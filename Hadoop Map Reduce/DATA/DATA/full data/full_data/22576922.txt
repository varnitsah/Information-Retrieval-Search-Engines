    chapter i       fortunes favourite  george augustus frederick duke of st james completed his twentyfirst year an event which created almost as great a sensation among the aristocracy of england as the norman conquest a minority of twenty years had converted a family always amongst the wealthiest of great britain into one of the richest in europe the duke of st james possessed estates in the north and in the west of england besides a whole province in ireland in london there were a very handsome square and several streets all made of bricks which brought him in yearly more cash than all the palaces of vicenza are worth in feesimple with those of the grand canal of venice to boot as if this were not enough he was an hereditary patron of internal navigation and although perhaps in his two palaces three castles four halls and lodges ad libitum there were more fires burnt than in any other establishment in the empire this was of no consequence because the coals were his own his rentroll exhibited a sum total very neatly written of two hundred thousand pounds but this was independent of half a million in the funds which we had nearly forgotten and which remained from the accumulations occasioned by the unhappy death of his father  the late duke of st james had one sister who was married to the earl of fitzpompey to the great surprise of the world to the perfect astonishment of the brotherinlaw his lordship was not appointed guardian to the infant minor the earl of fitzpompey had always been on the best possible terms with his grace the countess had only the year before his death accepted from his fraternal hand a diamond bracelet the lord viscount st maurice future chief of the house of fitzpompey had the honour not only of being his nephew but his godson who could account then for an action so perfectly unaccountable it was quite evident that his grace had no intention of dying  the guardian however that he did appoint was a mr dacre a catholic gentleman of ancient family and large fortune who had been the companion of his travels and was his neighbour in his county mr dacre had not been honoured with the acquaintance of lord fitzpompey previous to the decease of his noble friend and after that event such an acquaintance would probably not have been productive of agreeable reminiscences for from the moment of the opening of the fatal will the name of dacre was wormwood to the house of st maurice lord fitzpompey who though the brotherinlaw of a whig magnate was a tory voted against the catholics with renewed fervour  shortly after the death of his friend mr dacre married a beautiful and noble lady of the house of howard who after having presented him with a daughter fell ill and became that common character a confirmed invalid in the present day and especially among women one would almost suppose that health was a state of unnatural existence the illness of his wife and the nonpossession of parliamentary duties rendered mr dacres visits to his town mansion rare and the mansion in time was let  the young duke with the exception of an occasional visit to his uncle lord fitzpompey passed the early years of his life at castle dacre at seven years of age he was sent to a preparatory school at richmond which was entirely devoted to the early culture of the nobility and where the principal the reverend doctor coronet was so extremely exclusive in his system that it was reported that he had once refused the son of an irish peer miss coronet fed her imagination with the hope of meeting her fathers noble pupils in afterlife and in the meantime read fashionable novels  the moment that the young duke was settled at richmond all the intrigues of the fitzpompey family were directed to that quarter and as mr dacre was by nature unsuspicious and was even desirous that his ward should cultivate the friendship of his only relatives the st maurice family had the gratification as they thought of completely deceiving him lady fitzpompey called twice a week at crest house with a supply of pineapples or bonbons and the rev dr coronet bowed in adoration lady isabella st maurice gave a china cup to mrs coronet and lady augusta a papercutter to miss the family was secured all discipline was immediately set at defiance and the young duke passed the greater part of the halfyear with his affectionate relations his grace charmed with the bonbons of his aunt and the kisses of his cousins which were even sweeter than the sugarplums delighted with the pony of st maurice which immediately became his own and inebriated by the attentions of his unclewho at eight years of age treated him as his lordship styled it like a mancontrasted this life of early excitement with what now appeared the gloom and the restraint of castle dacre and he soon entered into the conspiracy which had long been hatching with genuine enthusiasm he wrote to his guardian and obtained permission to spend his vacation with his uncle thus through the united indulgence of dr coronet and mr dacre the duke of st james became a member of the family of st maurice  no sooner had lord fitzpompey secured the affections of the ward than he entirely changed his system towards the guardian he wrote to mr dacre and in a manner equally kind and dignified courted his acquaintance he dilated upon the extraordinary though extremely natural affection which lady fitzpompey entertained for the only offspring of her beloved brother upon the happiness which the young duke enjoyed with his cousins upon the great and evident advantages which his grace would derive from companions of his own age of the singular friendship which he had already formed with st maurice and then after paying mr dacre many compliments upon the admirable manner in which he had already fulfilled the duties of his important office and urging the lively satisfaction that a visit from their brothers friend would confer both upon lady fitzpompey and himself he requested permission for his nephew to renew the visit in which he had been so happy the duke seconded the earls diplomatic scrawl in the most graceful roundtext the masterly intrigues of lord fitzpompey assisted by mrs dacres illness which daily increased and which rendered perfect quiet indispensable were successful and the young duke arrived at his twelfth year without revisiting dacre every year however when mr dacre made a short visit to london his ward spent a few days in his company at the house of an oldfashioned catholic nobleman a visit which only afforded a dull contrast to the gay society and constant animation of his uncles establishment  it would seem that fate had determined to counteract the intentions of the late duke of st james and to achieve those of the earl of fitzpompey at the moment that the noble minor was about to leave dr coronet for eton mrs dacres state was declared hopeless except from the assistance of an italian sky and mr dacre whose attachment to his lady was romantic determined to leave england immediately  it was with deep regret that he parted from his ward whom he tenderly loved but all considerations merged in the paramount one and he was consoled by the reflection that he was at least left to the care of his nearest connections mr dacre was not unaware of the dangers to which his youthful pledge might be exposed by the indiscriminate indulgence of his uncle but he trusted to the impartial and inviolable system of a public school to do much and he anticipated returning to england before his ward was old enough to form those habits which are generally so injurious to young nobles in this hope mr dacre was disappointed mrs dacre lingered and revived and lingered for nearly eight years now filling the mind of her husband and her daughter with unreasonable hope now delivering them to that renewed anguish that heartrending grief which the attendant upon a declining relative can alone experience additionally agonizing because it cannot be indulged mrs dacre died and the widower and his daughter returned to england in the meantime the duke of st james had not been idle     chapter ii       tender relatives  the departure and at length the total absence of mr dacre from england yielded to lord fitzpompey all the opportunity he had long desired hitherto he had contented himself with quietly sapping the influence of the guardian now that influence was openly assailed all occasions were seized of depreciating the character of mr dacre and open lamentations were poured forth on the strange and unhappy indiscretion of the father who had confided the guardianship of his son not to his natural and devoted friends but to a harsh and repulsive stranger long before the young duke had completed his sixteenth year all memory of the early kindness of his guardian if it had ever been imprinted on his mind was carefully obliterated from it it was constantly impressed upon him that nothing but the exertions of his aunt and uncle had saved him from a life of stern privation and irrational restraint and the man who had been the chosen and cherished confidant of the father was looked upon by the son as a grim tyrant from whose clutches he had escaped and in which he determined never again to find himself old dacre as lord fitzpompey described him was a phantom enough at any time to frighten his youthful ward the great object of the uncle was to teaze and mortify the guardian into resigning his trust and infinite were the contrivances to bring about this desirable result but mr dacre was obstinate and although absent contrived to carry on and complete the system for the management of the hauteville property which he had so beneficially established and so long pursued  in quitting england although he had appointed a fixed allowance for his noble ward mr dacre had thought proper to delegate a discretionary authority to lord fitzpompey to furnish him with what might be called extraordinary necessaries his lordship availed himself with such dexterity of this power that his nephew appeared to be indebted for every indulgence to his uncle who invariably accompanied every act of this description with an insinuation that he might thank mrs dacres illness for the boon  well george he would say to the young etonian you shall have the boat though i hardly know how i shall pass the account at headquarters and make yourself easy about flashs bill though i really cannot approve of such proceedings thank your stars you have not got to present that account to old dacre well i am one of those who are always indulgent to young blood mr dacre and i differ he is your guardian though everything is in his power but you shall never want while your uncle can help you and so run off to caroline for i see you want to be with her  the lady isabella and the lady augusta who had so charmed mrs and miss coronet were no longer in existence each had knocked down her earl brought up by a mother exquisitely adroit in female education the ladies st maurice had run but a brief though a brilliant career beautiful and possessing every accomplishment which renders beauty valuable under the unrivalled chaperonage of the countess they had played their popular parts without a single blunder always in the best set never flirting with the wrong man and never speaking to the wrong woman all agreed that the ladies st maurice had fairly won their coronets their sister caroline was much younger and although she did not promise to develop so unblemished a character as themselves she was in default of another sister to be the duchess of st james  lady caroline st maurice was nearly of the same age as her cousin the young duke they had been playfellows since his emancipation from the dungeons of castle dacre and every means had been adopted by her judicious parents to foster and to confirm the kind feelings which had been first engendered by being partners in the same toys and sharing the same sports at eight years old the little duke was taught to call caroline his wife and as his grace grew in years and could better appreciate the qualities of his sweet and gentle cousin he was not disposed to retract the title when george rejoined the courtly coronet caroline invariably mingled her tears with those of her sorrowing spouse and when the time at length arrived for his departure for eton caroline knitted him a purse and presented him with a watchribbon at the last moment she besought her brother who was two years older to watch over him and soothed the moment of final agony by a promise to correspond had the innocent and softhearted girl been acquainted with or been able to comprehend the purposes of her crafty parents she could not have adopted means more calculated to accomplish them the young duke kissed her a thousand times and loved her better than all the world  in spite of his private house and his private tutor his grace did not make all the progress in his classical studies which means so calculated to promote abstraction and to assist acquirement would seem to promise the fact is that as his mind began to unfold itself he found a perpetual and a more pleasing source of study in the contemplation of himself his early initiation in the school of fitzpompey had not been thrown away he had heard much of nobility and beauty and riches and fashion and power he had seen many individuals highly though differently considered for the relative quantities which they possessed of these qualities it appeared to the duke of st james that among the human race he possessed the largest quantity of them all he cut his private tutor his private tutor who had been appointed by mr dacre remonstrated to lord fitzpompey and with such success that he thought proper shortly after to resign his situation dr coronet begged to recommend his son the rev augustus granville coronet the duke of st james now got on rapidly and also found sufficient time for his boat his tandem and his toilette  the duke of st james appeared at christ church his conceit kept him alive for a few terms it is delightful to receive the homage of two thousand young men of the best families in the country to breakfast with twenty of them and to cut the rest in spite however of the glories of the golden tuft and a delightful private establishment which he and his followers maintained in the chaste suburbs of alma mater the duke of st james felt ennuied consequently one clear night they set fire to a pyramid of caps and gowns in peckwater it was a silly thing for any one it was a sad indiscretion for a duke but it was done some were expelled his grace had timely notice and having before cut the oxonians now cut oxford  like all young men who get into scrapes the duke of st james determined to travel the dacres returned to england before he did he dexterously avoided coming into contact with them in italy mr dacre had written to him several times during the first years of his absence and although the dukes answers were short seldom and not very satisfactory mr dacre persisted in occasionally addressing him when however the duke had arrived at an age when he was at least morally responsible for his own conduct and entirely neglected answering his guardians letters mr dacre became altogether silent  the travelling career of the young duke may be conceived by those who have wasted their time and are compensated for that silliness by being called men of the world he gamed a little at paris he ate a good deal at vienna and he studied the fine arts in italy in all places his homage to the fair sex was renowned the parisian duchess the austrian princess and the italian countess spoke in the most enthusiastic terms of the english nobility at the end of three years the duke of st james was of opinion that he had obtained a great knowledge of mankind he was mistaken travel is not as is imagined the best school for that sort of science knowledge of mankind is a knowledge of their passions the traveller is looked upon as a bird of passage whose visit is short and which the vanity of the visited wishes to make agreeable all is show all false and all made up coterie succeeds coterie equally smilingthe explosions take place in his absence even a grand passion which teaches a man more perhaps than anything else is not very easily excited by the traveller the women know that sooner or later he must disappear and though this is the case with all lovers they do not like to miss the possibility of delusion thus the heroines keep in the background and the visitor who is always in a hurry falls into the net of the first flirtation that offers  the duke of st james had however acquired a great knowledge if not of mankind at any rate of manners he had visited all courts and sparkled in the most brilliant circles of the continent he returned to his own country with a taste extremely refined a manner most polished and a person highly accomplished     chapter iii       the duke returns  a sort of scrambling correspondence had been kept up between the young duke and his cousin lord st maurice who had for a few months been his fellowtraveller by virtue of these epistles notice of the movements of their interesting relative occasionally reached the circle at fitzpompey house although st maurice was scanty in the muchdesired communications because like most young englishmen he derived singular pleasure from depriving his fellowcreatures of all that small information which every one is so desirous to obtain the announcement however of the approaching arrival of the young duke was duly made lord fitzpompey wrote and offered apartments at fitzpompey house they were refused lord fitzpompey wrote again to require instructions for the preparation of hauteville house his letter was unanswered lord fitzpompey was quite puzzled  when does your cousin mean to come charles where does your cousin mean to go charles what does your cousin mean to do charles these were the hourly queries of the noble uncle  at length in the middle of january when no one expected him the duke of st james arrived at mivarts  he was attended by a french cook an italian valet a german jäger and a greek page at this dreary season of the year this party was perhaps the most distinguished in the metropolis  three years absence and a little knowledge of life had somewhat changed the duke of st jamess feelings with regard to his noble relatives he was quite disembarrassed of that panglossian philosophy which had hitherto induced him to believe that the earl of fitzpompey was the best of all possible uncles on the contrary his grace rather doubted whether the course which his relations had pursued towards him was quite the most proper and the most prudent and he took great credit to himself for having with such unbounded indulgence on the whole deported himself with so remarkable a temperance his grace too could no longer innocently delude himself with the idea that all the attention which had been lavished upon him was solely occasioned by the impulse of consanguinity finally the young dukes conscience often misgave him when he thought of mr dacre he determined therefore on returning to england not to commit himself too decidedly with the fitzpompeys and he had cautiously guarded himself from being entrapped into becoming their guest at the same time the recollection of old intimacy the general regard which he really felt for them all and the sincere affection which he entertained for his cousin caroline would have deterred him from giving any outward signs of his altered feelings even if other considerations had not intervened  and other considerations did intervene a duke and a young duke is an important personage but he must still be introduced even our hero might make a bad tack on his first cruise almost as important personages have committed the same blunder talk of catholic emancipation o thou imperial parliament emancipate the forlorn wretches who have got into a bad set even thy omnipotence must fail there  now the countess of fitzpompey was a brilliant of the first water under no better auspices could the duke of st james bound upon the stage no man in town could arrange his club affairs for him with greater celerity and greater tact than the earl and the married daughters were as much like their mother as a pair of diamond earrings are like a diamond necklace  the duke therefore though he did not choose to get caged in fitzpompey house sent his page spiridion to the countess on a special embassy of announcement on the evening of his arrival and on the following morning his grace himself made his appearance at an early hour  lord fitzpompey who was as consummate a judge of men and manners as he was an indifferent speculator on affairs and who was almost as finished a man of the world as he was an imperfect philosopher soon perceived that considerable changes had taken place in the ideas as well as in the exterior of his nephew the duke however was extremely cordial and greeted the family in terms almost of fondness he shook his uncle by the hand with a fervour with which few noblemen had communicated for a considerable period and he saluted his aunt on the cheek with a delicacy which did not disturb the rouge he turned to his cousin  lady caroline st maurice was indeed a right beautiful being she whom the young duke had left merely a graceful and kindhearted girl three years had changed into a somewhat dignified but most lovely woman a little perhaps of her native ease had been lost a little perhaps of a manner rather too artificial had supplanted that exquisite address which nature alone had prompted but at this moment her manner was as unstudied and as genuine as when they had gambolled together in the bowers of malthorpe her white and delicate arm was extended with cordial grace her full blue eye beamed with fondness and the soft blush that rose on her fair cheek exquisitely contrasted with the clusters of her dark brown hair  the duke was struck almost staggered he remembered their infant loves he recovered with ready address he bent his head with graceful affection and pressed her lips he almost repented that he had not accepted his uncles offer of hospitality     chapter iv       a social triumph  lord fitzpompey was a little consoled for the change which he had observed in the character of the duke by the remembrance of the embrace with which his grace had greeted lady caroline never indeed did a process which has through the lapse of so many ages occasioned so much delight produce more lively satisfaction than the kiss in question lord fitzpompey had given up his plan of managing the duke after the family dinner which his nephew had the pleasure to join the first day of his first visit the duke and he were alone and his lordship availed himself of the rare opportunity with that adroitness for which he was celebrated nothing could be more polite more affable more kind than his graces manner but the uncle cared little for politeness or affability or kindness the crafty courtier wanted candour and that was absent that ingenuous openness of disposition that frank and affectionate demeanour for which the duke of st james had been so remarkable in his early youth and with the aid of which lord fitzpompey had built so many spanish castles had quite disappeared  nothing could be more artificial more conventional more studied than his whole deportment in vain lord fitzpompey pumped the empty bucket invariably reminded him of his lost labour in vain his lordship laid his little diplomatic traps to catch a hint of the purposes or an intimation of the inclinations of his nephew the bait was never seized in vain the earl affected unusual conviviality and boundless affection the duke sipped his claret and admired his pictures nothing would do an air of habitual calm a look of kind condescension and an inclination to a smile which never burst into a beam announced that the duke of st james was perfectly satisfied with existence and conscious that he was himself of that existence the most distinguished ornament in fact he was a sublime coxcomb one of those rare characters whose finished manner and shrewd sense combined prevent their conceit from being contemptible after many consultations it was determined between the aunt and uncle that it would be most prudent to affect a total noninterference with their nephews affairs and in the meantime to trust to the goodness of providence and the charms of caroline  lady fitzpompey determined that the young duke should make his debut at once and at her house although it was yet january she did not despair of collecting a select band of guests brahmins of the highest caste some choice spirits were in office like her lord and therefore in town others were only passing through but no one caught a flyingfish with more dexterity than the countess the notice was short the whole was unstudied it was a felicitous impromptu and twenty guests were assembled who were the corinthian capitals of the temple of fashion  there was the premier who was invited not because he was a minister but because he was a hero there was another duke not less celebrated whose palace was a breathing shrine which sent forth the oracles of mode true he had ceased to be a young duke but he might be consoled for the vanished lustre of youth by the recollection that he had enjoyed it and by the present inspiration of an accomplished manhood there were the prince and the princess protocoli his highness a firstrate diplomatist unrivalled for his management of an opera and his consort with a countenance like cleopatra and a tiara like a constellation famed alike for her shawls and her snuff there were lord and lady bloomerly who were the best friends on earth my lord a sportsman but soft withal his talk the jockey club filtered through whites my lady a little blue and very beautiful their daughter lady charlotte rose by her mothers side like a tall bud by a fullblown flower there were the viscountess blaze a peeress in her own right and her daughter miss blaze dashaway who besides the glory of the future coronet moved in all the confidence of independent thousands there was the marquess of macaroni who was at the same time a general an ambassador and a dandy and who if he had liked could have worn twelve orders but this day being modest only wore six there too was the marchioness with a stomacher stiff with brilliants extracted from the snuffboxes presented to her husband at a congress  there were lord sunium who was not only a peer but a poet and his lady a greek who looked just finished by phidias there too was pococurante the epicurean and triple millionaire who in a political country dared to despise politics in the most aristocratic of kingdoms had refused nobility and in a land which showers all its honours upon its cultivators invested his whole fortune in the funds he lived in a retreat like the villa of hadrian and maintained himself in an elevated position chiefly by his wit and a little by his wealth there too were his noble wife thoroughbred to her fingers tips and beaming like the evening star and his son who was an mp and thought his father a fool in short our party was no common party but a band who formed the very core of civilisation a high court of last appeal whose word was a fiat whose sign was a hint whose stare was death and sneerdamnation  the graces befriend us we have forgotten the most important personage it is the first time in his life that charles annesley has been neglected it will do him good  dandy has been voted vulgar and beau is now the word it may be doubted whether the revival will stand and as for the exploded title though it had its faults at first the muse of byron has made it not only english but classical charles annesley could hardly be called a dandy or a beau there was nothing in his dressthough some mysterious arrangement in his costume some rare simplicity some curious happiness always made it distinguishedthere was nothing however in his dress which could account for the influence which he exercised over the manners of his contemporaries charles annesley was about thirty he had inherited from his father a younger brother a small estate and though heir to a wealthy earldom he had never abused what the world called his prospects yet his establishment his little house in mayfair his horses his moderate stud at melton were all unique and everything connected with him was unparalleled for its elegance its invention and its refinement but his manner was his magic his natural and subdued nonchalance so different from the assumed nonemotion of a mere dandy his coldness of heart which was hereditary not acquired his cautious courage and his unadulterated selflove had permitted him to mingle much with mankind without being too deeply involved in the play of their passions while his exquisite sense of the ridiculous quickly revealed those weaknesses to him which his delicate satire did not spare even while it refrained from wounding all feared marry admired and none hated him he was too powerful not to dread too dexterous not to admire too superior to hate perhaps the great secret of his manner was his exquisite superciliousness a quality which of all is the most difficult to manage even with his intimates he was never confidential and perpetually assumed his public character with the private coterie which he loved to rule on the whole he was unlike any of the leading men of modern days and rather reminded one of the fine gentlemen of our old brilliant comedy the dorimants the bellairs and the mirabels  charles annesley was a member of the distinguished party who were this day to decide the fate of the young duke let him come forward  his grace moved towards them tall and elegant in figure and with that air of affable dignity which becomes a noble and which adorns a court none of that affected indifference which seems to imply that nothing can compensate for the exertion of moving and which makes the dandy while it mars the man his large and somewhat sleepy grey eye his clear complexion his small mouth his aquiline nose his transparent forehead his rich brown hair and the delicacy of his extremities presented when combined a very excellent specimen of that style of beauty for which the nobility of england are remarkable gentle for he felt the importance of the tribunal never loud ready yet a little reserved he neither courted nor shunned examination his finished manner his experience of society his pretensions to taste the gaiety of his temper and the liveliness of his imagination gradually developed themselves with the developing hours  the banquet was over the duke of st james passed his examination with unqualified approval and having been stamped at the mint of fashion as a sovereign of the brightest die he was flung forth like the rest of his golden brethren to corrupt the society of which he was the brightest ornament     chapter v       sweeping changes  the morning after the initiatory dinner the young duke drove to hauteville house his family mansion situated in his family square his grace particularly prided himself on his knowledge of the arts a taste for which among other things he intended to introduce into england nothing could exceed the horror with which he witnessed the exterior of his mansion except the agony with which he paced through the interior  is this a palace thought the young duke this hospital a palace  he entered the marble hall the broad and lofty double staircase painted in fresco were not unpromising in spite of the dingy gilding but with what a mixed feeling of wonder and disgust did the duke roam through clusters of those queer chambers which in england are called drawingrooms  where are the galleries where the symmetrical saloons where the lengthened suite where the collateral cabinets sacred to the statue of a nymph or the mistress of a painter in which i have been customed to reside what page would condescend to lounge in this antechamber and is this gloomy vault that you call a diningroom to be my hall of apollo order my carriage  the duke sent immediately for sir carte blanche the successor in england of sir christopher wren his grace communicated at the same time his misery and his grand views sir carte was astonished with his graces knowledge and sympathised with his graces feelings he offered consolation and promised estimates they came in due time hauteville house in the drawing of the worthy knight might have been mistaken for the louvre some adjoining mansions were by some magical process for which sir carte was famous to be cleared of their present occupiers and the whole side of the square was in future to be the site of hauteville house the difficulty was great but the object was greater the expense though the estimate made a bold assault on the half million was a mere trifle considering the duke was delighted he condescended to make a slight alteration in sir cartes drawing which sir carte affirmed to be a great improvement now it was sir cartes turn to be delighted the duke was excited by his architects admiration and gave him a dissertation on schönbrunn  although mr dacre had been disappointed in his hope of exercising a personal influence over the education of his ward he had been more fortunate in his plans for the management of his wards property perhaps there never was an instance of the opportunities afforded by a long minority having been used to greater advantage the estates had been increased and greatly improved all and very heavy mortgages had been paid off and the rents been fairly apportioned mr dacre by his constant exertions and able dispositions since his return to england also made up for the neglect with which an important point had been a little treated and at no period had the parliamentary influence of the house of hauteville been so extensive so decided and so well bottomed as when our hero became its chief  in spite of his proverbial pride it seemed that mr dacre was determined not to be offended by the conduct of his ward the duke had not yet announced his arrival in england to his guardian but about a month after that event he received a letter of congratulation from mr dacre who at the same time expressed a desire to resign a trust into his graces hand which he believed had not been abused the duke who rather dreaded an interview wrote in return that he intended very shortly to visit yorkshire when he should have the pleasure of availing himself of the kind invitation to castle dacre and having thus as he thought dexterously got rid of the old gentleman for the present he took a ride with lady caroline st maurice      chapter vi       the duke visits hauteville  parliament assembled the town filled and every moment in the day of the duke of st james was occupied sir carte and his tribe filled up the morning then there were endless visits to endless visitors dressing riding chiefly with lady caroline luncheons and the bow window at whites then came the evening with all its crash and glare the banquet the opera and the ball  the duke of st james took the oaths and his seat he was introduced by lord fitzpompey he heard a debate we laugh at such a thing especially in the upper house but on the whole the affair is imposing particularly if we take part in it lord exchamberlain thought the nation going on wrong and he made a speech full of currency and constitution baron deprivyseal seconded him with great effect brief but bitter satirical and sore the earl of quarterday answered these full of confidence in the nation and in himself when the debate was getting heavy lord snap jumped up to give them something light the lords do not encourage wit and so are obliged to put up with pertness but viscount memoir was very statesmanlike and spouted a sort of universal history then there was lord ego who vindicated his character when nobody knew he had one and explained his motives because his auditors could not understand his acts then there was a maiden speech so inaudible that it was doubted whether after all the young orator really did lose his virginity in the end up started the premier who having nothing to say was manly and candid and liberal gave credit to his adversaries and took credit to himself and then the motion was withdrawn  while all this was going on some made a note some made a bet some consulted a book some their ease some yawned a few slept yet on the whole there was an air about the assembly which can be witnessed in no other in europe even the most indifferent looked as if he would come forward if the occasion should demand him and the most imbecile as if he could serve his country if it required him when a man raises his eyes from his bench and sees his ancestor in the tapestry he begins to understand the pride of blood  the young duke had not experienced many weeks of his career before he began to sicken of living in an hotel hitherto he had not reaped any of the fruits of the termination of his minority he was a cavalier seul highly considered truly but yet a mere member of society he had been this for years this was not the existence to enjoy which he had hurried to england he aspired to be society itself in a word his tastes were of the most magnificent description and he sighed to be surrounded by a court as hauteville house even with sir cartes extraordinary exertions could not be ready for his reception for three years which to him appeared eternity he determined to look about for an establishment he was fortunate a nobleman who possessed an hereditary mansion of the first class and much too magnificent for his resources suddenly became diplomatic and accepted an embassy the duke of st james took everything off his hands house furniture wines cooks servants horses sir carte was sent in to touch up the gilding and make a few temporary improvements and lady fitzpompey pledged herself to organise the whole establishment ere the full season commenced and the early easter had elapsed which had now arrived  it had arrived and the young duke had departed to his chief family seat hauteville castle in yorkshire he intended at the same time to fulfil his longpledged engagement at castle dacre he arrived at hauteville amid the ringing of bells the roasting of oxen and the crackling of bonfires the castle unlike most yorkshire castles was a gothic edifice ancient vast and strong but it had received numerous additions in various styles of architecture which were at the same time great sources of convenience and great violations of taste the young duke was seized with a violent desire to live in a genuine gothic castle each day his refined taste was outraged by discovering roman windows and grecian doors he determined to emulate windsor and he sent for sir carte  sir carte came as quick as thunder after lightning he was immediately struck with hauteville particularly with its capabilities it was a superb place certainly and might be rendered unrivalled the situation seemed made for the pure gothic the left wing should decidedly be pulled down and its site occupied by a knights hall the old terrace should be restored the donjon keep should be raised and a gallery three hundred feet long thrown through the body of the castle estimates estimates estimates but the time this was a greater point than the expense wonders should be done there were now five hundred men working for hauteville house there should be a thousand for hauteville castle carte blanche carte blanche carte blanche  on his arrival in yorkshire the duke had learnt that the dacres were in norfolk on a visit as the castle was some miles off he saw no necessity to make a useless exertion and so he sent his jäger with his card he had now been ten days in his native county it was dull and he was restless he missed the excitement of perpetual admiration and his eye drooped for constant glitter he suddenly returned to town just when the county had flattered itself that he was about to appoint his public days     chapter vii       the first fancy  easter was over the sun shone the world was mad and the young duke made his début at almacks he determined to prove that he had profited by a winter at vienna his dancing was declared consummate he galloped with grace and waltzed with vigour it was difficult to decide which was more admirable the elegance of his prance or the precision of his whirl a fat russian prince a lean austrian count a little german baron who somehow or other always contrived to be the most marked characters of the evening disappeared in despair  there was a lady in the room who attracted the notice of our hero she was a remarkable personage there are some sorts of beauty which defy description and almost scrutiny some faces rise upon us in the tumult of life like stars from out the sea or as if they had moved out of a picture our first impression is anything but fleshly we are struck dumb we gasp our limbs quiver a faintness glides over our frame we are awed instead of gazing upon the apparition we avert the eyes which yet will feed upon its beauty a strange sort of unearthly pain mixes with the intense pleasure and not till with a struggle we call back to our memory the commonplaces of existence can we recover our commonplace demeanour these indeed are rare visions early feelings when our young existence leaps with its mountain torrents but as the river of our life rolls on our eyes grow dimmer or our blood more cold  some effect of this kind was produced on the duke of st james by the unknown dame he turned away his head to collect his senses his eyes again rally and this time being prepared he was more successful in his observations  the lady was standing against the wall a young man was addressing some remarks to her which apparently were not very interesting she was tall and young and as her tiara betokened married dazzling fair but without colour with locks like night and features delicate but precisely defined yet all this did not at first challenge the observation of the young duke it was the general and peculiar expression of her countenance which had caused in him such emotion there was an expression of resignation or repose or sorrow or serenity which in these excited chambers was strange and singular and lone she gazed like some genius invisible to the crowd and mourning over its degradation  he stopped st maurice as his cousin passed by to inquire her name and learnt that she was lady aphrodite grafton the wife of sir lucius grafton  what lucy grafton exclaimed the duke i remember i was his fag at eton he was a handsome dog but i doubt whether he deserves such a wife introduce me  lady aphrodite received our hero with a gentle bow and did not seem quite as impressed with his importance as most of those to whom he had been presented in the course of the evening the duke had considerable tact with women and soon perceived that the common topics of a hack flirtation would not do in the present case he was therefore mild and modest rather piquant somewhat rational and apparently perfectly unaffected her ladyships reserve wore away she refused to dance but conversed with more animation the duke did not leave her side the women began to stare the men to bet lady aphrodite against the field in vain his grace laid a thousand plans to arrange a tearoom têteàtête he was unsuccessful as he was about to return to the charge her ladyship desired a passerby to summon her carriage no time was to be lost the duke began to talk hard about his old friend and schoolfellow sir lucius a greenhorn would have thought it madness to take an interest in such a person of all others but women like you to enter their house as their husbands friend lady aphrodite could not refrain from expressing her conviction that sir lucius would be most happy to renew his acquaintance with the duke of st james and the duke of st james immediately said that he would take the earliest opportunity of giving him that pleasure     chapter viii       a noble reprobate  sir lucius grafton was five or six years older than the duke of st james although he had been his contemporary at eton he too had been a minor and had inherited an estate capable of supporting the becoming dignity of an ancient family in appearance he was an antinous there was however an expression of firmness almost of ferocity about his mouth which quite prevented his countenance from being effeminate and broke the dreamy voluptuousness of the rest of his features in mind he was a roué devoted to pleasure he had racked the goblet at an early age and before he was fiveandtwenty procured for himself a reputation which made all women dread and some men shun him in the very wildest moment of his career when he was almost marked like cain he had met lady aphrodite maltravers she was the daughter of a nobleman who justly prided himself in a degenerate age on the virtue of his house nature as if in recompense for his goodness had showered all her blessings on his only daughter never was daughter more devoted to a widowed sire never was woman influenced by principles of purer morality  this was the woman who inspired sir lucius grafton with an ungovernable passion despairing of success by any other method conscious that sooner or later he must for family considerations propagate future baronets of the name of grafton he determined to solicit her hand but for him to obtain it he was well aware was difficult confident in his person his consummate knowledge of the female character and his unrivalled powers of dissimulation sir lucius arranged his dispositions the daughter feared the father hated him there was indeed much to be done but the remembrance of a thousand triumphs supported the adventurer lady aphrodite was at length persuaded that she alone could confirm the reformation which she alone had originated she yielded to a passion which her love of virtue had alone kept in subjection sir lucius and lady aphrodite knelt at the feet of the old earl the tears of his daughter ay and of his future soninlawfor sir lucius knew when to weepwere too much for his kind and generous heart he gave them his blessing which faltered on his tongue  a year had not elapsed ere lady aphrodite woke to all the wildness of a deluded woman the idol on whom she had lavished all the incense of her innocent affections became every day less like a true divinity at length even the ingenuity of a passion could no longer disguise the hideous and bitter truth she was no longer loved she thought of her father ah what was the madness of her memory  the agony of her mind disappointed her husbands hope of an heir and the promise was never renewed  in vain she remonstrated with the being to whom she was devoted in vain she sought by meek endurance again to melt his heart it was cold it was callous most women would have endeavoured to recover their lost influence by different tactics some perhaps would have forgotten their mortification in their revenge but lady aphrodite had been the victim of passion and now was its slave she could not dissemble  not so her spouse sir lucius knew too well the value of a good character to part very easily with that which he had so unexpectedly regained whatever were his excesses they were prudent ones he felt that boyhood could alone excuse the folly of glorying in vice and he knew that to respect virtue it was not absolutely necessary to be virtuous no one was apparently more choice in his companions than sir lucius grafton no husband was seen oftener with his wife no one paid more respect to age or knew better when to wear a grave countenance the world praised the magical influence of lady aphrodite and lady aphrodite in private wept over her misery in public she made an effort to conceal all she felt and as it is a great inducement to every woman to conceal that she is neglected by the man whom she adores her effort was not unsuccessful yet her countenance might indicate that she was little interested in the scene in which she mixed she was too proud to weep but too sad to smile elegant and lone she stood among her crushed and lovely hopes like a column amid the ruins of a beautiful temple  the world declared that lady aphrodite was desperately virtuous and the world was right a thousand fireflies had sparkled round this myrtle and its fresh and verdant hue was still unsullied and unscorched not a very accurate image but pretty and those who have watched a glancing shower of these glittering insects will confess that poetically the bush might burn the truth is that lady aphrodite still trembled when she recalled the early anguish of her broken sleep of love and had not courage enough to hope that she might dream again like the old hebrews she had been so chastened for her wild idolatry that she dared not again raise an image to animate the wilderness of her existence man she at the same time feared and despised compared with her husband all who surrounded her were she felt in appearance inferior and were she believed in mind the same  we know not how it is but love at first sight is a subject of constant ridicule but somehow we suspect that it has more to do with the affairs of this world than the world is willing to own eyes meet which have never met before and glances thrill with expression which is strange we contrast these pleasant sights and new emotions with hackneyed objects and worn sensations another glance and another thrill and we spring into each others arms what can be more natural  ah that we should awake so often to truth so bitter ah that charm by charm should evaporate from the talisman which had enchanted our existence  and so it was with this sweet woman whose feelings grow under the pen she had repaired to a splendid assembly to play her splendid part with the consciousness of misery without the expectation of hope she awaited without interest the routine which had been so often uninteresting she viewed without emotion the characters which had never moved a stranger suddenly appeared upon the stage fresh as the morning dew and glittering like the morning star all eyes await all tongues applaud him his step is grace his countenance hope his voice music and was such a being born only to deceive and be deceived was he to run the same false palling ruinous career which had filled so many hearts with bitterness and dimmed the radiancy of so many eyes never the nobility of his soul spoke from his glancing eye and treated the foul suspicion with scorn ah would that she had such a brother to warn to guide to love  so felt the lady aphrodite so felt we will not say so reasoned when once a woman allows an idea to touch her heart it is miraculous with what rapidity the idea is fathered by her brain all her experience all her anguish all her despair vanished like a long frost in an instant and in a night she felt a delicious conviction that a knight had at length come to her rescue a hero worthy of an adventure so admirable the image of the young duke filled her whole mind she had no ear for others voices she mused on his idea with the rapture of a votary on the mysteries of a new faith  yet strange when he at length approached her when he addressed her when she replied to that mouth which had fascinated even before it had spoken she was cold reserved constrained some talk of the burning cheek and the flashing eye of passion but a wise man would not perhaps despair of the heroine who when he approaches her treats him almost with scorn and trembles while she affects to disregard him  lady aphrodite has returned home she hurries to her apartment she falls in a sweet reverie her head leans upon her hand her soubrette a pretty and chattering swiss whose republican virtue had been corrupted by paris as rome by corinth endeavours to divert mer ladys ennui she excruciates her beautiful mistress with tattle about the admiration of lord band the sighs of sir harry her ladyship reprimands her for her levity and the soubrette grown sullen revenges herself for her mistresss reproof by converting the sleepy process of brushing into lively torture  the duke of st james called upon lady aphrodite grafton the next day and at an hour when he trusted to find her alone he was not disappointed more than once the silvertongued pendule sounded during that somewhat protracted but most agreeable visit he was indeed greatly interested by her but he was an habitual gallant and always began by feigning more than he felt she on the contrary who was really in love feigned much less yet she was no longer constrained though calm fluent and even gay she talked as well as listened and her repartees more than once called forth the resources of her guest she displayed a delicate and even luxurious taste not only in her conversation but the duke observed it with delight in her costume she had a passion for music and for flowers she sang a romance and she gave him a rose he retired perfectly fascinated     chapter ix       old friends meet  sir lucius grafton called on the duke of st james they did not immediately swear an eternal friendship but they greeted each other with considerable warmth talked of old times and old companions and compared their former sensations with their present no one could be a more agreeable companion than sir lucius and this day he left a very favourable impression with his young friend from this day too the dukes visits at the baronets were frequent and as the graftons were intimate with the fitzpompeys scarcely a day elapsed without his having the pleasure of passing a portion of it in the company of lady aphrodite his attentions to her were marked and sometimes mentioned lord fitzpompey was rather in a flutter george did not ride so often with caroline and never alone with her this was disagreeable but the earl was a man of the world and a sanguine man withal these things will happen it is of no use to quarrel with the wind and for his part he was not sorry that he had the honour of the grafton acquaintance it secured caroline her cousins company and as for the liaison if there were one why it must end and probably the difficulty of terminating it might even hasten the catastrophe which he had so much at heart so laura dearest let the graftons be asked to dinner  in one of those rides to which caroline was not admitted for lady aphrodite was present the duke of st james took his way to the regents park a wild sequestered spot whither he invariably repaired when he did not wish to be noticed for the inhabitants of this pretty suburb are a distinct race and although their eyes are not unobserving from their inability to speak the language of london they are unable to communicate their observations  the spring sun was setting and flung a crimson flush over the blue waters and the white houses the scene was rather imposing and reminded our hero of days of travel a sudden thought struck him would it not be delightful to build a beautiful retreat in this sweet and retired land and be able in an instant to fly from the formal magnificence of a london mansion lady aphrodite was charmed with the idea for the enamoured are always delighted with what is fanciful the duke determined immediately to convert the idea into an object to lose no time was his grand motto as he thought that sir carte had enough upon his hands he determined to apply to an artist whose achievements had been greatly vaunted to him by a distinguished and noble judge  m bijou de millecolonnes chevalier of the legion of honour and member of the academy of st lukes except in his title was the antipodes of sir carte blanche sir carte was all solidity solemnity and correctness bijou de millecolonnes all lightness gaiety and originality sir carte was ever armed with the parthenon palladio and st peters bijou de millecolonnes laughed at the ancients called palladio and michel barbarians of the middle ages and had himself invented an order bijou was not so plausible as sir carte but he was infinitely more entertaining far from being servile he allowed no one to talk but himself and made his fortune by his elegant insolence how singular it is that those who love servility are always the victims of impertinence  gaily did bijou de millecolonnes drive his peagreen cabriolet to the spot in question he formed his plan in an instant the occasional retreat of a noble should be something picturesque and poetical the mind should be led to voluptuousness by exquisite associations as well as by the creations of art it is thus their luxury is rendered more intense by the reminiscences that add past experience to present enjoyment for instance if you sail down a river imitate the progress of cleopatra and here here where the opportunity is so ample what think you of reviving the alhambra  splendid conception the duke already fancied himself a caliph lose no time chevalier dig plant build  nine acres were obtained from the woods and forests mounds were thrown up shrubs thrown in the paths emulated the serpent the nine acres seemed interminable all was surrounded by a paling eight feet high that no one might pierce the mystery of the preparations  a rumour was soon current that the zoological society intended to keep a bengal tiger au naturel and that they were contriving a residence which would amply compensate him for his native jungle the regents park was in despair the landlords lowered their rents and the tenants petitioned the king in a short time some hooded domes and some saracenic spires rose to sight and the truth was then made known that the young duke of st james was building a villa the regents park was in rapture the landlords raised their rents and the tenants withdrew their petition     chapter x his grace entertains  mr dacre again wrote to the duke of st james he regretted that he had been absent from home when his grace had done him the honour of calling at castle dacre had he been aware of that intended gratification he could with ease and would with pleasure have postponed his visit to norfolk he also regretted that it would not be in his power to visit london this season and as he thought that no further time should be lost in resigning the trust with which he had been so honoured he begged leave to forward his accounts to the duke and with them some notes which he believed would convey some not unimportant information to his grace for the future management of his property the young duke took a rapid glance at the sum total of his rental crammed all the papers into a cabinet with a determination to examine them the first opportunity and then rolled off to a morning concert of which he was the patron  the intended opportunity for the examination of the important papers was never caught nor was it surprising that it escaped capture it is difficult to conceive a career of more various more constant or more distracting excitement than that in which the duke of st james was now engaged his life was an ocean of enjoyment and each hour like each wave threw up its pearl how dull was the ball in which he did not bound how dim the banquet in which he did not glitter his presence in the gardens compensated for the want of flowers his vision in the park for the want of sun in public breakfasts he was more indispensable than pineapples in private concerts more noticed than an absent prima donna how fair was the dame on whom he smiled how dark was the tradesman on whom he frowned think only of prime ministers and princes to say nothing of princesses nay think only of managers of operas and french actors to say nothing of french actresses think only of jewellers milliners artists horsedealers all the shoals who hurried for his sanction think only of the two or three thousand civilised beings for whom all this population breathed and who each of them had claims upon our heros notice think of the statesmen who had so much to ask and so much to give the dandies to feed with and to be fed the dangerous dowagers and the desperate mothers the widows wild as early partridges the budding virgins mild as a summer cloud and soft as an opera hat think of the drony bores with their dull hum think of the chivalric guardsmen with their horses to sell and their bills to discount think of willis think of crockford think of whites think of brooks and you may form a faint idea how the young duke had to talk and eat and flirt and cut and pet and patronise  you think it impossible for one man to do all this there is yet much behind you may add to the catalogue melton and newmarket and if to hunt without an appetite and to bet without an object will not sicken you why build a yacht  the duke of st james gave his first grand entertainment for the season it was like the assembly of the immortals at the first levee of jove all hurried to pay their devoirs to the young king of fashion and each who succeeded in becoming a member of the court felt as proud as a peer with a new title or a baronet with an old one an air of regal splendour an almost imperial assumption was observed in the arrangements of the fête a troop of servants in rich liveries filled the hall grooms lined the staircase spiridion the greek page lounged on an ottoman in an antechamber and with the assistance of six young gentlemen in crimsonandsilver uniforms announced the coming of the cherished guests cartloads of pineapples were sent up from the yorkshire castle and waggons of orangetrees from the twickenham villa  a brilliant coterie of which his grace was a member had amused themselves a few nights before by representing in costume the court of charles the first they agreed this night to reappear in their splendid dresses and the duke who was villiers supported his character even to the gay shedding of a shower of diamonds in his cap was observed an hereditary sapphire which blazed like a volcano and which was rumoured to be worth his rentroll  there was a short concert at which the most celebrated signora made her début there was a single vaudeville which a white satin playbill presented to each guest as they entered the temporary theatre indicated to have been written for the occasion there was a ball in which was introduced a new dance nothing for a moment was allowed to lag longueurs were skilfully avoided and the excitement was so rapid that every one had an appetite for supper  a long gallery lined with bronzes and bijouterie with cabinets and sculpture with china and with paintings all purchased for the future ornament of hauteville house and here stowed away in unpretending but most artificial confusion offered accommodation to all the guests to a table covered with gold and placed in a magnificent tent upon the stage his grace loyally led two princes of the blood and a child of france madame de protocoli lady aphrodite grafton the duchess of shropshire and lady fitzpompey shared the honours of the pavilion and some might be excused for envying a party so brilliant and a situation so distinguished yet lady aphrodite was an unwilling member of it and nothing but the personal solicitation of sir lucius would have induced her to consent to the wish of their host  a pink carte succeeded to the satin playbill vitellius might have been pleased with the banquet ah how shall we describe those soups which surely must have been the magical elixir how paint those ortolans dressed by the inimitable artist à la st james for the occasion and which look so beautiful in death that they must surely have preferred such an euthanasia even to flying in the perfumed air of an ausonian heaven  sweet bird though thou hast lost thy plumage thou shalt fly to my mistress is it not better to be nibbled by her than mumbled by a cardinal i too will feed on thy delicate beauty sweet bird thy companion has fled to my mistress and now thou shalt thrill the nerves of her master oh doff then thy waistcoat of wineleaves pretty rover and show me that bosom more delicious even than womans what gushes of rapture what a flavour how peculiar even how sacred i heaven at once sends both manna and quails another little wanderer pray follow my example allow me all paradise opens let me die eating ortolans to the sound of soft music  even the supper was brief though brilliant and again the cotillon and the quadrille the waltz and the galoppe at no moment of his life had the young duke felt existence so intense wherever he turned his eye he found a responding glance of beauty and admiration wherever he turned his ear the whispered tones were soft and sweet as summer winds each look was an offering each word adoration his soul dilated the glory of the scene touched all his passions he almost determined not again to mingle in society but like a monarch merely to receive the world which worshipped him the idea was sublime was it even to him impracticable in the midst of his splendour he fell into a reverie and mused on his magnificence he could no longer resist the conviction that he was a superior essence even to all around him the world seemed created solely for his enjoyment nor man nor woman could withstand him from this hour he delivered himself up to a sublime selfishness with all his passions and all his profusion a callousness crept over his heart his sympathy for those he believed his inferiors and his vassals was slight where we do not respect we soon cease to love when we cease to love virtue weeps and flies his soul wandered in dreams of omnipotence  this picture perhaps excites your dislike perchance your contempt pause pity him pity his fatal youth     chapter xi       love at a bazaar  the lady aphrodite at first refused to sit in the dukes pavilion was she then in the habit of refusing let us not forget our venus of the waters shall we whisper where the young duke first dared to hope no you shall guess je vous le donne en trois the gardens the opera the tearoom no no no you are conceiving a locality much more romantic already you have created the bower of a parisina where the waterfall is even more musical than the birds more lulling than the evening winds where all is pale except the stars all hushed except their beating pulses will this do no what think you then of a bazaar  o thou wonderful nineteenth century thou that believest in no miracles and doest so many hast thou brought this too about that ladies hearts should be won and gentlemens also not in courts of tourney or halls of revel but over a counter and behind a stall we are indeed a nation of shopkeepers  the king of otaheite though a despot was a reformer he discovered that the eating of breadfruit was a barbarous custom which would infallibly prevent his people from being a great nation he determined to introduce french rolls a party rebelled the despot was energetic some were executed the rest ejected the vagabonds arrived in england as they had been banished in opposition to french rolls they were declared to be a british interest they professed their admiration of civil and religious liberty and also of a subscription when they had drunk a great deal of punch and spent all their money they discovered that they had nothing to eat and would infallibly have been starved had not an hibernian marchioness who had never been in ireland been exceedingly shocked that men should die of hunger and so being one of the bustlers she got up a fancy sale and a sandwich isle bazaar  all the world was there and of course our hero never was the arrival of a comet watched by astronomers who had calculated its advent with more anxiety than was the appearance of the young duke never did man pass through such dangers it was the fiery ordeal st anthony himself was not assailed by more temptations now he was saved from the lustre of a blonde face by the superior richness of a blonde lace he would infallibly have been ravished by that ringlet had he not been nearly reduced by that ring which sparkled on a hand like the white cats he was only preserved from his unprecedented dangers by their number no no he had a better talisman his conceit  ah lady balmont said his grace to a smiling artist who offered him one of her own drawings of a swiss cottage for me to be a tenant it must be love and a cottage  what am i to buy this ring mrs abercroft point de jour oh dreadful phrase allow me to present it to you for you are the only one whom such words cannot make tremble  this chain lady jemima for my glass it will teach me where to direct it  ah mrs fitzroy and he covered his face with affected fear can you forgive me your beautiful note has been half an hour unanswered the box is yours for tuesday  he tried to pass the next stall with a smiling bow but he could not escape it was lady de courcy a dowager but not old once beautiful her charms had not yet disappeared she had a pair of glittering eyes a skilfullycarmined cheek and locks yet raven her eloquence made her now as conspicuous as once did her beauty the young duke was her constant object and her occasional victim he hated above all things a talking woman he dreaded above all others lady de courcy  he could not shirk she summoned him by name so loud that crowds of barbarians stared and a man called to a woman and said my dear make haste heres a duke  lady de courcy was prime confidant of the irish marchioness she affected enthusiasm about the poor sufferers she had learnt otaheitan she lectured about the breadfruit and she played upon a barbarous thrumthrum the only musical instrument in those savage wastes ironically called the society islands because there is no society she was dreadful the duke in despair took out his purse poured forth from the pink and silver delicacy worked by the slender fingers of lady aphrodite a shower of sovereigns and fairly scampered off at length he reached the lady of his heart  i fear said the young duke with a smile and in a soft sweet voice that you will never speak to me again for i am a ruined man  a beam of gentle affection reprimanded him even for badinage on such a subject  i really came here to buy up all your stock but that gorgon lady de courcy captured me and my ransom has sent me here free but a beggar i do not know a more illfated fellow than myself now if you had only condescended to take me prisoner i might have saved my money for i should have kissed my chain  my chains i fear are neither very alluring nor very strong she spoke with a thoughtful air and he answered her only with his eye  i must bear off something from your stall he resumed in a more rapid and gayer tone and as i cannot purchase you must present now for a gift  choose  yourself  your grace is really spoiling my sale see poor lord bagshot what a valuable purchaser  ah bag my boy said the duke to a slang young nobleman whom he abhorred but of whom he sometimes made a butt am i in your way here take this and this and this and give me your purse ill pay lady aphrodite and so the duke again showered some sovereigns and returned the shrunken silk to its defrauded owner who stared and would have remonstrated but the duke turned his back upon him  there now he continued to lady aphrodite there is two hundred per cent profit for you you are not half a marchande i will stand here and be your shopman well annesley said he as that dignitary passed what will you buy i advise you to get a place pon my soul tis pleasant try lady de courcy you know you are a favourite  i assure your grace said mr annesley speaking slowly that that story about lady de courcy is quite untrue and very rude i never turn my back on any woman only my heel we are on the best possible terms she is never to speak to me and i am always to bow to her but i really must purchase where did you get that glasschain st james lady afy can you accommodate me  here is one prettier but are you nearsighted too mr annesley  very i look upon a longsighted man as a brute who not being able to see with his mind is obliged to see with his body the price of this  a sovereign said the duke cheap but we consider you as a friend  a sovereign you consider me a young duke rather two shillings and that a severe price a charitable price here is halfacrown give me sixpence i was not a minor farewell i go to the little pomfret she is a sweet flower and i intend to wear her in my buttonhole goodbye lady afy  the gay morning had worn away and st james never left his fascinating position many a sweet and many a soft thing he uttered sometimes he was baffled but never beaten and always returned to the charge with spirit he was confident because he was reckless the lady had less trust in herself because she was anxious yet she combated well and repressed the feelings which she could hardly conceal  many of her colleagues had already departed she requested the duke to look after her carriage a bold plan suddenly occurred to him and he executed it with rare courage and rarer felicity  lady aphrodite graftons carriage  here your grace  oh go home your lady will return with madame de protocoli  he rejoined her  i am sorry that by some blunder your carriage has gone what could you have told them  impossible how provoking how stupid  perhaps you told them that you would return with the fitzpompeys but they are gone or mrs aberleigh and she is not here or perhapsbut they have gone too everyone has gone  what shall i do how distressing i had better send pray send or i will ask lady de courcy  oh no no i really did not like to see you with her as a favouras a favour to me i pray you not  what can i do i must send let me beg your grace to send  certainly certainly but ten to one there will be some mistake there always is some mistake when you send these strangers and besides i forgot all this time my carriage is here let it take you home  no no  dearest lady aphrodite do not distress yourself i can wait here till the carriage returns or i can walk to be sure i can walk pray pray take the carriage as a favouras a favour to me  but i cannot bear you to walk i know you dislike walking  well then i will wait  well if it must be so but i am ashamed to inconvenience you how provoking of these men pray then tell the coachman to drive fast that you may not have to wait i declare there is scarcely a human being in the room and those odd people are staring so  he pressed her arm as he led her to his carriage she is in and yet before the door shuts he lingers  i shall certainly walk said he i do not think the easterly wind will make me very ill goodbye oh what a coupdevent  let me get out then and pray pray take the carriage i would much sooner do anything than go in it i would much rather walk i am sure you will be ill  not if i be with you     chapter xii       royal favour  there was a brilliant levee all stars and garters and a splendid drawingroom all plumes and séduisantes many a bright eye as its owner fought his way down st jamess street shot a wistful glance at the enchanted bowwindow where the duke and his usual companions sir lucius charles annesley and lord squib lounged and laughed stretched themselves and sneered many a bright eye that for a moment pierced the futurity that painted her going in state as duchess of st james  his majesty summoned a dinner party a rare but magnificent event and the chief of the house of hauteville appeared among the chosen vassals this visit did the young duke good and a few more might have permanently cured the conceit which the present one momentarily calmed his grace saw the plate and was filled with envy his grace listened to his majesty and was filled with admiration o father of thy people if thou wouldst but look a little oftener on thy younger sons their morals and their manners might be alike improved  his majesty in the course of the evening with his usual goodnature signalled out for his notice the youngest and not the least distinguished of his guests he complimented the young duke on the accession to the ornaments of his court and said with a smile that he had heard of conquests in foreign ones the duke accounted for his slight successes by reminding his majesty that he had the honour of being his godson and this he said in a slight and easy way not smart or quick or as a repartee to the royal observation for it is not decorous to bandy compliments with your sovereign his majesty asked some questions about an emperor or an archduchess and his grace answered to the purpose but short and not too pointed he listened rather than spoke and smiled more assents than he uttered the king was pleased with his young subject and marked his approbation by conversing with that unrivalled affability which is gall to a roundhead and inspiration to a cavalier there was a bon mot which blazed with all the soft brilliancy of sheet lightning what a contrast to the forky flashes of a regular wit then there was an anecdote of sheridanthe royal sheridaniana are not thricetold talesrecounted with that curious felicity which has long stamped the illustrious narrator as a consummate raconteur thenbut the duke knew when to withdraw and he withdrew with renewed loyalty     chapter xiii       a lovers trick  one day looking in at his jewellers to see some models of a shield and vases which were executing for him in gold the young duke met lady aphrodite and the fitzpompeys lady aphrodite was speaking to the jeweller about her diamonds which were to be reset for her approaching fête the duke took the ladies upstairs to look at the models and while they were intent upon them and other curiosities his absence for a moment was unperceived he ran downstairs and caught mr garnet  mr garnet i think i saw lady aphrodite give you her diamonds yes your grace  are they valuable in a careless tone hum pretty stones very pretty stones indeed few baronets ladies have a prettier set worth perhaps a 1000l say 1200l lady aphrodite grafton is not the duchess of st james you know said mr garnet as if he anticipated furnishing that future lady with a very different set of brilliants  mr garnet you can do me the greatest favour your grace has only to command me at all times  well then in a word for time presses can you contrive without particularly alteringthat is without altering the general appearance of these diamondscan you contrive to change the stones and substitute the most valuable that you have consistent as i must impress upon you with maintaining their general appearance as at present  the most valuable stones musingly repeated mr garnet general appearance as at present your grace is aware that we may run up some thousands even in this set  i give you no limit  but the time rejoined mr garnet they must be ready for her ladyships party we shall be hard pressed i am afraid of the time  cannot the men work all night pay them anything  it shall be done your grace your grace may command me in anything  this is a secret between us garnet your partners  shall know nothing and as for myself i am as close as an emerald in a sealring     chapter xiv       close of the season  hussein pacha the favourite not only of the marquess of mash but of tattersalls unaccountably sickened and died his noble master full of chagrin took to his bed and followed his steeds example the death of the marquess caused a vacancy in the stewardship of the approaching doncaster sir lucius grafton was the other steward and he proposed to the duke of st james as he was a yorkshireman to become his colleague his grace who wished to pay a compliment to his county closed with the proposition sir lucius was a firstrate jockey his colleague was quite ignorant of the noble science in all its details but that was of slight importance the baronet was to be the working partner and do the business the duke the show member of the concern and do the magnificence as one banker you may observe lives always in portland place reads the court journal all the morning and has an operabox while his partner lodges in lombard street thumbs a pricecurrent and only has a box at clapham  the young duke however was ambitious of making a good book and with all the calm impetuosity which characterises a youthful hauteville determined to have a crack stud at once so at ascot where he spent a few pleasant hours dined at the cottage was caught in a shower in return caught a cold a slight influenza for a week and all the world full of inquiries and anxiety at ascot i say he bought up all the winning horses at an average of three thousand guineas for each pair of ears sir lucius stared remonstrated and as his remonstrances were in vain assisted him  as people at the point of death often make a desperate rally so this the most brilliant of seasons was even more lively as it nearer approached its end the déjeûner and the villa fête the water party and the rambling ride followed each other with the bright rapidity of the final scenes in a pantomime each dama seemed only inspired with the ambition of giving the last ball and so numerous were the parties that the town really sometimes seemed illuminated to breakfast at twickenham and to dine in belgrave square to hear or rather to honour half an act of an opera to campaign through half a dozen private balls and to finish with a romp at the rooms as after our wine we take a glass of liqueur all this surely required the courage of an alexander and the strength of a hercules and indeed cannot be achieved without the miraculous powers of a joshua so thought the young duke as with an excited mind and a whirling head he threw himself at halfpast six oclock on a couch which brought him no sleep  yet he recovered and with the aid of the bath the soda and the coffee and all the thousand remedies which a skilful valet has ever at hand at three oclock on the same day he rose and dressed and in an hour was again at the illustrious bowwindow sneering with charles annesley or laughing downright with lord squib  the duke of st james gave a water party and the astounded thames swelled with pride as his broad breast bore on the ducal barges st maurice who was in the guards secured his band and lord squib who though it was july brought a furred great coat secured himself lady afy looked like amphitrite and lady caroline looked in love they wandered in gardens like calypsos they rambled over a villa which reminded them of baise they partook of a banquet which should have been described by ariosto all were delighted they delivered themselves to the charms of an unrestrained gaiety even charles annesley laughed and romped  this is the only mode in which public eating is essentially agreeable a banquetinghall is often the scene of exquisite pleasure but that is not so much excited by the gratification of a delicate palate as by the magnificent effect of light and shade by the beautiful women the radiant jewels the graceful costume the rainbow glass the glowing wines the glorious plate for the rest all is too hot too crowded and too noisy to catch a flavour to analyse a combination to dwell upon a gust to eat really to eat one must eat alone with a soft light with simple furniture an easy dress and a single dish at a time hours of bliss hours of virtue for what is more virtuous than to be conscious of the blessings of a bountiful nature a good eater must be a good man for a good eater must have a good digestion and a good digestion depends upon a good conscience  but to our tale if we be dull skip time will fly and beauty will fade and wit grow dull and even the season although it seems for the nonce like the existence of olympus will nevertheless steal away it is the hour when trade grows dull and tradesmen grow duller it is the hour that howell loveth not and stultz cannot abide though the first may be consoled by the ghosts of his departed millions of mouchoirs and the second by the vision of coming millions of shootingjackets oh why that sigh my gloomy mr gunter oh why that frown my gentle mrs grange  one by one the great houses shut shoal by shoal the little people sail away yet beauty lingers still still the magnet of a straggling ball attracts the remaining brilliants still a lagging dinner like a sumptermule on a march is a mark for plunder the park too is not yet empty and perhaps is even more fascinating like a beauty in a consumption who each day gets thinner and more fair the young duke remained to the last for we linger about our first season as we do about our first mistress rather wearied yet full of delightful reminiscences     book ii     chapter i       his grace meets an early love  lady aphrodite and the duke of st james were for the first time parted and with an absolute belief on the ladys side and an avowed conviction on the gentlemans that it was impossible to live asunder they separated her ladyship shedding some temporary tears and his grace vowing eternal fidelity  it was the crafty lord fitzpompey who brought about this catastrophe having secured his nephew as a visitor to malthorpe by allowing him to believe that the graftons would form part of the summer coterie his lordship took especial care that poor lady aphrodite should not be invited once part them once get him to malthorpe alone mused the experienced peer and he will be emancipated i am doing him too the greatest kindness what would i have given when a young man to have had such an uncle  the morning post announced with a sigh the departure of the duke of st james to the splendid festivities of malthorpe and also apprised the world that sir lucius and lady aphrodite were entertaining a numerous and distinguished party at their seat cleve park cambridgeshire  there was a constant bustle kept up at malthorpe and the young duke was hourly permitted to observe that independent of all private feeling it was impossible for the most distinguished nobleman to ally himself with a more considered family there was a continual swell of guests dashing down and dashing away like the ocean brilliant as its foam numerous as its waves but there was one permanent inhabitant of this princely mansion far more interesting to our hero than the evanescent crowds who rose like bubbles glittered broke and disappeared  once more wandering in that park of malthorpe where had passed the innocent days of his boyhood his thoughts naturally recurred to the sweet companion who had made even those hours of happiness more felicitous here they had rambled here they had first tried their ponies there they had nearly fallen there he had quite saved her here were the two very elms where st maurice made for them a swing here was the very keepers cottage of which she had made for him a drawing and which he still retained dear girl and had she disappointed the romance of his boyhood had the experience the want of which had allowed him then to be pleased so easily had it taught him to be ashamed of those days of affection was she not now the most gentle the most graceful the most beautiful the most kind was she not the most wifelike woman whose eyes had ever beamed with tenderness why why not at once close a career which though short yet already could yield reminiscences which might satisfy the most craving admirer of excitement but there was lady aphrodite yet that must end alas on his part it had commenced in levity he feared on hers it must terminate in anguish yet though he loved his cousin though he could not recall to his memory the woman who was more worthy of being his wife he could not also conceal from himself that the feelings which impelled him were hardly so romantic as he thought should have inspired a youth of oneandtwenty when he mused on the woman he loved best but he knew life and he felt convinced that a mistress and a wife must always be different characters a combination of passion with present respect and permanent affection he supposed to be the delusion of romance writers he thought he must marry caroline partly because he must marry sooner or later partly because he had never met a woman whom he had loved so much and partly because he felt he should be miserable if her destiny in life were not in some way or other connected with his own ah if she had but been my sister  after a little more cogitation the young duke felt much inclined to make his cousin a duchess but time did not press after doncaster he must spend a few weeks at cleve and then he determined to come to an explanation with lady aphrodite in the meantime lord fitzpompey secretly congratulated himself on his skilful policy as he perceived his nephew daily more engrossed with his daughter lady caroline like all unaffected and accomplished women was seen to great effect in the country  there while they feed their birds tend their flowers and tune their harp and perform those more sacred but not less pleasing duties which become the daughter of a great proprietor they favourably contrast with those more modish damsels who the moment they are freed from the park and from williss begin fighting for silver arrows and patronising county balls  september came and brought some relief to those who were suffering in the inferno of provincial ennui but this is only the purgatory to the paradise of battues yet september has its days of slaughter and the young duke gained some laurels with the aid of friend egg friend purdy and manton and the premier galloped down sixty miles in one morning he sacked his cover made a light bet with st james on the favourite lunched standing and was off before night for he had only three days holiday and had to visit lord protest lord content and lord proxy so having knocked off four of his crack peers he galloped back to london to flog up his secretaries  and the young duke was off too he had promised to spend a week with charles annesley and lord squib who had taken some norfolk baronets seat for the autumn and while he was at spa were thinning his preserves it was a week what fantastic dissipation one day the brains of three hundred hares made a pâté for charles annesley oh heliogabalus you gained eternal fame for what is now done in a corner     chapter ii       a new charmer  the carnival of the north at length arrived all civilised eyes were on the most distinguished party of the most distinguished steward who with his horse sanspareil seemed to share universal favour the french princes and the duke of burlington the protocolis and the fitzpompeys and the bloomerlys the duke and duchess of shropshire and the three ladies wrekin who might have passed for the graces lord and lady vatican on a visit from rome his lordship taking hints for a heat in the corso and her ladyship a classical beauty with a face like a cameo st maurice and annesley and squib composed the party the premier was expected and there was murmur of an archduke seven houses had been prepared a partywall knocked down to make a diningroom the plate sent down from london and venison and wine from hauteville  the assemblage exceeded in quantity and quality all preceding years and the hauteville arms the hauteville liveries and the hauteville outriders beat all hollow in blazonry and brilliancy and number the north countrymen were proud of their young duke and his carriages and six and longed for the castle to be finished nothing could exceed the propriety of the arrangements for sir lucius was an unrivalled hand and though a newmarket man gained universal approbation even in yorkshire lady aphrodite was all smiles and new liveries and the duke of st james reined in his charger right often at her splendid equipage  the days sport was over and the evenings sport begun to a quiet man who has no bet more heavy than a dozen pair of gloves perhaps not the least amusing now came the numerous dinnerparties none to be compared to that of the duke of st james lady aphrodite was alone wanting but she had to head the ménage of sir lucius every one has an appetite after a race the duke of shropshire attacked the venison as samson the philistines and the french princes for once in their life drank real champagne  yet all faces were not so serene as those of the party of hauteville many a one felt that strange mixture of fear and exultation which precedes a battle tomorrow was the dreaded st leger  tis night and the banquet is over and all are hastening to the ball  in spite of the brilliant crowd the entrance of the hauteville party made a sensation it was the crowning ornament to the scene the stamp of the sovereign the lamp of the pharos the flag of the tower the party dispersed and the duke after joining a quadrille with lady caroline wandered away to make himself generally popular  as he was moving along he turned his head he started  ah exclaimed his grace  the cause of this sudden and ungovernable exclamation can be no other than a woman you are right the lady who had excited it was advancing in a quadrille some ten yards from her admirer she was very young that is to say she had perhaps added a year or two to sweet seventeen an addition which while it does not deprive the sex of the early grace of girlhood adorns them with that indefinable dignity which is necessary to constitute a perfect woman she was not tall but as she moved forward displayed a figure so exquisitely symmetrical that for a moment the duke forgot to look at her face and then her head was turned away yet he was consoled a moment for his disappointment by watching the movements of a neck so white and round and long and delicate that it would have become psyche and might have inspired praxiteles her face is again turning towards him it stops too soon yet his eye feeds upon the outline of a cheek not too full yet promising of beauty like hope of paradise  she turns her head she throws around a glance and two streams of liquid light pour from her hazel eyes on his it was a rapid graceful movement unstudied as the motion of a fawn and was in a moment withdrawn yet was it long enough to stamp upon his memory a memorable countenance her face was quite oval her nose delicately aquiline and her high pure forehead like a parian dome the clear blood coursed under her transparent cheek and increased the brilliancy of her dazzling eyes his never left her there was an expression of decision about her small mouth an air of almost mockery in her curling lip which though in themselves wildly fascinating strangely contrasted with all the beaming light and beneficent lustre of the upper part of her countenance there was something too in the graceful but rather decided air with which she moved that seemed to betoken her selfconsciousness of her beauty or her rank perhaps it might be her wit for the duke observed that while she scarcely smiled and conversed with lips hardly parted her companion with whom she was evidently intimate was almost constantly convulsed with laughter although as he never spoke it was clearly not at his own jokes  was she married could it be impossible yet there was a richness in her costume which was not usual for unmarried women a diamond arrow had pierced her clustering and auburn locks she wore indeed no necklace with such a neck it would have been sacrilege no earrings for her ears were too small for such a burthen yet her girdle was of brilliants and a diamond cross worthy of belinda and her immortal bard hung upon her breast  the duke seized hold of the first person he knew it was lord bagshot  tell me he said in the stern low voice of a despot tell me who that creature is  which creature asked lord bagshot  booby brute bag that creature of light and love  where  there  what my mother  your mother cub carthorse answer me or i will run you through  who do you mean  there there dancing with that rawboned youth with red hair  what lord st jerome lor he is a catholic i never speak to them my governor

then i know you know all the time you are joking everybody knows the beauty of the county everybody knows may dacre  may dacre said the duke of st james as if he were shot  why what is the matter now asked lord bagshot  what the daughter of dacre of castle dacre pursued his grace  the very same the beauty of the county everybody knows may dacre i knew you knew her all the time you did not take me in why what is the matter  nothing get away  civil but you will remember your promise about whites  ay ay i shall remember you when you are proposed  here here is a business soliloquized the young duke may dacre what a fool i have been shall i shoot myself through the head or embrace her on the spot lord st jerome too he seems mightily pleased and my family have been voting for two centuries to emancipate this fellow curse his grinning face i am decidedly anticatholic but then she is a catholic i will turn papist ah there is lucy i want a counsellor  he turned to his fellowsteward oh lucy such a woman such an incident  what the inimitable miss dacre i suppose everybody speaking of her wherever i go one subject of conversation burlington wanting to waltz with her charles annesley being introduced and lady bloomerly decidedly of opinion that she is the finest creature in the county well have you danced with her  danced my dear fellow do not speak to me  what is the matter  the most diabolical matter that you ever heard of  well well  i have not even been introduced  well come on at once  i cannot  are you mad  worse than mad where is her father  who cares  i do in a word my dear lucy her father is that guardian whom i have perhaps mentioned to you and to whom i have behaved so delicately  why i thought your guardian was an old curmudgeon  what does that signify with such a daughter  oh here is some mistake this is the only child of dacre of castle dacre a most delightful fellow one of the first fellows in the county i was introduced to him today on the course i thought you knew them you were admiring his outriders today the green and silver  why bag told me they were old lord sunderlands  bag how can you believe a word that booby says he always has an answer today when afy drove in i asked bag who she was and he said it was his aunt lady de courcy i begged to be introduced and took over the blushing bag and presented him  but the father the father lucy how shall i get out of this scrape  oh put on a bold face here give him this ring and swear you procured it for him at genoa and then say that now you are here you will try his pheasants  my dear fellow you always joke i am in agony seriously what shall i do  why seriously be introduced to him and do what you can  which is he  at the extreme end next to the very pretty woman who bythebye i recommend to your notice mrs dallington vere she is amusing i know her well she is some sort of relation to your dacres i will present you to both at once  why i will think of it  well then i must away the two stewards knocking their heads together is rather out of character do you know it is raining hard i am cursedly nervous about tomorrow  pooh pooh if i could get through tonight i should not care for tomorrow     chapter iii        the duke apologises  as sir lucius hurried off his colleague advanced towards the upper end of the room and taking up a position made his observations through the shooting figures of the dancers on the dreaded mr dacre the late guardian of the duke of st james was in the perfection of manhood perhaps fiveandforty by age but his youth had lingered long he was tall thin and elegant with a mild and benevolent expression of countenance not unmixed however with a little reserve the ghost of youthly pride listening with polished and courtly bearing to the pretty mrs dallington vere assenting occasionally to her piquant observations by a slight bow or expressing his dissent by a still slighter smile seldom himself speaking yet always with that unembarrassed manner which makes a saying listened to mr dacre was altogether in appearance one of the most distinguished personages in this distinguished assembly the young duke fell into an attitude worthy of hamlet this then is old dacre o deceitful fitzpompey o silly st james could i ever forget that tall mild man who now is perfectly fresh in my memory ah that memory of mine it has been greatly developed tonight would that i had cultivated that faculty with a little more zeal but what am i to do the case is urgent what must the dacres think of me what must may dacre think on the course the whole day and i the steward and not conscious of the presence of the first family in the riding fool fool why why did i accept an office for which i was totally unfitted why why must i flirt away a whole morning with that silly sophy wrekin an agreeable predicament truly this what would i give now once more to be in st jamess street confound my yorkshire estates how they must dislike how they must despise me and now truly i am to be introduced to him the duke of st james mr dacre mr dacre the duke of st james what an insult to all parties how supremely ludicrous what a mode of offering my gratitude to the man to whom i am under solemn and inconceivable obligations a choice way truly to salute the bosomfriend of my sire the guardian of my interests the creator of my property the fosterer of my orphan infancy it is useless to conceal it i am placed in the most disagreeable the most inextricable situation inextricable am i then the duke of st james am i that being who two hours ago thought that the world was formed alone for my enjoyment and i quiver and shrink here like a common hind out out on such craven cowardice i am no hauteville i am bastard never i will not be crushed i will struggle with this emergency i will conquer it now aid me ye heroes of my house on the sands of palestine on the plains of france ye were not in a more difficult situation than is your descendant in a ballroom in his own county my mind elevates itself to the occasion my courage expands with the enterprise i will right myself with these dacres with honour and without humiliation  the dancing ceased the dancers disappeared there was a blank between the duke of st james on one side of the broad room and mr dacre and those with whom he was conversing on the other many eyes were on his grace and he seized the opportunity to execute his purpose he advanced across the chamber with the air of a young monarch greeting a victorious general it seemed that for a moment his majesty wished to destroy all difference of rank between himself and the man that he honoured so studied and so inexpressibly graceful were his movements that the gaze of all around involuntarily fixed upon him mrs dallington vere unconsciously refrained from speaking as he approached and one or two without actually knowing his purpose made way they seemed awed by his dignity and shuffled behind mr dacre as if he were the only person who was the dukes match  mr dacre said his grace in the softest but still audible tones and he extended at the same time his hand mr dacre our first meeting should have been neither here nor thus but you who have excused so much will pardon also this  mr dacre though a calm personage was surprised by this sudden address he could not doubt who was the speaker he had left his ward a mere child he saw before him the exact and breathing image of the heartfriend of his ancient days he forgot all but the memory of a cherished friendship  he was greatly affected he pressed the offered hand he advanced he moved aside the young duke followed up his advantage and with an air of the greatest affection placed mr dacres arm in his own and then bore off his prize in triumph  right skilfully did our hero avail himself of his advantage he spoke and he spoke with emotion there is something inexpressibly captivating in the contrition of a youthful and a generous mind mr dacre and his late ward soon understood each other for it was one of those meetings which sentiment makes sweet  and now said his grace i have one more favour to ask and that is the greatest i wish to be recalled to the recollection of my oldest friend  mr dacre led the duke to his daughter and the earl of st jerome who was still laughing at her side rose  the duke of st james may wishes to renew his acquaintance with you  she bowed in silence lord st jerome who was the great oracle of the yorkshire school and who had betted desperately against the favourite took mr dacre aside to consult him about the rain and the duke of st james dropped into his chair that tongue however which had never failed him for once was wanting there was a momentary silence which the lady would not break and at last her companion broke it and not felicitously  i think there is nothing more delightful than meeting with old friends  yes that is the usual sentiment but i half suspect that it is a commonplace invented to cover our embarrassment under such circumstances for after all an old friend so situated is a person whom we have not seen for many years and most probably not cared to see  illustration frontisp79  you are indeed severe  oh no i think there is nothing more painful than parting with old friends but when we have parted with them i am half afraid they are lost  absence then with you is fatal  really i never did part with any one i greatly loved but i suppose it is with me as with most persons  yet you have resided abroad and for many years  yes but i was too young then to have many friends and in fact i accompanied perhaps all that i possessed  how i regret that it was not in my power to accept your kind invitation to dacre in the spring  oh my father would have been very glad to see you but we really are dull kind of people not at all in your way and i really do not think that you lost much amusement  what better amusement what more interesting occupation could i have had than to visit the place where i passed my earliest and my happiest hours tis nearly fifteen years since i was at dacre  except when you visited us at easter we regretted our loss  ah yes except that exclaimed the duke remembering his jägers call but that goes for nothing i of course saw very little  yet i assure you you made a great impression so eminent a personage of course observes less than he himself is observed we had a graphical description of you on our return and a very accurate one too for i recognised your grace tonight merely from the report of your visit  the duke shot a shrewd glance at his companions face but it betrayed no indication of badinage and so rather puzzled he thought it best to put up with the parallel between himself and his servant but miss dacre did not quit this agreeable subject with all that promptitude which he fondly anticipated  poor lord st jerome said she who is really the most unaffected person i know has been complaining most bitterly of his deficiency in the air noble he is mistaken for a groom perpetually and once he says had a douceur presented to him in his character of an ostler your grace must be proud of your advantage over him you would have been gratified by the universal panegyric of our household they of course you know are proud of their young duke a real yorkshire duke and they love to dwell upon your truly imposing appearance as for myself who am true yorkshire also i take the most honest pride in hearing them describe your elegant attitude leaning back in your britzska with your feet on the opposite cushions your hat arranged aside with that air of undefinable grace characteristic of the grand seigneur and which is the last remnant of the feudal system your reiterated orders to drive over an old woman you did not even condescend to speak english which made them quite enthusiastic  oh miss dacre spare me  spare you i have heard of your graces modesty but this excessive sensibility under wellearned praise surprises me  but miss dacre you cannot indeed really believe that this vulgar ruffian this grim scarecrow this guy faux waswasmyself  not yourself really i am a simple personage i believe in my eyes and trust to my ears i am at a loss for your meaning  i mean then said the duke who had gained time to rally that this monster was some impostor who must have stolen my carriage picked my pocket and robbed me of my card which next to his reputation is a mans most delicate possession  then you never called upon us  i blush to confess it never but i will call in future every day  your ingenuousness really rivals your modesty  now after these confessions and compliments may i suggest a waltz  no one is waltzing now  when the quadrille then is finished  then i am engaged  after your engagement  that is indeed making a business of pleasure i have just refused a similar request of your fellowsteward we damsels shall soon be obliged to carry a book to enrol our engagements as well as our bets if this system of reversionary dancing be any longer encouraged  but you must dance with me said the duke imploringly  oh you will stumble upon me in the course of the evening and i shall probably be more fortunate  i suppose you feel nervous about tomorrow  not at all  ah i forgot your graces horse is the favourite favourites always win  have i a horse  why lord st jerome says he doubts whether it be one  lord st jerome seems a vastly amusing personage and as he is so often taken for an ostler i have no doubt is an exceedingly good judge of horseflesh  miss dacre smiled it was that wild but rather wicked gleam which sometimes accompanies the indulgence of innocent malice it seemed to insinuate i know you are piqued and i enjoy it but here her hand was claimed for the waltz  the young duke remained musing  there she swims away by heavens unrivalled and there is lady afy and burlington grand too yet there is something in this little dacre which touches my fancy more what is it i think it is her impudence that confounded scrape of carlstein i will cashier him tomorrow confound his airs i think i got out of it pretty well tonight on the whole has been a night of triumph but if i do not waltz with the little dacre i will only vote myself an ovation but see here comes sir lucius well how fares my brother consul  i do not like this rain i have been hedging with hounslow having previously set bag at his worthy sire with a little information we shall have a perfect swamp and then it will be strength against speed the old story damn the st leger i am sick of it  pooh pooh think of the little dacre  think of her my dear fellow i think of her too much i should absolutely have diddled hounslow if it had not been for her confounded pretty face flitting about my stupid brain i saw you speaking to guardy you managed that business well  why as i do all things i flatter myself lucy do you know lord st jerome  verbally we have exchanged monosyllables but he is of the other set  he is cursedly familiar with the little dacre as the friend of her father i think i shall interfere is there anything in it think you  oh no she is engaged to another  engaged said the duke absolutely turning pale  do you remember a dacre at eton  a dacre at eton mused the duke at another time it would not have been in his power to have recalled the stranger to his memory but this evening the train of association had been laid and after struggling a moment with his mind he had the man to be sure i do arundel dacre an odd sort of a fellow but he was my senior  well that is the man a nephew of guardy and cousin of course to la bellissima he inherits you know all the property she will not have a sou but old dacre as you call him has managed pretty well and monsieur arundel is to compensate for the entail by presenting him with a grandson  the deuce  the deuce indeed often have i broken his head would that i had to a little more purpose  let us do it now  he is not here otherwiseone dislikes a spooney to be successful  where are our friends  annesley with the duchess and squib with the duke at écarté  success attend them both  amen     chapter iv       innocence and experience  to feel that the possessions of an illustrious ancestry are about to slide from out your line for ever that the numerous tenantry who look up to you with the confiding eye that the most liberal parvenu cannot attract will not count you among their lords that the proud park filled with the ancient and toppling trees that your fathers planted will yield neither its glory nor its treasures to your seed and that the old gallery whose walls are hung with pictures more cherished than the collections of kings will not breathe with your long posterity all these are feelings sad and trying and are among those daily pangs which moralists have forgotten in their catalogue of miseries but which do not the less wear out those heartstrings at which they are so constantly tugging  this was the situation of mr dacre the whole of his large property was entailed and descended to his nephew who was a protestant and yet when he looked upon the blooming face of his enchanting daughter he blessed the providence which after all his visitations had doomed him to be the sire of a thing so lovely an exile from her country at an early age the education of may dacre had been completed in a foreign land yet the mingling bloods of dacre and of howard would not in a moment have permitted her to forget the inviolate island of the sage and free even if the unceasing and everwatchful exertions of her father had been wanting to make her worthy of so illustrious an ancestry  but this happily was not the case and to aid the development of the infant mind of his young child to pour forth to her as she grew in years and in reason all the fruits of his own richlycultivated intellect was the solitary consolation of one over whose conscious head was impending the most awful of visitations may dacre was gifted with a mind which even if her tutor had not been her father would have rendered tuition a delight her lively imagination which early unfolded itself her dangerous yet interesting vivacity the keen delight the swift enthusiasm with which she drank in knowledge and then panted for more her shrewd acuteness and her innate passion for the excellent and the beautiful filled her father with rapture which he repressed and made him feel conscious how much there was to check to guide and to form as well as to cherish to admire and to applaud  as she grew up the bright parts of her character shone with increased lustre but in spite of the exertions of her instructor some less admirable qualities had not yet disappeared she was still too often the dupe of her imagination and though perfectly inexperienced her confidence in her theoretical knowledge of human nature was unbounded she had an idea that she could penetrate the characters of individuals at a first meeting and the consequence of this fatal axiom was that she was always the slave of first impressions and constantly the victim of prejudice she was ever thinking individuals better or worse than they really were and she believed it to be out of the power of anyone to deceive her constant attendance during many years on a dying and beloved mother and her deeply religious feelings had first broken and then controlled a spirit which nature had intended to be arrogant and haughty her father she adored and she seemed to devote to him all that consideration which with more common characters is generally distributed among their acquaintance we hint at her faults how shall we describe her virtues her unbounded generosity her dignified simplicity her graceful frankness her true nobility of thought and feeling her firmness her courage and her truth her kindness to her inferiors her constant charity her devotion to her parents her sympathy with sorrow her detestation of oppression her pure unsullied thoughts her delicate taste her deep religion all these combined would have formed a delightful character even if unaccompanied with such brilliant talents and such brilliant beauty accustomed from an early age to the converse of courts and the forms of the most polished circles her manner became her blood her beauty and her mind yet she rather acted in unison with the spirit of society than obeyed its minutest decree she violated etiquette with a wilful grace which made the outrage a precedent and she mingled with princes without feeling her inferiority nature and art and fortune were the graces which had combined to form this girl she was a jewel set in gold and worn by a king  her creed had made her in ancient christendom feel less an alien but when she returned to that native country which she had never forgotten she found that creed her degradation her indignant spirit clung with renewed ardour to the crushed altars of her faith and not before those proud shrines where cardinals officiate and a thousand acolytes fling their censers had she bowed with half the abandonment of spirit with which she invoked the virgin in her oratory at dacre  the recent death of her mother rendered mr dacre and herself little inclined to enter society and as they were both desirous of residing on that estate from which they had been so long and so unwillingly absent they had not yet visited london the greater part of their time had been passed chiefly in communication with those great catholic families with whom the dacres were allied and to which they belonged the modern race of the howards and the cliffords the talbots the arundels and the jerninghams were not unworthy of their proud progenitors miss dacre observed with respect and assuredly with sympathy the mild dignity the noble patience the proud humility the calm hope the uncompromising courage with which her father and his friends sustained their oppression and lived as proscribed in the realm which they had created yet her lively fancy and gay spirit found less to admire in the feelings which influenced these families in their intercourse with the world which induced them to foster but slight intimacies out of the pale of the proscribed and which tinged their domestic life with that formal and gloomy colouring which ever accompanies a monotonous existence her disposition told her that all this affected noninterference with the business of society might be politic but assuredly was not pleasant her quick sense whispered to her it was unwise and that it retarded not advanced the great result in which her sanguine temper dared often to indulge under any circumstances it did not appear to her to be wisdom to second the efforts of their oppressors for their degradation or their misery and to seek no consolation in the amiable feelings of their fellowcreatures for the stern rigour of their unsocial government but independently of all general principles miss dacre could not but believe that it was the duty of the catholic gentry to mix more with that world which so misconceived their spirit proud in her conscious knowledge of their exalted virtues she felt that they had only to be known to be recognised as the worthy leaders of that nation which they had so often saved and never betrayed  she did not conceal her opinions from the circle in which they had grown up all the young members were her disciples and were decidedly of opinion that if the house of lords would but listen to may dacre emancipation would be a settled thing her logic would have destroyed lord liverpools arguments her wit extinguished lord eldons jokes but the elder members only shed a solemn smile and blessed may dacres shining eyes and sanguine spirit  her greatest supporter was mrs dallington vere this lady was a distant relation of mr dacre at seventeen she herself a catholic had married mr dallington vere of dallington house a catholic gentleman of considerable fortune whose age resembled his wealth no sooner had this incident taken place than did mrs dallington vere hurry to london and soon evinced a most laudable determination to console herself for her husbands political disabilities mrs dallington vere went to court and mrs dallington vere gave suppers after the opera and concerts which in number and brilliancy were only equalled by her balls the dandies patronised her and selected her for their muse the duke of shropshire betted on her always at écarté and to crown the whole affair she made mr dallington vere lay claim to a dormant peerage the women were all pique the men all patronage a protestant minister was alarmed and lord squib supposed that mrs dallington must be the scarlet lady of whom they had heard so often  season after season she kept up the ball and although of course she no longer made an equal sensation she was not less brilliant nor her position less eminent she had got into the best set and was more quiet like a patriot in place never was there a gayer lady than mrs dallington vere but never a more prudent one her virtue was only equalled by her discretion but as the odds were equal lord squib betted on the last people sometimes indeed did saythey always willbut what is talk mere breath and reputation is marble and iron and sometimes brass and so you see talk has no chance they did say that sir lucius grafton was about to enter into the romish communion but then it turned out that it was only to get a divorce from his wife on the plea that she was a heretic  the fact was mrs dallington vere was a most successful woman lucky in everything lucky even in her husband for he died he did not only die he left his whole fortune to his wife some said that his relations were going to set aside the will on the plea that it was written with a crowquill on pink paper but this was false it was only a codicil  all eyes were on a very pretty woman with fifteen thousand a year and only twentythree the duke of shropshire wished he were disembarrassed such a player of écarté might double her income lord raff advanced trusting to his beard and young amadée de rouerie mortgaged his dressingcase and came post from paris but in spite of his skyblue nether garments and his hessians he followed my lords example and recrossed the water it is even said that lord squib was sentimental but this must have been the malice of charles annesley  all however failed the truth is mrs dallington vere had nothing to gain by reentering paradise which matrimony of course is and so she determined to remain mistress of herself she had gained fashion and fortune and rank she was young and she was pretty she thought it might be possible for a discreet experienced little lady to lead a very pleasant life without being assisted in her expenses or disturbed in her diversion by a gentleman who called himself her husband occasionally asked her how she slept in a bed which he did not share or munificently presented her with a necklace purchased with her own money discreet mrs dallington vere  she had been absent from london during the past season having taken it also into her head to travel  she was equally admired and equally plotted for at rome at paris and at vienna as at london but the bird had not been caught and flying away left many a despairing prince and amorous count to muse over their lean visages and meagre incomes  dallington house made its fair mistress a neighbour of her relations the dacres no one could be a more fascinating companion than mrs dallington vere may dacre read her character at once and these ladies became great allies she was to assist miss dacre in her plans for rousing their catholic friends as no one was better qualified to be her adjutant already they had commenced their operations and balls at dallington and dacre frequent splendid and various had already made the catholic houses the most eminent in the riding and their brilliant mistresses the heroines of all the youth     chapter v       ruined hopes  it rained all night without ceasing yet the morrow was serene nevertheless the odds had shifted on the evening thy had not been more than two to one against the first favourite the duke of st jamess ch c sanspareil by ne plus ultra while they were five to one against the second favourite mr dashs gr c the dandy by banker and nine and ten to one against the next in favour this morning however affairs were altered mr dash and his dandy were at the head of the poll and as the owner rode his own horse being a jockey and a fit rival for the duke of st james his backers were sanguine sanspareil was however the second favourite  the duke however was confident as an universal conqueror and came on in his usual state rode round the course inspirited lady aphrodite who was all anxiety betted with miss dacre and bowed to mrs dallington  there were more than ninety horses and yet the start was fair but the result pardon me the fatal remembrance overpowers my pen an effort and some eau de portingale and i shall recover the first favourite was never heard of the second favourite was never seen after the distance post all the tentooners were in the rear and a dark horse which had never been thought of and which the careless st james had never even observed in the list rushed past the grand stand in sweeping triumph the spectators were almost too surprised to cheer but when the name of the winner was detected there was a deafening shout particularly from the yorkshiremen the victor was the earl of st jeromes b f may dacre by howard  conceive the confusion sanspareil was at last discovered and immediately shipped off for newmarket as young gentlemen who get into scrapes are sent to travel the dukes of burlington and shropshire exchanged a few hundreds the duchess and charles annesley a few gloves the consummate lord bloomerly though a backer of the favourite in compliment to his host contrived to receive from all parties and particularly from st maurice the sweet little wrekins were absolutely ruined sir lucius looked blue but he had hedged and lord squib looked yellow but some doubted lord hounslow was done and lord bagshot was diddled  the duke of st james was perhaps the heaviest sufferer on the field and certainly bore his losses the best had he seen the fiveandtwenty thousand he was minus counted before him he probably would have been staggered but as it was another crumb of his halfmillion was gone the loss existed only in idea it was really too trifling to think of and he galloped up to miss dacre and was among the warmest of her congratulators  i would offer your grace my sympathy for your congratulations said miss dacre in a rather amiable tone but and here she resumed her air of mockery you are too great a man to be affected by so light a casualty and now that i recollect myself did you run a horse  why no the fault was i believe that he would not run but sanspareil is as great a hero as ever he has only been conquered by the elements  the dinner at the duke of st jamess was this day more splendid even than the preceding he was determined to show that the disappointment had produced no effect upon the temper of so imperial a personage as himself and he invited several of the leading gentry to join his coterie the dacres were among the solicited but they were during the races the guests of mrs dallington vere whose seat was only a mile off and therefore were unobtainable  blazed the plate sparkled the wine and the aromatic venison sent forth its odourous incense to the skies the favourite cook had done wonders though a sanspareil pâté on which he had been meditating for a week was obliged to be suppressed and was sent up as a tourte à la bourbon in compliment to his royal highness it was a delightful party all the stiffness of metropolitan society disappeared all talked and laughed and ate and drank and the protocolis and the french princes who were most active members of a banquet ceased sometimes from want of breath to moralize on the english character the little wrekins with their wellacted lamentations over their losses were capital and sophy nearly smiled and chattered her head this day into the reversion of the coronet of fitzpompey may she succeed for a wilder little partridge never yet flew caroline st maurice alone was sad and would not be comforted although st james observing her gloom and guessing at its cause had in private assured her that far from losing on the whole he was perhaps even a winner  none however talked more agreeable nonsense and made a more elegant uproar than the duke of st james  these young men whispered lord squib to annesley do not know the value of money we must teach it them i know too well i find it very dear  if the old physicians are correct in considering from twentyfive to thirtyfive as the period of lusty youth lord squib was still a lusty youth though a very corpulent one indeed the carnival of his life however was nearly over and probably the termination of the raceweek might hail him a man he was the best fellow in the world short and sleek half bald and looked fifty with a waist however which had not yet vanished and where art successfully controlled rebellious nature like the austrians the lombards if he were not exactly a wit he was still however full of unaffected fun and threw out the results of a roué life with considerable ease and point he had inherited a fair and peerlike property which he had contrived to embarrass in so complicated and extraordinary a manner that he had been a ruined man for years and yet lived well on an income allowed him by his creditors to manage his estate for their benefit the joke was he really managed it well it was his hobby and he prided himself especially upon his character as a man of business  the banquet is certainly the best preparative for the ball if its blessings be not abused for then you get heavy your true votary of terpsichore and of him we only speak requires particularly in a land of easterly winds which cut into his cabhead at every turn of every street some previous process to make his blood set him an example in dancing it is strong burgundy and his sparkling sister champagne that make a raceball always so amusing a divertissement one enters the room with a gay elation which defies rule without violating etiquette and in these county meetings there is a variety of character and classes and manners which is interesting and affords an agreeable contrast to those more brilliant and refined assemblies the members of which being educated by exactly the same system and with exactly the same ideas think look move talk dress and even eat alike the only remarkable personage being a woman somewhat more beautiful than the beauties who surround her and a man rather more original in his affectations than the puppies that surround him the proof of the general dulness of polite circles is the great sensation that is always produced by a new face the season always commences briskly because there are so many ball and dinner and concert collect then plentiful votaries but as we move on the dulness will develop itself and then come the morning breakfast and the water party and the fête champêtre all desperate attempts to produce variety with old materials and to occasion a second effect by a cause which is already exhausted  these philosophical remarks precede another introduction to the public ballroom at doncaster mrs dallington vere and miss dacre are walking arm in arm at the upper end of the room  you are disappointed love about arundel said mrs dallington  bitterly i never counted on any event more certainly than on his return this summer  and why tarrieth the wanderer unwillingly of course  lord darrell who was to have gone over as chargé daffaires has announced to his father the impossibility of his becoming a diplomatist so our poor attaché suffers and is obliged to bear the portefeuille ad interim  does your cousin like vienna  not at all he is a regular john bull and if i am to judge from his correspondence he will make an excellent ambassador in one sense for i think his fidelity and his patriotism may be depended on we seldom serve those whom we do not love and if i am to believe arundel there is neither a person nor a place on the whole continent that affords him the least satisfaction  how singular then that he should have fixed on such a métier but i suppose like other young men his friends fixed for him  not at all no step could be less pleasing to my father than his leaving england but arundel is quite unmanageable even by papa he is the oddest but the dearest person in the world  he is very clever is he not  i think so i have no doubt he will distinguish himself whatever career he runs but he is so extremely singular in his manner that i do not think his general reputation harmonises with my private opinion  and will his visit to england be a long one  i hope that it will be a permanent one i you know am his confidant and entrusted with all his plans if i succeed in arranging something according to his wishes i hope that he will not again quit us  i pray you may sweet and wish love for your sake that he would enter the room this moment  this is the most successful meeting i should think that ever was known at doncaster said miss dacre we are at least indebted to the duke of st james for a very agreeable party to say nothing of all the gloves we have won  how do you like the duke of burlington  much there is a calm courtliness about him which i think very imposing he is the only man i ever saw who without being very young was not an unfit companion for youth and there is no affectation of juvenility about him he involuntarily reminds you of youth as an empty orchestra does of music  i shall tell him this he is already your devoted and i have no doubt that inspired at the same time by your universal charms and our universal hints i shall soon hail you duchess of burlington don arundel will repent his diplomacy  i thought i was to be another duchess this morning  you deserve to be a triple one but dream not of the unhappy patron of sanspareil there is something in his eyes which tells me he is not a marrying man  there was a momentary pause and miss dacre spoke  i like his brother steward bertha sir lucius is witty and candid it is an agreeable thing to see a man who had been so gay and who has had so many temptations to be gay turn into a regular domestic character without losing any of those qualities which made him an ornament to society when men of the world terminate their career as prudently as sir lucius i observe that they are always amusing companions because they are perfectly unaffected  no one is more unaffected than lucius grafton i am quite happy to find you like him for he is an old friend of mine and i know that he has a good heart  i like him especially because he likes you  dearest  he introduced me to lady afy i perceive that she is very attached to her husband  lady afy is a charming woman i know no woman so truly elegant as lady afy the young duke you know they say greatly admires lady afy  oh does he well now i should have thought her rather a sentimental and serious donna one very unlikely  hush here come two cavaliers  the dukes of burlington and st james advanced  we are attracted by observing two nymphs wandering in this desert said his grace of burlington this was the burgundy  and we wish to know whether there be any dragon to destroy any ogre to devour any magician to massacre or how when and where we can testify our devotion to the ladies of our love added his grace of st james this was the champagne  the age of chivalry is past said miss dacre bores have succeeded to dragons and i have shivered too many lances in vain ever to hope for their extirpation and as for enchantments  they depend only upon yourself gallantly interrupted the duke of burgundy pshaburlington  our spells are dissolved our wands are sunk five fathom deep we had retired to this solitude and we were moralising said mrs dallington vere  then you were doing an extremely useless and not very magnanimous thing said the duke of st james for to moralise in a desert is no great exertion of philosophy you should moralise in a drawingroom and so let me propose our return to that world which must long have missed us let us do something to astound these elegant barbarians look at that young gentleman how stiff he is a yorkshire apollo look at that old lady how elaborately she simpers the venus of the riding they absolutely attempt to flirt let us give them a gallop  he was advancing to salute this provincial couple but his more mature companion repressed him  ah i forgot said the young duke i am yorkshire if i were a western like yourself i might compromise my character your grace monopolises the fun  i think you may safely attack them said miss dacre i do not think you will be recognised people entertain in this barbarous country such vulgar oldfashioned notions of a duke of st james that i have not the least doubt your grace might have a good deal of fun without being found out  there is no necessity said the duke to fly from miss dacre for amusement bythebye you make a good repartee you must permit me to introduce you to my friend lord squib i am sure you would agree so  i have been introduced to lord squib  and you found him most amusing did he say anything which vindicates my appointment of him as my court jester  i found him modest he endeavoured to excuse his errors by being your companion and to prove his virtues by being mine  treacherous squib i positively must call him out duke bear him a cartel  the quarrel is ours and must be decided here said mrs dallington vere i second miss dacre  we are in the way of some good people here i think said the duke of burlington who though the most dignified was the most considerate of men at least here are a stray couple or two staring as if they wished us to understand we prevented a set  let them stare said the duke of st james we were made to be looked at tis our vocation hal and they are gifted with vision purposely to behold us  your grace said miss dacre reminds me of my old friend prince rubarini who told me one day that when he got up late he always gave orders to have the sun put back a couple of hours  and you miss dacre remind me of my old friend the duchess of nevers who told me one day that in the course of her experience she had only met one man who was her rival in repartee  and that man asked mrs vere  was your slave mrs dallington said the young duke bowing profoundly with his hand on his heart  i remember she said the same thing to me said the duke of burlington about ten years before  that was her grandmother burley said the duke of st james  her grandmother said mrs dallington exciting the contest  decidedly said the young duke i remember my friend always spoke of the duke of burlington as grandpapa  you will profit i have no doubt then by the company of so venerable a friend said miss dacre  why said the young duke i am not a believer in the perfectibility of the species and you know that when we come to a certain point  we must despair of improvement said the duke of burlington  your grace came forward like a true knight to my rescue said miss dacre bowing to the duke of burlington  beauty can inspire miracles said the duke of st james  this young gentleman has been spoiled by travel miss dacre said the duke of burlington you have much to answer for for he tells every one that you were his guardian  the eyes of miss dacre and the duke of st james met he bowed with that graceful impudence which is after all the best explanation for every possible misunderstanding  i always heard that the duke of st james was born of age said miss dacre  the report was rife on the continent when i travelled said mrs dallington vere  that was only a poetical allegory which veiled the precocious results of my fair tutors exertions  how discreet he is said the duke of burlington you may tell immediately that he is twoandforty  we are neither of us though off the pavé yet burlington so what say you to inducing these inspiring muses to join the waltz which is just now commencing  the young duke offered his hand to miss dacre and followed by their companions they were in a few minutes lost in the waves of the waltzers     chapter vi       a complaisant spouse  the gaieties of the raceweek closed with a ball at dallington house as the pretty mistress of this proud mansion was acquainted with all the members of the ducal party our hero and his noble band were among those who honoured it with their presence  we really have had so many balls both in this and other as immortal works that in a literary point of view we think we must give up dancing nor would we have introduced you to dallington house if there had been no more serious business on hand than a flirtation with a lady or a lobster salad ah why is not a little brief communion with the last as innocent as with the first  small feet are flitting in the mazy dance and music winds with inspiring harmony through halls whose lofty mirrors multiply beauty and add fresh lustre to the blazing lights may dacre there is wandering like a peri in paradise and lady aphrodite is glancing with her dazzling brow yet an asmodeus might detect an occasional gloom over her radiant face it is but for an instant yet it thrills she looks like some favoured sultana who muses for a moment amid her splendour on her early love  and she the sparkling mistress of this scene say where is she not among the dancers though a more graceful form you could scarcely look upon not even among her guests though a more accomplished hostess it would be hard to find gaiety pours forth its flood and all are thinking of themselves or of some one sweeter even than selfconsciousness or else perhaps one absent might be missed  leaning on the arm of sir lucius grafton and shrouded in her cashmere mrs dallington vere paces the terrace in earnest conversation  if i fail in this said sir lucius i shall be desperate fortune seems to have sent him for the very purpose think only of the state of affairs for a moment after a thousand plots on my part after having for the last two years never ceased my exertions to make her commit herself when neither a love of pleasure nor a love of revenge nor the thoughtlessness to which women in her situation generally have recourse produced the slightest effect this stripling starts upon the stage and in a moment the iceberg melts oh i never shall forget the rapture of the moment when the faithful lachen announced the miracle  but why not let the adventure take the usual course you have your evidence or you can get it finish the business the exposés to be sure are disagreeable enough but to be the talk of the town for a week is no great suffering go to baden drink the waters and it will be forgotten surely this is an inconvenience not to be weighed for a moment against the great result  illustration page106  believe me my dearest friend lucy grafton cares very little about the babble of the million provided it do not obstruct him in his objects would to heaven i could proceed in the summary and effectual mode you point out but that i much doubt there is about afy in spite of all her softness and humility a strange spirit a cursed courage or obstinacy which sometimes has blazed out when i have overgalled her in a way halfawful i confess i dread her standing at bay i am in her power and a divorce she could successfully oppose if i appeared to be the person who hastened the catastrophe and she were piqued to show that she would not fall an easy victim no no i have a surer though a more difficult game she is intoxicated with this boy i will drive her into his arms  a probable result forsooth i do not think your genius has particularly brightened since we last met i thought your letters were getting dull you seem to forget that there is a third person to be consulted in this adventure and why in the name of doctors commons the duke is to close his career by marrying a woman of whom with your leave he is already if experience be not a dream halfwearied is really past my comprehension although as yorkshire lucy i should not you know be the least apprehensive of mortals  i depend upon my unbounded influence over st james  what do you mean to recommend the step then  hear me at present i am his confidential counsellor on all subjects  but one  patience fair dame and i have hitherto imperceptibly but efficiently exerted my influence to prevent his getting entangled with any other nets  faithful friend  point de moquerie listen i depend further upon his perfect inexperience of women for in spite of his numerous gallantries he has never yet had a grand passion and is quite ignorant even at this moment how involved his feelings are with his mistress he has not yet learnt the bitter lesson that unless we despise a woman when we cease to love her we are still a slave without the consolement of intoxication i depend further upon his strong feelings for strong i perceive they are with all his affectation and on his weakness of character which will allow him to be the dupe of his first great emotion it is to prevent that explosion from taking place under any other roof than my own that i now require your advice and assistance that advice and assistance which already have done so much for me i like not this sudden and uncontemplated visit to castle dacre i fear these dacres i fear the revulsion of his feelings above all i fear that girl  but her cousin is he not a talisman she loves him  pooh a cousin is not the name an answer she loves him as she loves her pony because he was her companion when she was a child and kissed her when they gathered strawberries together the pallid moonlight passion of a cousin and an absent one too has but a sorry chance against the blazing beams that shoot from the eyes of a new lover would to heaven that i had not to go down to my boobies at cleve i should like nothing better than to amuse myself an autumn at dallington with the little dacre and put an end to such an unnatural and irreligious connection she is a splendid creature bring her to town next season  but to the point you wish me i imagine to act the same part with the lady as you have done with the gentleman i am to step in i suppose as the confidential counsellor on all subjects of sweet may i am to preserve her from a youth whose passions are so impetuous and whose principles are so unformed  admirable bertha you read my thoughts  but suppose i endanger instead of advance your plans suppose for instance i captivate his grace as extraordinary things have happened as you know high place must be respected and the coronet of a duchess must not be despised  all considerations must yield to you as do all men said sir lucius with ready gallantry but not free from anxiety  no no there is no danger of that i am not going to play traitress to my system even for the duke of st james therefore anything that occurs between us shall be merely an incident pour passer le temps seulement and to preserve our young friend from the little dacre i have no doubt he will behave very well and that i shall send him safe to cleve park in a fortnight with a good character i would recommend you however not to encourage any unreasonable delay  certainly not but i must of course be guided by circumstances sir lucius observed truly there were other considerations besides getting rid of his spouse which cemented his friendship with the young duke it will be curious if lending a few thousands to the husband save our hero from the wife there is no such thing as unmixed evil a man who loses his money gains at least experience and sometimes something better but what the duke of st james gained is not yet to be told  and you like lachen asked mrs dallington  very much  i formed her with great care but you must keep her in good humour  that is not difficult elle est très jolie and pretty women like yourself are always goodnatured  but has she really worked herself into the confidence of the virtuous aphrodite  entirely and the humour is that lachen has persuaded her that lachen herself is on the best possible terms with my confidential valet and can make herself at all times mistress of her masters secrets so it is always in my power apparently without taking the slightest interest in afys conduct to regulate it as i will at present she believes that my affairs are in a distracted state and that i intend to reside solely on the continent and to bear her off from her cupidon this thought haunts her rest and hangs heavy on her waking mind i think it will do the business  we have been too long absent let us return  i accompany you my charming friend what should i do without such an ally i only wish that i could assist you in a manner equally friendly is there no obdurate hero who wants a confidential adviser to dilate upon your charms or to counsel him to throw himself at your feet or are that beautiful in face and lovely form as they must always be invincible  i assure you quite disembarrassed of any attentions whatever but i suppose when i return to athens i must get platonic again  let me be the philosopher  no no we know each other too well i have been free ever since that fatal affair of young darrell and travel has restored my spirits a little they say his brother is just as handsome he was expected at vienna but i could not meet him although i suppose as i made him a viscount i am rather popular than not with him  pooh pooh think not of this no one blames you you are still a universal favourite but i would recommend you nevertheless to take me as your cavalier  you are too generous or too bold no man i am tired of flirtation and really think for varietys sake i must fall in love after all there is nothing like the delicious dream though it be but a dream spite of my discretion i sometimes tremble lest i should end by making myself a fool with some grand passion you look serious fear not for the young duke he is a dazzling gentleman but not a hero exactly to my taste     chapter vii       at castle dacre  the moment that was to dissolve the spell which had combined and enchanted so many thousands of human beings arrived nobles and nobodies beauties and blacklegs dispersed in all directions the duke of burlington carried off the french princes and the protocolis the bloomerlys and the vaticans to his paradise of marringworth the fitzpompeys cantered off with the shropshires omen of felicity to the enamoured st maurice and the enamouring sophy annesley and squib returned to their pâtés sir lucius and lady aphrodite neither of them with tempers like summer skies betook their way to cambridgeshire like adam and eve from the glorious garden the duke of st james after a hurried visit to london found himself at the beginning of october on his way to dacre  as his carriage rolled on he revelled in delicious fancies the young duke built castles not only at hauteville but in less substantial regions reverie in the flush of our warm youth generally indulges in the future we are always anticipating the next adventure and clothe the coming heroine with a rosy tint when we advance a little on our limited journey and an act or two of the comedy the gayest in all probability are over the wizard memory dethrones the witch imagination and tis the past on which the mind feeds in its musings tis then we ponder on each great result which has stolen on us without the labour of reflection tis then we analyse emotions which at the time we could not comprehend and probe the action which passion inspired and which prejudice has hitherto defended alas who can strike these occasional balances in lifes great ledger without a sigh alas how little do they promise in favour of the great account what whisperings of final bankruptcy what a damnable consciousness of present insolvency my friends what a blunder is youth ah why does truth light her torch but to illume the ruined temple of our existence ah why do we know we are men only to be conscious of our exhausted energies  and yet there is a pleasure in a deal of judgment which your judicious man alone can understand it is agreeable to see some younkers falling into the same traps which have broken our own shins and shipwrecked on the island of our hopes one likes to mark a vessel go down full in sight tis demonstration that we are not branded as cains among the favoured race of man then giving advice that is delicious and perhaps repays one all it is a privilege your greyhaired signors solely can enjoy but young men nowadays may make some claims to it and after all experience is a thing that all men praise bards sing its glories and proud philosophy has long elected it her favourite child tis the rò kaxàv in spite of all its ugliness and the elixir vitæ though we generally gain it with a shattered pulse  no more no more it is a bitter cheat the consolation of blunderers the last refuge of expiring hopes the forlorn battalion that is to capture the citadel of happiness yet yet impregnable oh what is wisdom and what is virtue without youth talk not to me of knowledge of mankind give give me back the sunshine of the breast which they oerclouded talk not to me of proud morality oh give me innocence  amid the ruins of eternal rome i scribble pages lighter than the wind and feed with fancies volumes which will be forgotten ere i can hear that they are even published yet am i not one insensible to the magic of my memorable abode and i could pour my passion oer the land but i repress my thoughts and beat their tide back to their hollow caves  the ocean of my mind is calm but dim and ominous of storms that may arise a cloud hangs heavy oer the horizons verge and veils the future even now a star appears steals into light and now again tis gone i hear the proud swell of the growing waters i hear the whispering of the wakening winds but reason lays her trident on the cresting waves and all again is hushed  for i am one though young yet old enough to know ambition is a demon and i fly from what i fear and fame has eagle wings and yet she mounts not so high as mans desires when all is gained how little then is won and yet to gain that little how much is lost let us once aspire and madness follows could we but drag the purple from the heros heart could we but tear the laurel from the poets throbbing brain and read their doubts their dangers their despair we might learn a greater lesson than we shall ever acquire by musing over their exploits or their inspiration think of unrecognised caesar with his wasting youth weeping over the macedonians young career could pharsalia compensate for those withering pangs view the obscure napoleon starving in the streets of paris what was st helena to the bitterness of such existence the visions of past glory might illumine even that darkimprisonment but to be conscious that his supernatural energies might die away without creating their miracles can the wheel or the rack rival the torture of such a suspicion lo byron bending oer his shattered lyre with inspiration in his very rage and the pert taunt could sting even this child of light to doubt of the truth of the creed in which you have been nurtured is not so terrific as to doubt respecting the intellectual vigour on whose strength you have staked your happiness yet these were mighty ones perhaps the records of the world will not yield us threescore to be their mates then tremble ye whose cheek glows too warmly at their names who would be more than man should fear lest he be less  yet there is hope there should be happiness for them for all kind nature ever mild extends her fond arms to her truant children and breathes her words of solace as we weep on her indulgent and maternal breast the exhausted passions one by one expire like gladiators in yon huge pile that has made barbarity sublime yes there is hope and joy and it is here  where the breeze wanders through a perfumed sky and where the beautiful sun illumines beauty  on the poets farm and on the conquerors arch thy beam is lingering it lingers on the shattered porticoes that once shrouded from thy oerpowering glory the lords of earth it lingers upon the ruined temples that even in their desolation are yet sacred tis gone as if in sorrow yet the woody lake still blushes with thy warm kiss and still thy rosy light tinges the pine that breaks the farthest heaven  a heaven all light all beauty and all love what marvel men should worship in these climes and lo a small and single cloud is sailing in the immaculate ether burnished with twilight like an olympian chariot from above with the fair vision of some graceful god  it is the hour that poets love but i crush thoughts that rise from out my mind like nymphs from out their caves when sets the sun yes tis a blessing here to breathe and muse and cold his clay indeed who does not yield to thy ausonian beauty clime where the heart softens and the mind expands region of mellowed bliss o most enchanting land  but we are at the park gates  they whirled along through a park which would have contained half a hundred of those patagonian paddocks of modern times which have usurped the name at length the young duke was roused from his reverie by carlstein proud of his previous knowledge leaning over and announcing  château de dacre your grace  the duke looked up the sun which had already set had tinged with a dying crimson the eastern sky against which rose a princely edifice castle dacre was the erection of vanbrugh an imaginative artist whose critics we wish no bitterer fate than not to live in his splendid creations a spacious centre richly ornamented though broken perhaps into rather too much detail was joined to wings of a corresponding magnificence by fanciful colonnades a terrace extending the whole front was covered with orange trees and many a statue and many an obelisk and many a temple and many a fountain were tinted with the warm twilight the duke did not view the forgotten scene of youth without emotion it was a palace worthy of the heroine on whom he had been musing the carriage gained the lofty portal luigi and spiridion who had preceded their master were ready to receive the duke who was immediately ushered to the rooms prepared for his reception he was later than he had intended and no time was to be unnecessarily lost in his preparation for his appearance  his graces toilet was already prepared the magical dressingbox had been unpacked and the shrine for his devotions was covered with richlycut bottles of all sizes arranged in all the elegant combinations which the picturesque fancy of his valet could devise adroitly intermixed with the golden instruments the china vases and the ivory and rosewood brushes which were worthy even of delcroixs exquisite inventions  the duke of st james was master of the art of dress and consequently consummated that paramount operation with the decisive rapidity of one whose principles are settled he was cognisant of all effects could calculate in a second all consequences and obtained his result with that promptitude and precision which stamp the great artist for a moment he was plunged in profound abstraction and at the same time stretched his legs after his drive he then gave his orders with the decision of wellington on the arrival of the prussians and the battle began  his grace had a taste for magnificence in costume but he was handsome young and a duke pardon him yet today he was on the whole simple confident in a complexion whose pellucid lustre had not yielded to a season of dissipation his grace did not dread the want of relief which a white face a white cravat and a white waistcoat would seem to imply  a hair chain set in diamonds worn in memory of the absent aphrodite and to pique the present dacre is annexed to a glass which reposes in the waistcoat pocket this was the only weight that the duke of st james ever carried it was a bore but it was indispensable  it is done he stops one moment before the long pierglass and shoots a glance which would have read the mind of talleyrand it will do he assumes the look the air that befit the occasion cordial but dignified sublime but sweet he descends like a deity from olympus to a banquet of illustrious mortals     chapter viii       fair women and brave men  mr dacre received him with affection his daughter with a cordiality which he had never yet experienced from her though more simply dressed than when she first met his ardent gaze her costume again charmed his practised eye it must be her shape thought the young duke it is magical  the rooms were full of various guests and some of these were presented to his grace who was of course an object of universal notice but particularly by those persons who pretended not to be aware of his entrance the party assembled at castle dacre consisted of some thirty or forty persons all of great consideration but of a different character from any with whom the duke of st james had been acquainted during his short experience of english society they were not what are called fashionable people we have no princes and no ambassadors no duke who is a gourmand no earl who is a jockey no manoeuvring mothers no flirting daughters no gambling sons for your entertainment there is no superfine gentleman brought down specially from town to gauge the refinement of the manners of the party and to prevent them by his constant supervision and occasional sneer from losing any of the beneficial results of their last campaign we shall sadly want too a lady patroness to issue a decree or quote her code of consolidated etiquette we are not sure that almacks will ever be mentioned quite sure that maradan has never yet been heard of the jockey club may be quoted but crockford will be a dead letter as for the rest boodles is all we can promise miserable consolation for the bowwindow as for buffoons and artists to amuse a vacant hour or sketch a vacant face we must frankly tell you at once that there is not one are you frightened will you go on will you trust yourself with these savages try they are rude but they are hospitable  the party we have said were all persons of great consideration some were noble most were rich all had ancestors there were the earl and countess of faulconcourt he looked as if he were fit to reconquer palestine and she as if she were worthy to reward him for his valour misplaced in this superior age he was sans peur and she sans reproche there was lord mildmay an english peer and a french colonel methinks such an incident might have been a better reason for a late measure than an irishman being returned a member of our imperial parliament there was our friend lord st jerome of course his stepmother yet young and some sisters pretty as nuns there were some cousins from the farthest north northumbrias bleakest bound who came down upon yorkshire like the goths upon italy and were revelling in what they considered a southern clime  there was an mp in whom the catholics had hopes he had made a great speech not only a great speech but a great impression his matter certainly was not new but well arranged and his images not singularly original but appositely introduced in short a bore who speaking on a subject in which a new hand is indulged and connected with the families whose cause he was pleading was for once courteously listened to by the very men who determined to avenge themselves for their complaisance by a cough on the first opportunity but the orator was prudent he reserved himself and the session closed with his fame yet fullblown  then there were country neighbours in great store with wives that were treasures and daughters fresh as flowers among them we would particularise two gentlemen they were great proprietors and catholics and baronets and consoled themselves by their active maintenance of the gamelaws for their inability to regulate their neighbours by any other one was sir chetwode chetwode of chetwode the other was sir tichborne tichborne of tichborne it was not easy to see two men less calculated to be the slaves of a foreign and despotic power which we all know catholics are tall and robust and rosy with hearts even stouter than their massy frames they were just the characters to assemble in runnymede and probably even at the present day might have imitated their ancestors even in their signatures in disposition they were much the same though they were friends in person there were some differences but they were slight sir chetwodes hair was straight and white sir tichbornes brown and curly sir chetwodes eyes were blue sir tichbornes grey  sir chetwodes nose was perhaps a snub sir tichbornes was certainly a bottle sir chetwode was somewhat garrulous and was often like a man at a play in the wrong box sir tichborne was somewhat taciturn but when he spoke it was always to the purpose and made an impression even if it were not new both were kind hearts but sir chetwode was jovial sir tichborne rather stern sir chetwode often broke into a joke sir tichborne sometimes backed into a sneer   a few of these characters were made known by mr dacre to his young friend but not many and in an easy way those that stood nearest introduction is a formality and a bore and is never resorted to by your wellbred host save in a casual way when proper people meet at proper houses they give each other credit for propriety and slide into an acquaintance by degrees the first day they catch a name the next they ask you whether you are the son of general no he was my uncle ah i knew him well a worthy soul and then the thing is settled you ride together shoot or fence or hunt a game of billiards will do no great harm and when you part you part with a hope that you may meet again  lord mildmay was glad to meet with the son of an old friend he knew the late duke well and loved him better it is pleasant to hear our fathers praised we too may inherit their virtues with their lands or cash or bonds and scapegraces as we are it is agreeable to find a precedent for the blood turning out well and after all there is no feeling more thoroughly delightful than to be conscious that the kind being from whose loins we spring and to whom we cling with an innate and overpowering love is viewed by others with regard with reverence or with admiration there is no pride like the pride of ancestry for it is a blending of all emotions how immeasurably superior to the herd is the man whose father only is famous imagine then the feelings of one who can trace his line through a thousand years of heroes and of princes  tis dinner hour that i have loved as loves the bard the twilight but no more those visions rise that once were wont to spring in my quick fancy the dream is past the spell is broken and even the lore on which i pondered in my first youth is strange as figures in egyptian tombs  no more no more oh never more to me that hour shall bring its rapture and its bliss no more no more oh never more for me shall flavour sit upon her thousand thrones and like a syren with a sunny smile win to renewed excesses each more sweet my feasting days are over me no more the charms of fish or flesh still less of fowl can make the fool of that they made before the fricandeau is like a dream of early love the fricassee with which i have so often flirted is like the tattle of the last quadrille and no longer are my dreams haunted with the dark passion of the rich ragoût ye soups oer whose creation i have watched like mothers oer their sleeping child ye sauces to which i have even lent a name where are ye now tickling perchance the palate of some easy friend who quite forgets the boon companion whose presence once lent lustre even to his ruby wine and added perfume to his perfumed hock  our duke however had not reached the age of retrospection he pecked as prettily as any bird seated on the right hand of his delightful hostess nobody could be better pleased supervised by his jäger who stood behind his chair no one could be better attended he smiled with the calm amiable complacency of a man who feels the world is quite right     chapter ix       the châtelaine of castle dacre  how is your graces horse sanspareil asked sir chetwode chetwode of chetwode of the duke of st james shooting at the same time a sly glance at his opposite neighbour sir tichborne tichborne of tichborne  quite well sir said the duke in his quietest tone but with an air which he flattered himself might repress further inquiry  has he got over his fatigue pursued the dogged baronet with a short gritty laugh that sounded like a loose dragchain dangling against the stones we all thought the yorkshire air would not agree with him  yet sir chetwode that could hardly be your opinion of sanspareil said miss dacre for i think if i remember right i had the pleasure of making you encourage our glove manufactory  sir chetwode looked a little confused the duke of st james inspirited by his fair ally rallied and hoped sir chetwode did not back his steed to a fatal extent if continued he i had had the slightest idea that any friend of miss dacre was indulging in such an indiscretion i certainly would have interfered and have let him known that the horse was not to win  is that a fact asked sir tichborne tichborne of tichborne with a sturdy voice  can a yorkshireman doubt it rejoined the duke was it possible for anyone but a mere newmarket dandy to have entertained for a moment the supposition that anyone but may dacre should be the queen of the st leger  i have heard something of this before said sir tichborne but i did not believe it a young friend of mine consulted me upon the subject would you advise me said he to settle why said i if you can prove any bubble my opinion is dont but if you cannot prove anything my opinion is do  very just very true were murmured by many in the neighbourhood of the oracle by no one with more personal sincerity than lady tichborne herself  i will write to my young friend continued the baronet  oh no said miss dacre his graces candour must not be abused i have no idea of being robbed of my wellearned honours sir tichborne private conversation must be respected and the sanctity of domestic life must not be profaned if the tactics of doncaster are no longer to be fair war why half the families in the riding will be ruined  stillsaid sir tichborne  but mr dacre like a deity in a trojan battle interposed and asked his opinion of a keeper  i hope you are a sportsman said miss dacre to the duke for this is the palace of nimrod  i have hunted it was not very disagreeable i sometimes shoot it is not very stupid  then in fact i perceive that you are a heretic lord faulconcourt his grace is moralising on the barbarity of the chase  then he has never had the pleasure of hunting in company with miss dacre  do you indeed follow the hounds asked the duke  sometimes do worse ride over them but lord faulconcourt is fast emancipating me from the trammels of my frippery foreign education and i have no doubt that in another season i shall fling off quite in style  you remember mr annesley asked the duke  it is difficult to forget him he always seemed to me to think that the world was made on purpose for him to have the pleasure of cutting it  yet he was your admirer  yes and once paid me a compliment he told me it was the only one that he had ever uttered  oh charley charley this is excellent we shall have a tale when we meet what was the compliment  it would be affectation in me to pretend that i have forgotten it nevertheless you must excuse me  pray pray let me have it  perhaps you will not like it  now i must hear it  well then he said that talking to me was the only thing that consoled him for having to dine with you and to dance with lady shropshire  charles is jealous drawled the duke  of her grace asked miss dacre with much anxiety  no but charles is aged and once when he dined with me was taken for my uncle  the ladies retired and the gentlemen sat barbarously long sir chetwode chetwode of chetwode and sir tichborne tichborne of tichborne were two men who drank wine independent of fashion and exacted to the last glass the identical quantity which their fathers had drunk half a century before and to which they had been used almost from their cradle the only subject of conversation was sporting terrible shots more terrible runs neat barrels and pretty fencers the duke of st james was not sufficiently acquainted with the geography of the mansion to make a premature retreat an operation which is looked upon with an evil eye and which to be successful must be prompt and decisive and executed with supercilious nonchalance so he consoled himself by a little chat with lord mildmay who sat smiling handsome and mustachioed with an empty glass and who was as much out of water as he was out of wine the duke was not very learned in parisian society but still with the aid of the duchess de berri and the duchess de duras léontine fay and lady stuart de rothesay they got on and made out the time until purgatory ceased and paradise opened  for paradise it was although there were there assembled some thirty or forty persons not less dull than the majority of our dull race and in those little tactics that make society less burdensome perhaps even less accomplished but a sunbeam will make even the cloudiest day break into smiles a bounding fawn will banish monotony even from a wilderness and a glass of claret or perchance some stronger grape will convert even the platitude of a goblet of water into a pleasing beverage and so may dacre moved among her guests shedding light life and pleasure  she was not one who shrouded in herself leaves it to chance or fate to amuse the beings whom she has herself assembled within her halls nonchalance is the métier of your modern hostess and so long as the house be not on fire or the furniture not kicked you may be even ignorant who is the priestess of the hospitable fane in which you worship  they are right men shrink from a fussy woman and few can aspire to regulate the destinies of their species even in so slight a point as an hours amusement without rare powers there is no greater sin than to be trop prononcée a want of tact is worse than a want of virtue some women it is said work on pretty well against the tide without the last i never knew one who did not sink who ever dared to sail without the first  loud when they should be low quoting the wrong person talking on the wrong subject teasing with notice excruciating with attentions disturbing a têteàtête in order to make up a dance wasting eloquence in persuading a man to participate in amusement whose reputation depends on his social sullenness exacting homage with a restless eye and not permitting the least worthy knot to be untwined without their divinityships interference patronising the meek anticipating the slow intoxicated with compliment plastering with praise that you in return may gild with flattery in short energetic without elegance active without grace and loquacious without wit mistaking bustle for style raillery for badinage and noise for gaiety these are the characters who mar the very career they think they are creating and who exercise a fatal influence on the destinies of all those who have the misfortune to be connected with them  not one of these was she the lady of our tale there was a quiet dignity lurking even under her easiest words and actions which made you feel her notice a compliment there was a fascination in her calm smile and in her sunlit eye which made her invitation to amusement itself a pleasure if you refused you were not pressed but left to that isolation which you appeared to admire if you assented you were rewarded with a word which made you feel how sweet was such society her invention never flagged her gaiety never ceased yet both were spontaneous and often were unobserved all felt amused and all were unconsciously her agents her word and her example seemed each instant to call forth from her companions new accomplishments new graces new sources of joy and of delight all were surprised that they were so agreeable     chapter x       loves young dream  morning came and the great majority of the gentlemen rose early as aurora the chase is the favourite pastime of man and boy yet some preferred plundering their hosts preserves by which means their slumbers were not so brief and their breakfast less disturbed the battue however in time called forth its band and then one by one or two by two or sometimes even three leaning on each others arms and smiling in each others faces the ladies dropped into the breakfastroom at castle dacre there until two oclock a lounging meal might always be obtained but generally by twelve the coast was clear for our party were a natural race of beings and would have blushed if flaming noon had caught them napping in their easy couches our bright bird may dacre too rose from her bower full of the memory of the sweetest dreams and fresh as lilies ere they kiss the sun  she bends before her ivory crucifix and gazes on her blessed mothers face where the sweet florentine had tinged with light a countenance       too fair for worship too divine for love  and innocence has prayed for fresh support and young devotion told her holy beads she rises with an eye of mellowed light and her soft cheek is tinted with the flush that comes from prayer guard over her ye angels wheresoeer and whatsoeer ye are for she shall be your meet companion in an afterday then love your gentle friend this sinless child of clay  the morning passed as mornings ever pass where twenty women for the most part pretty are met together some read some drew some worked all talked some wandered in the library and wondered why such great books were written one sketched a favourite hero in the picture gallery a dacre who had saved the state or church had fought at cressy or flourished at windsor another picked a flower out of the conservatory and painted its powdered petals here a purse halfmade promised when finished quite to make some hero happy then there was chat about the latest fashions caps and bonnets séduisantes and sleeves as the day grew old some rode some walked some drove a ponychair was lady faulconcourts delight whose arm was roundly turned and graced the whip while on the other hand lady st jerome rather loved to try the paces of an ambling nag because her figure was of the sublime and she looked not unlike an amazonian queen particularly when lord mildmay was her theseus  he was the most consummate polished gentleman that ever issued from the court of france he did his friend dacre the justice to suppose that he was a victim to his barbarous guests but for the rest of the galloping crew who rode and shot all day and in the evening fell asleep just when they were wanted he shrugged his shoulders and he thanked his stars in short lord mildmay was the ladies man and in their morning dearth of beaux to adopt their unanimous expression quite a host  then there was archery for those who could draw a bow or point an arrow and we are yet to learn the sight that is more dangerous for your bachelor to witness or the ceremony which more perfectly develops all that the sex would wish us to remark than this old english custom  with all these resources all was of course free and easy as the air your appearance was your own act if you liked you might have remained like a monk or nun in your cell till dinnertime but no later privacy and freedom are granted you in the morning that you may not exhaust your powers of pleasing before night and that you may reserve for those favoured hours all the new ideas that you have collected in the course of your morning adventures  but where was he the hero of our tale fencing craning hitting missing is he over or is he under has he killed or is he killed for the last is but the chance of war and pheasants have the pleasure of sometimes seeing as gay birds as themselves with plumage quite as shattered but there is no danger of the noble countenance of the duke of st james bearing today any evidence of the exploits of himself or his companions his grace was in one of his sublime fits and did not rise luigi consoled himself for the bore of this protracted attendance by diddling the pageinwaiting at dominos  the duke of st james was in one of his sublime fits he had commenced by thinking of may dacre and he ended by thinking of himself he was under that delicious and dreamy excitement which we experience when the image of a lovely and beloved object begins to mix itself up with our own intense selflove she was the heroine rather of an indefinite reverie than of definite romance instead of his own image alone playing about his fancy her beautiful face and springing figure intruded their exquisite presence he no longer mused merely on his own voice and wit he called up her tones of thrilling power he imagined her in all the triumph of her gay repartee in his minds eye he clearly watched all the graces of her existence she moved she gazed she smiled now he was alone and walking with her in some rich wood sequestered warm solemn dim feeding on the music of her voice and gazing with intenseness on the wakening passion of her devoted eye now they rode together scudded over champaign galloped down hills scampered through valleys all life and gaiety and vivacity and spirit now they were in courts and crowds and he led her with pride to the proudest kings he covered her with jewels but the world thought her brighter than his gems now they met in the most unexpected and improbable manner now they parted with a tenderness which subdued their souls even more than rapture now he saved her life now she blessed his existence now his reverie was too vague and misty to define its subject it was a stream of passion joy sweet voices tender tones exulting hopes beaming faces chaste embraces immortal transports  it was three oclock and for the twentieth time our hero made an effort to recall himself to the realities of life how cold how tame how lifeless how imperfect how inconsecutive did everything appear this is the curse of reverie but they who revel in its pleasures must bear its pains and are content yet it wears out the brain and unfits us for social life they who indulge in it most are the slaves of solitude they wander in a wilderness and people it with their voices they sit by the side of running waters with an eye more glassy than the stream the sight of a human being scares them more than a wild beast does a traveller the conduct of life when thrust upon their notice seems only a tissue of adventures without point and compared with the creatures of their imagination human nature seems to send forth only abortions  i must up said the young duke and this creature on whom i have lived for the last eight hours who has in herself been to me the universe this constant companion this cherished friend whose voice was passion and whose look was love will meet me with all the formality of a young lady all the coldness of a person who has never even thought of me since she saw me last damnable delusion tomorrow i will get up and hunt  he called luigi and a showerbath assisted him in taking a more healthy view of affairs yet his faithful fancy recurred to her again he must indulge it a little he left off dressing and flung himself in a chair  and yet he continued when i think of it again there surely can be no reason that this should not turn into a romance of real life i perceived that she was a little piqued when we first met at doncaster very natural very flattering i should have been piqued certainly i behaved decidedly ill but how in the name of heaven was i to know that she was the brightest little being that ever breathed well i am here now she has got her wish and i think an evident alteration has already taken place but she must not melt too quickly she will not she will do nothing but what is exquisitely proper how i do love this child i dote upon her very image it is the very thing that i have always been wanting the women call me inconstant i have never been constant but they will not listen to us without we feign feelings and then they upbraid us for not being influenced by them i have sighed i have sought i have wept for what i now have found what would she give to know what is passing in my mind by heavens there is no blood in england that has a better chance of being a duchess     chapter xi       le roi samuse  a canter is the cure for every evil and brings the mind back to itself sooner than all the lessons of chrysippus and crantor it is the only process that at the same time calms the feelings and elevates the spirits banishes blue devils and raises one to the society of angels ever bright and fair it clears the mind it cheers the heart it is the best preparation for all enterprises for it puts a man in good humour both with the world and himself and whether you are going to make a speech or scribble a scene whether you are about to conquer the world or yourself order your horse as you bound along your wit will brighten and your eloquence blaze your courage grow more adamantine and your generous feelings burn with a livelier flame and when the exercise is over the excitement does not cease as when it grows from music for your blood is up and the brilliancy of your eye is fed by your bubbling pulses then my young friend take my advice rush into the world and triumph will grow out of your quick life like victory bounding from the palm of jove  our duke ordered his horses and as he rattled along recovered from the enervating effects of his soft reverie on his way home he fell in with mr dacre and the two baronets returning on their hackneys from a hard fought field  gay sport asked his grace  a capital run i think the last forty minutes the most splitting thing we have had for a long time answered sir chetwode i only hope jack wilson will take care of poor fanny i did not half like leaving her your grace does not join us  i mean to do so but i am unfortunately a late riser  hem said sir tichborne the monosyllable meant much  i have a horse which i think will suit your grace said mr dacre and to which in fact you are entitled for it bears the name of your house you have ridden hauteville sir tichborne  yes fine animal  i shall certainly try his powers said the duke when is your next fieldday  thursday said sir tichborne but we shall be too early for you i am afraid with a gruff smile  oh no said the young duke who saw his man i assure you i have been up today nearly two hours let us get on  the first person that his graces eye met when he entered the room in which they assembled before dinner was mrs dallington vere  dinner was a favourite moment with the duke of st james during this visit at castle dacre since it was the only time in the day that thanks to his rank which he now doubly valued he could enjoy a têteàtête with its blooming mistress  i am going to hunt said the duke and i am to ride hauteville i hope you will set me an example on thursday and that i shall establish my character with sir tichborne  i am to lead on that day a bold band of archers i have already too much neglected my practising and i fear that my chance of the silver arrow is slight  i have betted upon you with everybody said the duke of st james  remember doncaster i am afraid that may dacre will again be the occasion of your losing your money  but now i am on the right side together we must conquer  i have a presentiment that our union will not be a fortunate one  then i am ruined said his grace with rather a serious tone  i hope you have not really staked anything upon such nonsense said miss dacre  i have staked everything said his grace  talking of stakes said lord st jerome who pricked up his ears at a congenial subject do you know what they are going to do about that affair of andersons  what does he say for himself asked sir chetwode  he says that he had no intention of embezzling the money but that as he took it for granted the point could never be decided he thought it was against the usury laws to allow money to lie idle  that fellow has always got an answer said sir tichborne i hate men who have always got an answer there is no talking common sense with them  the duke made his escape today and emboldened by his illustrious example charles faulcon lord st jerome and some other heroes followed to the great disgust of sir chetwode and sir tichborne  as the evening glided on conversation naturally fell upon the amusements of society  i am sure we are tired of dancing every night said miss dacre i wonder if we could introduce any novelty what think you bertha you can always suggest  you remember the tableaux vivants said mrs dallington vere  beautiful but too elaborate a business i fear for us we want something more impromptu the tableaux are nothing without brilliant and accurate costume and to obtain that we must work at least for a week and then after all in all probability a failure ils sont trop recherchés she said lowering her voice to mrs dallington pour nous ici they must spring out of a society used to such exhibitions  i have a costume dress here said the duke of  st james  and i have a uniform said lord mildmay  and then said mrs dallington there are cashmeres and scarfs and jewels to be collected i see however you think it impossible  i fear so however we will think of it in the meantime what shall we do now suppose we act a fairy tale  none of the girls can act said mrs dallington with a look of kind pity  let us teach them that itself will be an amusement suppose we act cinderella there is the music of cendrillon and you can compose when necessary as you go on clara howard said may dacre come here love we want you to be cinderella in a little play  i act oh dear may how can you laugh at me so i cannot act  you will not have to speak only just move about as i direct you while bertha plays music  oh dear may i cannot indeed i never did act ask eugenia  eugenia if you are afraid i am sure she will faint i asked you because i thought you were just the person for it  but only think said poor clara with an imploring voice to act may why acting is the most difficult thing in the world acting is quite a dreadful thing i know many ladies who will not act  but it is not acting clara well i will be cinderella and you shall be one of the sisters  no dear may  well then the fairy no dear dear dear may  well duke of st james what am i to do with this rebellious troop  let me be cinderella  it is astonishing said miss dacre the difficulty which you encounter in england if you try to make people the least amusing or vary the regular dull routine which announces dancing as the beautiful of diversions and cards as the sublime  we are barbarians said the duke we were not said may dacre what are tableaux or acted charades or romances to masques which were the splendid and various amusement of our ancestors last christmas we performed comus here with great effect but then we had arundel and he is an admirable actor  curse arundel thought the duke i had forgotten him  i do not wonder said mrs dallington vere at people objecting to act regular plays for independently of the objections not that i think anything of them myself which are urged against private theatricals the fact is to get up a play is a tremendous business and one or two is your bound but masques where there is so little to learn by rote a great consideration where music and song are so exquisitely introduced where there is such an admirable opportunity for brilliant costume and where the scene may be beautiful without changesuch an important pointi cannot help wondering that this national diversion is not revived  suppose we were to act a romance without the costume said the duke let us consider it a rehearsal and perhaps the misses howard will have no objection to sing  it is difficult to find a suitable romance said miss dacre all our modern english ones are too full of fine poetry we tried once an old ballad but it was too long last christmas we got up a good many and arundel isabella and myself used to scribble some nonsense for the occasion but i am afraid they are all either burnt or taken away i will look in the musiccase  she went to the musiccase with the duke and mrs dallington  no she continued not one not a single one but what are these she looked at some lines written in pencil in a musicbook oh here is something too slight but it will do you see she continued reading it to the duke by the introduction of the same line in every verse describing the same action a backscene is as it were created and the story if you can call it such proceeds in front really i think we might make something of this  mr dacre and some others were at whist the two baronets were together talking over the mornings sport ecarté covered a flirtation between lord mildmay and lady st jerome miss dacre assembled her whole troop and like a manager with a new play read in the midst of them the ballad and gave them directions for their conduct a japan screen was unfolded at the end of the room two couches indicated the limits of the stage then taking her guitar she sang with a sweet voice and arch simplicity these simpler lines       i       childe dacre stands in his fathers hall      while all the rest are dancing      childe dacre gazes on the wall      while brightest eyes are glancing      then prythee tell me gentles gay      what makes our childe so dull today  each verse was repeated  in the background they danced a cotillon  in the front the duke of st james as childe dacre leant against the wall with arms folded and eyes fixed in short in an attitude which commanded great applause       ii       i cannot tell unless it be      while all the rest are dancing      the lady alice on the sea      with brightest eyes is glancing      or muses on the twilight hour      will bring childe dacre to her bower  mrs dallington vere advances as the lady alice her walk is abrupt her look anxious and distracted she seems to be listening for some signal she falls into a musing attitude motionless and graceful as a statue clara howard alike marvels at her genius and her courage       iii       childe dacre hears the curfew chime      while all the rest are dancing      unless i find a fitting rhyme      oh here ends my romancing      but see her lovers at her feet      oh words of joy oh meeting sweet  the duke advances chivalric passion in his every gesture the lady alice rushes to his arms with that look of trembling transport which tells the tale of stolen love they fall into a group which would have made the fortune of an annual       iv       then let us hope when next i sing      and all the rest are dancing      our childe a gentle bride may bring      all other joys enhancing      then we will bless the twilight hour      that calld him to a ladys bower  the duke led mrs dallington to the dancers with courtly grace there was great applause but the spirit of fun and oneandtwenty inspired him and he led off a gallop in fact it was an elegant romp the two baronets started from their slumbers and lord mildmay called for mademoiselle dacre the call was echoed miss dacre yielded to the public voice and acted to the life the gratified and condescending air of a firstrate performer lord mildmay called for madame dallington miss dacre led on her companion as sontag would malibran there was no wreath at hand but the duke of st james robbed his coat of its rose and offered it on his knee to mademoiselle who presented it with parisian feeling to her rival the scene was as superb as anything at the académie     chapter xii       an impromptu excursion  we certainly must have a masque said the young duke as he threw himself into his chair satisfied with his performance  you must open hauteville with one said mrs dallington  a capital idea but we will practise at dacre first  when is hauteville to be finished asked mrs dallington i shall really complain if we are to be kept out of it much longer i believe i am the only person in the riding who has not been there  i have been there said the duke and am afraid i must go again for sir carte has just come down for a few days and i promised to meet him it is a sad bore i wish it were finished  take me with you said mrs dallington take us all and let us make a party  an admirable idea exclaimed the young duke with a brightening countenance what admirable ideas you have mrs dallington this is indeed turning business into pleasure what says our hostess  i will join you  tomorrow then said the duke  tomorrow you are rapid  never postpone never prepare that is your own rule tomorrow tomorrow all must go  papa will you go tomorrow to hauteville  are you serious  yes said miss dacre we never postpone we never prepare  but do not you think a day at least had better intervene urged mr dacre we shall be unexpected  i vote for tomorrow said the duke  tomorrow was the universal exclamation tomorrow was carried  i will write to blanche at once said the duke  mrs dallington vere ran for the writing materials and his grace indicted the following pithy note   halfpast ten castle dacre  dear sir carte  our party here intend to honour hauteville with a visit tomorrow and anticipate the pleasure of viewing the improvements with yourself for their cicerone let rawdon know immediately of this they tell me here that the sun rises about six as we shall not be with you till noon i have no doubt your united energies will be able to make all requisite preparations we may be thirty or forty believe me dear sir carte  your faithful servant  st james  carlstein bears this which you will receive in an hour let me have a line by return     chapter xiii       the charms of hauteville  it was a morning all dew and sunshine soft yet bright just fit for a hawking party for dames of high degree feathered cavaliers ambling palfreys and tinkling bells our friends rose early and assembled punctually all went and all went on horseback but they sent before some carriages for the return in case the ladies should be wearied with excessive pleasure the cavalcade for it was no less broke into parties which were often out of sight of each other the duke and lord st jerome clara howard and charles faulcon miss dacre and mrs dallington formed one and as they flattered themselves not the least brilliant they were all in high spirits and his grace lectured on ridinghabits with erudite enthusiasm  their road lay through a country wild and woody where crag and copse beautifully intermixed with patches of rich cultivation halfway they passed rosemount a fanciful pavilion where the dukes of st james sometimes sought that elegant simplicity which was not afforded by all the various charms of their magnificent hauteville at length they arrived at the parkgate of the castle which might itself have passed for a tolerable mansion it was ancient and embattled flanked by a couple of sturdy towers and gave a noble promise of the baronial pile which it announced the park was a petty principality and its apparently illimitable extent its rich variety of surface its ancient woods and numerous deer attracted the attention and the admiration even of those who had been born in such magical enclosures  away they cantered over the turf each moment with their blood more sparkling a turn in the road and hauteville with its donjon keep and lordly flag and manywindowed line of long perspective its towers and turrets and terraces bathed with the soft autumnal sun met their glad sight  your majesty is welcome to my poor castle said the young duke bowing with head uncovered to miss dacre  nay we are at the best but captive princesses about to be immured in that fearful keep and this is the way you mock us  i am content that you shall be my prisoner  a struggle for freedom said miss dacre looking back to mrs dallington and she galloped towards the castle  lord mildmay and lady st jerome cantered up and the rest soon assembled sir carte came forward all smiles with a clerk of the works bearing a portfolio of plans a crowd of servants for the duke maintained an establishment at hauteville advanced and the fair equestrians were dismounted they shook their habits and their curls vowed that riding was your only exercise and that dust in the earthly economy was a blunder and then they entered the castle  room after room gallery after gallery you know the rest shall we describe the silk hangings and the reverend tapestry the agate tables and the tall screens the china and the armour the state beds and the curious cabinets and the family pictures mixed up so quaintly with italian and flemish art but we pass from meek madonnas and seraphic saints from gleaming claudes and guidos soft as eve from rubenss satyrs and albanos boys and even from those gay and natural medleys paintings that cheer the heart where fruit and flower with their brilliant bloom call to a feast the butterfly and bee we pass from these to squareheaded ancestors by holbein all black velvet and gold chains cavaliers by vandyke all lace and spurs with pointed beards that did more execution even than their pointed swords patriots and generals by kneller in blenheim wigs and steenkirk cravats all robes and armour scarlet judges that supported shipmoney and purple bishops who had not been sent to the tower here was a wit who had sipped his coffee at buttons and there some mad alcibiades duke who had exhausted life ere he had finished youth and yet might be consoled for all his flashing follies could he witness the bright eyes that lingered on his countenance while they glanced over all the patriotism and all the piety all the illustrious courage and all the historic craft which when living it was daily told him that he had shamed ye dames with dewy eyes that lely drew have we forgotten you no by that sleepy loveliness that reminds us that night belongs to beauty ye were made for memory and oh our grandmothers that we now look upon as girls breathing in reynoldss playful canvas let us also pay our homage to your grace  the chapel where you might trace art from the richly gothic tomb designed by some neighbouring abbot to the last effort of flaxman the ridinghouse where brightly framed looked down upon you with a courtly smile the first and gartered duke who had been master of the horse were alike visited and alike admired they mounted the summit of the round tower and looked around upon the broad county which they were proud to call their own amid innumerable seats where blazed the hearths of the best blood of england they recognised with delight the dome of dacre and the woods of dallington they walked along a terrace not unworthy of the promenade of a court they visited the flower gardens where the peculiar style of every nation was in turn imitated they loitered in the vast conservatories which were themselves a palace they wandered in the wilderness where the invention of consummate art presented them with the ideal of nature in this poetic solitude where all was green and still and sweet or where the only sound was falling water or fluttering birds the young duke recurred to the feelings which during the last momentous week had so mastered his nature and he longed to wind his arm round the beautiful being without whom this enchanting domain was a dreary waste  they assembled in a green retreat where the energetic sir carte had erected a marquée and where a collation greeted the eyes of those who were well prepared for it rawdon had also done his duty and the guests who were aware of the sudden manner in which the whole affair had arisen wondered at the magic which had produced a result worthy of a weeks preparation but it is a great thing to be a young duke the pasties and the venison and the game the pines and the peaches and the grapes the cakes and the confectionery and the ices which proved that the stillroom at hauteville was not an empty name were all most popular but the wines they were marvellous and as the finest cellars in the country had been ransacked for excellence and variety it is not wonderful that their produce obtained a panegyric there was hock of a century old which made all stare though we for our part cannot see or rather taste the beauty of this antiquity wine like woman in our opinion should not be too old so we raise our altar to the infant bacchus but this is not the creed of the million nor was it the persuasion of sir chetwode chetwode or of sir tichborne tichborne good judges both the johannisberger quite converted them they no longer disliked the young duke they thought him a fool to be sure but at the same time a goodnatured one in the meantime all were interested and carlstein with his key bugle from out a neighbouring brake afforded the only luxury that was wanting  it is six oclock carriages are ordered and horses are harnessed back back to dacre but not at the lively rate at which they had left that lordly hall this morning they are all alike inclined to move slowly they are silent yet serene and satisfied they ponder upon the reminiscences of a delightful morning and also of a delightful meal perhaps they are a little weary perhaps they wish to gaze upon the sunset  it is eight oclock and they enter the park gates dinner is universally voted a bore even by the baronets coffee covers the retreat of many a wearied bird to her evening bower the rest lounge on a couch or sofa or chew the cud of memory on an ottoman it was a day of pleasure which had been pleasant that was certain but that was past who is to be duchess of st james answer this may dacre or bertha vere or clara howard lady st jerome is it to be a daughter of thy house lady faulconcourt art thou to be hailed as the unrivalled mother tis mystery all as must always be the future of this world we muse we plan we hope but naught is certain but that which is naught for a question answered a doubt satisfied an end attained what are they but fit companions for clothes out of fashion cracked china and broken fans  our hero was neither wearied nor sleepy for his mind was too full of exciting fancies to think of the interests of his body as all were withdrawing he threw his cloak about him and walked on the terrace it was a night soft as the rhyme that sighs from rogers shell and brilliant as a phrase just turned by moore the thousand stars smiled from their blue pavilions and the moon shed the mild light that makes a lover muse fragrance came in airy waves from trees rich with the golden orange and from out the woods there ever and anon arose a sound deep and yet hushed and mystical and soft it could not be the wind  his heart was full his hopes were sweet his fate pledged on a die and in this shrine where all was like his love immaculate and beautiful he vowed a faith which had not been returned such is the madness of love such is the magic of beauty  music rose upon the air some huntsmen were practising their horns the triumphant strain elevated his high hopes the tender tone accorded with his emotions he paced up and down the terrace in excited reverie fed by the music in imagination she was with him she spoke she smiled she loved he gazed upon her beaming countenance his soul thrilled with tones which only she could utter he pressed her to his throbbing and tumultuous breast  the music stopped he fell from his seventh heaven he felt all the exhaustion of his prolonged reverie all was flat dull unpromising the moon seemed dim the stars were surely fading the perfume of the trees was faint the wind of the woods was a howling demon exhausted dispirited ay almost desperate with a darkened soul and staggering pace he regained his chamber     chapter xiv       pride has a fall  there is nothing more strange but nothing more certain than the different influence which the seasons of night and day exercise upon the moods of our minds him whom the moon sends to bed with a head full of misty meaning the sunwill summon in the morning with a brain clear and lucid as his beam twilight makes us pensive aurora is the goddess of activity despair curses at midnight hope blesses at noon  and the bright beams of phoebuswhy should this good old name be forgottencalled up our duke rather later than a monk at matins in a less sublime disposition than that in which he had paced among the orangetrees of dacre his passion remained but his poetry was gone he was all confidence and gaiety and love and panted for the moment when he could place his mothers coronet on the only head that was worthy to share the proud fortunes of the house of hauteville  luigi i will rise what is going on today the gentlemen are all out your grace  and the ladies  are going to the archery ground your grace  ah she will be there luigi  yes your grace  my robe luigi  yes your grace  i forgot what i was going to say luigi  yes your grace  luigi luigi luigi hummed the duke perfectly unconscious and beating time with his brush his valet stared but more when his lord with eyes fixed on the ground fell into a soliloquy not a word of which most provokingly was audible except to my reader  how beautiful she looked yesterday upon the keep when she tried to find dacre i never saw such eyes in my life i must speak to lawrence immediately i think i must have her face painted in four positions like that picture of lady alice gordon by sir joshua her full face is sublime and yet there is a piquancy in the profile which i am not sureand yet again when her countenance is a little bent towards you and her neck gently turned i think that is after allbut then when her eyes meet yours full oh yes yes yes that first look at doncaster it is impressed upon my brain like selfconsciousness i never can forget it but then her smile when she sang on tuesday night by heavens he exclaimed aloud life with such a creature is immortality  about one oclock the duke descended into empty chambers not a soul was to be seen the birds had flown he determined to go to the archery ground he opened the door of the musicroom  he found miss dacre alone at a table writing she looked up and his heart yielded as her eye met his  you do not join the nymphs asked the duke  i have lent my bow she said to an able substitute  she resumed her task which he perceived was copying music he advanced he seated himself at the table and began playing with a pen he gazed upon her his soul thrilled with unwonted sensations his frame shook with emotions which for a moment deprived him even of speech at length he spoke in a low and tremulous tone  i fear i am disturbing you miss dacre  by no means she said with a courteous air and then remembering she was a hostess is there anything that you require  much more than i can hope o miss dacre suffer me to tell you how much i admire how much i love you  she started she stared at him with distended eyes and her small mouth was open like a ring  my lord  yes he continued in a rapid and impassioned tone i at length find an opportunity of giving way to feelings which it has been long difficult for me to control o beautiful being tell me tell me that i am blessed  my lord ii am most honoured pardon me if i say most surprised  yes from the first moment that your ineffable loveliness rose on my vision my mind has fed upon your image our acquaintance has only realised of your character all that my imagination had preconceived such unrivalled beauty such unspeakable grace could only have been the companions of that exquisite taste and that charming delicacy which even to witness has added great felicity to my existence oh tell metell me that they shall be for me something better than a transient spectacle condescend to share the fortune and the fate of one who only esteems his lot in life because it enables him to offer you a station not utterly unworthy of your transcendent excellence  i have permitted your grace to proceed too far for yourfor my own sake i should sooner have interfered but in truth i was so astounded at your unexpected address that i have but just succeeded in recalling my scattered senses let me again express to you my acknowledgments for an honour which i feel is great but permit me to regret that for your offer of your hand and fortune these acknowledgments are all i can return  miss dacre am i then to wake to the misery of being rejected  a little week ago duke of st james we were strangers it would be hard if it were in the power of either of us now to deliver the other to misery  you are offended then at the presumption which on so slight an acquaintance has aspired to your hand it is indeed a high possession i thought only of you not of myself your perfections require no time for recognition perhaps my imperfections require time for indulgence let me then hope  you have misconceived my meaning and i regret that a foolish phrase should occasion you the trouble of fresh solicitude and me the pain of renewed refusal in a word it is not in my power to accept your hand  he rose from the table and stifled the groan which struggled in his throat he paced up and down the room with an agitated step and a convulsed brow which marked the contest of his passions but he was not desperate his heart was full of high resolves and mighty meanings indefinite but great he felt like some conqueror who marking the battle going against him proud in his infinite resources and invincible power cannot credit the madness of a defeat and the lady she leant her head upon her delicate arm and screened her countenance from his scrutiny  he advanced  miss dacre pardon this prolonged intrusion forgive this renewed discourse but let me only hope that a more favoured rival is the cause of my despair and i will thank you  my lord duke she said looking up with a faint blush but with a flashing eye and in an audible and even energetic tone the question you ask is neither fair nor manly but as you choose to press me i will say that it requires no recollection of a third person to make me decline the honour which you intended me  miss dacre you speak in anger almost in bitterness believe me he added rather with an air of pique had i imagined from your conduct towards me that i was an object of dislike i would have spared you this inconvenience and myself this humiliation  at castle dacre my conduct to all its inmates is the same the duke of st james indeed hath both hereditary and personal claims to be considered here as something better than a mere inmate but your grace has elected to dissolve all connection with our house and i am not desirous of assisting you in again forming any  harsh words miss dacre  harsher truth my lord duke said miss dacre rising from her seat and twisting a pen with agitated energy you have prolonged this interview not i let it end for i am not skilful in veiling my mind and i should regret here at least to express what i have hitherto succeeded in concealing  it cannot end thus said his grace let me at any rate know the worst you have if not too much kindness at least too much candour to part sol i am at a loss to understand said miss dacre what other object our conversation can have for your grace than to ascertain my feelings which i have already declared more than once upon a point which you have already more than once urged if i have not been sufficiently explicit or sufficiently clear let me tell you sir that nothing but the request of a parent whom i adore would have induced me even to speak to the person who had dared to treat him with contempt miss dacre  you are moved or you affect to be moved tis well if a word from a stranger can thus affect you you may be better able to comprehend the feelings of that person whose affections you have so long outraged your equal in blood duke of st james your superior in all other respects  beautiful being said his grace advancing falling on his knee and seizing her hand pardon pardon pardon like your admirable sire forgive cast into oblivion all remembrance of my fatal youth is not your anger is not this moment a bitter an utter expiation for all my folly all my thoughtless all my inexperienced folly for it was no worse on my knees and in the face of heaven let me pray you to be mine i have staked my happiness upon this venture in your power is my fate on you it depends whether i shall discharge my duty to society to the country to which i owe so much or whether i shall move in it without an aim an object or a hope think think only of the sympathy of our dispositions the similarity of our tastes think think only of the felicity that might be ours think of the universal good we might achieve is there anything that human reason could require that we could not command any object which human mind could imagine that we could not obtain and as for myself i swear that i will be the creature of your will nay nay oaths are mockery vows are idle is it possible to share existence with you beloved girl without watching for your every wish without  my lord duke this must end you do not recommend yourself to me by this rhapsody what do you know of me that you should feel all this i may be different from what you expected that is all another week and another woman may command a similar effusion i do not believe you to be insincere there would be more hope for you if you were you act from impulse and not from principle this is your best excuse for your conduct to my father it is one that i accept but which will certainly ever prevent me from becoming your wife farewell nay nay let us not part in enmity enmity and friendship are strong words words that are much abused there is another which must describe our feelings towards the majority of mankind and mine towards you substitute for enmity indifference  she quitted the room he remained there for some minutes leaning on the mantelpiece and then rushed into the park he hurried for some distance with the rapid and uncertain step which betokens a tumultuous and disordered mind at length he found himself among the ruins of dacre abbey the silence and solemnity of the scene made him conscious by the contrast of his own agitated existence the desolation of the beautiful ruin accorded with his own crushed and beautiful hopes he sat himself at the feet of the clustered columns and covering his face with his hands he wept  they were the first tears that he had shed since childhood and they were agony men weep but once but then their tears are blood we think almost their hearts must crack a little so heartless are they ever after enough of this  it is bitter to leave our fathers hearth for the first time bitter is the eve of our return when a thousand fears rise in our haunted souls bitter are hope deferred and selfreproach and power unrecognised bitter is poverty bitterer still is debt it is bitter to be neglected it is more bitter to be misunderstood it is bitter to lose an only child it is bitter to look upon the land which once was ours bitter is a sisters woe a brothers scrape bitter a mothers tear and bitterer still a fathers curse bitter are a briefless bag a curates bread a diploma that brings no fee bitter is halfpay  it is bitter to muse on vanished youth it is bitter to lose an election or a suit bitter are rage suppressed vengeance unwreaked and prizemoney kept back bitter are a failing crop a glutted market and a shattering spec bitter are rents in arrear and tithes in kind bitter are salaries reduced and perquisites destroyed bitter is a tax particularly if misapplied a rate particularly if embezzled bitter is a trade too full and bitterer still a trade that has worn out bitter is a bore  it is bitter to lose ones hair or teeth it is bitter to find our annual charge exceed our income it is bitter to hear of others fame when we are boys it is bitter to resign the seals we fain would keep it is bitter to hear the winds blow when we have ships at sea or friends bitter are a broken friendship and a dying love bitter a woman scorned a man betrayed  bitter is the secret woe which none can share bitter are a brutal husband and a faithless wife a silly daughter and a sulky son bitter are a losing card a losing horse bitter the public hiss the private sneer bitter are old age without respect manhood without wealth youth without fame bitter is the east winds blast bitter a stepdames kiss it is bitter to mark the woe which we cannot relieve it is bitter to die in a foreign land  but bitterer far than this than these than all is waking from our first delusion for then we first feel the nothingness of self that hell of sanguine spirits all is dreary blank and cold the sun of hope sets without a ray and the dim night of dark despair shadows only phantoms the spirits that guard round us in our pride have gone fancy weeping flies imagination droops her glittering pinions and sinks into the earth courage has no heart and love seems a traitor a busy demon whispers in our ear that all is vain and worthless and we among the vainest of a worthless crew  and so our young friend here now depreciated as much as he had before exaggerated his powers there seemed not on the earths face a more forlorn a more feeble a less estimable wretch than himself but just now a hero o what a fool what a miserable contemptible fool was he with what a light tongue and lighter heart had he spoken of this woman who despised who spurned him his face blushed ay burnt at the remembrance of his reveries and his fond monologues the very recollection made him shudder with disgust he looked up to see if any demon were jeering him among the ruins  his heart was so crushed that hope could not find even one desolate chamber to smile in his courage was so cowed that far from indulging in the distant romance to which under these circumstances we sometimes fly he only wondered at the absolute insanity which for a moment had permitted him to aspire to her possession sympathy of dispositions similarity of tastes forsooth why we are different existences nature could never have made us for the same world or with the same clay o consummate being why why did we meet why why are my eyes at length unsealed why why do i at length feel conscious of my utter worthlessness o god i am miserable he arose and hastened to the house he gave orders to luigi and his people to follow him to rosemount with all practicable speed and having left a note for his host with the usual excuse he mounted his horse and in half an hours time with a countenance like a stormy sea was galloping through the park gates of dacre     book iii     chapter i       if she be not fair for me  the day after the arrival of the duke of st james at cleve park his host sir lucius grafton received the following note from mrs dallington vere   castle dacre 182  my dear baronet  your pigeon has flown otherwise i should have tied this under his wing for i take it for granted he is trained too dexterously to alight anywhere but at cleve  i confess that in this affair your penetration has exceeded mine i hope throughout it will serve you as well i kept my promise and arrived here only a few hours after him the prejudice which i had long observed in the little dacre against your protégé was too marked to render any interference on my part at once necessary nor did i anticipate even beginning to give her good advice for a month to come heaven knows what a month of his conduct might have done a month achieves such wonders and to do him justice he was most agreeable but our young gentleman grew impetuous and so the day before yesterday he vanished and in the most extraordinary manner sudden departure unexpected business letter and servants both left behind monsieur grave and a little astonished and the demoiselle thoughtful at the least but not curious very suspicious this last circumstance a flash crossed my mind but i could gain nothing even with my most dexterous wiles from the little dacre who is a most unmanageable heroine however with the good assistance of a person who in a french tragedy would figure as my confidante and who is the sister of your lachen something was learnt from monsieur le valet to say nothing of the page all agree a countenance pale as death orders given in a low voice of suppressed passion and sundry oaths i hear he sulked the night at rosemount  now my good lucy listen to me lose no time about the great object if possible let this autumn be distinguished you have an idea that our friend is a very manageable sort of personage in phrase less courteous is sufficiently weak for all reasonable purposes i am not quite so clear about this he is at present very young and his character is not formed but there is a something about him which makes me half fear that if you permit his knowledge of life to increase too much you may quite fear having neglected my admonitions at present his passions are high use his blood while it is hot and remember that if you count on his rashness you may as nearly in the present instance yourself rue it in a word despatch the deed that is done you know  my kindest remembrances to dear lady afy and tell her how much i regret i cannot avail myself of her most friendly invitation considering as i know she hates me i really do feel flattered  you cannot conceive what vandals i am at present among nothing but my sincere regard for you my muchvalued friend would induce me to stay here a moment i have received from the countenance of the dacres all the benefit which a marked connection with so respectable and so moral a family confers and i am tired to death but it is a welldevised plan to have a reserve in the battles of society you understand me and i am led to believe that it has had the best effect and silenced even the loudest confound their politics as dear little squib says from whom i had the other day the funniest letter which i have half a mind to send you only you figure in it so much  burlington is at brighton and all my friends except yourself i have a few barbarians to receive at dallington and then i shall be off there join us as quickly as you can do you know i think that it would be an excellent locale for the scena we might drive them over to dieppe only do not put off your visit too long or else there will be no steamers  the duke of shropshire has had a fit but rallied he vows he was only picking up a letter or tying his shoestring or something of that kind but ruthven says he dined off boudins à la sefton and that after a certain age you know  lord darrell is with annesley and co i understand most friendly towards me which is pleasant and charles who is my firm ally takes care to confirm the kind feeling i am glad about this  felix crawlegh or crawley as some say has had an affair with tommy seymour at grants felix was grand about porter or something which he never drank and all that tommy who knew nothing about the brewing father asked him very innocently why malt liquors had so degenerated conceive the agony particularly as lady selina is said to have no violent aversion to quartering her arms with a mashtub argent  the macaronis are most hospitable this year and the marquess says that the only reason that they kept in before was because he was determined to see whether economy was practicable he finds it is not so now expense is no object  augustus henley is about to become a senator what do you think of this he says he has tried everything for an honest livelihood and even once began a novel but could not get on which squib says is odd because there is a receipt going about for that operation which saves all trouble  take a pair of pistols and a pack of cards a cookerybook and a set of new quadrilles mix them up with half an intrigue and a whole marriage and divide them into three equal portions now as augustus has both fought and gamed dined and danced i suppose it was the morality which posed him or perhaps the marriage  they say there is something about lady flutter but i should think all talk most probably a report set about by her ladyship lord flame has been blackballed that is certain but there is no more news except that the wiltshires are going to the continent we know why and that the spankers are making more dash than ever god knows how adieu  b d v   the letter ended all things end at last a shecorrespondent for our money provided always that she does not cross  our dukein spite of his disgrace he still is ours and yours too i hope gentlest readerour duke found himself at cleve park again in a different circle from the one to which he had been chiefly accustomed the sporting world received him with open arms with some of these worthies as owner of sanspareil he had become slightly acquainted but what is half a morning at tattersalls or half a week at doncaster compared with a meeting at newmarket there your congenial spirits congregate freemasons every man of them no uninitiated wretch there dares to disturb with his profane presence the hallowed mysteries there the race is not a peg to hang a few days of dissipation on but a sacred ceremony to the celebration of which all men and all circumstances tend and bend no balls no concerts no public breakfasts no bands from litolf no singers from welsh no pineapples from gunter are there called for by thoughtless thousands who have met not from any affection for the turfs delights or their neighbours cash but to sport their splendid liveries and to disport their showy selves  the house was full of men whose talk was full of bets the women were not as bad but they were not plentiful some lords and signors were there without their dames lord bloomerly for instance alone or rather with his eldest son lord bloom just of age and already a knowing hand his father introduced him to all his friends with that smiling air of selfcontent which men assume when they introduce a youth who may show the world what they were at his years so the earl presented the young viscount as a lover presents his miniature to his mistress lady afy shone in unapproached perfection a dull marchioness a gauche viscountess and some other dames who did not look like the chorus of this diana acted as capital foils and permitted her to meet her cavalier under what are called the most favourable auspices  they dined and discussed the agricultural interest in all its exhausted ramifications wheat was sold over again even at a higher price poachers were recalled to life or from beyond seas to be rekilled or retransported the poorlaws were a very rich topic and the poor lands a very ruinous one but all this was merely the light conversation just to vary in an agreeable mode which all could understand the regular material of discourse and that was of stakes and stallions pedigrees and plates  our party rose early for their pleasure was their business here were no lounging dandies and no exclusive belles who kept their bowers until hunger which also drives down wolves from the pyrenees brought them from their mystical chambers to luncheon and to life in short an air of interest a serious and a thoughtful look pervaded every countenance fashion was kicked to the devil and they were all too much in earnest to have any time for affectation breakfast was over and it was a regular meal at which all attended and they hurried to the course it seems when the party arrive that they are the only spectators a party or two come on to keep them company a club discharges a crowd of gentlemen a stable a crowd of grooms at length a sprinkling of human beings is collected but all is wondrous still and wondrous cold the only thing that gives sign of life is lord breedalls movable stand and the only intimation that fire is still an element is the sailing breath of a stray cigar  this then is newmarket exclaimed the young duke if it required fiveandtwenty thousand pounds to make doncaster amusing a plum at least will go in rendering newmarket endurable  but the young duke was wrong there was a fine race and the connoisseurs got enthusiastic sir lucius grafton was the winner the duke sympathised with his friends success  he began galloping about the course and his blood warmed he paid a visit to sanspareil he heard his steed was still a favourite for a coming race he backed his steed and sanspareil won he began to find newmarket not so disagreeable in a word our friend was in an entirely new scene which was exactly the thing he required he was interested and forgot or rather forcibly expelled from his mind his late overwhelming adventure he grew popular with the set his courteous manners his affable address his gay humour and the facility with which he adopted their tone and temper joined with his rank and wealth subdued the most rugged and the coldest hearts even the jockeys were civil to him and welcomed him with a sweet smile and gracious nod instead of the sour grin and malicious wink with which those characters generally greet a stranger those mysterious characters who in their influence over their superiors and their total want of sympathy with their species are our only match for the oriental eunuch  he grew we say popular with the set they were glad to see among them a young nobleman of spirit he became a member of the jockey club and talked of taking a place in the neighbourhood all recommended the step and assured him of their readiness to dine with him as often as he pleased he was a universal favourite and even chuck farthing the gentleman jockey with a cockeye and a knowing shake of his head squeaked out in a sporting treble one of his monstrous fudges about the prince in days of yore and swore that like his royal highness the young duke made the market all alive  the heart of our hero was never insensible to flattery he could not refrain from comparing his present with his recent situation the constant consideration of all around him the affectionate cordiality of sir lucius and the unobtrusive devotion of lady afy melted his soul these agreeable circumstances graciously whispered to him each hour that he could scarcely be the desolate and despicable personage which lately in a moment of madness he had fancied himself he began to indulge the satisfactory idea that a certain person however unparalleled in form and mind had perhaps acted with a little precipitation then his eyes met those of lady aphrodite and full of these feelings he exchanged a look which reminded him of their first meeting though now mellowed by gratitude and regard and esteem it was perhaps even more delightful he was loved and he was loved by an exquisite being who was the object of universal admiration what could he desire more nothing but the wilfulness of youth could have induced him for a moment to contemplate breaking chains which had only been formed to secure his felicity he determined to bid farewell for ever to the impetuosity of youth he had not been three days under the roof of cleve before he felt that his happiness depended upon its fairest inmate you see then that absence is not always fatal to love     chapter ii       fresh entanglements  his grace completed his stud and became one of the most distinguished votaries of the turf sir lucius was the inspiring divinity upon this occasion our hero like all young men and particularly young nobles did everything in extremes and extensive arrangements were made by himself and his friend for the ensuing campaign sir lucius was to reap half the profit and to undertake the whole management the duke was to produce the capital and to pocket the whole glory thus rolled on some weeks at the end of which our hero began to get a little tired he had long ago recovered all his selfcomplacency and if the form of may dacre ever flitted before his vision for an instant he clouded it over directly by the apparition of a bet or thrust it away with that desperate recklessness with which we expel an ungracious thought the duke sighed for a little novelty christmas was at hand he began to think that a regular country christmas must be a sad bore lady afy too was rather exigeante it destroys ones nerves to be amiable every day to the same human being she was the best creature in the world but cambridgeshire was not a pleasant county he was most attached but there was not another agreeable woman in the house he would not hurt her feelings for the world but his own were suffering desperately he had no idea that he ever should get so entangled brighton they say is a pleasant place  to brighton he went and although the graftons were to follow him in a fortnight still even these fourteen days were a holiday it is extraordinary how hourly and how violently change the feelings of an inexperienced young man  sir lucius however was disappointed in his brighton trip ten days after the departure of the young duke the county member died sir lucius had been long maturing his pretensions to the vacant representation he was strongly supported for he was a personal favourite and his family had claims but he was violently opposed for a novus homo was ambitious and the baronet was poor sir lucius was a man of violent passions and all feelings and considerations immediately merged in his paramount ambition his wife too at this moment was an important personage she was generally popular she was beautiful highly connected and highly considered her canvassing was a great object she canvassed with earnestness and with success for since her consolatory friendship with the duke of st james her character had greatly changed and she was now as desirous of conciliating her husband and the opinion of society as she was before disdainful of the one and fearless of the other sir lucius and lady aphrodite grafton were indeed on the best possible terms and the whole county admired his conjugal attentions and her wifelike affections  the duke who had no influence in this part of the world and who was not at all desirous of quitting brighton compensated for his absence at this critical moment by a friendly letter and the offer of his purse by this good aid his wifes attractions and his own talents sir lucy succeeded and by the time parliament had assembled he was returned member for his native county  in the meantime his friend had been spending his time at brighton in a far less agitated manner but in its way not less successful for he was amused and therefore gained his object as much as the baronet the duke liked brighton much without the bore of an establishment he found himself among many agreeable friends living in an unostentatious and impromptu though refined and luxurious style one day a new face another day a new dish another day a new dance successively interested his feelings particularly if the face rode which they all do the dish was at sir george saucevilles and the dance at the duke of burlingtons so time flew on between a canter to rottindean the flavours of a perigord and the blunders of the mazurka  but february arrived and this agreeable life must end the philosophy of society is so practical that it is not allowed even to a young duke absolutely to trifle away existence duties will arise in spite of our best endeavours and his grace had to roll up to town to dine with the premier and to move the address     chapter iii       a new star rises  another season had arrived another of those magical periods of which one had already witnessed his unparalleled triumphs and from which he had derived such exquisite delight to his surprise he viewed its arrival without emotion if with any feeling with disgust  he had quaffed the cup too eagerly the draught had been delicious but time also proved that it had been satiating was it possible for his vanity to be more completely gratified than it had been was it possible for victories to be more numerous and more unquestioned during the coming campaign than during the last had not his life then been one long triumph who had not offered their admiration who had not paid homage to his allacknowledged empire yet even this career however dazzling had not been pursued even this success however brilliant had not been attained without some effort and some weariness also some exhaustion often as he now remembered had his head ached more than once as now occurred to him had his heart faltered even his first season had not passed over without his feeling lone in the crowded saloon or starting at the supernatural finger in the banquetinghall yet then he was the creature of excitement who pursued an end which was as indefinite as it seemed to be splendid all had now happened that could happen he drooped he required the impulse which we derive from an object unattained  yet had he exhausted life at twoandtwenty this must not be his feelings must be more philosophically accounted for he began to suspect that he had lived too much for the world and too little for himself that he had sacrificed his ease to the applause of thousands and mistaken excitement for enjoyment his memory dwelt with satisfaction on the hours which had so agreeably glided away at brighton in the choice society of a few intimates he determined entirely to remodel the system of his life and with the sanguine impetuosity which characterised him he at the same moment felt that he had at length discovered the road to happiness and determined to pursue it without the loss of a precious moment  the duke of st james was seen less in the world and he appeared but seldom at the various entertainments which he had once so adorned yet he did not resign his exalted position in the world of fashion but on the contrary adopted a course of conduct which even increased his consideration he received the world not less frequently or less splendidly than heretofore and his magnificent mansion early in the season was opened to the favoured crowd yet in that mansion which had been acquired with such energy and at such cost its lord was almost as strange and certainly not as pleased an inmate as the guests who felt their presence in his chambers a confirmation or a creation of their claims to the worlds homage the alhambra was finished and there the duke of st james entirely resided but its regal splendour was concealed from the prying eye of public curiosity with a proud reserve a studied secrecy and stately haughtiness becoming a caliph a small band of initiated friends alone had the occasional entrée and the mysterious air which they provokingly assumed whenever they were crossexamined on the internal arrangements of this mystical structure only increased the number and the wildness of the incidents which daily were afloat respecting the fantastic profusion and scientific dissipation of the youthful sultan and his envied viziers  the town ever since the season commenced had been in feverish expectation of the arrival of a new singer whose fame had heralded her presence in all the courts of christendom whether she were an italian or a german a gaul or a greek was equally unknown an air of mystery environed the most celebrated creature in europe there were odd whispers of her parentage every potentate was in turn entitled to the gratitude of mankind for the creation of this marvel now it was an emperor now a king a grand duke then put in his claim and then an archduke today she was married tomorrow she was single today her husband was a prince incog tomorrow a drummajor well known even her name was a mystery and she was known and worshipped throughout the whole civilised world by the mere title of the bird of paradise  about a month before easter telegraphs announced her arrival the admiralty yacht was too late she determined to make her first appearance at the opera and not only the young duke but even a far more exalted personage was disappointed in the sublime idea of anticipating the public opinion by a private concert she was to appear for the first time on tuesday the house of commons adjourned  the curtain is drawn up and the house is crowded everybody is there who is anybody protocoli looking as full of fate as if the french were again on the danube macaroni as full of himself as if no other being were engrossing universal attention the premier appears far more anxious than he does at council and the duke of burlington arranges his fanlike screen with an agitation which for a moment makes him forget his unrivalled nonchalance even lady bloomerly is in suspense and even charles annesleys heart beats but ah or rather bah the enthusiasm of lady de courcy even the young guardsman who paid her ladyship for her ivory franks by his idle presence even he must have felt callous as those young guardsmen are  will that bore of a tenor ever finish that provoking aria that we have heard so often how drawlingly he drags on his dull deafening  Êccola  have you seen the primal dew ere the sun has lipped the pearl have you seen a summer fly with tinted wings of shifting light glance in the liquid noontide air have you marked a shooting star or watched a young gazelle at play then you have seen nothing fresher nothing brighter nothing wilder nothing lighter than the girl who stands before you she was infinitely small fair and bright her black hair was braided in madonnas over a brow like ivory a deep pure pink spot gave lustre to each cheek her features were delicate beyond a dream her nose quite straight with a nostril which would have made you crazy if you had not already been struck with idiocy by gazing on her mouth she a singer impossible she cannot speak and now we look again she must sing with her eyes they are so large and lustrous  the bird of paradise curtsied as if she shrunk under the overwhelming greeting and crossed her breast with arms that gleamed like moonbeams and hands that glittered like stars this gave time to the cognoscenti to remark her costume which was ravishing and to try to see her feet but they were too small at last lord squib announced that he had discovered them by a new glass and described them as a couple of diamondclaws most exquisitely finished  she moved her head with a faint smile as if she distrusted her powers and feared the assembly would be disappointed and then she shot forth a note which thrilled through every heart and nearly cracked the chandelier even lady fitzpompey said brava as she proceeded the audience grew quite frantic it was agreed on all hands that miracles had recommenced each air was sung only to call forth fresh exclamations of miracolo and encores were as unmerciful as an usurper  amid all this rapture the young duke was not silent his box was on the stage and ever and anon the syren shot a glance which seemed to tell him that he was marked out amid this brilliant multitude each round of applause each roar of ravished senses only added a more fearful action to the wild purposes which began to flit about his graces mind his imagination was touched his old passion to be distinguished returned in full force this creature was strange mysterious celebrated her beauty her accomplishments were as singular and as rare as her destiny and her fame his reverie absolutely raged it was only disturbed by her repeated notice and his returned acknowledgments he arose in a state of mad excitation once more the slave or the victim of his intoxicated vanity he hurried behind the scenes he congratulated her on her success her genius and her beauty and to be brief within a week of her arrival in our metropolis the bird of paradise was fairly caged in the alhambra     chapter iv       the bird is caged  hitherto the duke of st james had been a celebrated personage but his fame had been confined to the two thousand brahmins who constitute the world his patronage of the signora extended his celebrity in a manner which he had not anticipated and he became also the hero of the ten or twelve or fifteen millions of pariahs for whose existence philosophers have hitherto failed to adduce a satisfactory cause  the duke of st james was now in the comprehensive sense of the phrase a public character some choice spirits took the hint from the public feeling and determined to dine on the public curiosity a sunday journal was immediately established of this epic our duke was the hero his manners his sayings his adventures regularly regaled on each holy day the protestant population of this protestant empire who in france or italy or even germany faint at the sight of a peasantry testifying their gratitude for a day of rest by a dance or a tune sketches of the alhambra soupers in the regents park the court of the caliph the bird cage c c c were duly announced and duly devoured this journal being solely devoted to the illustration of the life of a single and a private individual was appropriately entitled the universe its contributors were eminently successful their pure inventions and impure details were accepted as delicate truth and their ferocious familiarity with persons with whom they were totally unacquainted demonstrated at the same time their knowledge both of the forms and the personages of polite society  at the first announcement of this hebdomadal his grace was a little annoyed and noctes hautevillienses made him fear treason but when he had read a number he entirely acquitted any person of a breach of confidence on the whole he was amused a variety of ladies in time were introduced with many of whom the duke had scarcely interchanged a bow but the respectable editor was not up to lady afy  if his grace however were soon reconciled to this not very agreeable notoriety and consoled himself under the activity of his libellers by the conviction that their prolusions did not even amount to a caricature he was less easily satisfied with another performance which speedily advanced its claims to public notice  there is an unavoidable reaction in all human affairs the duke of st james had been so successfully attacked that it became worth while successfully to defend him and another sunday paper appeared the object of which was to maintain the silver side of the shield here everything was couleur de rose one week the duke saved a poor man from the serpentine another a poor woman from starvation now an orphan was grateful and now miss zouch impelled by her necessity and his reputation addressed him a column and a half quite heartrending parents with nine children nine children without parents clergymen most improperly unbeneficed officers most wickedly reduced widows of younger sons of quality sacrificed to the colonies sisters of literary men sacrificed to national works which required his patronage to appear daughters who had known better days but somehow or other had not been so well acquainted with their parents all advanced with multiplied petitions and that hackneyed heartless air of misery which denotes the mumper his grace was infinitely annoyed and scarcely compensated for the inconvenience by the prettiest little creature in the world who one day forced herself into his presence to solicit the honour of dedicating to him her poems  he had enough on his hands so he wrote her a cheque and with a courtesy which must have made sappho quite desperate put her out of the room  we forgot to say that the name of the new journal was the new world the new world is not quite so big as the universe but then it is as large as all the other quarters of the globe together the worst of this business was the universe protested that the duke of st james like a second canning had called this new world into existence which was too bad because in truth he deprecated its discovery scarcely less than the venetians  having thus managed in the course of a few weeks to achieve the reputation of an unrivalled roué our hero one night betook himself to almacks a place where his visits this season were both shorter and less frequent  many an anxious mother gazed upon him as he passed with an eye which longed to pierce futurity many an agitated maiden looked exquisitely unembarrassed while her fluttering memory feasted on the sweet thought that at any rate another had not captured this unrivalled prize perhaps she might be the anson to fall upon this galleon it was worth a long cruise and even a chance of shipwreck  he danced with lady aphrodite because since the affair of the signora he was most punctilious in his attentions to her particularly in public that affair of course she passed over in silence though it was bitter she however had had sufficient experience of man to feel that remonstrance is a last resource and usually an ineffectual one it was something that her rivalnot that her ladyship dignified the bird by that titleit was something that she was not her equal that she was not one with whom she could be put in painful and constant collision she tried to consider it a freak to believe only half she heard and to indulge the fancy that it was a toy which would soon tire as for sir lucius he saw nothing in this adventure or indeed in the alhambra system at all which militated against his ulterior views no one more constantly officiated at the ducal orgies than himself both because he was devoted to selfgratification and because he liked ever to have his protégé in sight he studiously prevented any other individual from becoming the petronius of the circle his deep experience also taught him that with a person of the young dukes temper the mode of life which he was now leading was exactly the one which not only would insure but even hurry the catastrophe his faithful friend so eagerly desired his pleasures as sir lucius knew would soon pall for he easily perceived that the duke was not heartless enough for a roué when thorough satiety is felt young men are in the cue for desperate deeds looking upon happiness as a dream or a prize which in lifes lottery they have missed worn hipped dissatisfied and desperate they often hurry on a result which they disapprove merely to close a miserable career or to brave the society with which they cannot sympathise  the duke however was not yet sated as after a feast when we have despatched a quantity of wine there sometimes as it were arises a second appetite unnatural to be sure but very keen so in a career of dissipation when our passion for pleasure appears to be exhausted the fatal fancy of man like a wearied hare will take a new turn throw off the hellhounds of ennui and course again with renewed vigour  and tonight the duke of st james was as he had been for some weeks all life and fire and excitement and his eye was even now wandering round the room in quest of some consummate spirit whom he might summon to his saracenic paradise  a consummate spirit his eye lighted on there stood may dacre he gasped for breath he turned pale it was only for a moment and his emotion was unperceived there she stood beautiful as when she first glanced before him there she stood with all her imperial graces and all surrounding splendour seemed to fade away before her dazzling presence like mournful spirits of a lower world before a radiant creature of the sky  she was speaking with her sunlight smile to a young man whose appearance attracted his notice he was dressed entirely in black rather short but slenderly made sallow but clear with long black curls and a murillo face and looked altogether like a young jesuit or a venetian official by giorgone or titian his countenance was reserved and his manner not easy yet on the whole his face indicated intellect and his figure blood the features haunted the dukes memory he had met this person before there are some countenances which when once seen can never be forgotten and the young man owned one of these the duke recalled him to his memory with a pang  our herolet him still be ours for he is rather desolate and he requires the backing of his friendsour hero behaved pretty well he seized the first favourable opportunity to catch miss dacres eye and was grateful for her bow emboldened he accosted her and asked after mr dacre she was courteous but unembarrassed her calmness however piqued him sufficiently to allow him to rally he was tolerably easy and talked of calling their conversation lasted only for a few minutes and was fortunately terminated without his withdrawal which would have been awkward the young man whom we have noticed came up to claim her hand  arundel dacre or my eyes deceive me said the young duke i always consider an old etonian a friend and therefore i address you without ceremony  the young man accepted but not with readiness the offered hand he blushed and spoke but in a hesitating and husky voice then he cleared his throat and spoke again but not much more to the purpose then he looked to his partner whose eyes were on the ground and rose as he endeavoured to catch them for a moment he was silent again then he bowed slightly to miss dacre and solemnly to the duke and then he carried off his cousin  poor dacre said the duke he always had the worst manner in the world not in the least changed  his grace wandered into the tearoom a knot of dandies were in deep converse he heard his own name and that of the duke of burlington then came doncaster beauty dont you know oh yes all quite mad c c c as he passed he was invited in different ways to join the coterie of his admirers but he declined the honour and passed them with that icy hauteur which he could assume and which judiciously used contributed not a little to his popularity  he could not conquer his depression and although it was scarcely past midnight he determined to disappear fortunately his carriage was waiting he was at a loss what to do with himself he dreaded even to be alone the signora was at a private concert and she was the last person whom at this moment he cared to see his low spirits rapidly increased he got terribly nervous and felt miserable at last he drove to whites  the house had just broken up and the political members had just entered and in clusters some standing and some yawning some stretching their arms and some stretching their legs presented symptoms of an escape from boredom among others round the fire was a young man dressed in a rough great coat all cords and sables with his hat bent aside a shawl tied round his neck with boldness and a huge oaken staff clenched in his left hand with the other he held the courier and reviewed with a critical eye the report of the speech which he had made that afternoon this was lord darrell  we have always considered the talents of younger brothers as an unanswerable argument in favour of a providence lord darrell was the younger son of the earl of darleyford and had been educated for a diplomatist a report some two years ago had been very current that his elder brother then lord darrell was against the consent of his family about to be favoured with the hand of mrs dallington vere certain it is he was a devoted admirer of that lady of that lady however a less favoured rival chose one day to say that which staggered the romance of the impassioned youth in a moment of rashness impelled by sacred feelings it is reported at least for the whole is a mystery he communicated what he had heard with horror to the mistress of his destinies whatever took place certain it is lord darrell challenged the indecorous speaker and was shot through the heart the affair made a great sensation and the darleyfords and their connections said bitter things of mrs dallington and talked much of rash youth and subtle women of discreeter years and passions shamefully inflamed and purposes wickedly egged on we say nothing of all this nor will we dwell upon it mrs dallington vere assuredly was no slight sufferer but she conquered the cabal that was formed against her for the dandies were her friends and gallantly supported her through a trial under which some women would have sunk as it was at the end of the season she did travel but all is now forgotten and hill street berkeley square again contains at the moment of our story its brightest ornament  the present lord darrell gave up all idea of being an ambassador but he was clever and though he hurried to gratify a taste for pleasure which before had been too much mortified he could not relinquish the ambitious prospects with which he had during the greater part of his life consoled himself for his cadetship he piqued himself upon being at the same time a dandy and a statesman he spoke in the house and not without effect he was one of those who make themselves masters of great questions that is to say who read a great many reviews and newspapers and are full of others thoughts without ever having thought themselves he particularly prided himself upon having made his way into the alhambra set he was the only man of business among them the duke liked him for it is agreeable to be courted by those who are themselves considered  lord darrell was a favourite with women they like a little intellect he talked fluently on all subjects he was what is called a talented young man then he had mind and soul and all that the miracles of creation have long agreed that body without soul will not do and even a coxcomb in these days must be original or he is a bore no longer is such a character the mere creation of his tailor and his perfumer lord darrell was an avowed admirer of lady caroline st maurice and a great favourite with her parents who both considered him an oracle on the subjects which respectively interested them you might dine at fitzpompey house and hear his name quoted at both ends of the table by the host upon the state of europe and by the hostess upon the state of the season had it not been for the young duke nothing would have given lady fitzpompey greater pleasure than to have received him as a soninlaw but as it was he was only kept in store for the second string to cupids bow  lord darrell had just quitted the house in a costume which though rough was not less studied than the finished and elaborate toilet which in the course of an hour he will exhibit in the enchanted halls of almacks there he will figure to the last the most active and the most remarked and though after these continued exertions he will not gain his couch perhaps till seven our lord of the treasury for he is one will resume his official duties at an earlier hour than any functionary in the kingdom  yet our friend is a little annoyed now what is the matter he dilates to his uncle lord seymour temple a greyheaded placeman on the profligacy of the press what is this the virgilian line our orator introduced so felicitously is omitted he panegyrizes the mirror of parliament where he has no doubt the missing verse will appear the quotation was new timeo danaos  lord seymour temple begins a long story about fox and general fitzpatrick this is a signal for a general retreat and the bore as sir boyle roche would say like the last rose of summer remains talking to himself     chapter v       his graces rival  arundel dacre was the only child of mr dacres only and deceased brother and the heir to the whole of the dacre property his father a man of violent passions had married early in life against the approbation of his family and had revolted from the catholic communion the elder brother however mortified by this great deed which passion had prompted and not conscience had exerted his best offices to mollify their exasperated father and to reconcile the sire to the son but he had exerted them ineffectually and as is not unusual found after much harrowing anxiety and deep suffering that he was not even recompensed for his exertions and his sympathy by the gratitude of his brother the younger dacre was not one of those minds whose rashness and impetuosity are counterbalanced or rather compensated by a generous candour and an amiable remorse he was headstrong but he was obstinate he was ardent but he was sullen he was unwary but he was suspicious everyone who opposed him was his enemy all who combined for his preservation were conspirators his father whose feelings he had outraged and never attempted to soothe was a tyrant his brother who was devoted to his interests was a traitor  these were his living and his dying thoughts while he existed he was one of those men who because they have been imprudent think themselves unfortunate and mistake their diseased mind for an implacable destiny when he died his deathbed was consoled by the reflection that his persecutors might at last feel some compunction and he quitted the world without a pang because he flattered himself that his departure would cost them one  his father who died before him had left him no fortune and even had not provided for his wife or child his brother made another ineffectual attempt to accomplish a reconciliation but his proffers of love and fortune were alike scorned and himself insulted and arundel dacre seemed to gloat on the idea that he was an outcast and a beggar  yet even this strange being had his warm feelings he adored his wife particularly because his father had disowned her he had a friend whom he idolised and who treating his occasional conduct as a species of insanity had never deserted him this friend had been his college companion and in the odd chapter of circumstances had become a powerful political character dacre was a man of talent and his friend took care that he should have an opportunity of displaying it he was brought into parliament and animated by the desire as he thought of triumphing over his family he exerted himself with success but his infernal temper spoiled all his active quarrels and his noisy brawls were even more endurable than his sullen suspicions his dark hints and his silent hate he was always offended and always offending such a man could never succeed as a politician a character who of all others must learn to endure to forget and to forgive he was soon universally shunned but his first friend was faithful though bitterly tried and dacre retired from public life on a pension  his wife had died and during the latter years of his life almost his only companion was his son he concentrated on this being all that ardent affection which had he diffused among his fellowcreatures might have ensured his happiness and his prosperity yet even sometimes he would look in his childs face with an anxious air as if he read incubating treason and then press him to his bosom with unusual fervour as if he would stifle the idea which alone was madness  this child was educated in an hereditary hate of the dacre family his uncle was daily painted as a tyrant whom he classed in his young mind with phalaris or dionysius there was nothing that he felt keener than his fathers wrongs and nothing which he believed more certain than his uncles wickedness he arrived at his thirteenth year when his father died and he was to be consigned to the care of that uncle  arundel dacre had left his son as a legacy to his friend but that friend was a man of the world and when the elder brother not only expressed his willingness to maintain the orphan but even his desire to educate and adopt him as his son he cheerfully resigned all his claims to the forlorn boy and felt that by consigning him to his uncle he had most religiously discharged the trust of his confiding friend  the nephew arrived at castle dacre with a heart equally divided between misery and hatred it seemed to him that a fate more forlorn than his had seldom been awarded to mortal although he found his uncle diametrically opposite to all that his misled imagination had painted him although he was treated with a kindness and indulgence which tried to compensate for their too long estranged affections arundel dacre could never conquer the impressions of his boyhood and had it not been for his cousin may a creature of whom he had not heard and of whom no distorted image had therefore haunted his disturbed imagination had it not been for this beautiful girl who greeted him with affection which warmed and won his heart so morbid were his feelings that he would in all probability have pined away under the roof which he should have looked upon as his own  his departure for eton was a relief as he grew up although his knowledge of life and man had long taught him the fallacy of his early feelings and although he now yielded a tear of pity rather than of indignation to the adored manes of his father his peculiar temper and his first education never allowed him entirely to emancipate himself from his hereditary feelings his character was combined of many and even of contrary qualities  his talents were great but his want of confidence made them more doubtful to himself than to the world yet at times in his solitary musings he perhaps even exaggerated his powers he was proud and yet worldly he never forgot that he was a dacre but he desired to be the architect of his own fortune and his very love of independence made him at an early period meditate on the means of managing mankind he was reserved and cold for his imagination required much yet he panted for a confidant and was one of those youths with whom friendship is a passion to conclude he was a protestant among catholics and although this circumstance inasmuch as it assisted him in the views which he had early indulged was not an ungracious one he felt that till he was distinguished it had lessened his consideration since he could not count upon the sympathy of hereditary connections and ancient party altogether he was one who with the consciousness of ancient blood the certainty of future fortune fine talents great accomplishments and not slight personal advantages was unhappy yet although not of a sanguine temper and occasionally delivered to the darkest spleen his intense ambition sustained him and he lived on the hope and sometimes on the conviction that a bright era would some day console him for the bitterness of his past and present life  at school and at college he equally distinguished himself and was everywhere respected and often regarded yet he had never found that friend on whom his fancy had often busied itself and which one whose alternations of feeling were so violent peremptorily required his uncle and himself viewed each other with mutual respect and regard but confidence did not exist between them mr dacre in spite of his long and constant efforts despaired of raising in the breast of his nephew the flame of filial love and had it not been for his daughter who was the only person in the world to whom arundel ever opened his mind and who could consequently throw some light upon his wants and wishes it would not have been in his power to evince to his nephew that this disappointment had not affected his uncles feelings in his favour  when his education was completed mr dacre had wished him to take up his residence in yorkshire and in every sense to act as his son as he was his successor but arundel declined this proposition he obtained from his fathers old political connection the appointment of attaché to a foreign embassy and he remained on the continent with the exception of a yearly visit to yorkshire three or four years but his views were not in the diplomatic line and this appointment only served as a political school until he could enter parliament may dacre had wormed from him his secret and worked with energy in his cause an opportunity appeared to offer itself and under the patronage of a catholic nobleman he was to appear as a candidate for an open borough it was on this business that he had returned to england     chapter vi       birds of a feather  we will go and make a morning call the garish light of day that never suits a chamber was broken by a muslin veil which sent its softened twilight through a room of moderate dimensions but of princely decoration and which opened into a conservatory the choice saloon was hung with rosecoloured silk which diffused a delicate tint over the inlaid and costly cabinets it was crowded with tables covered with bijouterie apparently however a road had been cut through the furniture by which you might wind your way up to the divinity of the temple a ravishing perfume which was ever changing wandered through the apartment now a violet breeze made you poetical now a rosy gale called you to love and ever and anon the strange but thrilling breath of some rare exotic summoned you like an angel to opening eden all was still and sweet save that a fountain made you as it were more conscious of silence save that the song of birds made you as it were more sensible of sweetness  upon a couch her small head resting upon an arm covered with bracelets which blazed like a soldans treasure reclined mrs dallington vere  she is in thought is her abstracted eye fixed in admiration upon that twinkling foot which clothed in its russian slipper looks like a serpents tongue small red and pointed or does a more serious feeling than selfadmiration inspire this musing ah a cloud courses over that pellucid brow tis gone but it frowned like the harbinger of a storm again a small but bloodred blush rises into that clear cheek it was momentary but its deep colour indicated that it came from the heart her eye lights up with a wild and glittering fire but the flash vanishes into darkness and gloom follows the unnatural light she clasps her hands she rises from an uneasy seat though supported by a thousand pillows and she paces the conservatory  a guest is announced it is sir lucius grafton  he salutes her with that studied courtesy which shows they are only friends but which when maintained between intimate acquaintance sometimes makes wicked people suspect that they once perhaps were more she resumes her seat and he throws himself into an easy chair which is opposite  your note i this moment received bertha and i am here you perceive that my fidelity is as remarkable as ever  we had a gay meeting last night  very much so so lady araminta has at last shown mercy  i cannot believe it  i have just had a note from challoner preliminary i suppose to my trusteeship you are not the only person who holds my talents for business in high esteem  but ballingford what will he say  that is his affair and as he never to my knowledge spoke to the purpose his remarks now i suppose are not fated to be much more apropos  yet he can say things we all know  yes yes we all know but nobody believes that is the motto of the present day and the only way to neutralise scandal and to counteract publicity  mrs dallington was silent and looked uneasy and her friend perceiving that although she had sent to him so urgent a billet she did not communicate expressed a little surprise  but you wish to see me bertha  i do very much and to speak to you for these many days i have intended it but i do not know how it is i have postponed and postponed our interview i begin to believe she added looking up with a faint smile i am half afraid to speak  good god said the baronet really alarmed you are in no trouble  oh no make yourself easy trouble trouble no no i am not exactly in trouble i am not in debt i am not in a scrape butbutbut i am in somethingsomething worse perhaps i am in love  the baronet looked puzzled he did not for a moment suspect himself to be the hero yet although their mutual confidence was illimitable he did not exactly see why in the present instance there had been such urgency to impart an event not altogether either unnatural or miraculous  in love said sir lucius a very proper situation for the prettiest woman in london everybody is in love with you and i heartily rejoice that some one of our favoured sex is about to avenge our sufferings  point de moquerie lucy i am miserable  dear little pigeon what is the matter  ah me  speakspeak said he in a gay tone you were not made for sighs but smiles begin  well then the young duke  the deuce said sir lucius alarmed  oh no make yourself easy said mrs dallington smiling no counterplot i assure you although really you do not deserve to succeed  then who is it eagerly asked sir lucius  you will not let me speak the young duke  damn the duke  how impatient you are lucy i must begin with the beginning well the young duke has something to do with it  pray be explicit  in a word then said mrs dallington in a low voice but with an expression of earnestness which sir lucius had never before remarked i am in love desperately in love with one whom hitherto in accordance with your wishes i have been driving into the arms of another our views our interests are opposite but i wish to act fairly if possible i wish to reconcile them and it is for this purpose that i have summoned you this morning  arundel dacre said sir lucius quietly and he rapped his cane on his boot the bloodred spot again rose in his companions cheek  there was silence for a moment sir lucius would not disturb it and mrs dallington again spoke  st james and the little dacre have again met you have my secret i do not ask your good services with arundel which i might at another time but you cannot expect me to work against myself depend then no longer on my influence with may dacre for to be explicit as we have always been most heartily should i rejoice to see her a duchess  the point bertha said sir lucius very quietly is not that i can no longer count upon you as an ally but i must i perceive reckon you an opponent  cannot we prevent this asked mrs dallington with energy  i see no alternative said sir lucius shaking his head with great unconcern time will prove who will have to congratulate the other  my friend said mrs dallington with briskness and decision no affectation between us drop this assumed unconcern you know you know well that no incident could occur to you at this moment more mortifying than the one i have communicated which deranges your plans and probably may destroy your views you cannot misconceive my motives in making this not very agreeable communication i might have pursued my object without your knowledge and permission in a word i might have betrayed you but with me every consideration has yielded to friendship i cannot forget how often and how successfully we have combined i should grieve to see our ancient and glorious alliance annulled i am yet in hopes that we may both obtain our objects through its medium  i am not aware said sir lucius with more feeling that i have given you any cause to complain of my want of candour we are in a difficult position i have nothing to suggest but i am ready to listen you know how ready i am to adopt all your suggestions and i know how seldom you have wanted an expedient  the little dacre then must not marry her cousin but we cannot flatter ourselves that such a girl will not want to marry some one i have a conviction that this is her decisive season she must be occupied in a word lucy some one must be found  the baronet started from his chair and nearly knocked down a table  confound your tables bertha said he in a pettish tone i can never consult in a room full of tables he walked into the conservatory and she followed him he seemed plunged in thought they were again silent suddenly he seized her hand and led her back to the sofa on which they both sat down  my dear friend he said in a tone of agitated solemnity i will conceal no longer from you what i have sometimes endeavoured to conceal from myself i love that girl to distraction you  yes to distraction ever since we first met her image has haunted me i endeavoured to crush a feeling which promised only to plunge me into anxiety and to distract my attention from my important objects but in vain in vain her unexpected appearance yesterday has revived my passion with triple fervour i have passed a sleepless night and rise with the determination to obtain her  you know your own power lucius better perhaps than i do or the world we rank it high none higher yet nevertheless i look upon this declaration as insanity  he raised her hand to his lips and pressed it with delicate warmth and summoned his most insinuating tone with your aid bertha i should not despair  lucy i am your friend perhaps your best friend but these dacres would it were anyone but a dacre no no this cannot be  bertha you know me better than the world i am a roué and you are my friend but believe me i am not quite so vain as to indulge for a moment in the idea that may dacre should be aught to me but what all might approve and all might honour yes i intend her for my wife  your wife you are indeed premature  not quite so premature as you perhaps imagine know then that the great point is on the eve of achievement urged by the information which afy thinks she unconsciously obtains from lachen and harrowed by the idea that i am about to tear her from england she has appealed to the duke in a manner to which they were both unused hitherto her docile temper has not permitted her to abuse her empire now she exerts her power with an energy to which he believed her a stranger he is staggered by his situation he at the same time repents having so rashly engaged the feelings of a woman and is flattered that he is so loved they have more than once consulted upon the expediency of an elopement  this is good news  o bertha you must feel like me before you can estimate it yes he clenched his fist with horrible energy there is no hell like a detested wife  they were again silent but when she thought that his emotion had subsided she again recalled their consideration to the object of their interview  you play a bold game indeed but it shall not fail from any deficiency on my part but how are we to proceed at present who is to interest the feelings of the little dacre at once  who but her future husband what i want you to do is this we shall call but prepare the house to receive us not only as acquaintances but as desirable intimates you know what to say i have an idea that the divine creature entertains no very unfavourable opinion of your obedient slave and with her temper i care not for what she will not probably hear the passing opinion of a third person i stand at present thanks to afy very high with the public and you know although my life has not the least altered that my indiscretions have now a dash of discretion in them and a reformed rake as all agree is the personification of morality prepare my way with the dacres and all will go right and as for this arundel i know him not but you have told me enough to make me consider him the most fortunate of men as for love between cousins i laugh at it a glance from you will extinguish the feeble flame as a sunbeam does a fire and for the rest the world does me the honour to believe that if lucius grafton be remarkable for one thing more than another it is for the influence he attains over young minds i will get acquainted with this boy and for once let love be unattended by doubt  long was their counsel the plans we have hinted at were analysed canvassed weighed and finally matured they parted after a long morning well aware of the difficulties which awaited their fulfilment but also full of hope     chapter vii       a dangerous guide  such able and congenial spirits as mrs dallington vere and sir lucius grafton prosecuted their plans with the success which they had a right to anticipate lady aphrodite who was proud of her previous acquaintance however slight with the most distinguished girl in london and eager to improve it unconsciously assisted their operations society is so constituted that it requires no little talent and no slight energy to repel the intimacy even of those whose acquaintance is evidently not desirable and there are many people in this world mixing apparently with great spirit and selfesteem in its concerns who really owe their constant appearance and occasional influence in circles of consideration to no other qualities than their own callous impudence and the indolence and the irresolution of their victims they who at the same time have no delicacy and no shame count fearful odds and much as is murmured about the false estimation of riches there is little doubt that the parvenus as often owe their advancement in society to their perseverance as to their pelf  when therefore your intimacy is courted by those whose intimacy is an honour and that too with an art which conceals its purpose you often find that you have and are a devoted friend really before you have felt sufficient gratitude for the operabox which has been so often lent the carriage which has been ever at hand the brother who has received such civilities or the father who has been requested to accept some of the unattainable tokay which he has charmed you by admiring at your own table  the manoeuvres and tactics of society are infinitely more numerous and infinitely finer than those of strategy woe betide the rash knight who dashes into the thick of the polished melée without some slight experience of his barb and his lance let him look to his arms he will do well not to appear before his helm be plumed with some reputation however slight he may be very rich or even very poor we have seen that answer with a belisariuslike air and more than one hero without an obolus has stumbled upon a fortune merely from his contempt of riches if to fight or write or dress be above you why then you can ride or dance or even skate but do not think as many young gentlemen are apt to believe that talking will serve your purpose that is the quicksand of your young beginners all can talk in a public assembly that is to say all can give us exhortations which do not move and arguments which do not convince but to converse in a private assembly is a different affair and rare are the characters who can be endured if they exceed a whisper to their neighbours but though mild and silent be ever ready with the rapier of repartee and be ever armed with the breastplate of good temper you will infallibly gather laurels if you add to these the spear of sarcasm and the shield of nonchalance  the high style of conversation where eloquence and philosophy emulate each other where principles are profoundly expounded and felicitously illustrated all this has ceased it ceased in this country with johnson and burke and it requires a johnson and a burke for its maintenance there is no mediocrity in such discourse no intermediate character between the sage and the bore the second style where men not things are the staple but where wit and refinement and sensibility invest even personal details with intellectual interest does flourish at present as it always must in a highly civilised society s is or rather was a fine specimen of this school and m and l are his worthy rivals this style is indeed for the moment very interesting then comes your conversation man who we confess is our aversion his talk is a thing apart got up before he enters the company from whose conduct it should grow out he sits in the middle of a large table and with a brazen voice bawls out his anecdotes about sir thomas or sir humphry lord blank or my lady blue he is incessant yet not interesting ever varying yet always monotonous even if we were amused we are no more grateful for the entertainment than we are to the lamp over the table for the light which it universally sheds and to yield which it was obtained on purpose we are more gratified by the slight conversation of one who is often silent but who speaks from his momentary feelings than by all this hullaballoo yet this machine is generally a favourite piece of furniture with the hostess you may catch her eye as he recounts some adventure of the morning which proves that he not only belongs to every club but goes to them light up with approbation and then when the ladies withdraw and the female senate deliver their criticism upon the late actors she will observe with a gratified smile to her confidante that the dinner went off well and that mr bellow was very strong today  all this is horrid and the whole affair is a delusion a variety of people are brought together who all come as late as possible and retire as soon merely to show they have other engagements a dinner is prepared for them which is hurried over in order that a certain number of dishes should be not tasted but seen and provided that there is no moment that an absolute silence reigns provided that besides the bustling of the servants the clattering of the plates and knives a stray anecdote is told which if good has been heard before and which if new is generally flat provided a certain number of certain names of people of consideration are introduced by which some stranger for whom the party is often secretly given may learn the scale of civilisation of which he this moment forms a part provided the senators do not steal out too soon to the house and their wives to another party the hostess is congratulated on the success of her entertainment  and this glare and heat and noise these congeries of individuals without sympathy and dishes without flavour this is society what an effect without a cause a man must be green indeed to stand this for two seasons one cannot help thinking that one consequence of the increased intelligence of the present day will be a great change in the habits of our intercourse  to our tale we linger few who did not know too much of sir lucius grafton could refrain from yielding him their regard when he chose to challenge it and with the dacres he was soon an acknowledged favourite as a new mp and hitherto doubtful supporter of the catholic cause it was grateful to mr dacres feelings to find in him an ally and flattering to mr dacres judgment when that ally ventured to consult him on his friendly operations with miss dacre he was a mild amiable man who knew the world thoroughly good but void of cant and owner of a virtue not less to be depended on because his passions had once been strong and he had once indulged them his experience of life made him value domestic felicity because he knew that there was no other source of happiness which was at once so pure and so permanent but he was not one of those men who consider marriage as an extinguisher of all those feelings and accomplishments which throw a lustre on existence and he did not consider himself bound because he had plighted his faith to a beautiful woman immediately to terminate the very conduct which had induced her to join him in the sacred and eternal pledge his gaiety still sparkled his wit still flashed still he hastened to be foremost among the courteous and still his high and ready gallantry indicated that he was not prepared to yield the fitting ornament of his still blooming youth a thousand unobtrusive and delicate attentions which the innocent now received from him without a thought save of lady aphrodites good fortune a thousand gay and sentimental axioms which proved not only how agreeable he was but how enchanting he must have been a thousand little deeds which struggled to shun the light and which palpably demonstrated that the gaiety of his wit the splendour of his accomplishments and the tenderness of his soul were only equalled by his unbounded generosity and unparalleled good temper all these combined had made sir lucius grafton to many always a delightful often a dangerous and sometimes a fatal companion he was one of those whose candour is deadly it was when he least endeavoured to conceal his character that its hideousness least appeared he confessed sometimes so much that you yielded that pity which ere the shrived culprit could receive by some fatal alchemy was changed into passion his smile was a lure his speech was a spell but it was when he was silent and almost gloomy when you caught his serious eye charged as it were with emotion gazing on yours that if you had a guardian sylph you should have invoked its aid and we pray if ever you meet the man of whom we write your invocation may not be forgotten or be what is more likely too late  the dacres this season were the subject of general conversation she was the distinguished beauty and the dandies all agreed that his dinner was worthy of his daughter lady fitzpompey was not behind the welcoming crowd she was too politic a leader not to feel anxious to enlist under her colours a recruit who was so calculated to maintain the reputation of her forces fitzpompey house must not lose its character for assembling the most distinguished the most agreeable and the most refined and may dacre was a divinity who would summon many a crowd to her niche in this pantheon of fashion  if any difficulty were for a moment anticipated in bringing about this arrangement a fortunate circumstance seemed sufficient to remove it lord st maurice and arundel dacre had been acquainted at vienna and though the intimacy was slight it was sweet st maurice had received many favours from the attaché and as he was a man of family and reputation had been happy to greet him on his arrival in london before the dacres made their appearance in town for the season arundel had been initiated in the mysteries of fitzpompey house and therefore a desire from that mansion to cultivate the good graces of his yorkshire relation seemed not only not forced but natural so the families met and to the surprise of each other became even intimate for may dacre and lady caroline soon evinced a mutual regard for each other female friendships are of rapid growth and in the present instance when there was nothing on either side which was not lovable it was quite miraculous and the friendship particularly on the part of lady caroline shot up in one night like a blooming aloe  perhaps there is nothing more lovely than the love of two beautiful women who are not envious of each others charms how delightfully they impart to each other the pattern of a cap or flounce or frill how charmingly they entrust some slight slender secret about tinting a flower or netting a purse now one leans over the other and guides her inexperienced hand as it moves in the mysteries of some novel work and then the other looks up with an eye beaming with devotion and then again the first leans down a little lower and gently presses her aromatic lips upon her friends polished forehead  these are sights which we quiet men who like little jack horner know where to take up a safe position occasionally enjoy but which your noisy fellows who think that women never want to be alonea sad mistakeand consequently must be always breaking or stringing a guitar or cutting a pencil or splitting a crowquill or overturning the gold ink or scribbling over a pattern or doing any other of the thousand acts of mischief are debarred from  not that these bright flowers often bloomed alone a blossom not less brilliant generally shared with them the same parterre mrs dallington completed the bouquet and arundel dacre was the butterfly who she was glad to perceive was seldom absent when her presence added beauty to the beautiful indeed she had good reason to feel confidence in her attractions independently of her charms which assuredly were great her fortune which was even greater possessed she was well aware no slight allurement to one who ever trembled when he thought of his dependence and often glowed when he mused over his ambition his slight but increasing notice was duly estimated by one who was perfectly acquainted with his peculiar temper and daily perceived how disregardful he was of all others except her and his cousin but a cousin she felt confidence in the theory of sir lucius grafton  and the young duke have we forgotten him sooth to say he was seldom with our heroine or heroines he had called on mr dacre and had greeted him with marked cordiality and he had sometimes met him and his daughter in society but although invited he had hitherto avoided being their visitor and the comparatively secluded life which he now led prevented him from seeing them often at other houses mr dacre who was unaware of what had passed between him and his daughter thought his conduct inexplicable but his former guardian remembered that it was not the first time that his behaviour had been unusual and it was never the disposition of mr dacre to promote explanations  our hero felt annoyed at his own weakness it would have been infinitely more worthy of so celebrated so unrivalled a personage as the duke of st james not to have given the woman who had rejected him this evidence of her power according to etiquette he should have called there daily and have dined there weekly and yet never have given the former object of his adoration the slightest idea that he cared a breath for her presence according to etiquette he should never have addressed her but in a vein of persiflage and with a smile which indicated his perfect heartease and her bad taste according to etiquette he should have flirted with every woman in her company rode with her in the park walked with her in the gardens chatted with her at the opera and drunk wine with her at a water party and finally to prove how sincere he was in his former estimation of her judgment have consulted her on the presents which he should make to some intimate friend of hers whom he announces as his future bride this is the way to manage a woman and the result may be conceived she stares she starts she sighs she weeps feels highly offended at her friend daring to accept him writes a letter of rejection herself to the affianced damsel which she makes him sign and then presents him with the hand which she always meant to be his  but this was above our hero the truth is whenever he thought of may dacre his spirit sank she had cowed him and her arrival in london had made him as dissatisfied with his present mode of life as he had been with his former career they had met again and under circumstances apparently to him the most unfavourable although he was hopeless yet he dreaded to think what she might hear of him her contempt was bitter her dislike would even be worse yet it seemed impossible to retrieve he was plunged deeper than he imagined embarrassed entangled involved he flew to lady afy half in pique and half in misery passion had ceased to throw a glittering veil around this idol but she was kind and pure and gentle and devoted it was consoling to be loved to one who was so wretched it seemed to him that life must ever be a blank without the woman who a few months ago he had left an encumbrance the recollection of past happiness was balm to one who was so forlorn he shuddered at the thought of losing his only precious possession and he was never more attached to his mistress than when the soul of friendship rose from the body of expired love     chapter viii       an epicurean feast  the duke of st james dines today with mr annesley men and things should be our study and it is universally acknowledged that a dinner is the most important of affairs and a dandy the most important of individuals if we liked we could give you a description of the fête which should make all your mouths water but everyone cooks now and ekes out his page by robbing jarrin and by rifling ude  charles annesley was never seen to more advantage than when a host then his superciliousness would if not vanish at least subside he was not less calm but somewhat less cold like a summer lake therefore we will have an eye upon his party because to dine with dandies should be a prominent feature in your career and must not be omitted in this sketch of the life and times of our young hero the party was of that number which at once secures a variety of conversation and the impossibility of two persons speaking at the same time the guests were his grace lord squib and lord darrell the repast like everything connected with mr annesley was refined and exquisite rather slight than solid and more novel than various there was no affectation of gourmandise the vice of male dinners your imagination and your sight were not at the same time dazzled and confused by an agglomeration of the peculiar luxuries of every clime and every season as you mused over a warm and sunny flavour of a brown soup your host did not dilate upon the milder and moonlight beauties of a white one a gentle dallying with a whiting that chicken of the ocean was not a signal for a panegyric of the darker attraction of a matelotte à la royale the disappearance of the first course did not herald a catalogue of discordant dainties you were not recommended to neglect the croquettes because the boudins might claim attention and while you were crowning your important labours with a quail you were not reminded that the pâté de troyes unlike the less reasonable human race would feel offended if it were not cut then the wines were few some sherry with a pedigree like an arabian heightened the flavour of the dish not interfered with it as a toady keeps up the conversation which he does not distract a goblet of graffenburg with a bouquet like womans breath made you as you remembered some liquid which it had been your fate to fall upon suppose that german wines like german barons required some discrimination and that hock like other titles was not always the sign of the high nobility of its owner a glass of claret was the third grace but if we had been there we should have devoted ourselves to one of the sparkling sisters for one wine like one woman is sufficient to interest ones feelings for fourandtwenty hours fickleness we abhor  i observed you riding today with the gentle leonora st james said mr annesley  no her sister  indeed those girls are uncommonly alike the fact is now that neither face nor figure depends upon nature  no said lord squib all that the artists of the present day want is a model let a family provide one handsome sister and the hideousness of the others will not prevent them under good management from being mistaken by the best judges for the beauty six times in the same hour  you are trying i suppose to account for your unfortunate error at cleverleys on monday squib said lord darrell laughing  pooh all nonsense  what was it said mr annesley  not a word true said lord squib stifling curiosity  i believe it said the duke without having heard a syllable come darrell out with it  it really is nothing very particular only it is whispered that squib said something to lady cleverley which made her ring the bell and that he excused himself to his lordship by protesting that from their similarity of dress and manner and strong family likeness he had mistaken the countess for her sister  omnes well done squib and were you introduced to the right person  why said his lordship fortunately i contrived to fall out about the settlements and so i escaped  so the chaste diana is to be the new patroness said lord darrell  so i understand rejoined mr annesley this is the age of unexpected appointments  on dit that when it was notified to the party most interested there was a rider to the bill excluding my lords relations  ha ha ha faintly laughed mr annesley what have they been doing so remarkable  nothing said lord squib that is just their fault they have every recommendation but when any member of that family is in a room everybody feels so exceedingly sleepy that they all sink to the ground that is the reason that there are so many ottomans at heavyside house  is it true asked the duke that his grace really has a flapper  unquestionably said lord squib the other day i was announced and his attendant was absent he had left his instrument on a sofa i immediately took it up and touched my lord upon his hump i never knew him more entertaining he really was quite lively  but diana is a favourite goddess of mine said annesley taste that hock  superb where did you get it  a present from poor raffenburg  ah where is he now  at paris i believe  paris and where is she  i liked raffenburg said lord squib he always reminded me of a country innkeeper who supplies you with pipes and tobacco gratis provided that you will dine with him  he had unrivalled meerschaums said mr annesley and he was most liberal there are two you know i never use them but they are handsome furniture  those dalmaines are fine girls said the duke of st james  very pretty creatures do you know duke said annesley i think the youngest one something like miss dacre  indeed i cannot say the resemblance struck me  i see old mother dalmaine dresses her as much like the doncaster belle as she possibly can  yes and spoils her said lord squib but old mother dalmaine with all her fuss was ever a bad cook and overdid everything  young dalmaine they say observed lord darrell is in a sort of a scrape  ah what  oh some confusion at headquarters a great tallowchandlers son got into the regiment and committed some heresy at mess  i do not know the brother said the duke  you are fortunate then he is unendurable to give you an idea of him suppose you met him here which you never will he would write to you the next day my dear st james  my tailor presented me his best compliments the other morning said the duke  the world is growing familiar said mr annesley  there must be some remedy said lord darrell  yes said lord squib with indignation tradesmen nowadays console themselves for not getting their bills paid by asking their customers to dinner  it is shocking said mr annesley with a forlorn air do you know i never enter society now without taking as many preliminary precautions as if the plague raged in all our chambers in vain have i hitherto prided myself on my existence being unknown to the million i never now stand still in a street lest my portrait be caught for a lithograph i never venture to a strange dinner lest i should stumble upon a fashionable novelist and even with all this vigilance and all this denial i have an intimate friend whom i cannot cut and who they say writes for the court journal  but why cannot you cut him asked lord darrell  he is my brother and you know i pride myself upon my domestic feelings  yes said lord squib to judge from what the world says one would think annesley you were a brummel  squib not even in jest couple my name with one whom i will not call a savage merely because he is unfortunate  what did you think of little eugenie annesley last night asked the duke  well very well indeed something like brocards worst  i was a little disappointed in her début and much interested in her success she was rather a favourite of mine in paris so i invited her to the alhambra yesterday with claudius piggott and some more i had half a mind to pull you in but i know you do not much admire piggott  on the contrary i have been in piggotts company without being much offended  i think piggott improves said lord darrell it was those waistcoats which excited such a prejudice against him when he first came over  what a prejudice against peacock piggott said lord squib pretty peacock piggott tell it not in gath whisper it not in ascalon and above all insinuate it not to lady de courcy  there is not much danger of my insinuating anything to her said mr annesley  your compact i hope is religiously observed said the duke  yes very well there was a slight infraction once but i sent charles fitzroy as an ambassador and war was not declared  do you mean asked lord squib when your cabriolet broke down before her door and she sent out to request that you would make yourself quite at home  i mean that fatal day replied mr annesley i afterwards discovered she had bribed my tiger  do you know eugenies sister st james asked lord darrell  yes she is very clever very popular at paris but i like eugenie because she is so goodnatured her laugh is so hearty  so it is said lord squib do you remember that girl at madrid annesley who used to laugh so  what isidora she is coming over  but i thought it was high treason to plunder the grandees dovecotes  why all our regular official negotiations have failed she is not permitted to treat with a foreign manager but the new ambassador has a secretary and that secretary has some diplomatic ability and so isidora is to be smuggled over  in a red box i suppose said lord squib  i rather admire our adèle said the duke of st james i really think she dances with more aplomb than any of them  oh certainly she is a favourite of mine  but i like that wild little ducis said lord squib she puts me in mind of a wild cat  and marunia of a bengal tiger said his grace  she is a fine woman though said lord darrell  i think your cousin st james said lord squib will get into a scrape with marunia i remember chetwynd telling me and he was not apt to complain on that score that he never should have broken up if it had not been for her  but he was an extravagant fellow said mr annesley he called me in at his bouleversement for advice as i have the reputation of a good economist i do not know how it is though i see these things perpetually happen but why men and men of small fortunes should commit such follies really exceeds my comprehension ten thousand pounds for trinkets and nearly as much for old furniture  chetwynd kept it up a good many years though i think said lord darrell i remember going to see his rooms when i first came over you recollect his pearl fountain of cologne water  millecolonnes fitted up his place i think asked the young duke but it was before my time  oh yes little bijou said annesley he has done you justice duke i think the alhambra much the prettiest thing in town  i was attacked the other day most vigorously by mrs dallington to obtain a sight said lord squib i referred her to lucy grafton do you know st james i have half a strange idea that there is a renewal in that quarter  so they say said the duke if so i confess i am surprised but they remembered lord darrell and the conversation turned  those are clever horses of lincoln graves said mr annesley  neat cattle as bagshot says observed lord squib  is it true that bag is going to marry one of the wrekins asked the duke  which asked lord squib not sophy surely i thought she was to be your cousin i dare say he added a false report i suppose to use a bagshotism his governor wants it but i should think lord cub would not yet be taken in bythebye he says you have promised to propose him at whites st james  oppose him i said rejoined the duke bag really never understands english however i think it as probable that he will lounge there as on the treasury bench that was his governors last shrewd plan  darrell said lord squib is there any chance of my being a commissioner for anything it struck me last night that i had never been in office  i do not think squib that you ever will be in office if even you be appointed  on the contrary my good fellow my punctuality should surprise you i should like very much to be a lay lord because i cannot afford to keep a yacht and theirs they say are not sufficiently used for the admirals think it spooney and the landlubbers are always sick  i think myself of having a yacht this summer said the duke of st james be my captain squib  if you be serious i will commence my duties tomorrow  i am serious i think it will be amusing i give you full authority to do exactly what you like provided in two months time i have the crack vessel in the club  i begin to press annesley your dinner is so good that you shall be purser and darrell you are a man of business you shall be his clerk for the rest i think st maurice may claim a place and  peacock piggott by all means said the duke a gay sailor is quite the thing  and charles fitzroy said annesley because i am under obligations to him and promised to have him in my eye  and bagshot for a butt said the duke  and backbite for a buffoon said mr annesley  and for the rest said the young duke the rest of the crew i vote shall be women the dalmaines will just do  and the little trevors said lord darrell  and long harrington said lord squib she is my beauty  and the young ducie said annesley and mrs dallington of course and caroline st maurice and charlotte bloomerly really she was dressed most prettily last night and above all the queen bee of the hive may dacre eh st james and i have another proposition said annesley with unusual animation may dacre won the st leger and ruled the course and may dacre shall win the cup and rule the waves our yacht shall be christened by the lady bird of yorkshire  what a delightful thing it would be said the duke of st james if throughout life we might always choose our crew cull the beauties and banish the bores  but that is impossible said lord darrell every ornament of society is counterbalanced by some accompanying blur i have invariably observed that the ugliness of a chaperon is exactly in proportion to the charms of her charge and that if a man be distinguished for his wit his appearance his style or any other good quality he is sure to be saddled with some family or connection who require all his popularity to gain them a passport into the crowd  one might collect an unexceptionable coterie from our present crowd said mr annesley it would be curious to assemble all the pet lambs of the flock  is it impossible asked the duke  burlington is the only man who dare try said lord darrell  i doubt whether any individual would have sufficient pluck said lord squib  yes said the duke it must i think be a jointstock company to share the glory and the odium let us do it  there was a start and a silence broken by annesley in a low voice  by heavens it would be sublime if practicable but the difficulty does indeed seem insurmountable  why we would not do it said the young duke if it were not difficult the first thing is to get a frame for our picture to hit upon some happy pretence for assembling in an impromptu style the young and gay our purpose must not be too obvious it must be something to which all expect to be asked and where the presence of all is impossible so that in fixing upon a particular member of a family we may seem influenced by the wish that no circle should be neglected then too it should be something like a waterparty or a fête champêtre where colds abound and fits are always caught so that a consideration for the old and the infirm may authorise us not to invite them then too  omnes bravo bravo st james it shall be it shall be  it must be a fête champêtre said annesley decidedly and as far from town as possible  twickenham is at your service said the duke  just the place and just the distance the only objection is that by being yours it will saddle the enterprise too much upon you we must all bear our share in the uproar for trust me there will be one but there are a thousand ways by which our responsibility may be insisted upon for instance let us make a list of all our guests and then let one of us act as secretary and sign the invitations which shall be like tickets no other name need appear and the hosts will indicate themselves at the place of rendezvous  my lords said lord squib i rise to propose the health of mr secretary annesley and i think if anyone carry the business through it will be he  i accept the trust at present be silent as night for we have much to mature and our success depends upon our secrecy     chapter ix       the fête of youth and beauty  arundel dacre though little apt to cultivate an acquaintance with anyone called on the young duke the morning after their meeting the truth is his imagination was touched by our heros appearance his grace possessed all that accomplished manner of which arundel painfully felt the want and to which he eagerly yielded his admiration he earnestly desired the dukes friendship but with his usual mauvaise honte their meeting did not advance his wishes he was as shy and constrained as usual and being really desirous of appearing to advantage and leaving an impression in his favour his manner was even divested of that somewhat imposing coldness which was not altogether ineffective in short he was rather disagreeable the duke was courteous as he usually was and ever to the dacres but he was not cordial he disliked arundel dacre in a word he looked upon him as his favoured rival the two young men occasionally met but did not grow more intimate studiously polite the young duke ever was both to him and to his lovely cousin for his pride concealed his pique and he was always afraid lest his manner should betray his mind  in the meantime sir lucius grafton apparently was running his usual course of triumph it is fortunate that those who will watch and wonder about everything are easily satisfied with a reason and are ever quick in detecting a cause so mrs dallington vere was the fact that duly accounted for the baronets intimacy with the dacres all was right again between them it was unusual to be sure these rifacimentos still she was a charming woman and it was well known that lucius had spent twenty thousand on the county where was that to come from they should like to know but from old dallington veres yorkshire estates which he had so wisely left to his pretty wife by the pink paper codicil  and this lady of so many loves how felt she most agreeably as all dames do who dote upon a passion which they feel convinced will be returned but which still waits for a response arundel dacre would yield her a smile from a face more worn by thought than joy and arundel dacre who was wont to muse alone was now ever ready to join his cousin and her friends in the ride or the promenade miss dacre too had noticed to her a kindly change in her cousins conduct to her father he was more cordial to his uncle sought to pay him deference and seemed more desirous of gaining his goodwill the experienced eye too of this pretty woman allowed her often to observe that her heros presence was not particularly occasioned or particularly inspired by his cousin in a word it was to herself that his remarks were addressed his attentions devoted and often she caught his dark and liquid eye fixed upon her beaming and refulgent brow  sir lucius grafton proceeded with that strange mixture of craft and passion which characterised him each day his heart yearned more for the being on whom his thoughts should never have pondered now exulting in her increased confidence she seemed already his victim now awed by her majestic spirit he despaired even of her being his bride now melted by her unsophisticated innocence he cursed even the least unhallowed of his purposes and now enchanted by her consummate loveliness he forgot all but her beauty and his own passion  often had he dilated to her with the skill of an arch deceiver on the blessings of domestic joy often in her presence had his eye sparkled when he watched the infantile graces of some playful children then he would embrace them with a soft care and gushing fondness enough to melt the heart of any mother whom he was desirous to seduce and then with a halfmurmured sigh he regretted in broken accents that he too was not a father  in due time he proceeded even further dark hints of domestic infelicity broke unintentionally from his ungoverned lips miss dacre stared he quelled the tumult of his thoughts struggled with his outbreaking feelings and triumphed yet not without a tear which forced its way down a face not formed for grief and quivered upon his fair and downy cheek sir lucius grafton was well aware of the magic of his beauty and used his charms to betray as if he were a woman  miss dacre whose soul was sympathy felt in silence for this excellent this injured this unhappy this agreeable man ill could even her practised manner check the current of her mind or conceal from lady aphrodite that she possessed her dislike as for the young duke he fell into the lowest abyss of her opinions and was looked upon as alike frivolous heartless and irreclaimable  but how are the friends with whom we dined yesterday frequent were the meetings deep the consultations infinite the suggestions innumerable the expedients in the morning they met and breakfasted with annesley in the afternoon they met and lunched with lord squib in the evening they met and dined with lord darrell and at night they met and supped at the alhambra each council only the more convinced them that the scheme was feasible and must be glorious at last their ideas were matured and annesley took steps to break a great event to the world who were on the eve of being astonished  he repaired to lady bloomerly the world sometimes talked of her ladyship and mr annesley the world were quite wrong as they often are on this subject mr annesley knew the value of a female friend by lady bloomerlys advice the plan was entrusted in confidence to about a dozen dames equally influential then a few of the most considered male friends heard a strange report lord darrell dropped a rumour at the treasury but with his finger on the mouth and leaving himself out of the list proceeded to give his favourable opinion of the project merely as a disinterested and expected guest then the duke promised peacock piggott one night at the alhambra but swore him to solemn secrecy over a vase of sherbet then squib told his tailor in consideration that his bill should not be sent in and finally the bird of paradise betrayed the whole affair to the musical world who were of course all agog then when rumour began to wag its hundred tongues the twelve peeresses found themselves bound in honour to step into the breach yielded the plan their decided approbation and their avowed patronage puzzled the grumblers silenced the weak and sneered down the obstinate  the invitations began to issue and the outcry against them burst forth a fronde was formed but they wanted a de retz and many kept back with the hope of being bribed from joining it the four cavaliers soon found themselves at the head of a strong party and then like a faction who have successfully struggled for toleration they now openly maintained their supremacy it was too late to cabal the uninvited could only console themselves by a passive sulk or an active sneer but this would not do and their bilious countenances betrayed their chagrin  the difficulty now was not to keep the bores away but to obtain a few of the beauties who hesitated a chaperon must be found for one another must be added on to a party like a star to the cluster of a constellation among those whose presence was most ardently desired but seemed most doubtful was miss dacre an invitation had been sent to her father but he was out of town and she did not like to join so peculiar a party without him but it was unanimously agreed that without her the affair would be a failure and charles annesley was sent envoy extraordinary to arrange with the good aid of his friend mrs dallington all was at length settled and fervid prayers that the important day might be ushered in by a smiling sun were offered up during the next fortnight at halfpast six every morning by all civilised society who then hurried to their nights rest     chapter x       sir lucius drops the mask  the fête at the pavilion such was the title of the twickenham villa though the subject of universal interest was anticipated by no one with more eager anxiety than by sir lucius grafton for that day he determined should decide the fate of the duke of st james he was sanguine as to the result nor without reason for the last month he had by his dark machinery played desperately upon the feelings of lady aphrodite and more than once had she despatched rapid notes to her admirer for counsel and for consolation the duke was more skilful in soothing her griefs than in devising expedients for their removal he treated the threatened as a distant evil and wiped away her tears in a manner which is almost an encouragement to weep  at last the eventful morn arrived and a scorching sun made those exult to whom the barge and the awning promised a progress equally calm and cool woe to the dusty britzska woe to the molten furnace of the crimson cabriolet  they came as the stars come out from the heavens what time the sun is in his first repose now a single hero brilliant as a planet now a splendid party clustering like a constellation music is on the waters and perfume on the land each moment a barque glides up with its cymbals each moment a cavalcade bright with bouquets  ah gathering of brightness ah meeting of lustre why why are you to be celebrated by one so obscure and dull as i am ye lady carolines and ye lady franceses ye lady barbaras and ye lady blanches is it my fault  o graceful lord francis why why have you left us why why have you exchanged your ionian lyre for an irish harp you were not made for politics leave them to clerks fly fly back to pleasure to frolic and fun confess now that you sometimes do feel a little queer we say nothing of the difference between may fair and donnybrook  and thou too luttrell gayest bard that ever threw off a triplet amid the clattering of cabs and the chattering of clubs art thou too mute where where dost thou linger is our druid among the oaks of ampthill or like a truant etonian is he lurking among the beeches of burnham what has the immortal letter unlike all other good advice absolutely not been thrown away or is the jade incorrigible whichever be the case you need not be silent there is yet enough to do and yet enough to instruct teach us that wealth is not elegance that profusion is not magnificence and that splendour is not beauty teach us that taste is a talisman which can do greater wonders than the millions of the loanmonger teach us that to vie is not to rival and to imitate not to invent teach us that pretension is a bore teach us that wit is excessively goodnatured and like champagne not only sparkles but is sweet teach us the vulgarity of malignity teach us that envy spoils our complexions and that anxiety destroys our figure catch the fleeting colours of that sly chameleon cant and show what excessive trouble we are ever taking to make ourselves miserable and silly teach us all this and aglaia shall stop a crow in its course and present you with a pen thalia hold the golden fluid in a sèvres vase and euphrosyne support the violetcoloured scroll  the four hosts greeted the arrivals and assisted the disembarkations like the famous four sons of aymon  they were all dressed alike and their costume excited great attention at first it was to have been very plain black and white and a single rose but it was settled that simplicity had been overdone and like a country girl after her first season had turned into a most affected baggage so they agreed to be regal and fancy uniforms worthy of the court of oberon were the order of the day we shall not describe them for the description of costume is the most inventive province of our historical novelists and we never like to be unfair or trench upon our neighbours lands or rights but the alhambra button indicated a mystical confederacy and made the women quite frantic with curiosity  the guests wandered through the gardens always various and now a paradise of novelty there were four brothers fresh from the wildest recesses of the carpathian mount who threw out such woodnotes wild that all the artists stared and it was universally agreed that had they not been french chorussingers they would have been quite a miracle but the lapland sisters were the true prodigy who danced the mazurka in the national style there was also a fireeater but some said he would never set the river in flames though he had an antidote against all poisons but then our mithridates always tried its virtues on a stuffed poodle whose bark evinced its vitality there also was a giant in the wildest part of the shrubbery and a dwarf on whom the ladies showered their sugarplums and who in return offered them tobacco but it was not true that the giant sported stilts or that the dwarf was a suckingbabe some people are so suspicious then a bell rang and assembled them in the concertroom and the bird of paradise who today was consigned to the cavaliership of peacock piggott condescended to favour them with a new song which no one had ever heard and which consequently made them feel more intensely all the sublimity of exclusiveness shall we forget the panniers of shoes which melnotte had placed in every quarter of the gardens we will say nothing of maradans cases of caps because for this incident lord bagshot is our authority  on a sudden it seemed that a thousand bugles broke the blue air and they were summoned to a déjeûner in four crimson tents worthy of sardanapalus  over each waved the scutcheon of the president glittering were the glories of the hundred quarterings of the house of darrell si non è vero è ben trovato was the motto lord darrells grandfather had been a successful lawyer lord squibs emblazonry was a satire on its owner holdfast was the motto of a man who had let loose annesleys simple shield spoke of the conquest but all paled before the banner of the house of hauteville for it indicated an alliance with royalty the attendants of each pavilion wore the livery of its lord  shall we attempt to describe the delicacy of this banquet where imagination had been racked for novel luxury through the centre of each table ran a rivulet of rosewater and gold and silver fish glanced in its unrivalled course the bouquets were exchanged every halfhour and music soft and subdued but constant and thrilling wound them up by exquisite gradations to that pitch of refined excitement which is so strange a union of delicacy and voluptuousness when the soul as it were becomes sensual and the body as it were dissolves into spirit and in this choice assembly where all was youth and elegance and beauty was it not right that every sound should be melody every sight a sight of loveliness and every thought a thought of pleasure  they arose and reassembled on the lawn where they found to their surprise had arisen in their absence a dutch fair numerous were the booths innumerable were the contents the first artists had arranged the picture and the costumes the first artists had made the trinkets and the toys and what a very agreeable fair where all might suit their fancy without the permission of that sulky tyrant a purse all were in excellent humour and no false shame prevented them from plundering the stalls the noble proprietors set the example annesley offered a bouquet of precious stones to charlotte bloomerly and it was accepted and the duke of st james showered a sack of whimsical breloques among a scrambling crowd of laughing beauties among them was miss dacre he had not observed her their eyes met and she smiled it seemed that he had never felt happiness before  ere the humours of the fair could be exhausted they were summoned to the margin of the river where four painted and gilded galleys which might have sailed down the cydmus and each owning its peculiar chief prepared to struggle for preeminence in speed all betted and the duke encouraged by the smile hastened to miss dacre to try to win back some of his doncaster losses but arundel dacre had her arm in his and she was evidently delighted with his discourse his graces blood turned and he walked away  it was sunset when they returned to the lawn and then the ballroom presented itself but the twilight was long and the night was warm there were no hateful dews no odious mists and therefore a great number danced on the lawn the fair was illuminated and all the little marchandes and their lusty porters walked about in their costume  the duke again rallied his courage and seeing arundel dacre with mrs dallington vere he absolutely asked miss dacre to dance she was engaged he doubted and walked into the house disconsolate yet if he had waited one moment he would have seen sir lucius grafton rejoin her and lead her to the cotillon that was forming on the turf the duke sauntered to lady aphrodite but she would not dance yet she did not yield his arm and proposed a stroll they wandered away to the extremity of the grounds fainter and fainter grew the bursts of the revellers yet neither of them spoke much for both were dull  illustration page243  yet at length her ladyship did speak and amply made up for her previous silence all former scenes to this were but as the preface to the book all she knew and all she dreaded all her suspicions all her certainties all her fears were poured forth in painful profusion this night was to decide her fate she threw herself on his mercy if he had forgotten his love out dashed all those arguments all those appeals all those assertions which they say are usual under these circumstances she was a woman he was a man she had staked her happiness on this venture he had a thousand cards to play love and first love with her as with all women was everything he and all men at the worst had a thousand resources he might plunge into politics he might game he might fight he might ruin himself in innumerable ways but she could only ruin herself in one miserable woman miserable sex she had given him her all she knew it was little would she had more she knew she was unworthy of him would she were not she did not ask him to sacrifice himself to her she could not expect it she did not even desire it only she thought he ought to know exactly the state of affairs and of consequences and that certainly if they were parted which assuredly they would be most decidedly she would droop and fade and die she wept she sobbed his entreaties alone seemed to prevent hysterics  these scenes are painful at all times and even the callous they say have a twinge but when the actress is really beautiful and pure as this lady was and the actor young and inexperienced and amiable as this actor was the consequences are more serious than is usual the duke of st james was unhappy he was discontented he was dissatisfied with himself he did not love this lady if love were the passion which he entertained for miss dacre but she loved him he knew that she was beautiful and he was convinced that she was excellent the world is malicious but the world had agreed that lady aphrodite was an unblemished pearl yet this jewel was reserved for him intense gratitude almost amounted to love in short he had no idea at this moment that feelings are not in our power his were captive even if entrapped it was a great responsibility to desert this creature the only one from whom he had experienced devotion to conclude a season of extraordinary dissipation to use no harsher phrase had somewhat exhausted the nervous powers of our hero his energies were deserting him he had not heart or heartlessness enough to extricate himself from this dilemma it seemed that if this being to whom he was indebted for so much joy were miserable he must be unhappy that if she died life ought to have could have no charms for him he kissed away her tears he pledged his faith and lady aphrodite grafton was his betrothed  she wonderfully recovered her deep but silent joy seemed to repay him even for this bitter sacrifice compared with the late racking of his feelings the present calm which was merely the result of suspense being destroyed seemed happiness his conscience whispered approbation and he felt that for once he had sacrificed himself to another  they reentered the villa and he took the first opportunity of wandering alone to the least frequented parts of the grounds his mind demanded solitude and his soul required soliloquy  so the game is up truly a most lame and impotent conclusion and this then is the result of all my high fancies and indefinite aspirations verily i am a very distinguished hero and have not abused my unrivalled advantages in the least what am i bitter on myself there will be enough to sing my praises without myself joining in this chorus of congratulation o fool fool now i know what folly is but barely fifteen months since i stepped upon these shores full of hope and full of pride and now i leave them how o my dishonoured fathers even my posterity which god grant i may not have will look on my memory with hatred and on hers with scorn  well i suppose we must live for ourselves we both of us know the world and heaven can bear witness that we should not be haunted by any uneasy hankering after what has brought us such a heartache if it were for love if it were forbut away i will not profane her name if it were for her that i was thus sacrificing myself i could bear it i could welcome it i can imagine perfect and everlasting bliss in the sole society of one single being but she is not that being let me not conceal it let me wrestle with this bitter conviction  and am i indeed bound to close my career thus to throw away all hope all chance of felicity at my age for a point of honour no no it is not that after all i have experienced that with her and from her which i have with no other woman and she is so good so gentle and all agree so lovely how infinitely worse would her situation be if deserted than mine is as her perpetual companion the very thought makes my heart bleed yes amiable devoted dearest afy i throw aside these morbid feelings you shall never repent having placed your trust in me i will be proud and happy of such a friend and you shall be mine for ever  a shriek broke on the air he started it was near he hastened after the sound he entered into a small green glade surrounded by shrubs where had been erected a fanciful hermitage there he found sir lucius grafton on his knees grasping the hand of the indignant but terrified miss dacre the duke rushed forward miss dacre ran to meet him sir lucius rose  this lady sir lucius grafton is under my protection said the young duke with a flashing eye but a calm voice she clung to his arm he bore her away the whole was the affair of an instant  the duke and his companion proceeded in silence she tried to hasten but he felt her limbs shake upon his arm he stopped no one not even a servant was near he could not leave her for an instant there she stood trembling her head bent down and one hand clasping the other which rested on his arm terrible was her struggle but she would not faint and at length succeeded in repressing her emotions they were yet a considerable way from the house she motioned with her left hand to advance but still she did not speak on they walked though more slowly for she was exhausted and occasionally stopped for breath or strength  at length she said in a faint voice i cannot join the party i must go home directly how can it be done  your companions said the duke  are of course engaged or not to be found but surely somebody i know is departing manage it say i am ill  o miss dacre if you knew the agony of my mind  do not speak for heavens sake do not speak  he turned off from the lawn and approached by a small circuit the gate of the ground suddenly he perceived a carriage on the point of going off it was the duchess of shropshires  there is the duchess of shropshire you know her but not a minute is to be lost there is such a noise they will not hear are you afraid to stop here one instant by yourself i shall not be out of sight and not away a second i run very quick  no no i am not afraid go go  away rushed the duke of st james as if his life were on his speed he stopped the carriage spoke and was back in an instant  lean lean on me with all your strength i have told everything necessary to lady shropshire nobody will speak a word because they believe you have a terrible headache i will say everything necessary to mrs dallington and your cousin do not give yourself a moments uneasiness and oh miss dacre if i might say one word  she did not stop him  if continued he it be your wish that the outrage of tonight should be known only to myself and him i pledge my word it shall be so though willingly if i were authorised i would act a different part in this affair  it is my wish she spoke in a low voice with her eyes still upon the ground and i thank you for this and for all  they had now joined the shropshires but it was now discovered miss dacre had no shawl and sundry other articles were wanting to the evident dismay of the ladies wrekin they offered theirs but their visitor refused and would not allow the duke to fetch her own off they drove but when they had proceeded above half a mile a continued shout on the road which the fat coachman for a long time would not hear stopped them and up came the duke of st james covered with dust and panting like a racer with miss dacres shawl     chapter xi       grim preparations  so much time was occupied by this adventure of the shawl and by making requisite explanations to mrs dallington vere that almost the whole of the guests had retired when the duke found himself again in the saloon his brotherhosts too were off with various parties to which they had attached themselves he found the fitzpompeys and a few still lingering for their carriages and arundel dacre and his fair admirer his grace had promised to return with lady afy and was devising some scheme by which he might free himself from this now not very suitable engagement when she claimed his arm she was leaning on it and talking to lady fitzpompey when sir lucius approached and with his usual tone put a note into the dukes hand saying at the same time this appears to belong to you i shall go to town with piggott and then he walked away  with the wife leaning on his arm the young duke had the pleasure of reading the following lines written with the pencil of the husband  after what has just occurred only one more meeting can take place between us and the sooner that takes place the better for all parties this is no time for etiquette i shall be in kensington gardens in the grove on the right side of the summerhouse at halfpast six tomorrow morning and shall doubtless find you there  sir lucius was not out of sight when the duke had finished reading his cartel making some confused excuse to lady afy which was not expected he ran after the baronet and soon reached him  grafton i shall be punctual but there is one point on which i wish to speak to you at once the cause of this meeting may be kept i hope a secret  so far as i am concerned an inviolable one bowed the baronet stiffly and they parted  the duke returned satisfied for sir lucius grafton ever observed his word to say nothing of the great interest which he surely had this time in maintaining his pledge  our hero thought that he never should reach london the journey seemed a day and the effort to amuse lady afy and to prevent her from suspecting by his conduct that anything had occurred was most painful silent however he at last became but her mind too was engaged and she supposed that her admirer was quiet only because like herself he was happy at length they reached her house but he excused himself from entering and drove on immediately to annesley he was at lady bloomerlys lord darrell had not returned and his servant did not expect him lord squib was never to be found  the duke put on a great coat over his uniform and drove to whites it was really a wilderness never had he seen fewer men there in his life and there were none of his set the only younglooking man was old colonel carlisle who with his skilfully enamelled cheek flowing auburn locks shining teeth and tinted whiskers might have been mistaken for gay twentyseven instead of grey seventytwo but the colonel had the gout to say nothing of any other objections  the duke took up the courier and read three or four advertisements of quack medicines but nobody entered it was nearly midnight he got nervous somebody came in lord hounslow for his rubber even his favoured child bagshot would be better than nobody the duke protested that the next acquaintance who entered should be his second old or young his vow had scarcely been registered when arundel dacre came in alone he was the last man to whom the duke wished to address himself but fate seemed to have decided it and the duke walked up to him  mr dacre i am about to ask of you a favour to which i have no claim  mr dacre looked a little confused and murmured his willingness to do anything  to be explicit i am engaged in an affair of honour of an urgent nature will you be my friend  willingly he spoke with more ease may i ask the name of the other party thethe cause of the meeting  the other party is sir lucius grafton  hum said arundel dacre as if he were no longer curious about the cause when do you meet  at halfpast six in kensington gardens tomorrow i believe i should say this morning  your grace must be wearied said arundel with unusual ease and animation now follow my advice go home at once and get some rest give yourself no trouble about preparations leave everything to me i will call upon you at halfpast five precisely with a chaise and posthorses which will divert suspicion now good night  but really your rest must be considered and then all this trouble  oh i have been in the habit of sitting up all night do not think of me nor am i quite inexperienced in these matters in too many of which i have unfortunately been engaged in germany  the young men shook hands and the duke hastened home fortunately the bird of paradise was at her own establishment in baker street a bureau where her secretary in her behalf transacted business with the various courts of europe and the numerous cities of great britain here many a negotiation was carried on for opera engagements at vienna or paris or berlin or st petersburg here many a diplomatic correspondence conducted the fate of the musical festivals of york or norwich or exeter  chapter xii  an affair of honour  let us return to sir lucius grafton he is as mad as any man must be who feels that the imprudence of a moment has dashed the ground all the plans and all the hopes and all the great results over which he had so often pondered the great day from which he had expected so much had passed nor was it possible for fourandtwenty hours more completely to have reversed all his feelings and all his prospects miss dacre had shared the innocent but unusual and excessive gaiety which had properly become a scene of festivity at once so agreeable so various and so novel sir lucius grafton had not been insensible to the excitement on the contrary his impetuous passions seemed to recall the former and more fervent days of his career and his voluptuous mind dangerously sympathised with the beautiful and luxurious scene he was elated too with the thought that his freedom would perhaps be sealed this evening and still more by his almost constant attendance on his fascinating companion as the particular friend of the dacre family and as the secret ally of mrs dallington vere he in some manner contrived always to be at miss dacres side with the laughing but insidious pretence that he was now almost too grave and staid a personage for such scenes he conversed with few others and humourously maintaining that his dancing days were over danced with none but her even when her attention was engaged by a third person he lingered about and with his consummate knowledge of the world easy wit and constant resources generally succeeded in not only sliding into the conversation but engrossing it arundel dacre too although that young gentleman had not departed from his usual coldness in favour of sir lucius grafton the baronet would most provokingly consider as his particular friend never seemed to be conscious that his reserved companion was most punctilious in his address to him but on the contrary called him in return dacre and sometimes arundel in vain young dacre struggled to maintain his position his manner was no match for that of sir lucius grafton annoyed with himself he felt confused and often quitted his cousin that he might be free of his friend thus sir lucius grafton contrived never to permit miss dacre to be alone with arundel and to her he was so courteous so agreeable and so useful that his absence seemed always a blank or a period in which something ever went wrong  the triumphant day rolled on and each moment sir lucius felt more sanguine and more excited we will not dwell upon the advancing confidence of his desperate mind hope expanded into certainty certainty burst into impatience in a desperate moment he breathed his passion  may dacre was the last girl to feel at a loss in such a situation no one would have rung him out of a saloon with an air of more contemptuous majesty but the shock the solitary strangeness of the scene the fear for the first time that none were near and perhaps also her exhausted energy frightened her and she shrieked one only had heard that shriek yet that one was legion sooner might the whole world know the worst than this person suspect the least sir lucius was left silent with rage mad with passion desperate with hate  he gasped for breath now his brow burnt now the cold dew ran off his countenance in streams he clenched his fist he stamped with agony he found at length his voice and he blasphemed to the unconscious woods  his quick brain flew to the results like lightning the duke had escaped from his mesh his madness had done more to win this boy miss dacres heart than an age of courtship he had lost the idol of his passion he was fixed for ever with the creature of his hate he loathed the idea he tottered into the hermitage and buried his face in his hands  something must be done some monstrous act of energy must repair this fatal blunder he appealed to the mind which had never deserted him the oracle was mute yet vengeance might even slightly redeem the bitterness of despair this fellow should die and his girl for already he hated miss dacre should not triumph in her minion he tore a leaf from his tablets and wrote the lines we have already read  the young duke reached home you expect of course that he sat up all night making his will and answering letters by no means the first object that caught his eye was an enormous ottoman he threw himself upon it without undressing and without speaking a word to luigi and in a moment was fast asleep he was fairly exhausted luigi stared and called spiridion to consult they agreed that they dare not go to bed and must not leave their lord so they played écarté till at last they quarrelled and fought with the candles over the table but even this did not wake their unreasonable master so spiridion threw down a few chairs by accident but all in vain at halfpast five there was a knocking at the gate and they hurried away  arundel dacre entered with them woke the duke and praised him for his punctuality his grace thought that he had only dozed a few minutes but time pressed five minutes arranged his toilet and they were first on the field  in a moment sir lucius and mr piggott appeared arundel dacre on the way had anxiously enquired as to the probability of reconciliation but was told at once it was impossible so now he measured the ground and loaded the pistols with a calmness which was admirable they fired at once the duke in the air and the baronet in his friends side when sir lucius saw his grace fall his hate vanished he ran up with real anxiety and unfeigned anguish  have i hit you by hll  his grace was magnanimous but the case was urgent a surgeon gave a favourable report and extracted the ball on the spot the duke was carried back to his chaise and in an hour was in the state bed not of the alhambra but of his neglected mansion  arundel dacre retired when he had seen his friend home but gave urgent commands that he should be kept quiet no sooner was the second out of sight than the principal ordered the room to be cleared with the exception of spiridion and then rising in his bed wrote this note which the page was secretly to deliver  house  182  dear miss dacre  a very unimportant but somewhat disagreeable incident has occurred i have been obliged to meet sir lucius grafton and our meeting has fortunately terminated without any serious consequences yet i wish that you should hear of this first from me lest you might imagine that i had not redeemed my pledge of last night and that i had placed for a moment my own feelings in competition with yours this is not the case and never shall be dear miss dacre with one whose greatest pride is to subscribe himself  your most obedient and faithful servant  st james     chapter xiii       a mind distraught  the world talked of nothing but the duel between the duke of st james and sir lucius grafton  it was a thunderbolt and the phenomenon was accounted for by every cause but the right one yet even those who most confidently solved the riddle were the most eagerly employed in investigating its true meaning the seconds were of course applied to arundel dacre was proverbially unpumpable but peacock piggott whose communicative temper was an adage how came he on a sudden so diplomatic not a syllable oozed from a mouth which was ever open not a hint from a countenance which never could conceal its mind he was not even mysterious but really looked just as astonished and was just as curious as themselves fine times these for the universe and the new world all came out about lady afy and they made up for their long and previous ignorance or as they now boldly blustered their long and considerate forbearance sheets given away gratis edition on saturday night for the country and woodcuts of the pavilion fête the when the how and the wherefore a the summerhouse and lady aphrodite meeting the young duke b the hedge behind which sir lucius grafton was concealed c kensington gardens and a cloudy morning and so on cruikshank did wonders  but let us endeavour to ascertain the feelings of the principal agents in this odd affair sir lucius now was cool and the mischief being done took a calm review of the late mad hours as was his custom he began to enquire whether any good could be elicited from all this evil he owed his late adversary sundry moneys which he had never contemplated the possibility of repaying to the person who had eloped with his wife had he shot his creditor the account would equally have been cleared and this consideration although it did not prompt had not dissuaded the late desperate deed as it was he now appeared still to enjoy the possession both of his wife and his debts and had lost his friend bad generalship sir lucy reconciliation was out of the question the dukes position was a good one strongly entrenched with a flesh wound he had all the sympathy of society on his side and after having been confined for a few weeks he could go to paris for a few months and then return as if the graftons had never crossed his eye rid of a troublesome mistress and a troublesome friend his position was certainly a good one but sir lucius was astute and he determined to turn this shumla of his grace the quarrel must have been about her ladyship who could assign any other cause for it and the duke must now be weak with loss of blood and anxiety and totally unable to resist any appeal particularly a personal one to his feelings he determined therefore to drive lady afy into his graces arms if he could only get her into the house for an hour the business would be settled  these cunning plans were however nearly being crossed by a very simple incident annoyed at finding that her feelings could be consulted only by sacrificing those of another woman miss dacre quite confident that as lady aphrodite was innocent in the present instance she must be immaculate told everything to her father and stifling her tears begged him to make all public but mr dacre after due consideration enjoined silence  in the meantime the young duke was not in so calm a mood as sir lucius rapidly the late extraordinary events dashed through his mind and already those feelings which had prompted his soliloquy in the garden were no longer his all forms all images all ideas all memory melted into miss dacre he felt that he loved her with a perfect love that she was to him what no other woman had been even in the factitious delirium of early passion a thought of her seemed to bring an entirely novel train of feelings impressions wishes hopes the world with her must be a totally different system and his existence in her society a new and another life her very purity refined the passion which raged even in his exhausted mind gleams of virtue morning streaks of duty broke upon the horizon of his hitherto clouded soul an obscure suspicion of the utter worthlessness of his life whispered in his hollow ear he darkly felt that happiness was too philosophical a system to be the result or the reward of impulse however unbounded and that principle alone could create and could support that bliss which is our beings end and aim  but when he turned to himself he viewed his situation with horror and yielded almost to despair what what could she think of the impure libertine who dared to adore her if ever time could bleach his own soul and conciliate hers what what was to become of aphrodite was his new career to commence by a new crime was he to desert this creature of his affections and break a heart which beat only for him it seemed that the only compensation he could offer for a life which had achieved no good would be to establish the felicity of the only being whose happiness seemed in his power yet what a prospect if before he had trembled now  but his harrowed mind and exhausted body no longer allowed him even anxiety weak yet excited his senses fled and when arundel dacre returned in the evening he found his friend delirious he sat by his bed for hours suddenly the duke speaks arundel dacre rises he leans over the sufferers couch  ah why turns the face of the listener so pale and why gleam those eyes with terrible fire the perspiration courses down his clear but sallow cheek he throws his dark and clustering curls aside and passes his hand over his damp brow as if to ask whether he too had lost his senses from this fray  the duke is agitated he waves his arm in the air and calls out in a tone of defiance and of hate his voice sinks it seems that he breathes a milder language and speaks to some softer being there is no sound save the longdrawn breath of one on whose countenance is stamped infinite amazement arundel dacre walks the room disturbed often he pauses plunged in deep thought tis an hour past midnight and he quits the bedside of the young duke  he pauses at the threshold and seems to respire even the noisome air of the metropolis as if it were eden as he proceeds down hill street he stops and gazes for a moment on the opposite house what passes in his mind we know not perhaps he is reminded that in that mansion dwell beauty wealth and influence and that all might be his perhaps love prompts that gaze perhaps ambition is it passion or is it power or does one struggle with the other  as he gazes the door opens but without servants and a man deeply shrouded in his cloak comes out it was night and the individual was disguised but there are eyes which can pierce at all seasons and through all concealments and arundel dacre marked with astonishment sir lucius grafton     chapter xiv       reconciliation  when it was understood that the duke of st james had been delirious public feeling reached what is called its height that is to say the curiosity and the ignorance of the world were about equal everybody was indignant not so much because the young duke had been shot but because they did not know why if the sympathy of the women could have consoled him our hero might have been reconciled to his fate among these no one appeared more anxious as to the result and more ignorant as to the cause than mrs dallington vere arundel dacre called on her the morning ensuing his midnight observation but understood that she had not seen sir lucius grafton who they said had quitted london which she thought probable nevertheless arundel thought proper to walk down hill street at the same hour and if not at the same minute yet in due course of time he discovered the absent man  in two or three days the young duke was declared out of immediate danger though his attendants must say he remained exceedingly restless and by no means in a satisfactory state yet with their aid they had a right to hope the best at any rate if he were to go off his friends would have the satisfaction of remembering that all had been done that could be so saying dr x took his fee and surgeons y and z prevented his conduct from being singular  now began the operations on the grafton side a letter from lady aphrodite full of distraction she was fairly mystified what could have induced lucy suddenly to act so puzzled her as well it might her despair and yet her confidence in his grace seemed equally great some talk there was of going off to cleve at once her husband on the whole maintained a rigid silence and studied coolness yet he had talked of vienna and florence and even murmured something about public disgrace and public ridicule in short the poor lady was fairly worn out and wished to terminate her harassing career at once by cutting the gordian knot in a word she proposed coming on to her admirer and as she supposed her victim and having the satisfaction of giving him his cooling draughts and arranging his bandages  if the meeting between the young duke and sir lucius grafton had been occasioned by any other cause than the real one it is difficult to say what might have been the fate of this proposition our own opinion is that this work would have been only in one volume for the requisite morality would have made out the present one but as it was the image of miss dacre hovered above our hero as his guardian genius he despaired of ever obtaining her but yet he determined not wilfully to crush all hope some great effort must be made to right his position lady aphrodite must not be deserted the very thought increased his fever he wrote to gain time but another billet in immediate answer only painted increased terrors and described the growing urgency of her persecuted situation he was driven into a corner but even a stag at bay is awful what then must be a young duke the most noble animal in existence  ill as he was he wrote these lines not to lady aphrodite but to her husband   my dear grafton  you will be surprised at hearing from me is it necessary for me to assure you that my interference on a late occasion was accidental and can you for a moment maintain that under the circumstances i could have acted in a different manner i regret the whole business but most i regret that we were placed in collision  i am ready to cast all memory of it into oblivion and as i unintentionally offended i indulge the hope that in this conduct you will bear me company  surely men like us are not to be dissuaded from following our inclinations by any fear of the opinion of the world the whole affair is at present a mystery and i think with our united fancies some explanation may be hit upon which will render the mystery quite impenetrable while it professes to offer a satisfactory solution  i do not know whether this letter expresses my meaning for my mind is somewhat agitated and my head not very clear but if you be inclined to understand it in the right spirit it is sufficiently lucid at any rate my dear grafton i have once more the pleasure of subscribing myself faithfully yours  st james   this letter was marked immediate consigned to the custody of luigi with positive orders to deliver it personally to sir lucius and if not at home to follow till he found him  he was not at home and he was found ats clubhouse sullen dissatisfied with himself doubtful as to the result of his fresh manouvres and brooding over his infernal debts sir lucius had stepped into and passed the whole morning playing desperately with lord hounslow and baron de berghem never had he experienced such a smashing morning he had long far exceeded his resources and was proceeding with a vague idea that he should find money somehow or other when this note was put into his hand as it seemed to him by providence the signature of semiramis could not have imparted more exquisite delight to a collector of autographs were his long views his complicated objects and doubtful results to be put in competition a moment with so decided so simple and so certain a benefit certainly not by a gamester he rose from the table and with strange elation wrote these lines   my dearest friend  you forgive me but can i forgive myself i am plunged in overwhelming grief shall i come on your mad but devoted friend  lucius grafton  the duke of st james   they met the same day after a long consultation it was settled that peacock piggott should be entrusted in confidence with the secret of the affair merely a drunken squabble growing out of the bird of paradise wine jealousy an artful woman and headstrong youth will account for anything they accounted for the present affair the story was believed because the world were always puzzled at lady aphrodite being the cause the baronet proceeded with promptitude to make the version pass current he indicted the universe and the new world he prosecuted the caricaturists and was seen everywhere with his wife the universe and the new world revenged themselves on the signora and then she indicted them they could not now even libel an opera singer with impunity where was the boasted liberty of the press  in the meantime the young duke once more easy in his mind wonderfully recovered and on the eighth day after the ball of beauty he returned to the pavilion which had now resumed its usual calm character for fresh air and soothing quiet     chapter xv       arundels warning  in the morning of the young dukes departure for twickenham as miss dacre and lady caroline st maurice were sitting together at the house of the former and moralising over the last nights ball mr arundel dacre was announced  you have just arrived in time to offer your congratulations arundel on an agreeable event said miss dacre lord st maurice is about to lead to the hymeneal altar  lady sophy wrekin i know it  how extremely diplomatic the attaché in your very air i thought of course i was to surprise you but future ambassadors have such extraordinary sources of information  mine is a simple one the duchess imagining i suppose that my attentions were directed to the wrong lady warned me some weeks past however my congratulations shall be duly paid lady caroline st maurice allow me to express  all that you ought to feel said miss dacre but men at the present day pride themselves on insensibility  do you think i am insensible lady caroline asked arundel  i must protest against unfair questions said her ladyship  but it is not unfair you are a person who have now seen me more than once and therefore according to may you ought to have a perfect knowledge of my character moreover you do not share the prejudices of my family i ask you then do you think i am so heartless as may would insinuate  does she insinuate so much  does she not call me insensible because i am not in raptures that your brother is about to marry a young lady who for aught she knows may be the object of my secret adoration  arundel you are perverse said miss dacre  no may i am logical  i have always heard that logic is much worse than wilfulness said lady caroline  but arundel always was both said miss dacre he is not only unreasonable but he will always prove that he is right here is your purse sir she added with a smile presenting him with the result of her weeks labour  this is the way she always bribes me lady caroline do you approve of this corruption  i must confess i have a slight though secret kindness for a little bribery mamma is now on her way to mortimers on a corrupt embassy the nouvelle mariée you know must be reconciled to her change of lot by quite a new set of playthings i can give you no idea of the necklace that our magnificent cousin in spite of his wound has sent sophy  but then such a cousin said miss dacre a young duke like the young lady in the fairy tale should scarcely ever speak without producing brilliants  sophy is highly sensible of the attention as she amusingly observed except himself marrying her he could scarcely do more i hear the carriage adieu love good morning mr dacre  allow me to see you to your carriage i am to dine at fitzpompey house today i believe  arundel dacre returned to his cousin and seating himself at the table took up a book and began reading it the wrong side upwards then he threw down a ball of silk then he cracked a knittingneedle and then with a husky sort of voice and a half blush and altogether an air of infinite confusion he said this has been an odd affair may of the duke of st james and sir lucius grafton  a very distressing affair arundel  how singular that i should have been his second may  could he have found anyone more fit for that office arundel  i think he might i must say this that had i known at the time the cause of the fray i should have refused to accompany him  she was silent and he resumed  an opera singer at the best sir lucius grafton showed more discrimination peacock piggott was just the character for his place and i think my principal too might have found a more congenial spirit what do you think may  really arundel this is a subject of which i know nothing  indeed well it is odd may but do you know i have a queer suspicion that you know more about it than anybody else  i arundel she exclaimed with marked confusion  yes you may he repeated with firmness and looked her in the face with a glance which would read her soul ay i am sure you do  who says so  oh do not fear that you have been betrayed no one says it but i know it we future ambassadors you know have such extraordinary sources of information  you jest arundel on a grave subject  grave yes it is grave may dacre it is grave that there should be secrets between us it is grave that our house should have been insulted it is grave that you of all others should have been outraged but oh it is much more grave it is bitter that any other arm than this should have avenged the wrong he rose from his chair he paced the room in agitation and gnashed his teeth with a vindictive expression that he tried not to suppress  o my cousin my dear dear cousin spare me she hid her face in her hands yet she continued speaking in a broken voice i did it for the best it was to suppress strife to prevent bloodshed i knew your temper and i feared for your life yet i told my father i told him all and it was by his advice that i have maintained throughout the silence which i perhaps too hastily at first adopted  my own dear may spare me i cannot mark a tear from you without a pang how i came to know this you wonder it was the delirium of that person who should not have played so proud a part in this affair and who is yet our friend it was his delirium that betrayed all in the madness of his excited brain he reacted the frightful scene declared the outrage and again avenged it yet believe me i am not tempted by any petty feeling of showing i am not ignorant of what is considered a secret to declare all this i know i feel your silence was for the best that it was prompted by sweet and holy feelings for my sake believe me my dear cousin if anything could increase the infinite affection with which i love you it would be the consciousness that at all times whenever my image crosses your mind it is to muse for my benefit or to extenuate my errors  dear may you who know me better than the world know well my heart is not a mass of ice and you who are ever so ready to find a good reason even for my most wilful conduct and an excuse for my most irrational will easily credit that in interfering in an affair in which you are concerned i am not influenced by an unworthy an officious or a meddling spirit no dear may it is because i think it better for you that we should speak upon this subject that i have ventured to treat upon it perhaps i broke it in a crude but credit me not in an unkind spirit i am well conscious i have a somewhat ungracious manner but you who have pardoned it so often will excuse it now to be brief it is of your companion to that accursed fête that i would speak  mrs dallington  surely she avoid her may i do not like that woman you know i seldom speak at hazard if i do not speak more distinctly now it is because i will never magnify suspicions into certainties which we must do even if we mention them but i suspect greatly suspect an open rupture would be disagreeable would be unwarrantable would be impolitic the season draws to a close quit town somewhat earlier than usual and in the meantime receive her if necessary but if possible never alone you have many friends and if no other lady caroline st maurice is worthy of your society  he bent down his head and kissed her forehead she pressed his faithful hand  and now dear may let me speak of a less important object of myself i find this borough a mere delusion every day new difficulties arise and every day my chance seems weaker i am wasting precious time for one who should be in action i think then of returning to vienna and at once i have some chance of being appointed secretary of embassy and i then shall have achieved what was the great object of my life independence  this is always a sorrowful subject to me arundel you have cherished such strange do not be offended if i say such erroneous ideas on the subject of what you call independence that i feel that upon it we can consult neither with profit to you nor satisfaction to myself independence who is independent if the heir of dacre bow to anyone independence who can be independent if the future head of one of the first families in this great country will condescend to be the secretary even of a king  we have often talked of this may and perhaps i have carried a morbid feeling to some excess but my paternal blood flows in these veins and it is too late to change i know not how it is but i seem misplaced in life my existence is a long blunder  too late to change dearest arundel oh thank you for those words can it can it ever be too late to acknowledge error particularly if by that very acknowledgment we not only secure our own happiness but that of those we love and those who love us  dear may when i talk with you i talk with my good genius but i am in closer and more constant converse with another mind and of that i am the slave it is my own i will not conceal from you from whom i have concealed nothing that doubts and dark misgivings of the truth and wisdom of my past feelings and my past career will ever and anon flit across my fancy and obtrude themselves upon my consciousness your fatheryes i feel that i have not been to him what nature intended and what he deserved  o arundel she said with streaming eyes he loves you like a son yet yet be one  he seated himself on the sofa by her side and took her small hand and bathed it with his kisses  my sweet and faithful friend my very sister i am overpowered with feelings to which i have hitherto been a stranger there is a cause for all this contest of my passions it must out my being has changed the scales have fallen from my sealed eyes and the fountain of my heart oerflows life seems to have a new purpose and existence a new cause listen to me listen and if you can may comfort me     chapter xvi       three graces  at twickenham the young duke recovered rapidly not altogether displeased with his recent conduct his selfcomplacency assisted his convalescence sir lucius grafton visited him daily regularly about four or five oclock he galloped down to the pavilion with the last on dit some gay message from whites a mot of lord squib or a trait of charles annesley but while he studied to amuse the wearisome hours of his imprisoned friend in the midst of all his gaiety an interesting contrition was ever breaking forth not so much by words as looks it was evident that sir lucius although he dissembled his affliction was seriously affected by the consequence of his rash passion and his amiable victim whose magnanimous mind was incapable of harbouring an inimical feeling and ever respondent to a soft and generous sentiment felt actually more aggrieved for his unhappy friend than for himself of arundel dacre the duke had not seen much that gentleman never particularly sympathised with sir lucius grafton and now he scarcely endeavoured to conceal the little pleasure which he received from the baronets society sir lucius was the last man not to detect this mood but as he was confident that the duke had not betrayed him he could only suppose that miss dacre had confided the affair to her family and therefore under all circumstances he thought it best to be unconscious of any alteration in arundel dacres intercourse with him civil therefore they were when they met the baronet was even courteous but they both mutually avoided each other  at the end of three weeks the duke of st james returned to town in perfect condition and received the congratulations of his friends mr dacre had been of the few who had been permitted to visit him at twickenham nothing had then passed between them on the cause of his illness but his grace could not but observe that the manner of his valued friend was more than commonly cordial and miss dacre with her father was among the first to hail his return to health and the metropolis  the bird of paradise who since the incident had been several times in hysterics and had written various notes of three or four lines each of enquiries and entreaties to join her noble friend had been kept off from twickenham by the masterly tactics of lord squib she however would drive to the dukes house the day after his arrival in town and was with him when sundry loud knocks in quick succession announced an approaching levée he locked her up in his private room and hastened to receive the compliments of his visitors in the same apartment among many others he had the pleasure of meeting for the first time lady aphrodite grafton lady caroline st maurice and miss dacre all women whom he had either promised intended or offered to marry a curious situation this and really when our hero looked upon them once more and viewed them in delightful rivalry advancing with their congratulations he was not surprised at the feelings with which they had inspired him far far exceeding the bonhomie of macheath the duke could not resist remembering that had it been his fortune to have lived in the land in which his historiographer will soon be wandering in short to have been a pacha instead of a peer he might have married all three  a prettier fellow and three prettier women had never met since the immortal incident of ida  it required the thorough breeding of lady afy to conceal the anxiety of her passion miss dacres eyes showered triple sunshine as she extended a hand not too often offered but lady caroline was a cousin and consanguinity therefore authorised as well as accounted for the warmth of her greeting     chapter xvii       a second refusal  a very few days after his return the duke of st james dined with mr dacre it was the first time that he had dined with him during the season the fitzpompeys were there and among others his grace had the pleasure of again meeting a few of his yorkshire friends  once more he found himself at the right hand of miss dacre all his career since his arrival in england flitted across his mind doncaster dear doncaster where he had first seen her teemed only with delightful reminiscences to a man whose favourite had bolted such is the magic of love then came castle dacre and the orange terrace and their airy romps and the delightful party to hauteville and then dacre abbey an involuntary shudder seemed to damp all the ardour of his soul but when he turned and looked upon her beaming face he could not feel miserable  he thought that he had never been at so agreeable a party in his life yet it was chiefly composed of the very beings whom he daily execrated for their powers of boredom and he himself was not very entertaining he was certainly more silent than loquacious and found himself often gazing with mute admiration on the little mouth every word breathed forth from which seemed inspiration yet he was happy oh what happiness is his who dotes upon a woman few could observe from his conduct what was passing in his mind yet the quivering of his softened tones and the mild lustre of his mellowed gaze his subdued and quiet manner his unperceived yet infinite attentions his memory of little incidents that all but lovers would have forgotten the total absence of all compliment and gallantry and repartee all these to a fine observer might have been gentle indications of a strong passion and to her to whom they were addressed sufficiently intimated that no change had taken place in his feelings since the warm hour in which he first whispered his oerpowering love  the ladies retired and the duke of st james fell into a reverie a political discourse of elaborate genius now arose lord fitzpompey got parliamentary young faulcon made his escape having previously whispered to another youth not unheard by the duke of st james that his mother was about to depart and he was convoy his grace too had heard lady fitzpompey say that she was going early to the opera shortly afterwards parties evidently retired but the debate still raged lord fitzpompey had caught a stout yorkshire squire and was delightedly astounding with official graces his stern opponent a sudden thought occurred to the duke he stole out of the room and gained the saloon  he found it almost empty with sincere pleasure he bid lady balmont who was on the point of departure farewell and promised to look in at her box he seated himself by lady greville nugent and dexterously made her follow lady balmonts example she withdrew with the conviction that his grace would not be a moment behind her there were only old mrs hungerford and her rich daughter remaining they were in such raptures with miss dacres singing that his grace was quite in despair but chance favoured him even old mrs hungerford this night broke through her rule of not going to more than one house and she drove off to lady de courcys  they were alone it is sometimes an awful thing to be alone with those we love  sing that again asked the duke imploringly it is my favourite air it always reminds me of dacre  she sang she ceased she sang with beauty and she ceased with grace but all unnoticed by the tumultuous soul of her adoring guest his thoughts were intent upon a greater object the opportunity was sweet and yet those boisterous wassailers they might spoil all  do you know that this is the first time that i have seen your rooms lit up said the duke  is it possible i hope they gain the approbation of so distinguished a judge  i admire them exceedingly bythebye i see a new cabinet in the next room swaby told me the other day that you were one of his ladypatronesses i wish you would show it me i am very curious in cabinets  she rose and they advanced to the end of another and a longer room  this is a beautiful saloon said the duke how long is it  i really do not know but i think between forty and fifty feet  oh you must be mistaken forty or fifty feet i am an excellent judge of distances i will try forty or fifty feet ah the next room included let us walk to the end of the next room each of my paces shall be one foot and a half  they had now arrived at the end of the third room  let me see resumed the duke you have a small room to the right oh did i not hear that you had made a conservatory i see i see it lit up too let us go in i want to gain some hints about london conservatories  it was not exactly a conservatory but a balcony of large dimensions had been fitted up on each side with coloured glass and was open to the gardens it was a rich night of fragrant june the moon and stars were as bright as if they had shone over the terrace of dacre and the perfume of the flowers reminded him of his favourite orangetrees the mild cool scene was such a contrast to the hot and noisy chamber they had recently quitted that for a moment they were silent  you are not afraid of this delicious air asked his grace  midsummer air said miss dacre must surely be harmless  again there was silence and miss dacre after having plucked a flower and tended a plant seemed to express an intention of withdrawing suddenly he spoke and in a gushing voice of heartfelt words  miss dacre you are too kind too excellent to be offended if i dare to ask whether anything could induce you to view with more indulgence one who sensibly feels how utterly he is unworthy of you  you are the last person whose feelings i should wish to hurt let us not revive a conversation to which i can assure you neither of us looks back with satisfaction  is there then no hope must i ever live with the consciousness of being the object of your scorn  oh no no as you will speak let us understand each other however i may approve of my decision i have lived quite long enough to repent the manner in which it was conveyed i cannot without the most unfeigned regret i cannot for a moment remember that i have addressed a bitter word to one to whom i am under the greatest obligations if my apologies  pray pray be silent  i must speak if my apologies my complete my most humble apologies can be any compensation for treating with such lightness feelings which i now respect and offers by which i now consider myself honoured accept them  o miss dacre that fatal word respect  we have warmer words in this house for you you are now our friend  i dare not urge a suit which may offend you yet if you could read my heart i sometimes think that we might be happy let me hope  my dear duke of st james i am sure you will not ever offend me because i am sure you will not ever wish to do it there are few people in this world for whom i entertain a more sincere regard than yourself i am convinced i am conscious that when we met i did sufficient justice neither to your virtues nor your talents it is impossible for me to express with what satisfaction i now feel that you have resumed that place in the affections of this family to which you have an hereditary right i am grateful truly sincerely grateful for all that you feel with regard to me individually and believe me in again expressing my regret that it is not in my power to view you in any other light than as a valued friend i feel that i am pursuing that conduct which will conduce as much to your happiness as my own  my happiness miss dacre  indeed such is my opinion i will not again endeavour to depreciate the feelings which you entertain for me and by which ever remember i feel honoured but these very feelings prevent you from viewing their object so dispassionately as i do  i am at a loss for your meaning at least favour me by speaking explicitly you see i respect your sentiments and do not presume to urge that on which my very happiness depends  to be brief then i will not affect to conceal that marriage is a state which has often been the object of my meditations i think it the duty of all women that so important a change in their destiny should be well considered if i know anything of myself i am convinced that i should never survive an unhappy marriage  but why dream of anything so utterly impossible  so very probable so very certain you mean ay i repeat my words for they are truth if i ever marry it is to devote every feeling and every thought each hour each instant of existence to a single being for whom i alone live such devotion i expect in return without it i should die or wish to die but such devotion can never be returned by you  you amaze me i who live only on your image  your education the habits in which you are brought up the maxims which have been instilled into you from your infancy the system which each year of your life has more matured the worldly levity with which everything connected with woman is viewed by you and your companions whatever may be your natural dispositions all this would prevent you all this would render it a perfect impossibility all this will ever make you utterly unconscious of the importance of the subject on which we are now conversing pardon me for saying it you know not of what you speak yes however sincere may be the expression of your feelings to me this moment i shudder to think on whom your memory dwelt even this hour but yesterday i never will peril my happiness on such a chance but there are others who do not think as i do  miss dacre save me if you knew all you would not doubt this moment is my destiny  my dear duke of st james save yourself there is yet time you have my prayers  let me then hope  indeed indeed it cannot be here our conversation on this subject ends for ever  yet we part friends he spoke in a broken voice  the best and truest she extended her arm he pressed her hand to his impassioned lips and quitted the house mad with love and misery     chapter xviii       joys of the alhambra  the duke threw himself into his carriage in that mood which fits us for desperate deeds what he intended to do indeed was doubtful but something very vigorous very decided perhaps very terrible an indefinite great effort danced in misty magnificence before the vision of his mind his whole being was to be changed his life was to be revolutionised such an alteration was to take place that even she could not doubt the immense yet incredible result then despair whispered its coldblooded taunts and her last hopeless words echoed in his ear but he was too agitated to be calmly miserable and in the poignancy of his feelings he even meditated death one thing however he could obtain one instant relief was yet in his power solitude he panted for the loneliness of his own chamber broken only by his agitated musings  the carriage stopped the lights and noise called him to life this surely could not be home whirled open the door down dashed the steps with all that prompt precision which denotes the practised hand of an aristocratic retainer 284  what is all this symmons why did you not drive home  your grace forgets that mr annesley and some gentlemen sup with your grace tonight at the alhambra  impossible drive home  your grace perhaps forgets that your grace is expected said the experienced servant who knew when to urge a master who tomorrow might blame him for permitting his caprice  what am i to do stay here i will run upstairs and put them off  he ran up into the crushroom the opera was just over and some parties who were not staying the ballet had already assembled there as he passed along he was stopped by lady fitzpompey who would not let such a capital opportunity escape of exhibiting caroline and the young duke together  mr bulkley said her ladyship there must be something wrong about the carriage an experienced middleaged gentleman who jobbed on in society by being always ready and knowing his cue resigned the arm of lady caroline st maurice and disappeared  george said lady fitzpompey give your arm to carry just for one moment  if it had been anybody but his cousin the duke would easily have escaped but caroline he invariably treated with marked regard perhaps because his conscience occasionally reproached him that he had not treated her with a stronger feeling at this moment too she was the only being in the world save one whom he could remember with satisfaction he felt that he loved her most affectionately but somehow she did not inspire him with those peculiar feelings which thrilled his heart at the recollection of may dacre  in this mood he offered an arm which was accepted but he could not in a moment assume the tone of mind befitting his situation and the scene he was silent for him a remarkable circumstance  do not stay here said lady caroline is a soft voice which her mother could not overhear i know you want to be away steal off  where can i be better than with you carry said the young duke determined not to leave her and loving her still more for her modest kindness and thereon he turned round and to show that he was sincere began talking with his usual spirit mr bulkley of course never returned and lady fitzpompey felt as satisfied with her diplomatic talents as a plenipotentiary who has just arranged an advantageous treaty  arundel dacre came up and spoke to lady fitzpompey never did two persons converse together who were more dissimilar in their manner and their feelings and yet arundel dacre did contrive to talk a result which he could not always accomplish even with those who could sympathise with him lady fitzpompey listened to him with attention for arundel dacre in spite of his odd manner or perhaps in some degree in consequence of it had obtained a distinguished reputation both among men and women and it was the great principle of lady fitzpompey to attach to her the distinguished youth of both sexes she was pleased with this public homage of arundel dacre because he was one who with the reputation of talents family and fashion seldom spoke to anyone and his attentions elevated their object thus she maintained her empire  st maurice now came up to excuse himself to the young duke for not attending at the alhambra tonight sophy could not bear it he whispered she had got her head full of the most ridiculous fancies and it was in vain to speak so he had promised to give up that as well as crockfords  this reminded our hero of his party and the purpose of his entering the opera he determined not to leave caroline till her carriage was called and he began to think that he really must go to the alhambra after all he resolved to send them off at an early hour  anything new tonight henry asked his grace of lord st maurice i have just come in  oh then you have seen them  seen whom  the most knowing forestieri we ever had we have been speaking of nothing else the whole evening has not caroline told you arundel dacre introduced me to them  who are they  i forget their names dacre how do you call the heroes of the night dacre never answers did you ever observe that but see there they come  the duke turned and observed lord darrell advancing with two gentlemen with whom his grace was well acquainted these were prince charles de whiskerburg and count frill  m de whiskerburg was the eldest son of a prince who besides being the premier noble of the empire possessed in his own country a very pretty park of two or three hundred miles in circumference in the boundaries of which the imperial mandate was not current but hid its diminished head before the supremacy of a subject worshipped under the title of john the twentyfourth m de whiskerburg was a young man tall with a fine figure and fine features in short a sort of hungarian apollo only his beard his mustachios his whiskers his favoris his padishas his sultanas his mignonettas his dulcibellas did not certainly entitle him to the epithet of imberbis and made him rather an apter representative of the hungarian hercules  count frill was a different sort of personage he was all rings and ringlets ruffles and a little rouge much older than his companion short in stature plump in figure but with a most defined waist fair blooming with a multiplicity of long light curls and a perpetual smile playing upon his round countenance he looked like the cupid of an opera olympus  the duke of st james had been intimate with these distinguished gentlemen in their own country and had received from them many and distinguished attentions often had he expressed to them his sincere desire to greet them in his native land their mutual anxiety of never again meeting was now removed if his heart instead of being bruised had been absolutely broken still honour conscience the glory of his house his individual reputation alike urged him not to be cold or backward at such a moment he advanced therefore with a due mixture of grace and warmth and congratulated them on their arrival at this moment lady fitzpompeys carriage was announced promising to return to them in an instant he hastened to his cousin but mr arundel dacre had already offered his arm which for arundel dacre was really pretty well  the duke was now glad that he had a small reunion this evening as he could at once pay a courtesy to his foreign friends he ran into the signoras dressingroom to assure her of his presence he stumbled upon peacock piggott as he came out and summoned him to fill the vacant place of st maurice and then sent him with a message to some friends who yet lingered in their box and whose presence he thought might be an agreeable addition to the party  you entered the alhambra by a saracenic cloister from the ceiling of which an occasional lamp threw a gleam upon some eastern arms hung up against the wall this passage led to the armoury a room of moderate dimensions but hung with rich contents many an inlaid breastplate many a mameluke scimitar and damascus blade many a gemmed pistol and pearlembroidered saddle might there be seen though viewed in a subdued and quiet light all seemed hushed and still and shrouded in what had the reputation of being a palace of pleasure  in this chamber assembled the expected guests and having all arrived they proceeded down a small gallery to the banquetingroom the room was large and lofty it was fitted up as an eastern tent the walls were hung with scarlet cloth tied up with ropes of gold round the room crouched recumbent lions richly gilt who grasped in their paws a lance the top of which was a coloured lamp the ceiling was emblazoned with the hauteville arms and was radiant with burnished gold a cresset lamp was suspended from the centre of the shield and not only emitted an equable flow of soft though brilliant light but also as the aromatic oil wasted away distilled an exquisite perfume  the table blazed with golden plate for the bird of paradise loved splendour at the end of the room under a canopy and upon a throne the shield and vases lately executed for his grace now appeared everything was gorgeous costly and imposing but there was no pretence save in the original outline at maintaining the oriental character the furniture was french and opposite the throne canovas hebe bounded with a golden cup from a pedestal of ormolu  the guests are seated but after a few minutes the servants withdraw small tables of ebony and silver and dumb waiters of ivory and gold conveniently stored are at hand and spiridion never leaves the room the repast was refined exquisite various it was one of those meetings where all eat when a few persons easy and unconstrained unencumbered with cares and of dispositions addicted to enjoyment get together at past midnight it is extraordinary what an appetite they evince singers also are proverbially prone to gourmandise and though the bird of paradise unfortunately possessed the smallest mouth in all singingland it is astonishing how she pecked but they talked as well as feasted and were really gay  prince said the duke i hope madame de harestein approves of your trip to england  the prince only smiled for he was of a silent disposition and therefore wonderfully well suited his travelling companion  poor madame de harestein exclaimed count frill what despair she was in when you left vienna my dear duke i did what i could to amuse her i used to take my guitar and sing to her morning and night but without effect she certainly would have died of a broken heart if it had not been for the dancingdogs  did they bite her asked a lady who affected the wit of lord squib and so inoculate her with gaiety  everybody was mad about the dancingdogs they came from peru and danced the mazurka in green jackets with a jabot oh what a jabot  i dislike animals excessively remarked another lady who was as refined as mr annesley her model  dislike the dancingdogs said count frill ah my good lady you would have been enchanted even the kaiser fed them with pistachio nuts oh so pretty delicate leetle things soft shining little legs and pretty little faces so sensible and with such jabots  i assure you they were excessively amusing said the prince in a soft confidential undertone to his neighbour mrs montfort who was as dignified as she was beautiful and who admiring his silence which she took for state smiled and bowed with fascinating condescension  and what else has happened very remarkable count since i left you asked lord darrell  nothing nothing my dear darrell this bêtise of a war has made us all serious if old clamstandt had not married that gipsy little dugiria i really think i should have taken a turn to belgrade  you should not eat so much poppet drawled charles annesley to a spanish danseuse tall dusky and lithe glancing like a lynx and graceful as a jennet she was very silent but no doubt indicated the possession of cervantic humour by the sly calmness with which she exhausted her own waiter and pillaged her neighbours  why not said a little french actress highly finished like a miniature who scarcely ate anything but drank champagne and chatted with equal rapidity and composure and who was always ready to fight anybodys battle provided she could get an opportunity to talk why not mr annesley you never will let anybody eat i never eat myself because every night having to talk so much i am dry dry dry so i drink drink drink it is an extraordinary thing that there is no language which makes you so thirsty as french  what can be the reason asked a sister of mrs montfort a tall fair girl who looked sentimental but was only silly  because there is so much salt in it said lord squib  delia drawled mr annesley you look very pretty tonight  i am charmed to charm you mr annesley shall i tell you what lord bon mot said of you  no ma mignonne i never wish to hear my own good things  spoiled you should add said the fair rival of lord squib if bon mot be in the case  lord bon mot is a most gentlemanlike man said delia indignant at an admirer being attacked he always wants to be amusing whenever he dines out he comes and sits with me for half an hour to catch the air of the parisian badinage  and you tell him a variety of little things asked lord squib insidiously drawing out the secret tactics of bon mot  beaucoup beaucoup said delia extending two little white hands sparkling with gems if he come in ever so how do you call it heavy not that in the domps ah it is that if ever he come in the domps he goes out always like a soufflée  as empty i have no doubt said the witty lady  and as sweet i have no doubt said lord squib for delcroix complains sadly of your excesses delia  mr delcroix complain of me that indeed is too bad just because i recommend montmorency de versailles to him for an excellent customer ever since he abuses me merely because montmorency has forgot in the hurry of going off to pay his little account  but he says you have got all the things said lord squib whose great amusement was to put delia in a passion  what of that screamed the little lady montmorency gave them me  dont make such a noise said the bird of paradise i never can eat when there is a noise duke continued she in a fretful tone they make such a noise  annesley keep squib quiet  delia leave that young man alone if isidora would talk a little more and you eat a little more i think you would be the most agreeable little ladies i know poppet put those bonbons in your pocket you should never eat sugarplums in company  thus talking agreeable nonsense tasting agreeable dishes and sipping agreeable wines an hour ran on sweetest music from an unseen source ever and anon sounded and spiridion swung a censer full of perfumes round the chamber at length the duke requested count frill to give them a song the bird of paradise would never sing for pleasure only for fame and a slight cheque the count begged to decline and at the same time asked for a guitar the signora sent for hers and his excellency preluding with a beautiful simper gave them some slight thing to this effect       i       charming bignetta charming bignetta      what a gay little girl is charming bignetta      she dances she prattles      she rides and she rattles      but she always is charming that charming bignetta        ii       charming bignetta charming bignetta      what a wild little witch is charming bignetta      when she smiles im all madness      when she frowns im all sadness      but she always is smiling that charming bignetta        iii       charming bignetta charming bignetta      what a wicked young rogue is charming bignetta      she laughs at my shyness      and flirts with his highness      yet still she is charming that charming bignetta        iv       charming bignetta charming bignetta      what a dear little girl is charming bignetta      think me only a sister      said she trembling i kissed her      what a charming young sister is charming bignetta   to choicer music chimed his gay guitar in estes halls yet still his song served its purpose for it raised a smile  i wrote that for madame sapiepha at the congress of verona said count frill it has been thought amusing  madame sapiepha exclaimed the bird of paradise what that pretty little woman who has such pretty caps  the same ah what caps what taste  you like caps then asked the bird of paradise with a sparkling eye  oh if there be anything more than another that i know most it is the cap here said he rather oddly unbuttoning his waistcoat you see what lace i have got  ah me what lace exclaimed the bird in rapture duke look at his lace come here sit next to me let me look at that lace she examined it with great attention then turned up her beautiful eyes with a fascinating smile ah cest jolie nestce pas but you like caps i tell you what you shall see my caps spiridion go mon cher and tell maamselle to bring my caps all my caps one of each set  in due time entered the swiss with the caps all the caps one of each set as she handed them in turn to her mistress the bird chirped a panegyric upon each  that is pretty is it not and this also but this is my favourite what do you think of this border cest belle cette garniture et ce jabot cest trèsséduisant nestce pas mais voici the cap of princess lichtenstein cest superb cest mon favori but i also love very much this of the duchess de berri she gave me the pattern herself and after all this cornette à petite santé of lady blaze is a dear little thing then again this coiffe à dentelle of lady macaroni is quite a pet  pass them down said lord squib we want to look at them accordingly they were passed down lord squib put one on  do i look superb sentimental or only pretty asked his lordship the example was contagious and most of the caps were appropriated no one laughed more than their mistress who not having the slightest idea of the value of money would have given them all away on the spot not from any goodnatured feeling but from the remembrance that tomorrow she might amuse half an hour in buying others  whilst some were stealing and she remonstrating the duke clapped his hands like a caliph the curtain at the end of the apartment was immediately withdrawn and the ballroom stood revealed  it was the same size as the banquetinghall its walls exhibited a long perspective of golden pilasters the frequent piers of which were of lookingglass save where occasionally a picture had been as it were inlaid in its rich frame here was the titian venus of the tribune deliciously copied by a french artist there the roman fornarina with her delicate grace beamed like the personification of raffaelles genius here zuleikha living in the light and shade of that magician guercino in vain summoned the passions of the blooming hebrew and there cleopatra preparing for her last immortal hour proved by what we saw that guido had been a lover  the ceiling of this apartment was richly painted and richly gilt from it were suspended three lustres by golden cords which threw a softened light upon the floor of polished and curiously inlaid woods at the end of the apartment was an orchestra  round the room waltzed the elegant revellers softly and slowly led by their host they glided along like spirits of air but each time that the duke passed the musicians the music became livelier and the motion more brisk till at length you might have mistaken them for a college of spinning dervishes one by one an exhausted couple retreated from the lists some threw themselves on a sofa some monopolised an easy chair but in twenty minutes the whirl had ceased at length peacock piggott gave a groan which denoted returning energy and raised a stretching leg in air bringing up though most unwittingly upon his foot one of the birds sublime and beautiful caps  halloa piggott armed capaupied i see said lord squib this joke was a signal for general resuscitation  the alhambra formed a quadrangle all the chambers were on the basement story in the middle of the court of the quadrangle was a beautiful fountain and the court was formed by a conservatory which was built along each side of the interior square and served like a cloister or covered way for a communication between the different parts of the building to this conservatory they now repaired it was broad full of rare and delicious plants and flowers and brilliantly illuminated busts and statues were intermingled with the fairy grove and a rich warm hue by a skilful arrangement of coloured lights was thrown over many a nymph and fair divinity many a blooming hero and beardless god here they lounged in different parties talking on such subjects as idlers ever fall upon now and then plucking a flower now and then listening to the fountain now and then lingering over the distant music and now and then strolling through a small apartment which opened to their walks and which bore the title of the temple of gnidus here canovas venus breathed an atmosphere of perfume and of light that wonderful statue whose fullcharged eye is not very classical to be sure but then how true  while they were thus whiling away their time lord squib proposed a visit to the theatre which he had ordered to be lit up to the theatre they repaired they rambled over every part of the house amused themselves with a visit to the gallery and then collected behind the scenes they were excessively amused with the properties and lord squib proposed they should dress themselves in a few minutes they were all in costume a crowd of queens and chambermaids jews and chimneysweeps lawyers and charleys spanish dons and irish officers rushed upon the stage the little spaniard was almaviva and fell into magnificent attitudes with her sword and plume lord squib was the old woman of brentford and very funny sir lucius grafton harlequin and darrell grimaldi the prince and the count without knowing it figured as watchmen squib whispered annesley that sir lucius otrigger might appear in character but was prudent enough to suppress the joke  the band was summoned and they danced quadrilles with infinite spirit and finished the night at the suggestion of lord squib by breakfasting on the stage by the time this meal was despatched the purple light of morn had broken into the building and the ladies proposed an immediate departure     book iv     chapter i       pen bronnock palace  the arrival of the two distinguished foreigners reanimated the dying season all vied in testifying their consideration and the duke of st james exceeded all he took them to see the alterations at hauteville house which no one had yet witnessed and he asked their opinion of his furniture which no one had yet decided on two fêtes in the same week established as well as maintained his character as the archduke of fashion remembering however the agreeable month which he had spent in the kingdom of john the twentyfourth he was reminded with annoyance that his confusion at hauteville prevented him from receiving his friends en grand seigneur in his hereditary castle metropolitan magnificence which if the parvenu could not equal he at least could imitate seemed a poor return for the feudal splendour and impartial festivity of an hungarian magnate while he was brooding over these reminiscences it suddenly occurred to him that he had never made a progress into his western territories pen bronnock palace was the boast of cornwall though its lord had never paid it a visit the duke of st james sent for sir carte blanche  besides entertaining the foreign nobles the young duke could no longer keep off the constantlyrecurring idea that something must be done to entertain himself he shuddered to think where and what he should have been been had not these gentlemen so providentially arrived as for again repeating the farce of last year he felt that it would no longer raise a smile yorkshire he shunned doncaster made him tremble a week with the duke of burlington at marringworth a fortnight with the fitzpompeys at malthorpe a month with the graftons at cleve and so on he shuddered at the very idea who can see a pantomime more than once who could survive a pantomime the twentieth time all the shifting scenes and flitting splendour all the motley crowds of sparkling characters all the quick changes and full variety are once enchantment but when the splendour is discovered to be monotony the change order and the caprice a system when the characters play ever the same part and the variety never varies how dull how weary how infinitely flat is such a world to that man who requires from its converse not occasional relaxation but constant excitement  pen bronnock was a new object at this moment in his life novelty was indeed a treasure if he could cater for a month no expense should be grudged as for the future he thrust it from his mind by taking up his residence too at pen bronnock he escaped from all invitations and so in a word the worthy knight received orders to make all preparations at the palace for the reception of a large party in the course of three weeks  sir carte as usual did wonders there was fortunately for his employer no time to build or paint but some dingy rooms were hung with scarlet cloth cartloads of new furniture were sent down the theatre was reburnished the stables put in order and what was of infinitely more importance in the estimation of all englishmen the neglected pile was well aired     chapter ii       a dandy from vienna  we are in the country and such a country that even in italy we think of thee native hesperia here myrtles grow and fear no blasting north or blighting east here the south wind blows with that soft breath which brings the bloom to flesh here the land breaks in gentle undulations and here blue waters kiss a verdant shore hail to thy thousand bays and deepred earth thy marble quarries and thy silver veins hail to thy farextending landscape whose sparkling villages and streaky fields no clime can match  some gales we owe to thee of balmy breath some gentle hours when life had fewest charms and we are grateful for all this to say nothing of your cider and your junkets  the duke arrived just as the setting sun crowned the proud palace with his gleamy rays it was a pile which the immortal inigo had raised in sympathy with the taste of a noble employer who had passed his earliest years in lombardy of stone and sometimes even of marble with pediments and balustrades and ornamental windows and richlychased keystones and flights of steps and here and there a statue the structure was quite palladian though a little dingy and on the whole very imposing  there were suites of rooms which had no end and staircases which had no beginning in this vast pile nothing was more natural than to lose your way an agreeable amusement on a rainy morning there was a collection of pictures very various by which phrase we understand not select yet they were amusing and the canalettis were unrivalled there was a regular ballroom and a theatre so resources were at hand the scenes though dusty were numerous and the duke had provided new dresses the park was not a park by which we mean that it was rather a chase than the highlyfinished enclosure which we associate with the first title in fact pen bronnock chase was the right name of the settlement but some monarch travelling having been seized with a spasm recruited his strength under the roof of his loyal subject then the chief seat of the house of hauteville and having in his urgency been obliged to hold a privy council there the supreme title of palace was assumed by right  the domain was bounded on one side by the sea and here a yacht and some slight craft rode at anchor in a small green bay and offered an opportunity for the adventurous and a refuge for the wearied when you have been bored for an hour or two on earth it sometimes is a change to be bored for an hour or two on water  the house was soon full and soon gay the guests and the means of amusing them were equally numerous but this was no common villeggiatura no visit to a family with their regular pursuits and matured avocations the host was as much a guest as any other the young duke appointed lord squib master of the ceremonies and gave orders for nothing but constant excitement constant excitement his lordship managed to maintain for he was experienced clever careless and gay and for once in his life had the command of unbounded resources he ordered he invented he prepared and he expended they acted they danced they sported they sailed they feasted they masqueraded and when they began to get a little wearied of themselves and their own powers of diversion gradually vanished then a public ball was given twice a week at the palace and all the west of england invited new faces brought new ideas new figures brought new fancies all were delighted with the young duke and flattery from novel quarters will for a moment whet even the appetite of the satiated simplicity too can interest there were some misses gayweather who got unearthed who never had been in london though nature had given them sparkling eyes and springing persons this tyranny was too bad papa was quizzed mamma flattered and the daughters simplicity amused these young lordlings rebellion was whispered in the small ears of the gay weathers the little heads too of the gayweathers were turned they were the constant butt and the constant resource of every lounging dandy  the bird of paradise also arranged her professional engagements so as to account with all possible propriety for her professional visit at pen bronnock the musical meeting at exeter over she made her appearance and some concerts were given which electrified all cornwall count frill was very strong here though to be sure he also danced and acted in all varieties he was the soul too of a masqued ball but when complimented on his accomplishments and thanked for his exertions he modestly depreciated his worth and panegyrised the dancingdogs  as for the prince on the whole he maintained his silence but it was at length discovered by the fair sex that he was not stupid but sentimental when this was made known he rather lost ground with the dark sex who before thinking him thick had vowed that he was a devilish good fellow but now being really envious had their tale and hint their sneer and sly joke m de whiskerburg had one active accomplishment this was his dancing his gallopade was declared to be divine he absolutely sailed in air his waltz at his will either melted his partner into a dream or whirled her into a frenzy dangerous m de whiskerburg     chapter iii       a little rift  it is said that the conduct of refined society in a literary point of view is on the whole productive but of slight interest that all we can aspire to is to trace a brilliant picture of brilliant manners and that when the dance and the festival have been duly inspired by the repartee and the sarcasm and the gem the robe and the plume adroitly lighted up by the lamp and the lustre our cunning is exhausted and so your novelist generally twists this golden thread with some substantial silken cord for use and works up with the light dance and with the heavy dinner some secret marriage and some shrouded murder and thus by english plots and german mysteries the page trots on or jolts till in the end justice will have her way and the three volumes are completed  a plan both good and antique and also popular but not our way we prefer trusting to the slender incidents which spring from out our common intercourse there is no doubt that that great pumicestone society smooths down the edges of your thoughts and manners bodies of men who pursue the same object must ever resemble each other the life of the majority must ever be imitation thought is a labour to which few are competent and truth requires for its development as much courage as acuteness so conduct becomes conventional and opinion is a legend and thus all men act and think alike  but this is not peculiar to what is called fashionable life it is peculiar to civilisation which gives the passions less to work upon mankind are not more heartless because they are clothed in ermine it is that their costume attracts us to their characters and we stare because we find the prince or the peeress neither a conqueror nor a heroine the great majority of human beings in a country like england glides through existence in perfect ignorance of their natures so complicated and so controlling is the machinery of our social life few can break the bonds that tie them down and struggle for selfknowledge fewer when the talisman is gained can direct their illuminated energies to the purposes with which they sympathise  a mode of life which encloses in its circle all the dark and deep results of unbounded indulgence however it may appear to some who glance over the sparkling surface does not exactly seem to us one either insipid or uninteresting to the moral speculator and indeed we have long been induced to suspect that the seeds of true sublimity lurk in a life which like this book is half fashion and half passion  we know not how it was but about this time an unaccountable almost an imperceptible coolness seemed to spring up between our hero and the lady aphrodite if we were to puzzle our brains for ever we could not give you the reason nothing happened nothing had been said or done which could indicate its origin perhaps this was the origin perhaps the dukes conduct had become though unexceptionable too negative but here we only throw up a straw perhaps if we must go on suggesting anxiety ends in callousness  his grace had thought so much of her feelings that he had quite forgotten his own or worn them out her ladyship too was perhaps a little disappointed at the unexpected reconciliation when we have screwed our courage up to the sticking point we like not to be baulked both too perhapswe go on perhapsingboth too we repeat perhaps could not help mutually viewing each other as the cause of much mutual care and mutual anxiousness both too perhaps were a little tired but without knowing it the most curious thing and which would have augured worst to a calm judge was that they silently seemed to agree not to understand that any alteration had really taken place between them which we think was a bad sign because a lovers quarrel we all know like a storm in summer portends a renewal of warm weather or ardent feelings and a lady is never so well seated in her admirers heart as when those betters are interchanged which express so much and those explanations entered upon which explain so little  and here we would dilate on greater things than some imagine but unfortunately we are engaged for newmarket calls sir lucius and his friends we will not join them having lost enough his grace half promised to be one of the party but when the day came just remembered the shropshires were expected and so was very sorry and the rest lady aphrodite and himself parted with warmth which remarkably contrasted with their late intercourse and which neither of them could decide whether it were reviving affection or factitious effort m de whiskerburg and count frill departed with sir lucius being extremely desirous to be initiated in the mysteries of the turf and above all to see a real english jockey     chapter iv       satiety  the newspapers continued to announce the departures of new visitors to the duke of st james and to dilate upon the protracted and princely festivity of pen bronnock but while thousands were envying his lot and hundreds aspiring to share it what indeed was the condition of our hero  a month or two had rolled on and if he had not absolutely tasted enjoyment at least he had thrown off reflection but as the autumn wore away and as each day he derived less diversion or distraction from the repetition of the same routine carried on by different actors he could no longer control feelings which would be predominant and those feelings were not such as perhaps might have been expected from one who was receiving the homage of an admiring world in a word the duke of st james was the most miserable wretch that ever lived  where is this to end he asked himself is this year to close to bring only a repetition of the past well i have had it all and what is it my restless feelings are at last laid my indefinite appetites are at length exhausted i have known this mighty world and where am i once all prospects all reflections merged in the agitating the tremulous and panting lust with which i sighed for it have i been deceived have i been disappointed is it different from what i expected has it fallen short of my fancy has the dexterity of my musings deserted me have i underacted the hero of my reveries have i in short mismanaged my début have i blundered no no no far far has it gone beyond even my imagination and my life has if no other realised its ideas  who laughs at me who does not burn incense before my shrine what appetite have i not gratified what gratification has proved bitter my vanity has it been for an instant mortified am i not acknowledged the most brilliant hero of the most brilliant society in europe intense as is my selflove has it not been gorged luxury and splendour were my youthful dreams and have i not realised the very romance of indulgence and magnificence my career has been one long triumph my palaces and my gardens and my jewels my dress my furniture my equipages my horses and my festivals these used to occupy my meditations when i could only meditate and have my determinations proved a delusion ask the admiring world  and now for the great point to which all this was to tend which all this was to fascinate and subdue to adorn to embellish to delight to honour woman oh when i first dared among the fields of eton to dwell upon the soft yet agitating fancy that some day my existence might perhaps be rendered more intense by the admiration of these maddening but then mysterious creatures could could i have dreamt of what has happened is not this the very point in which my career has most outtopped my lofty hopes  i have read and sometimes heard of satiety it must then be satiety that i feel for i do feel more like a doomed man than a young noble full of blood and youth and yet satiety it is a word what then a word is breath and am i wiser satiety satiety satiety oh give me happiness oh give me love  ay there it is i feel it now too well i feel that happiness must spring from purer fountains than selflove we are not born merely for ourselves and they who full of pride make the trial as i have done and think that the world is made for them and not for mankind must come to as bitter results perhaps as bitter a fate for by heavens i am half tempted at this moment to fling myself from off this cliff and so end all  why should i live for virtue and for duty to compensate for all my folly and to achieve some slight good end with my abused and unparalleled means ay it is all vastly rational and vastly sublime but it is too late i feel the exertion above me i am a lost man  we cannot work without a purpose and an aim i had mine although it was a false one and i succeeded had i one now i might succeed again but my heart is a dull void and caroline that gentle girl will not give me what i want and to offer her but half a heart may break hers and i would not bruise that delicate bosom to save my dukedom those sad silly parents of hers have already done mischief enough but i will see darrell and will at least arrange that i like him and will make him my friend for her sake god god why am i not loved a word from her and all would change i feel a something in me which could put all right i have the will and she could give the power  now see what a farce life is i shall go on heaven knows how i cannot live long men like me soon bloom and fade what i may come to i dread to think there is a dangerous facility in my temper i know it well for i know more of myself than people think there is a dangerous facility which with may dacre might be the best guaranty of virtue but with all others for all others are at the best weak things will as certainly render me despicable perhaps degraded i hear the busy devil whispering even now it is my demon now i say see what a farce life is i shall die like a dog as i have lived like a fool and then my epitaph will be in everybodys mouth here are the consequences of selfindulgence here is a fellow forsooth who thought only of the gratification of his vile appetites and by the living heaven am i not standing here among my hereditary rocks and sighing to the ocean to be virtuous  she knew me well she read me in a minute and spoke more truth at that last meeting than is in a thousand sermons it is out of our power to redeem ourselves our whole existence is a false foul state totally inimical to love and purity and domestic gentleness and calm delight yet are we envied oh could these fools see us at any other time except surrounded by our glitter and hear of us at any other moment save in the first bloom of youth which is even then often wasted could they but mark our manhood and view our hollow marriages and disappointed passions could they but see the traitors that we have for sons the daughters that own no duty could they but watch us even to our grave tottering after some fresh bauble some vain delusion which to the last we hope may prove a substitute for what we have never found through life a contented mind they would do something else but envy us  but i stand prating when i am wanted i must home home o sacred word and then comes night horrible night horrible day it seems to me i am upon the eve of some monstrous folly too ridiculous to be a crime and yet as fatal i have half a mind to go and marry the bird of paradise out of pure pique with myself and with the world     chapter v       a startling letter  southey that virtuous man whom wisdom calls her own somewhere thanks god that he was not born to a great estate we quite agree with the seer of keswick it is a bore provided a man can enjoy every personal luxury what profits it that your flag waves on castles you never visit and that you count rents which you never receive and yet there are some things which your miserable moderate incomes cannot command and which one might like to have for instance a band  a complete a consummate band in uniforms of uncut white velvet with a highlywrought gold button just tipped with a single pink topaz appears to me greek phrase when we die band will be found impressed upon our heart like frigate on the core of nelson the negroes should have their noses bored as well as their ears and hung with rings of rubies the kettledrums should be of silver and with regard to a great estate no doubt it brings great cares or to get free of them the estate must be neglected and then it is even worse  elections come on and all your members are thrown out so much for neglected influence agricultural distress prevails and all your farms are thrown up so much for neglected tenants harassed by leases renewals railroads fines and mines you are determined that life shall not be worn out by these continual and petty cares thinking it somewhat hard that because you have two hundred thousand ayear you have neither ease nor enjoyment you find a remarkably clever man who manages everything for you enchanted with his energy his acuteness and his foresight fascinated by your increasing rentroll and the total disappearance of arrears you dub him your right hand introduce him to all your friends and put him into parliament and then fired by the ambition of rivalling his patron he disburses embezzles and decamps  but where is our hero is he forgotten never but in the dumps blue devils and so on a little bilious it may be and dull he scarcely would amuse you at this moment so we come forward with a graceful bow the jack pudding of our doctor who is behind  in short that is to say in longfor what is true use of this affected brevity when this tale is done what have you got so let us make it last we quite repent of having intimated so much in future it is our intention to develop more and to describe and to delineate and to define and in short to bore you know the model of this kind of writing richardson whom we shall revive in future we shall as a novelist take clarendons rebellion for our guide and write our heros notes or heroines letters like a state paper or a broken treaty  the duke and the young dukeoh to be a duke and to be young it is too muchwas seldom seen by the gay crowd who feasted in his hall his mornings now were lonely and if at night his eye still sparkled and his step still sprang why between us wine gave him beauty and wine gave him grace  it was the dreary end of dull november and the last company were breaking off the bird of paradise according to her desire had gone to brighton where his grace had presented her with a tenement neat light and finished and though situated amid the wilds of kemp town not more than one hyæna on a night ventured to come down from the adjacent heights he had half promised to join her because he thought he might as well be there as here and consequently he had not invited a fresh supply of visitors from town or rather from the country as he was hesitating about what he should do he received a letter from his bankers which made him stare he sent for the groom of the chambers and was informed the house was clear save that some single men still lingered as is their wont they never take a hint his grace ordered his carriage and more alive than he had been for the last two months dashed off to town     chapter vi       the cost of pleasure  the letter from his bankers informed the duke of st james that not only was the halfmillion exhausted but in pursuance of their powers they had sold out all his stock and in reliance on his credit had advanced even beyond it they were ready to accommodate him in every possible way and to advance as much more as he could desire at five per cent sweet five per cent oh magical five per cent lucky the rogue now who gets three nevertheless they thought it but proper to call his graces attention to the circumstance and to put him in possession of the facts something unpleasant is coming when men are anxious to tell the truth  the duke of st james had never affected to be a man of business still he had taken it for granted that pecuniary embarrassment was not ever to be counted among his annoyances he wanted something to do and determined to look into his affairs merely to amuse himself  the bankers were most polite they brought their books also several packets of papers neatly tied up and were ready to give every information the duke asked for results he found that the turf the alhambra the expenses of his outfit in purchasing the lease and furniture of his mansion and the rest had with his expenditure exhausted his first years income but he reconciled himself to this because he chose to consider them extraordinary expenses then the festivities of pen bronnock counterbalanced the economy of his more scrambling life the preceding year yet he had not exceeded his income much then he came to sir cartes account he began to get a little frightened two hundred and fifty thousand had been swallowed by hauteville castle one hundred and twenty thousand by hauteville house ninetysix thousand had been paid for furniture there were also some awkward miscellanies which in addition exceeded the halfmillion  this was smashing work but castles and palaces particularly of the correctest style of architecture are not to be had for nothing the duke had always devoted the halfmillion to this object but he had intended that sum to be sufficient what puzzled and what annoyed him was a queer suspicion that his resources had been exhausted without his result being obtained he sent for sir carte who gave every information and assured him that had he had the least idea that a limit was an object he would have made his arrangements accordingly as it was he assured the young duke that he would be the lord of the most sumptuous and accurate castle and of the most gorgeous and tasteful palace in europe he was proceeding with a cloud of words when his employer cut him short by a peremptory demand of the exact sum requisite for the completion of his plans sir carte was confused and requested time the estimates should be sent in as quickly as possible the clerks should sit up all night and even his own rest should not be an object any more than the dukes purse so they parted  the duke determined to run down to brighton for change of scene he promised his bankers to examine everything on his return in the meantime they were to make all necessary advances and honour his drafts to any amount  he found the city of chalk and shingles not quite so agreeable as last year he discovered that it had no trees there was there also just everybody that he did not wish to see it was one great st james street and seemed only an anticipation of that very season which he dreaded he was half inclined to go somewhere else but could not fix upon any spot london might be agreeable as it was empty but then those confounded accounts awaited him the bird of paradise was a sad bore he really began to suspect that she was little better than an idiot then she ate so much and he hated your eating women he gladly shuffled her off on that fool count frill who daily brought his guitar to kemp town they just suited each other what a madman he had been to have embarrassed himself with this creature it would cost him a pretty ransom now before he could obtain his freedom how we change already the duke of st james began to think of pounds shillings and pence a year ago so long as he could extricate himself from a scrape by force of cash he thought himself a lucky fellow  the graftons had not arrived but were daily expected he really could not stand them as for lady afy he execrated the greenhornism which had made him feign a passion and then get caught where he meant to capture as for sir lucius he wished to heaven he would just take it into his head to repay him the fifteen thousand he had lent him at that confounded election to say nothing of anything else  then there was burlington with his old loves and his new dances he wondered how the deuce that fellow could be amused with such frivolity and always look so serene and calm then there was squib that man never knew when to leave off joking and annesley with his false refinement and darrell with his petty ambition he felt quite sick and took a solitary ride but he flew from scylla to charybdis mrs montfort could not forget their many delightful canters last season to rottingdean and lo she was at his side he wished her down the cliff  in this fit of the spleen he went to the theatre there were eleven people in the boxes he listened to the school for scandal never was slander more harmless he sat it all out and was sorry when it was over but was consoled by the devils of der freischutz how sincerely how ardently did he long to sell himself to the demon it was eleven oclock and he dreaded the play to be over as if he were a child what to do with himself or where to go he was equally at a loss the door of the box opened and entered lord bagshot if it must be an acquaintance this cub was better than any of his refined and lately cherished companions  well bag what are you doing with yourself  oh i dont know just looking in for a lark any game  on my honour i cant say  whats that girl oh i see thats little wilkins theres moll otway nothing new i shall go and rattle the bones a little eh my boy  rattle the bones what is that  dont you know and here this promising young peer manually explained his meaning  what do you play at asked the duke  hazard for my money but what you like  where  we meet at de berghems there is a jolly set of us all crack men when my governor is here i never go he is so jealous i suppose there must be only one gamester in the family eh my covey lord bagshot excited by the unusual affability of the young duke grew quite familiar  i have half a mind to look in with you said his grace with a careless air  oh come along by all means theyll be devilish glad to see you de berghem was saying the other day what a nice fellow you were and how he should like to know you you dont know de berghem do you  i have seen him i know enough of him  they quitted the theatre together and under the guidance of lord bagshot stopped at a door in brunswick terrace there they found collected a numerous party but all persons of consideration the baron who had once been a member of the diplomatic corps and now lived in england by choice on his pension and private fortune received them with marked courtesy proud of his companion lord bagshots hoarse coarse idiot voice seemed ever braying his frequent introductions of the duke of st james were excruciating and it required all the freezing of a finished manner to pass through this fiery ordeal his grace was acquainted with most of the guests by sight and to some he even bowed they were chiefly men of a certain age with the exception of two or three young peers like himself  there was the earl of castlefort plump and luxurious with a youthful wig who though a sexagenarian liked no companion better than a minor his lordship was the most amiable man in the world and the most lucky but the first was his merit and the second was not his fault there was the juvenile lord dice who boasted of having done his brothers out of their miserable 5000l patrimony and all in one night but the wrinkle that had already ruffled his once clear brow his sunken eye and his convulsive lip had been thrown we suppose into the bargain and in our opinion made it a dear one there was temple grace who had run through four fortunes and ruined four sisters withered though only thirty one thing alone remained to be lost what he called his honour which was already on the scent to play booty there was cogit who when he was drunk swore that he had had a father but this was deemed the only exception to in vino veritas who he was the goddess of chance alone could decide and we have often thought that he might bear the same relation to her as Æneas to the goddess of beauty his age was as great a mystery as anything else he dressed still like a boy yet some vowed he was eighty he must have been salathiel property he never had and yet he contrived to live connection he was not born with yet he was upheld by a set he never played yet he was the most skilful dealer going he did the honours of a rouge et noir table to a miracle and looking as he thought most genteel in a crimson waistcoat and a gold chain raked up the spoils or complacently announced après lord castlefort had few secrets from him he was the jackal to these prowling beasts of prey looked out for pigeons got up little parties to richmond or brighton sang a song when the rest were too anxious to make a noise and yet desired a little life and perhaps could cog a die arrange a lookingglass or mix a tumbler  unless the loss of an occasional napoleon at a german wateringplace is to be so stigmatised gaming had never formed one of the numerous follies of the duke of st james rich and gifted with a generous sanguine and luxurious disposition he had never been tempted by the desire of gain or as some may perhaps maintain by the desire of excitement to seek assistance or enjoyment in a mode of life which stultifies all our fine fancies deadens all our noble emotions and mortifies all our beautiful aspirations  we know that we are broaching a doctrine which many will start at and which some will protest against when we declare our belief that no person whatever his apparent wealth ever yet gamed except from the prospect of immediate gain we hear much of want of excitement of ennui of satiety and then the gamingtable is announced as a sort of substitute for opium wine or any other mode of obtaining a more intense vitality at the cost of reason gaming is too active too anxious too complicated too troublesome in a word too sensible an affair for such spirits who fly only to a sort of dreamy and indefinite distraction  the fact is gaming is a matter of business its object is tangible clear and evident there is nothing high or inflammatory or exciting no false magnificence no visionary elevation in the affair at all it is the very antipodes to enthusiasm of any kind it presupposes in its votary a mind essentially mercantile all the feelings that are in its train are the most mean the most commonplace and the most annoying of daily life and nothing would tempt the gamester to experience them except the great object which as a matter of calculation he is willing to aim at on such terms no man flies to the gamingtable in a paroxysm the first visit requires the courage of a forlorn hope the first stake will make the lightest mind anxious the firmest hand tremble and the stoutest heart falter after the first stake it is all a matter of calculation and management even in games of chance night after night will men play at rouge et noir upon what they call a system and for hours their attention never ceases any more than it would if they were in the shop or oh the wharf no manual labour is more fatiguing and more degrading to the labourer than gaming every gamester feels ashamed and this vice this worst vice from whose embrace moralists daily inform us man can never escape is just the one from which the majority of men most completely and most often free themselves infinite is the number of men who have lost thousands in their youth and never dream of chance again it is this pursuit which oftener than any other leads man to selfknowledge appalled by the absolute destruction on the verge of which he finds his early youth just stepping aghast at the shadowy crimes which under the influence of this life seem as it were to rise upon his soul often he hurries to emancipate himself from this fatal thraldom and with a ruined fortune and marred prospects yet thanks his creator that his soul is still white his conscience clear and that once more he breathes the sweet air of heaven  and our young duke we must confess gamed as all other men have gamed for money his satiety had fled the moment that his affairs were embarrassed the thought suddenly came into his head while bagshot was speaking he determined to make an effort to recover and so completely was it a matter of business with him that he reasoned that in the present state of his affairs a few thousands more would not signify that these few thousands might lead to vast results and that if they did he would bid adieu to the gamingtable with the same coolness with which he had saluted it  yet he felt a little odd when he first rattled the bones and his affected nonchalance made him constrained he fancied every one was watching him while on the contrary all were too much interested in their own different parties this feeling however wore off  according to every novelist and the moralists our betters the duke of st james should have been fortunate at least tonight you always win at first you know if so we advise said children of fancy and of fact to pocket their gains and not play again the young duke had not the opportunity of thus acting he lost fifteen hundred pounds and at halfpast five he quitted the barons  hot bilious with a confounded twang in his mouth and a cracking pain in his head he stood one moment and sniffed in the salt sea breeze the moon was unfortunately on the waters and her cool beneficent light reminded him with disgust of the hot burning glare of the barons saloon he thought of may dacre but clenched his fist and drove her image from his mind     chapter vii       dangerous friends  he rose late and as he was lounging over his breakfast entered lord bagshot and the baron already the young duke began to experience one of the gamesters curses the intrusive society of those of whom you are ashamed eightandforty hours ago lord bagshot would no more have dared to call on the duke of st james than to call at the pavilion and now with that reckless want of tact which marks the innately vulgar he seemed to triumph in their unhallowed intimacy and lounging into his graces apartment with that halfshuffling hairswaggering air indicative of the cove hat cocked and thumbs in his greatcoat pockets cast his complacent eye around and praised his graces rooms lord bagshot who for the occasional notice of the duke of st james had been so long a ready and patient butt now appeared to assume a higher character and addressed his friend in a tone and manner which were authorised by the equality of their rank and the sympathy of their tastes if this change had taken place in the conduct of the viscount it was not a singular one the duke also to his surprise found himself addressing his former butt in a very different style from that which he had assumed in the ballroom of doncaster in vain he tried to rally in vain he tried to snub it was indeed in vain he no longer possessed any right to express his contempt of his companion that contempt indeed he still felt he despised lord bagshot still but he also despised himself  the soft and silky baron was a different sort of personage but there was something sinister in all his elaborate courtesy and highly artificial manner which did not touch the feelings of the duke whose courtesy was but the expression of his noble feelings and whose grace was only the impulse of his rich and costly blood baron de berghem was too attentive and too deferential he smiled and bowed too much he made no allusion to the last nights scene nor did his tutored companion but spoke of different and lighter subjects in a manner which at once proved his experience of society the liveliness of his talents and the cultivation of his taste he told many stories all short and poignant and always about princes and princesses whatever was broached he always had his apropos of vienna and altogether seemed an experienced mild tolerant man of the world not bigoted to any particular opinions upon any subject but of a truly liberal and philosophic mind  when they had sat chatting for halfanhour the baron developed the object of his visit which was to endeavour to obtain the pleasure of his graces company at dinner to taste some wild boar and try some tokay the duke who longed again for action accepted the invitation and then they parted  our hero was quite surprised at the feverish anxiety with which he awaited the hour of union he thought that seven oclock would never come he had no appetite at breakfast and after that he rode but luncheon was a blank in the midst of the operation he found himself in a brown study calculating chances all day long his imagination had been playing hazard or rouge et noir once he thought that he had discovered an infallible way of winning at the latter on the long run he was convinced it must answer and he panted to prove it  seven oclock at last arrived and he departed to brunswick terrace there was a brilliant party to meet him the same set as last night but select he was faint and did justice to the cuisine of his host which was indeed remarkable when we are drinking a mans good wine it is difficult to dislike him prejudice decreases with every draught his grace began to think the baron as goodhearted as agreeable he was grateful for the continued attentions of old castlefort who he now found out had been very well acquainted with his father and once even made a trip to spa with him lord dice he could not manage to endure though that worthy was for him remarkably courteous and grinned with his parchment face like a goodhumoured ghoul temple grace and the duke became almost intimate there was an amiable candour in that gentlemans address a softness in his tones and an unstudied and extremely interesting delicacy in his manner which in this society was remarkable tom cogit never presumed to come near the young duke but paid him constant attention he sat at the bottom of the table and was ever sending a servant with some choice wine or recommending him through some third person some choice dish it is pleasant to be made much of as shakspeare says even by scoundrels to be king of your company is a poor ambition yet homage is homage and smoke is smoke whether it come out of the chimney of a palace or of a workhouse  the banquet was not hurried though all wished it finished no one liked to appear urgent it was over at last and they walked upstairs where the tables were arranged for all parties and all play tom cogit went up a few minutes before them like the lady of the mansion to review the lights and arrange the cards feminine tom cogit  the events of tonight were much the same as of the preceding one the duke was a loser but his losses were not considerable he retired about the same hour with a head not so hot or heavy and he never looked at the moon or thought of may dacre the only wish that reigned in his soul was a longing for another opportunity and he had agreed to dine with the baron before he left brunswick terrace  thus passed a week one night the duke of st james redeeming himself another falling back to his old position now pushing on to madrid now recrossing the tagus on the whole he had lost four or five thousand pounds a mere trifle to what as he had heard had been lost and gained by many of his companions during only the present season on the whole he was one of the most moderate of these speculators generally played at the large table and never joined any of those private coteries some of which he had observed and of some of which he had heard yet this was from no prudential resolve or temperate resolution the young duke was heartily tired of the slight results of all his anxiety hopes and plans and ardently wished for some opportunity of coming to closer and more decided action the baron also had resolved that an end should be put to this skirmishing but he was a calm head and never hurried anything  i hope your grace has been lucky tonight said the baron one evening strolling up to the duke as for myself really if dice goes on playing i shall give up banking that fellow must have a talisman i think he has broken more banks than any man living the best thing he did of that kind was the roulette story at paris you have heard of that  was that lord dice  oh yes he does everything he must have cleared his hundred thousand last year i have suffered a good deal since i have been in england castlefort has pulled in a great deal of my money i wonder to whom he will leave his property  you think him rich  oh he will cut up large said the baron elevating his eyebrows a pleasant man too i do not know any man that i would sooner play with than castlefort no one who loses his money with better temper  or wins it said his grace  that we all do said the baron faintly laughing your grace has lost and you do not seem particularly dull you will have your revenge those who lose at first are always the children of fortune i always dread a man who loses at first all i beg is that you will not break my bank  why you see i am not playing now i am not surprised there is too much heat and noise here said he we will have a quiet dinner some day and play at our ease come tomorrow and i will ask castlefort and dice i should uncommonly like entre nous to win some of their money i will take care that nobody shall be here whom you would not like to meet bythebye whom were you riding with this morning fine woman     chapter viii       birds of prey  the young duke had accepted the invitation of the baron de berghem for tomorrow and accordingly himself lords castlefort and dice and temple grace assembled in brunswick terrace at the usual hour the dinner was studiously plain and very little wine was drunk yet everything was perfect tom cogit stepped in to carve in his usual silent manner he always came in and went out of a room without anyone observing him he winked familiarly to temple grace but scarcely presumed to bow to the duke he was very busy about the wine and dressed the wild fowl in a manner quite unparalleled tom cogit was the man for a sauce for a brown bird what a mystery he made of it cayenne and burgundy and limes were ingredients but there was a magic in the incantation with which he alone was acquainted he took particular care to send a most perfect portion to the young duke and he did this as he paid all attentions to influential strangers with the most marked consciousness of the sufferance which permitted his presence never addressing his grace but audibly whispering to the servant take this to the duke or asking the attendant whether his grace would try the hermitage  after dinner with the exception of cogit who was busied in compounding some wonderful liquid for the future refreshment they sat down to écarté without having exchanged a word upon the subject there seemed a general understanding among all the parties that tonight was to be a pitched battle and they began at once briskly yet in spite of their universal determination midnight arrived without anything decisive another hour passed over and then tom cogit kept touching the barons elbow and whispering in a voice which everybody could understand all this meant that supper was ready it was brought into the room  gaming has one advantage it gives you an appetite that is to say so long as you have a chance remaining the duke had thousands for at present his resources were unimpaired and he was exhausted by the constant attention and anxiety of five hours he passed over the delicacies and went to the sidetable and began cutting himself some cold roast beef tom cogit ran up not to his grace but to the baron to announce the shocking fact that the duke of st james was enduring great trouble and then the baron asked his grace to permit mr cogit to serve him our hero devouredwe use the word advisedly as fools say in the house of commonshe devoured the roast beef and rejecting the hermitage with disgust asked for porter  they set to again fresh as eagles at six oclock accounts were so complicated that they stopped to make up their books each played with his memoranda and pencil at his side nothing fatal had yet happened the duke owed lord dice about five thousand pounds and temple grace owed him as many hundreds lord castlefort also was his debtor to the tune of seven hundred and fifty and the baron was in his books but slightly every halfhour they had a new pack of cards and threw the used one on the floor all this time tom cogit did nothing but snuff the candles stir the fire bring them a new pack and occasionally make a tumbler for them at eight oclock the dukes situation was worsened the run was greatly against him and perhaps his losses were doubled he pulled up again the next hour or two but nevertheless at ten oclock owed everyone something no one offered to give over and everyone perhaps felt that his object was not obtained they made their toilets and went downstairs to breakfast in the meantime the shutters were opened the room aired and in less than an hour they were at it again  they played till dinnertime without intermission and though the duke made some desperate efforts and some successful ones his losses were nevertheless trebled yet he ate an excellent dinner and was not at all depressed because the more he lost the more his courage and his resources seemed to expand at first he had limited himself to ten thousand after breakfast it was to have been twenty thousand then thirty thousand was the ultimatum and now he dismissed all thoughts of limits from his mind and was determined to risk or gain everything  at midnight he had lost fortyeight thousand pounds affairs now began to be serious his supper was not so hearty while the rest were eating he walked about the room and began to limit his ambition to recovery and not to gain when you play to win back the fun is over there is nothing to recompense you for your bodily tortures and your degraded feelings and the very best result that can happen while it has no charms seems to your cowed mind impossible  illustration page338  on they played and the duke lost more his mind was jaded he floundered he made desperate efforts but plunged deeper in the slough feeling that to regain his ground each card must tell he acted on each as if it must win and the consequences of this insanity for a gamester at such a crisis is really insane were that his losses were prodigious  another morning came and there they sat ankledeep in cards no attempt at breakfast now no affectation of making a toilet or airing the room the atmosphere was hot to be sure but it well became such a hell there they sat in total in positive forgetfulness of everything but the hot game they were hunting down there was not a man in the room except tom cogit who could have told you the name of the town in which they were living there they sat almost breathless watching every turn with the fell look in their cannibal eyes which showed their total inability to sympathise with their fellowbeings all forms of society had been long forgotten there was no snuffbox handed about now for courtesy admiration or a pinch no affectation of occasionally making a remark upon any other topic but the allengrossing one lord castlefort rested with his arms on the table a false tooth had got unhinged his lordship who at any other time would have been most annoyed coolly put it in his pocket his cheeks had fallen and he looked twenty years older lord dice had torn off his cravat and his hair hung down over his callous bloodless cheeks straight as silk temple grace looked as if he were blighted by lightning and his deep blue eyes gleamed like a hyaenas the baron was least changed tom cogit who smelt that the crisis was at hand was as quiet as a bribed rat  on they played till six oclock in the evening and then they agreed to desist till after dinner lord dice threw himself on a sofa lord castlefort breathed with difficulty the rest walked about while they were resting on their oars the young duke roughly made up his accounts he found that he was minus about one hundred thousand pounds  immense as this loss was he was more struck more appalled let us say at the strangeness of the surrounding scene than even by his own ruin as he looked upon his fellow gamesters he seemed for the first time in his life to gaze upon some of those hideous demons of whom he had read he looked in the mirror at himself a blight seemed to have fallen over his beauty and his presence seemed accursed he had pursued a dissipated even more than a dissipated career many were the nights that had been spent by him not on his couch great had been the exhaustion that he had often experienced haggard had sometimes even been the lustre of his youth but when had been marked upon his brow this harrowing care when had his features before been stamped with this anxiety this anguish this baffled desire this strange unearthly scowl which made him even tremble what was it possible it could not be that in time he was to be like those awful those unearthly those unhallowed things that were around him he felt as if he had fallen from his state as if he had dishonoured his ancestry as if he had betrayed his trust he felt a criminal in the darkness of his meditations a flash burst from his lurid mind a celestial light appeared to dissipate this thickening gloom and his soul felt as if it were bathed with the softening radiancy he thought of may dacre he thought of everything that was pure and holy and beautiful and luminous and calm it was the innate virtue of the man that made this appeal to his corrupted nature his losses seemed nothing his dukedom would be too slight a ransom for freedom from these ghouls and for the breath of the sweet air  he advanced to the baron and expressed his desire to play no more there was an immediate stir all jumped up and now the deed was done cant in spite of their exhaustion assumed her reign they begged him to have his revenge were quite annoyed at the result had no doubt he would recover if he proceeded without noticing their remarks he seated himself at the table and wrote cheques for their respective amounts tom cogit jumping up and bringing him the inkstand lord castlefort in the most affectionate manner pocketed the draft at the same time recommending the duke not to be in a hurry but to send it when he was cool lord dice received his with a bow temple grace with a sigh the baron with an avowal of his readiness always to give him his revenge  the duke though sick at heart would not leave the room with any evidence of a broken spirit and when lord castlefort again repeated pay us when we meet again he said i think it very improbable that we shall meet again my lord i wished to know what gaming was i had heard a great deal about it it is not so very disgusting but i am a young man and cannot play tricks with my complexion  he reached his house the bird was out he gave orders for himself not to be disturbed and he went to bed but in vain he tried to sleep what rack exceeds the torture of an excited brain and an exhausted body his hands and feet were like ice his brow like fire his ears rung with supernatural roaring a nausea had seized upon him and death he would have welcomed in vain in vain he courted repose in vain in vain he had recourse to every expedient to wile himself to slumber each minute he started from his pillow with some phrase which reminded him of his late fearful society hour after hour moved on with its leaden pace each hour he heard strike and each hour seemed an age each hour was only a signal to cast off some covering or shift his position it was at length morning with a feeling that he should go mad if he remained any longer in bed he rose and paced his chamber the air refreshed him he threw himself on the floor the cold crept over his senses and he slept     chapter ix       a duke without a friend  o ye immortal gods ye are still immortal although no longer ye hover oer olympus the crescent glitters on your mountains base and crosses spring from out its toppling crags but in vain the mufti and the patriarch and the pope flout at your past traditions they are married to mans memory by the sweetest chain that ever fancy wove for love the poet is a priest who does not doubt the inspiration of his oracles and your shrines are still served by a faithful band who love the beautiful and adore the glorious in vain in vain they tell us your divinity is a dream from the cradle to the grave our thoughts and feelings take their colour from you o Ægiochus the birch has often proved thou art still a thunderer and although thy twanging bow murmur no longer through the avenging air many an apple twig still vindicates thy outraged dignity pulcher apollo  o ye immortal gods nothing so difficult as to begin a chapter and therefore have we flown to you in literature as in life it is the first step you know the rest after a paragraph or so our blood is up and even our jaded hackneys scud along and warm up into friskiness  the duke awoke another day of his eventful life is now to run its course he found that the bird of paradise had not returned from an excursion to a neighbouring park he left a note for her apprising her of his departure to london and he despatched an affectionate letter to lady aphrodite which was the least that he could do considering that he perhaps quitted brighton the day of her arrival and having done all this he ordered his horses and before noon was on his first stage  it was his birthday he had completed his twentythird year this was sufficient even if he had no other inducement to make him indulge in some slight reflection these annual summings up are awkward things even to the prosperous and the happy but to those who are the reverse who are discontented with themselves and find that youth melting away which they believe can alone achieve anything i think a birthday is about the most gloomy fourandtwenty hours that ever flap their damp dull wings over melancholy man  yet the duke of st james was rather thoughtful than melancholy his life had been too active of late to allow him to indulge much in that passive mood i may never know what happiness is thought his grace as he leaned back in his whirling britzska but i think i know what happiness is not it is not the career which i have hitherto pursued all this excitement which they talk of so much wears out the mind and i begin to believe even the body for certainly my energies seem deserting me but two years two miserable years fourandtwenty months eightandforty times the hours the few hours that i have been worse than wasting here and i am shipwrecked fairly bulged yet i have done everything tried everything and my career has been an eminent career woe to the wretch who trusts to his pampered senses for felicity woe to the wretch who flies from the bright goddess sympathy to sacrifice before the dark idol selflove ah i see too late we were made for each other too late i discover the beautiful results of this great principle of creation oh the blunders of an unformed character oh the torture of an illregulated mind  give me a life with no fierce alternations of rapture and anguish no impossible hopes no mad depression free me from the delusions which succeed each other like scentless roses that are ever blooming save me from the excitement which brings exhaustion and from the passion that procreates remorse give me the luminous mind where recognised and paramount duty dispels the harassing ascertains the doubtful confirms the wavering sweetens the bitter give me content oh give me love  how is it to end what is to become of me can nothing rescue me is there no mode of relief no place of succour no quarter of refuge no hope of salvation i cannot right myself and there is an end of it society society society i owe thee much and perhaps in working in thy service those feelings might be developed which i am now convinced are the only source of happiness but i am plunged too deep in the quag i have no impulse no call i know not how it is but my energies good and evil seem alike vanishing there stares that fellow at my carriage god willingly would i break the stones upon the road for a year to clear my mind of all the past  a carriage dashed by and a lady bowed it was mrs dallington vere  the duke had appointed his banker to dine with him as not a moment must be lost in preparing for the reception of his brighton drafts he was also to receive this evening a complete report of all his affairs the first thing that struck his eye on his table was a packet from sir carte blanche he opened it eagerly stared started nearly shrieked it fell from his hands he was fortunately alone the estimates for the completion of his works and the purchase of the rest of the furniture exactly equalled the sum already expended sir carte added that the works might of course be stopped but that there was no possible way of reducing them with any deference to the original design scale and style that he had already given instructions not to proceed with the furniture until further notice but regretted to observe that the orders were so advanced that he feared it was too late to make any sensible reduction it might in some degree reconcile his grace to this report when he concluded by observing that the advanced state of the works could permit him to guarantee that the present estimates would not be exceeded  the duke had sufficiently recovered before the arrival of his confidential agent not to appear agitated only serious the awful catastrophe at brighton was announced and his report of affairs was received it was a very gloomy one great agricultural distress prevailed and the rents could not be got in fiveandtwenty per cent was the least that must be taken off his income and with no prospect of being speedily added on there was a projected railroad which would entirely knock up his canal and even if crushed must be expensively opposed coals were falling also and the duties in town increasing there was sad confusion in the irish estates the missionaries who were patronised on the neighbouring lands of one of the city companies had been exciting fatal confusion chapels were burnt crops destroyed stock butchered and rents all in arrear mr dacre had contrived with great prudence to repress the efforts of the new reformation and had succeeded in preventing any great mischief his plans for the pursual of his ideas and feelings upon this subject had been communicated to his late ward in an urgent and important paper which his grace had never seen but one day unread pushed into a certain black cabinet which perhaps the reader may remember his graces miscellaneous debts had also been called in and amounted to a greater sum than they had anticipated which debts always do one hundred and forty thousand pounds had crumbled away in the most imperceptible manner a great slice of this was the portion of the jeweller his shield and his vases would at least be evidence to his posterity of the splendour and the taste of their imprudent ancestor but he observed the other items with less satisfaction he discovered that in the course of two years he had given away one hundred and thirtyseven necklaces and bracelets and as for rings they must be counted by the bushel the result of this gloomy interview was that the duke had not only managed to get rid of the immortal halfmillion but had incurred debts or engagements to the amount of nearly eight hundred thousand pounds incumbrances which were to be borne by a decreased and perhaps decreasing income his grace was once more alone well my brain is not turned and yet i think it has been pretty well worked these last few days it cannot be true it must all be a dream he never could have dined here and said all this have i indeed been at brighton no no no i have been sleeping after dinner i have a good mind to ring and ask whether he really was here it must be one great delusion but no there are those cursed accounts well what does it signify i was miserable before and now i am only contemptible in addition how the world will laugh they were made forsooth for my diversion o idiot you will be the butt of everyone talk of bagshot indeed why he will scarcely speak to me  away with this let me turn these things in my mind take it at one hundred and fifty thousand it is more it must be more but we will take it at that now suppose one hundred thousand is allotted every year to meet my debts i suppose in nine or ten years i shall be free not that freedom will be worth much then but still i am thinking of the glory of the house i have betrayed well then there is fifty thousand ayear left let me see twenty thousand have always been spent in ireland and ten at pen bronnock and they must not be cut down the only thing i can do now is not to spare myself i am the cause and let me meet the consequences well then perhaps twenty thousand ayear remain to keep hauteville castle and hauteville house to maintain the splendour of the duke of st james why my hereditary charities alone amount to a quarter of my income to say nothing of incidental charges i too who should and who would wish to rebuild at my own cost every bridge that is swept away and every steeple that is burnt in my county  and now for the great point shall i proceed with my buildings my own personal convenience whispers no but i have a strong conviction that the advice is treasonable what the young dukes folly for every gazer in town and country to sneer at oh my fathers am i indeed your child or am i bastard never never shall your shield be sullied while i bear it never shall your proud banner veil while i am chieftain they shall be finished certainly they shall be finished if i die an exile there can be no doubt about this i feel the deep propriety  this girl too something must be done for her i must get squib to run down to brighton for me and afy poor dear afy i think she will be sorry when she hears it all  my head is weak i want a counsellor this man cannot enter into my feelings then there is my family lawyer if i ask him for advice he will ask me for instructions besides this is not a matter of pounds shillings and pence it is an affair as much of sentiment as economy it involves the honour of my family and i want one to unburden myself to who can sympathise with the tortured feelings of a noble of a duke without a dukedom for it has come to that but i will leave sneers to the world  there is annesley he is clever but so coldblooded he has no heart there is squib he is a good fellow and has heart enough and i suppose if i wanted to pension off a mistress or compound with a few rascally tradesmen he would manage the affair to a miracle there is darrell but he will be so fussy and confidential and official every meeting will be a cabinet council every discussion a debate every memorandum a state paper there is burlington he is experienced and clever and kindhearted and i really think likes me but no no it is too ridiculous we who have only met for enjoyment whose countenance was a smile and whose conversation was badinage we to meet and meditate on my broken fortunes impossible besides what right have i to compel a man the study of whose life is to banish care to take all my anxieties on his back or refuse the duty at the cost of my acquaintance and the trouble of his conscience ah i once had a friend the best the wisest but no more of that what is even the loss of fortune and of consideration to the loss of hishis daughters love  his voice faltered yet it was long before he retired and he rose on the morrow only to meditate over his harassing embarrassments as if the cup of his misery were not oerflowing a new incident occurred about this time which rendered his sense of them even keener but this is important enough to commence a new chapter     chapter x       a new star rises  william henry marquess of marylebone completed his twentyfirst year an event which created a greater sensation among the aristocracy of england even than the majority of george augustus frederick duke of st james the rentroll of his grace was great but that of his lordship was incalculable he had not indeed so many castles as our hero but then in the metropolis a whole parish owned him as lord and it was whispered that when a few miles of leases fell in the very civil list must give him the wall even in the duration of his minority he had the superiority over the young duke for the marquess was a posthumous son  lord marylebone was a short thick swarthy young gentleman with wiry black hair a nose somewhat flat sharp eyes and tusky mouth altogether not very unlike a terrier his tastes were unknown he had not travelled nor done anything very particular except with a few congenial spirits beat the guards in a rowingmatch a pretty diversion and almost as conducive to a small white hand as almondpaste  but his lordship was now of age and might be seen every day at a certain hour rattling up bond street in a red drag in which he drove four or five particular friends who lived at stevens hotel and therefore we suppose were the partners of his glory in his victory over his majestys household troops lord marylebone was the universal subject of conversation pursuits which would have devoted a shabby earl of twelve or fifteen thousand a year to universal reprobation or what is much worse to universal sneers assumed quite a different character when they constituted the course of life of this fortunate youth he was a delightful young man so unaffected no superrefinement no false delicacy everyone each sex everything extended his her or its hand to this cub who quite puzzled but too brutal to be confused kept driving on the red van and each day perpetrating some new act of profligacy some new instance of coarse profusion tasteless extravagance and inelegant eccentricity  but nevertheless he was the hero of the town he was the great point of interest in the universe and the new world favoured the old one with weekly articles on his character and conduct the young duke was quite forgotten if really young he could be longer called lord marylebone was in the mouth of every tradesman who authenticated his own vile inventions by foisting them on his lordship the most grotesque fashions suddenly inundated the metropolis and when the duke of st james ventured to express his disapprobation he found his empire was over they were sorry that it did not meet his graces taste but really what his grace had suggested was quite gone by this was the only hat or cane or coat which any civilised being could be seen with lord marylebone wore or bore no other  in higher circles it was much the same although the dandies would not bate an inch and certainly would not elect the young marquess for their leader they found to their dismay that the empire which they were meditating to defend had already slipped away from their grasp a new race of adventurous youths appeared upon the stage beards and greatcoats even rougher bulldogs instead of poodles clubs instead of canes cigars instead of perfumes were the order of the day there was no end to boatracing crockfords sneered at whites and there was even a talk of reviving the ring even the women patronised the young marquess and those who could not be blind to his real character were sure that if well managed he would not turn out ill  assuredly our hero though shelved did not envy his successful rival had he been instead of one for whom he felt a sovereign contempt a being even more accomplished than himself pity and not envy would have been the sentiment he would have yielded to his ascendant star but nevertheless he could not be insensible to the results of this incident and the advent of the young marquess seemed like the sting in the epigram of his life after all his ruinous magnificence after all the profuse indulgence of his fantastic tastes he had sometimes consoled himself even in the bitterness of satiety by reminding himself that he at least commanded the admiration of his fellowcreatures although it had been purchased at a costly price not insensible to the power of his wealth the magic of his station he had however ventured to indulge in the sweet belief that these qualities were less concerned in the triumphs of his career than his splendid person his accomplished mind his amiable disposition and his finished manner his beauty his wit his goodness and his grace even from this delusion too was he to waken and for the first time in his life he gauged the depth and strength of that popularity which had been so dear to him and which he now found to be so shallow and so weak  what will they think of me when they know all what they will i care not i would sooner live in a cottage with may dacre and work for our daily bread than be worshipped by all the beauty of this babylon  gloomy yet sedate he returned home his letters announced two extraordinary events m de whiskerburg had galloped off with lady aphrodite and count frill had flown away with the bird of paradise     chapter xi       lovely woman stoops to folly  the last piece of information was a relief but the announcement of the elopement cost him a pang both surprised and the first shocked him we are unreasonable in love and do not like to be anticipated even in neglect an hour ago lady aphrodite grafton was to him only an object of anxiety and a cause of embarrassment she was now a being to whom he was indebted for some of the most pleasing hours of his existence and who could no longer contribute to his felicity everybody appeared deserting him  he had neglected her to be sure and they must have parted it was certain yet although the present event saved him from the most harrowing of scenes he could not refrain shedding a tear so good and so beautiful and was this her end he who knew all knew how bitter had been the lot of her life  it is certain that when one of your very virtuous women ventures to be a little indiscreet we say it is certain though we regret it that sooner or later there is an explosion and the reason is this that they are always in a hurry to make up for lost time and so love with them becomes a business instead of being a pleasure nature had intended lady aphrodite grafton for a psyche so spiritual was her soul so pure her blood artthat is education which at least should be an art though it is notart had exquisitely sculptured the precious gem that nature had developed and all that was wanting was love to stamp an impression lady aphrodite grafton might have been as perfect a character as was ever the heroine of a novel and to whose account shall we place her blighted fame and sullied lustre to that animal who seems formed only to betray woman her husband was a traitor in disguise she found herself betrayed but like a noble chieftain when her capital was lost maintained herself among the ruins of her happiness in the citadel of her virtue she surrendered she thought on terms and in yielding her heart to the young duke though never for a moment blind to her conduct yet memory whispered extenuation and love added all that was necessary  our hero we are for none of your perfect heroes did not behave much better than her husband the difference between them was sir lucius graftons character was formed and formed for evil while the duke of st james when he became acquainted with lady aphrodite possessed none gallantry was a habit in which he had been brought up to protest to woman what he did not believe and to feign what he did not feel were as he supposed parts in the character of an accomplished gentleman and as hitherto he had not found his career productive of any misery we may perhaps view his conduct with less severity but at length he approaches not a mere woman of the world who tries to delude him into the idea that he is the first hero of a romance that has been a hundred times repeated he trembles at the responsibility which he has incurred by engaging the feelings of another in the conflict of his emotions some rays of moral light break upon his darkened soul profligacy brings its own punishment and he feels keenly that man is the subject of sympathy and not the slave of selflove  this remorse protracts a connection which each day is productive of more painful feelings but the heart cannot be overstrung and anxiety ends in callousness then come neglect remonstrance explanations protestations and sooner or later a catastrophe  but love is a dangerous habit and when once indulged is not easily thrown off unless you become devout which is in a manner giving the passion a new direction in catholic countries it is surprising how many adventures end in a convent a dame in her desperation flies to the grate which never reopens but in protestant regions she has time to cool and thats the deuce so instead of taking the veil she takes a new lover  lady aphrodite had worked up her mind and the young duke to a step the very mention of which a year before would have made him shudder what an enchanter is passion no wonder ovid who was a judge made love so much connected with his metamorphoses with infinite difficulty she had dared to admit the idea of flying with his grace but when the idea was once admitted when she really had once or twice constantly dwelt on the idea of at length being free from her tyrant and perhaps about to indulge in those beautiful affections for which she was formed and of which she had been rifled when i say all this occurred and her hero diplomatised and in short kept back why she had advanced one step without knowing it to running away with another man  it was unlucky that de whiskerburg stepped in an englishman would not have done she knew them well and despised them all but he was new dangerous novelty with a cast of feelings which because they were strange she believed to be unhackneyed and he was impassioned we need not go on  so this star has dropped from out the heaven so this precious pearl no longer gleams among the jewels of society and there she breathes in a foreign land among strange faces and stranger customs and when she thinks of what is past laughs at some present emptiness and tries to persuade her withering heart that the mind is independent of country and blood and opinion and her fathers face no longer shines with its proud love and her mothers voice no longer whispers to her with sweet anxiety clouded is the brow of her bold brother and dimmed is the radiancy of her budding sisters bloom  poor creature that is to say wicked woman for we are not of those who set themselves against the verdict of society or ever omit to expedite by a gentle kick a falling friend and yet when we just remember beauty is beauty and grace is grace and kindness is kindness although the beautiful the graceful and the amiable do get in a scrape we dont know how it is we confess it is a weakness but under these circumstances we do not feel quite inclined to sneer  but this is wrong we should not pity or pardon those who have yielded to great temptation or perchance great provocation besides it is right that our sympathy should be kept for the injured  to stand amid the cold ashes of your desolate hearth with all your penates shivered at your feet to find no smiling face meet your return no brow look gloomy when you leave your door to eat and sleep alone to be bored with grumbling servants and with weekly bills to have your children asking after mamma and no one to nurse your gout or cure the influenza that rages in your household all this is doubtless hard to digest and would tell in a novel particularly if written by my friends mr ward or mr bulwer     chapter xii       kindly words  the duke had passed a stormy morning with his solicitor who wished him to sell the pen bronnock property which being parliamentary would command a price infinitely greater than might be expected from its relative income the very idea of stripping his coronet of this brightest jewel and thus sacrificing for wealth the ends of riches greatly disordered him and he more and more felt the want of a counsellor who could sympathise with his feelings as well as arrange his fortunes in this mood he suddenly seized a pen and wrote the following letter   house feb 5 182  my dear mr dacre  i keenly feel that you are the last person to whom i should apply for the counsels or the consolation of friendship i have long ago forfeited all claims to your regard and your esteem i never possessed yet if only because my career ought to end by my being an unsuccessful suppliant to the individual whom both virtue and nature pointed out to me as my best friend and whose proffered and parental support i have so wantonly however thoughtlessly rejected i do not regret that this is written no feeling of false delicacy can prevent me from applying to one to whom i have long ago incurred incalculable obligations and no feeling of false delicacy will i hope for a moment prevent you from refusing the application of one who has acknowledged those obligations only by incalculable ingratitude  in a word my affairs are i fear inextricably involved i will not dwell upon the madness of my life suffice that its consequences appall me i have really endeavoured to examine into all details and am prepared to meet the evil as becomes me but indeed my head turns with the complicated interests which solicit my consideration and i tremble lest in the distraction of my mind i may adopt measures which may baffle the very results i would attain for myself i am ready to pay the penalty of my silly profligacy and if exile or any other personal infliction can redeem the fortunes of the house that i have betrayed i shall cheerfully submit to my destiny my career has been productive of too little happiness to make me regret its termination  but i want advice i want the counsel of one who can sympathise with my distracted feelings who will look as much or rather more to the honour of my family than to the convenience of myself i cannot obtain this from what are called men of business and with a blush i confess i have no friend in this situation my thoughts recur to one on whom believe me they have often dwelt and although i have no right to appeal to your heart for my fathers sake you will perhaps pardon this address whatever you may resolve my dearest sir rest assured that you and your family will always command the liveliest gratitude of one who regrets he may not subscribe himself  your obliged and devoted friend  st james  i beg that you will not answer this if your determination be what i anticipate and what i deserve dacre dacre esq c c c   it was signed sealed and sent he repented its transmission when it was gone he almost resolved to send a courier to stop the post he continued walking up and down his room for the rest of the day he could not eat or read or talk he was plunged in a nervous reverie he passed the next day in the same state unable to leave his house and unseen by visitors he retired to his bed feverish and dispirited the morning came and he woke from his hot and broken sleep at an early hour yet he had not energy to rise at last the post arrived and his letters were brought up to him with a trembling hand and sinking breath he read these lines   castle dacre february 6 182  my dear young friend  not only for your fathers sake but your own are my services ever at your command i have long been sensible of your amiable disposition and there are circumstances which will ever make me your debtor  the announcement of the embarrassed state of your affairs fills me with sorrow and anxiety yet i will hope the best young men unconsciously exaggerate adversity as well as prosperity if you are not an habitual gamester and i hope you have not been even an occasional one unbounded extravagance could scarcely in two years have permanently injured your resources however bring down with you all papers and be careful to make no arrangement even of the slightest nature until we meet  we expect you hourly may desires her kindest regards and begs me to express the great pleasure which she will feel at again finding you our guest it is unnecessary for me to repeat how very sincerely  i am your friend  dacre dacre   he read the letter three times to be sure he did not mistake the delightful import then he rang the bell with a vivacity which had not characterised him for many a month  luigi prepare to leave town tomorrow morning for an indefinite period i shall only take you i must dress immediately and order breakfast and my horses  the duke of st james had communicated the state of his affairs to lord fitzpompey who was very shocked offered his best services and also asked him to dinner to meet the marquess of marylebone the young duke had also announced to his relatives and to some of his particular friends that he intended to travel for some time and he well knew that their charitable experience would understand the rest they understood everything the marquesss party daily increased and the universe and the new world announced that the young duke was done up  there was one person to whom our hero would pay a farewell visit before he left london this was lady caroline st maurice he had called at fitzpompey house one or two mornings in the hope of finding her alone and today he determined to be more successful as he stopped his horse for the last time before his uncles mansion he could not help calling to mind the first visit which he had paid after his arrival but the door opens he enters he is announced and finds lady caroline alone  ten minutes passed away as if the morning ride or evening ball were again to bring them together the young duke was still gay and still amusing at last he said with a smile  do you know caroline this is a farewell visit and to you  she did not speak but bent her head as if she were intent upon some work and so seated herself that her countenance was almost hid  you have heard from my uncle continued he laughing and if you have not heard from him you have heard from somebody else of my little scrape a fool and his money you know caroline and a short reign and a merry one when we get prudent we are wondrous fond of proverbs my reign has certainly been brief enough with regard to the merriment that is not quite so certain i have little to regret except your society sweet coz  dear george how can you talk so of such serious affairs if you knew how unhappy how miserable i am when i hear the cold callous world speak of such things with indifference you would at least not imitate their heartlessness  dear caroline said he seating himself at her side  i cannot help thinking she continued that you have not sufficiently exerted yourself about these embarrassments you are of course too harassed too much annoyed too little accustomed to the energy and the detail of business to interfere with any effect but surely a friend might you will not speak to my father and perhaps you have your reasons but is there no one else st maurice i know has no head ah george i often feel that if your relations had been different people your fate might have been different we are the fault  he kissed her hand  among all your intimates she continued is there no one fit to be your counsellor no one worthy of your confidence  none said the duke bitterly none none i have no friend among those intimates there is not a man of them who cares to serve or is capable of serving me  you have well considered asked lady caroline  well dear well i know them all by rote head and heart ah my dear dear carry if you were a man what a nice little friend you would be  you will always laugh george but ii have no heart to laugh this breaking up of your affairs this exile this losing you whom we all love love so dearly makes me quite miserable  he kissed her hand again  i dare say she continued you have thought me as heartless as the rest because i never spoke but i knew that is i feared or rather hoped that a great part of what i heard was false and so i thought notice was unnecessary and might be painful yet heaven knows there are few subjects that have been oftener in my thoughts or cost me more anxiety are you sure you have no friend  i have you caroline i did not say i had no friends i said i had none among those intimates you talked of that there was no man among them capable of the necessary interference even if he were willing to undertake it but i am not friendless not quite forlorn dear my fate has given me a friend that i but little deserve one whom if i had prized better i should not perhaps have been obliged to put his friendship to so severe a trial tomorrow caroline i depart for castle dacre there is my friend alas how little have i deserved such a boon  dacre exclaimed lady caroline mr dacre oh you have made me so happy george mr dacre is the very very person that is the very best person you could possibly have applied to  goodbye caroline said his grace rising  she burst into tears  never never had she looked so lovely never never had he loved her so entirely tears tears shed for him oh what what is grief when a lovely woman remains to weep over our misfortunes could he be miserable could his career indeed be unfortunate when this was reserved for him he was on the point of pledging his affection but to leave her under such circumstances was impossible to neglect mr dacre was equally so he determined to arrange his affairs with all possible promptitude and then to hasten up and entreat her to share his diminished fortunes but he would not go without whispering hope without leaving some soft thought to lighten her lonely hours he caught her in his arms he covered her sweet small mouth with kisses and whispered in the midst of their pure embrace  dearest carry i shall soon return and we will yet be happy     book v     chapter i       once more at dacre  miss dacre although she was prepared to greet the duke of st james with cordiality did not anticipate with equal pleasure the arrival of the page and the jäger infinite had been the disturbances they had occasioned during their first visit and endless the complaints of the steward and the housekeeper the menservants were initiated in the mysteries of dominoes and the maidservants in the tactics of flirtation karlstein was the hero of the underbutlers and even the trusty guardian of the cellar himself was too often on the point of obtaining the germans opinion of his masters german wines gaming and drunkenness and love the most productive of all the teeming causes of human sorrow had in a week sadly disordered the wellregulated household of castle dacre and nothing but the impetuosity of our hero would have saved his hosts establishment from utter perdition miss dacre was therefore not less pleased than surprised when the britzska of the duke of st james discharged on a fine afternoon its noble master attended only by the faithful luigi at the terrace of the castle  a few country cousins fresh from cumberland who knew nothing of the duke of st james except from a stray number of the universe which occasionally stole down to corrupt the pure waters of their lakes were the only guests mr dacre grasped our heros hand with a warmth and expression which were unusual with him but which conveyed better than words the depth of his friendship and his daughter who looked more beautiful than ever advanced with a beaming face and joyous tone which quite reconciled the duke of st james to being a ruined man  the presence of strangers limited their conversation to subjects of general interest at dinner the duke took care to be agreeable he talked in an unaffected manner and particularly to the cousins who were all delighted with him and found him quite a different person from what they had fancied the evening passed over and even lightly without the aid of écarté romances or gallops mr dacre chatted with old mr montingford and old mrs montingford sat still admiring her girls who stood still admiring may dacre singing or talking and occasionally reconciled us to their occasional silence by a frequent and extremely hearty laugh that cumberland laugh which never outlives a single season in london  and the duke of st james what did he do it must be confessed that in some points he greatly resembled the misses montingford for he was both silent and admiring but he never laughed yet he was not dull and was careful not to show that he had cares which is vulgar if a man be gloomy let him keep to himself no one has a right to go croaking about society or what is worse looking as if he stifled grief these fellows should be put in the pound we like a good broken heart or so now and then but then one should retire to the sierra morena mountains and live upon locusts and wild honey not dine out with our cracked cores and while we are meditating suicide the gazette or the chiltern hundreds damn a vintage or eulogise an entrée  and as for cares what are cares when a man is in love once more they had met once more he gazed upon that sunny and sparkling face once more he listened to that sweet and thrilling voice which sounded like a birdlike burst of music upon a summer morning she moved and each attitude was fascination she was still and he regretted that she moved now her neck now her hair now her round arm now her tapering waist ravished his attention now he is in ecstasies with her twinkling foot now he is dazzled with her glancing hand  once more he was at dacre how different was this meeting to their first then she was cold almost cutting then she was disregardful almost contemptuous but then he had hoped ah madman he had more than hoped now she was warm almost affectionate now she listened to him with readiness ay almost courted his conversation and now he could only despair as he stood alone before the fire chewing this bitter cud she approached him  how good you were to come directly she said with a smile which melted his heart i fear however you will not find us so merry as before but you can make anything amusing come then and sing to these damsels do you know they are half afraid of you and i cannot persuade them that a terrible magician has not assumed for the nonce the air and appearance of a young gentleman of distinction  he smiled but could not speak repartee sadly deserts the lover yet smiles under those circumstances are eloquent and the eye after all speaks much more to the purpose than the tongue forgetting everything except the person who addressed him he offered her his hand and advanced to the group which surrounded the piano     chapter ii       the moth and the flame  the next morning was passed by the duke of st james in giving mr dacre his report of the state of his affairs his bankers accounts his architects estimates his solicitors statements were all brought forward and discussed a ride generally with miss dacre and one of her young friends dinner and a short evening and eleven oclock sent them all to repose thus glided on a fortnight the mornings continued to be passed in business affairs were more complicated than his grace had imagined who had no idea of detail he gave all the information that he could and made his friend master of his particular feelings for the rest mr dacre was soon involved in much correspondence and although the young duke could no longer assist him he recommended and earnestly begged that he would remain at dacre for he could perceive better than his grace that our hero was labouring under a great deal of excitement and that his health was impaired a regular course of life was therefore as necessary for his constitution as it was desirable for all other reasons  behold then our hero domesticated at dacre rising at nine joining a family breakfast taking a quiet ride or moderate stroll sometimes looking into a book but he was no great reader sometimes fortunate enough in achieving a stray game at billiards usually with a miss montingford and retiring to rest about the time that in london his most active existence generally began was he dull was he wearied he was never lighterhearted or more contented in his life happy he could not allow himself to be styled because the very cause which breathed this calm over his existence seemed to portend a storm which could not be avoided it was the thought the presence the smile the voice of may dacre that imparted this new interest to existence that being who never could be his he shuddered to think that all this must end but although he never indulged again in the great hope his sanguine temper allowed him to thrust away the future and to participate in all the joys of the flowing hour  at the end of february the montingfords departed and now the duke was the only guest at dacre nor did he hear that any others were expected he was alone with her again often was he alone with her and never without a strange feeling coming over his frame which made him tremble mr dacre a man of active habits always found occupation in his public duties and in the various interests of a large estate and usually requested or rather required the duke of st james to be his companion he was desirous that the duke should not be alone and ponder too much over the past nor did he conceal his wishes from his daughter who on all occasions as the duke observed with gratification seconded the benevolent intentions of her parent nor did our hero indeed wish to be alone or to ponder over the past he was quite contented with the present but he did not want to ride with papa and took every opportunity to shirk all of which mr dacre set down to the indolence of exhaustion and the inertness of a mind without an object  i am going to ride over to doncaster george said mr dacre one morning at breakfast i think that you had better order your horse too a good ride will rouse you and you should show yourself there  oh very well sir but but i think that  but what asked mr dacre smiling  the duke looked to miss dacre who seemed to take pity on his idleness  you make him ride too much papa leave him at home with me i have a long round today and want an escort i will take him instead of my friend tom carter you must carry a basket though said she turning to the duke and run for the doctor if he be wanted and in short do any odd message that turns up  so mr dacre departed alone and shortly after his daughter and the duke of st james set out on their morning ramble many were the cottages at which they called many the old dames after whose rheumatisms and many the young damsels after whose fortunes they enquired old dame rawdon was worse or better worse last night but better this morning she was always better when miss called misss face always did her good and fanny was very comfortable at squire wentworths and the housekeeper was very kind to her thanks to miss saying a word to the great lady and old john selby was quite about again misss stuff had done him a world of good to say nothing of mr dacres generous old wine  and is this your second son dame rishworth no that bees our fourth said the old woman maternally arranging the urchins thin white flat straight unmanageable hair we are thinking what to do with him miss he wants to go out to service since jem eustace got on so i dont know what the matter is with the lads but i think we shall have none of them in the fields soon he can clean knives and shoes very well miss mr bradford at the castle was saying tother day that perhaps he might want a young hand you havent heard anything i suppose miss  and what is your name sir asked miss dacre bobby rishworth miss well bobby i must consult mr bradford we be in great trouble miss said the next cottager we be in great trouble tom poor tom was out last night and the keepers will give him up the good man has done all he can we have all done all we can miss and you see how it ends he is the first of the family that ever went out i hope that will be considered miss seventy years our fathers before us have we been on the state and nothing ever sworn agin us i hope that will be considered miss i am sure if tom had been an underkeeper as mr roberts once talked of this would never have happened i hope that will be considered miss we are in great trouble surely tom you see was our first miss  i never interfere about poaching you know mrs jones mr dacre is the best judge of such matters but you can go to him and say that i sent you i am afraid however that he has heard of tom before  only that night at milwood miss and then you see he had been drinking with squire ridges people i hope that will be considered miss  well well go up to the castle  pray be seated miss said a neatlooking mistress of a neat little farmhouse pray be seated sir let me dust it first dust will get everywhere do what we can and hows pa miss he has not given me a lookin for many a day not since he was ahunting bless me if it aynt a fortnight this day fortnight he tasted our ale sure enough will you take a glass sir  you are very good no i thank you not today  yes give him a glass nurse he is unwell and it will do him good  she brought the sparkling amber fluid and the duke did justice by his draught  i shall have fine honey for you miss this year said the old nurse are you fond of honey sir our honey is well known about i dont know how it is but we do always contrive to manage the bees how fond some people are of honey good lord now when you were a little girl i knew this young lady sir before you did you always used to be fond of honey i remember one day let me see it must be ay truly that it is eighteen years ago next martinmas i was agoing down the nursery stairs just to my poor mistresss room and i had you in my arms for i knew this young lady sir before you did well i was agoing down the stairs as i just said to my poor dear mistresss room with you who was then a littleun indeed bless your smiling face you cost me many a weary hour when you were weaned miss that you did some thought you would never get through it but i always said while there is life there is hope and so you see i were right but as i was saying i was agoing down the stairs to my poor dear mistress and i had a gallipot in my hand a covered gallipot with some leeches and just as i had got to the bottom of the stairs and was agoing into my poor dear mistresss room said you i never shall forget it said you honey honey nurse she thought it were honey sir so you see she were always very fond of honey for i knew this young lady long before you did sir  are you quite sure of that nurse said miss dacre i think this is an older friend than you imagine you remember the little duke do not you this is the little duke do you think he has grown  now bless my life is it so indeed well be sure he has grown i always thought he would turn out well miss though dr pretyman were always apreaching and talking his prophecycations i always thought he would turn out well at last bless me how he has grown indeed perhaps he grows too fast and that makes him weak nothing better than a glass of ale for weak people i remember when dr pretyman ordered it for my poor dear mistress give her ale said the doctor as strong as it can be brewed and sure enough my poor dear master had it brewed have you done growing sir you was ever a troublesome child often and often have i called george george georgy georgy porgy and he never would come near me though he heard all the time as plainly as he does now bless me he has grown indeed  but i have turned out well at last nurse eh asked the duke  ay sure enough i always said so often and often have i said he will turn out well at last you be going miss i thank you for looking in my duty to my master i was thinking of bringing up one of those cheeses he likes so  ay do nurse he can eat no cheese but yours  as they wandered home they talked of lady caroline to whom the duke mentioned that he must write he had once intended distinctly to have explained his feelings to her in a letter from dacre but each day he postponed the close of his destiny although without hope he lingered and he lingered round may dacre as a bird flutters round the fruit which is already grasped by a boy circumstances which we shall relate had already occurred which confirmed the suspicion he had long entertained that arundel dacre was his favoured rival impressed with the folly of again encouraging hope yet unable to harden his heart against her continual fascination the softness of his manner indicated his passion and his calm and somewhat languid carriage also told her it was hopeless perhaps after all there is no demeanour more calculated to melt obdurate woman the gratification he received from her society was evident yet he never indulged in that gallantry of which he was once so proud when she approached him a mild smile lit up his pensive countenance he adopted her suggestions but made none he listened to her remarks with interest but no longer bandied repartee delicately he impressed her with the absolute power which she might exercise over his mind  i write myself to caroline tomorrow said miss dacre  ah then i need not write i talked of going up sooner have the kindness to explain why i do not peremptory orders from mr dacre fresh air and  arithmetic i understand you get on admirably  my follies said the duke with a serious air have at least been productive of one good end they have amused you  nay i have done too many foolish things myself any more to laugh at my neighbours as for yourself you have only committed those which were inseparable from your situation and few like the duke of st james would so soon have opened their eyes to the truth of their conduct  a compliment from you repays me for all  selfapprobation does which is much better than compliments from anyone see there is papa and arundel too let us run up     chapter iii       again the rival  the duke of st james had on his arrival at dacre soon observed that a constant correspondence was maintained between miss dacre and her cousin there was no attempt to conceal the fact from any of the guests and as that young gentleman was now engaged in an affair interesting to all his friends every letter generally contained some paragraph almost as interesting to the montingfords as to herself which was accordingly read aloud mr arundel dacre was candidate for the vacant representation of a town in a distant county he had been disappointed in his views on the borough about which he had returned to england but had been nevertheless persuaded by his cousin to remain in his native country during this period he had been a great deal at castle dacre and had become much more intimate and unreserved with his uncle who observed with great satisfaction this change in his character and lost no opportunity of deserving and increasing the confidence for which he had so long unavailingly yearned and which was now so unexpectedly proffered  the borough for which arundel dacre was about to stand was in sussex a county in which his family had no property and very slight connection yet at the place the catholic interest was strong and on that and the usual whig influence he ventured his desire to be a member of the legislature at all and from early times extreme was now greatly heightened by the prospect of being present at the impending catholic debate after an absence of three weeks he had hurried to yorkshire for fourandtwenty hours to give a report of the state of his canvass and the probability of his success in that success all were greatly interested but none more so than miss dacre whose thoughts indeed seemed to dwell on no other subject and who expressed herself with a warmth which betrayed her secret feelings had the place only been in yorkshire she was sure he must have succeeded she was the best canvasser in the world and everybody agreed that harry greystoke owed his election merely to her insinuating tongue and unrivalled powers of scampering by which she had completely baffled the tactics of lady amarantha  germain who thought that a canvass was only a long morning call and might be achieved in a cashmere and a britzska  the young duke who had seen little of his second since the eventful day greeted him with warmth and was welcomed with a frankness which he had never before experienced from his friend excited by rapid travel and his present course of life and not damped by the unexpected presence of any strangers arundel dacre seemed quite a changed man and talked immensely  come may i must have a kiss i have been kissing as pretty girls as you there now you all said i never should be a popular candidate i get regularly huzzaed every day so they have been obliged to hire a band of butchers boys to pelt me whereupon i compare myself to cæsar set upon in the senate house and get immense cheering in the county chronicle which i have bribed if you knew the butts of wine the heidelberg tuns of ale that i have drank during the last fortnight you would stare indeed as much as the lake but then i have to talk so much that the ardour of my eloquence like the hot flannels of the humane society save me from the injurious effects of all this liquid  but will you get in but will you get in exclaimed his cousin  tis not in mortals to command success but  pooh pooh you must command it well then i have an excellent chance and the only thing against me is that my committee are quite sure but really i think that if the protestant overseers whom bythebye may i cannot persuade that i am a heretic it is very hard that a man is not believed when he says he shall be damned if they do not empty the workhouse we shall do but let us go in for i have travelled all night and must be off tomorrow morning  they entered the house and the duke quitted the family group about an hour afterwards he sauntered to the musicroom as he opened the door his eyes lighted upon may dacre and her cousin they were standing before the fire with their backs to the door his arm was wound carelessly round her waist and with his other hand he supported with her a miniature at which she was looking  the duke could not catch her countenance which was completely hid but her companion was not gazing on the picture his head a little turned indicated that there was a living countenance more interesting to him than all the skill of the most cunning artist part of his cheek was alone perceptible and that was burning red  all this was the work of a moment the duke stared turned pale closed the door without a sound and retired unperceived when he was sure that he could no longer be observed he gasped for breath a cold dew covered his frame his joints loosened and his sinking heart gave him that sickening sensation when life appears utterly worthless and ourselves utterly contemptible yet what had he witnessed a confirmation of what he had never doubted what was this woman to him alas how supreme was the power with which she ruled his spirit and this dacre this arundel dacre how he hated him oh that they were hand to hand and sword to sword in some fair field and there decide it he must conquer he felt that already his weapon pierced that craven heart and ripped open that breast which was to be the pillow of hell hell he rushed to his room and began a letter to caroline st maurice but he could not write and after scribbling over a quire of paper he threw the sheets to the flames and determined to ride up to town tomorrow  the dinner bell sounded could he meet them ay meet them defy them insult them he descended to the diningroom he heard her musical and liquid voice the scowl upon his brow melted away but gloomy and silent he took his seat and gloomy and silent he remained little he spoke and that little was scarcely courteous but arundel had enough to say he was the hero of the party well he might be story after story of old maids and young widows sturdy butchers and corrupt coal merchants sparkled away but a faint smile was all the tribute of the duke and a tribute that was seldom paid  you are not well said miss dacre to him in a low voice  i believe i am answered he shortly  you do not seem quite so she replied with an air of surprise  i believe i have got a headache he retorted with little more cordiality she did not again speak but she was evidently annoyed     chapter iv       bitter is jealousy  there certainly is a dark delight in being miserable a sort of strange satisfaction in being savage which is uncommonly fascinating one of the greatest pests of philosophy is that one can no longer be sullen and most sincerely do i regret it to brood over misery to flatter yourself that there is not a single being who cares for your existence and not a single circumstance to make that existence desirable there is wild witchery in it which we doubt whether opium can reach and are sure that wine cannot  and the duke he soon left the uncle and nephew to their miserable speculations about the state of the poll and took his sullen way with the air of ajax to the terrace here he stalked along in a fierce reverie asked why he had been born why he did not die why he should live and so on his wounded pride which had borne so much fairly got the mastery and revenged itself for all insults on love whom it ejected most scurvily he blushed to think how he had humiliated himself before her she was the cause of that humiliation and of every disagreeable sensation that he was experiencing he began therefore to imprecate vengeance walked himself into a fair coldhearted malicious passion and avowed most distinctly that he hated her as for him most ardently he hoped that some day or other they might again meet at six oclock in the morning in kensington gardens but in a different relation to each other  it was dark when he entered the castle he was about ascending to his own room when he determined not to be cowed and resolved to show himself the regardless witness of their mutual loves so he repaired to the drawingroom at one end of this very spacious apartment mr dacre and arundel were walking in deep converse at the other sat miss dacre at a table reading the duke seized a chair without looking at her dragged it along to the fireplace and there seating himself with his arms folded his feet on the fender and his chair tilting he appeared to be lost in the abstracting contemplation of the consuming fuel  some minutes had passed when a slight sound like a fluttering bird made him look up miss dacre was standing at his side  is your head better she asked him in a soft voice  thank you it is quite well he replied in a sullen one  there was a moments pause and then she again spoke  i am sure you are not well  perfectly thank you  something has happened then she said rather imploringly  what should have happened he rejoined pettishly  you are very strange very unlike what you always are  what i always am is of no consequence to myself or to anyone else and as for what i am now i cannot always command my feelings though i shall take care that they are not again observed  i have offended you  then you have shown your discretion for you should always offend the forlorn  i did not think before that you were bitter  that has made me bitter which has made all others so  what  disappointment  another pause yet she did not go  i will not quarrel and so you need not try you are consigned to my care and i am to amuse you what shall we do  do what you like miss dacre but spare oh spare me your pity  you do indeed surprise me pity i was not thinking of pity but you are indeed serious and i leave you  he turned he seized her hand  nay do not go forgive me he said forgive me for i am most miserable  why why are you  oh do not ask you agonise me  shall i sing shall i charm the evil spirit  anything  she tripped to the piano and an air bursting like the spring and gay as a village feast filled the room with its delight he listened and each instant the chilly weight loosened from his heart her balmy voice now came upon his ear breathing joy and cheerfulness content and love could love be the savage passion which lately subjugated his soul he rose from his seat he walked about the room each minute his heart was lighter his brow more smooth a thousand thoughts beautiful and quivering like the twilight glanced oer his mind in indistinct but exquisite tumult and hope like the voice of an angel in a storm was heard above all he lifted a chair gently from the ground and stealing to the enchantress seated himself at her side so softly he reached her that for a moment he was unperceived she turned her head and her eyes met his even the ineffable incident was forgotten as he marked the strange gush of lovely light that seemed to say what to think of was after all madness     chapter v       arundels disappointment  the storm was past he vowed that a dark thought should not again cross his mind it was fated that she should not be his but it was some miserable satisfaction that he was only rejected in favour of an attachment which had grown with her years and had strengthened with her stature and in deference to an engagement hallowed by time as well as by affection it was deadly indeed to remember that fate seemed to have destined him for that happy position and that his folly had rejected the proffered draught of bliss he blasphemed against the fitzpompeys however he did not leave dacre at the same time as arundel but lingered on his affairs were far from being arranged the irish business gave great trouble and he determined therefore to remain  it was ridiculous to talk of feeding a passion which was not susceptible of increase her society was heaven and he resolved to enjoy it although he was to be expelled as for his loss of fortune it gave him not a moments care without her he felt he could not live in england and even ruined he would be a match for an italian prince  so he continued her companion each day rising with purer feelings and a more benevolent heart each day more convinced of the falseness of his past existence and of the possibility of happiness to a wellregulated mind each day more conscious that duty is nothing more than selfknowledge and the performance of it consequently the development of feelings which are the only true source of selfgratification he mourned over the opportunities which he had forfeited of conducing to the happiness of others and himself sometimes he had resolved to remain in england and devote himself to his tenantry but passion blinded him and he felt that he had erred too far ever to regain the right road  the election for which arundel dacre was a candidate came on each day the state of the poll arrived it was nearly equal to the last their agitation was terrible but forgotten in the deep mortification which they experienced at the announcement of his defeat he talked to the public boldly of petitioning and his certainty of ultimate success but he let them know privately that he had no intention of the first and no chance of the second even mr dacre could mot conceal his deep disappointment but may was quite in despair even if her father could find means of securing him a seat another time the present great opportunity was lost  surely we can make some arrangement for next session said the duke whispering hope to her  oh no no no so much depended upon this it is not merely his taking a part in the debate butbut arundel is so odd and everything was staked upon this i cannot tell you what depended upon it he will leave england directly  she did not attempt to conceal her agitation the duke rose and paced the room in a state scarcely less moved a thought had suddenly flashed upon him their marriage doubtless depended upon this success he knew something of arundel dacre and had heard more he was convinced of the truth of his suspicion either the nephew would not claim her hand until he had carved out his own fortunes or perhaps the uncle made his distinction the condition of his consent yet this was odd it was all odd a thousand things had occurred which equally puzzled him yet he had seen enough to weigh against a thousand thoughts     chapter vi       a generous action  another fortnight glided away and he was still at the castle still the constant and almost sole companion of may dacre it is breakfast the servant is delivering the letterbag to mr dacre interesting moment when you extend your hand for the billet of a mistress and receive your tailors bill how provokingly slow are most domestic chieftains in this anxious operation they turn the letters over and over and upside and down arrange confuse mistake assort pretend like champollion to decipher illegible franks and deliver with a slight remark which is intended as a friendly admonition the documents of the unlucky wight who encourages unprivileged correspondents  a letter was delivered to miss dacre she started exclaimed blushed and tore it open  only you only you she said extending her hand to the young duke only you were capable of this  it was a letter from arundel dacre not only written but franked by him  it explained everything that the duke of st james might have told them before but he preferred hearing all himself from the delighted and delightful lips of miss dacre who read to her father her cousins letter  the duke of st james had returned him for one of his cornish boroughs it appeared that lord st maurice was the previous member who had accepted the chiltern hundreds in his favour  you were determined to surprise as well as delight us said mr dacre  i am no admirer of mysteries said the duke but the fact is in the present case it was not in my power to give you any positive information and i had no desire to provide you after your late disappointment with new sources of anxiety the only person i could take the liberty with at so short a notice was st maurice he you know is a liberal but he cannot forget that he is the son of a tory and has no great ambition to take any active part in affairs at present i anticipated less difficulty with him than with his father st maurice can command me again when it suits him but i confess to you i have been surprised at my uncles kindness in this affair i really have not done justice to his character before and regret it he has behaved in the most kindhearted and the most liberal manner and put me under obligations which i never shall forget he seems as desirous of serving my friend as myself and i assure you sir it would give you pleasure to know in what terms of respect he speaks of your family and particularly of arundel  arundel says he shall take his seat the morning of the debate how very near how admirably managed oh i never shall recover my surprise and delight how good you are  he takes his seat then tomorrow said mr dacre in a musing tone my letters give a rather nervous account of affairs we are to win it they hope but by two only as for the lords the majority against us will it is said be somewhat smaller than usual we shall never triumph george till may is mp for the county cannot you return her for pen bronnock too  they talked as you may suppose of nothing else at last mr dacre remembered an appointment with his bailiff and proposed to the duke to join him who acceded  and i to be left alone this morning then said miss dacre i am sure as they say of children i can set to nothing  come and ride with us then  an excellent idea let us canter over to hauteville i am just in the humour for a gallop up the avenue and feel half emancipated already with a dacre in the house oh tomorrow how nervous i shall be  i will despatch barrington then said mr dacre and join you in ten minutes  how good you are said miss dacre to the duke how can we thank you enough what can we do for you  you have thanked me enough what have i done after all my opportunity to serve my friends is brief is it wonderful that i seize the opportunity  brief brief why do you always say so why do you talk so of leaving us  my visit to you has been already too long it must soon end and i remain not in england when it ceases  come and live at hauteville and be near us  he faintly smiled as he said no no my doom is fixed hauteville is the last place that i should choose for my residence even if i remained in england but i hear the horses  the important night at length arrived or rather the important messenger who brought down express a report of its proceedings to castle dacre  nothing is more singular than the various success of men in the house of commons fellows who have been the oracles of coteries from their birth who have gone through the regular process of gold medals senior wranglerships and double firsts who have nightly sat down amid tumultuous cheering in debating societies and can harangue with unruffled foreheads and unfaltering voice from one end of a dinnertable to the other who on all occasions have something to say and can speak with fluency on what they know nothing about no sooner rise in the house than their spells desert them all their effrontery vanishes commonplace ideas are rendered even more uninteresting by monotonous delivery and keenly alive as even boobies are in those sacred walls to the ridiculous no one appears more thoroughly aware of his unexpected and astounding deficiencies than the orator himself he regains his seat hot and hard sultry and stiff with a burning cheek and an icy hand repressing his breath lest it should give evidence of an existence of which he is ashamed and clenching his fist that the pressure may secretly convince him that he has not as completely annihilated his stupid body as his false reputation  on the other hand persons whom the women have long deplored and the men long pitied as having no manner who blush when you speak to them and blunder when they speak to you suddenly jump up in the house with a selfconfidence which is only equalled by their consummate ability and so it was with arundel dacre he rose the first night that he took his seat a great disadvantage of which no one was more sensible than himself and for an hour and a half he addressed the fullest house that had long been assembled with the selfpossession of an habitual debater his clenching argument and his luminous detail might have been expected from one who had the reputation of having been a student what was more surprising was the withering sarcasm that blasted like the simoom the brilliant sallies of wit that flashed like a sabre the gushing eddies of humour that drowned all opposition and overwhelmed those ponderous and unwieldy arguments which the producers announced as rocks but which he proved to be porpoises never was there such a triumphant début and a peroration of genuine eloquence because of genuine feeling concluded amid the long and renewed cheers of all parties  the truth is eloquence is the child of knowledge when a mind is full like a wholesome river it is also clear confusion and obscurity are much oftener the results of ignorance than of inefficiency few are the men who cannot express their meaning when the occasion demands the energy as the lowest will defend their lives with acuteness and sometimes even with eloquence they are masters of their subject knowledge must be gained by ourselves mankind may supply us with facts but the results even if they agree with previous ones must be the work of our own mind to make others feel we must feel ourselves and to feel ourselves we must be natural this we can never be when we are vomiting forth the dogmas of the schools knowledge is not a mere collection of words and it is a delusion to suppose that thought can be obtained by the aid of any other intellect than our own what is repetition by a curious mystery ceases to be truth even if it were truth when it was first heard as the shadow in a mirror though it move and mimic all the actions of vitality is not life when a man is not speaking or writing from his own mind he is as insipid company as a lookingglass  before a man can address a popular assembly with command he must know something of mankind and he can know nothing of mankind without knowing something of himself selfknowledge is the property of that man whose passions have their play but who ponders over their results such a man sympathises by inspiration with his kind he has a key to every heart he can divine in the flash of a single thought all that they require all that they wish such a man speaks to their very core all feel that a masterhand tears off the veil of cant with which from necessity they have enveloped their souls for cant is nothing more than the sophistry which results from attempting to account for what is unintelligible or to defend what is improper  perhaps although we use the term we never have had oratory in england there is an essential difference between oratory and debating oratory seems an accomplishment confined to the ancients unless the french preachers may put in their claim and some of the irish lawyers mr shiels speech in kent was a fine oration and the boobies who taunted him for having got it by rote were not aware that in doing so he only wisely followed the example of pericles demosthenes lysias isocrates hortensius cicero cæsar and every great orator of antiquity oratory is essentially the accomplishment of antiquity it was their most efficient mode of communicating thought it was their substitute for printing  i like a good debate and when a stripling used sometimes to be stifled in the gallery or enjoy the easier privileges of a members son i like i say a good debate and have no objection to a due mixture of bores which are a relief i remember none of the giants of former days but i have heard canning he was a consummate rhetorician but there seemed to me a dash of commonplace in all that he said and frequent indications of the absence of an original mind to the last he never got clear of good god sir and all the other hackneyed ejaculations of his youthful debating clubs the most commanding speaker that i ever listened to is i think sir francis burdett i never heard him in the house but at an election he was full of music grace» and dignity even amid all the vulgar tumult and unlike all mob orators raised the taste of the populace to him instead of lowering his own to theirs his colleague mr hobhouse seemed to me ill qualified for a demagogue though he spoke with power he is rather too elaborate and a little heavy but fluent and never weak his thoughtful and highlycultivated mind maintains him under all circumstances and his breeding never deserts him sound sense comes recommended from his lips by the language of a scholar and the urbanity of a gentleman  mr brougham at present reigns paramount in the house of commons i think the lawyer has spoiled the statesman he is said to have great powers of sarcasm from what i have observed there i should think very little ones would be quite sufficient many a sneer withers in those walls which would scarcely i think blight a currantbush out of them and i have seen the house convulsed with raillery which in other society would infallibly settle the rallier to be a bore beyond all tolerance even an idiot can raise a smile they are so goodnatured or find it so dull mr cannings badinage was the most successful though i confess i have listened to few things more calculated to make a man gloomy but the house always ran riot taking everything for granted and cracked their universal sides before he opened his mouth the fault of mr brougham is that he holds no intellect at present in great dread and consequently allows himself on all occasions to run wild few men hazard more unphilosophical observations but he is safe because there is no one to notice them on all great occasions mr brougham has come up to the mark an infallible test of a man of genius  i hear that mr macaulay is to be returned if he speaks half as well as he writes the house will be in fashion again i fear that he is one of those who like the individual whom he has most studied will give up to party what was meant for mankind  at any rate he must get rid of his rabidity he writes now on all subjects as if he certainly intended to be a renegade and was determined to make the contrast complete  mr peel is the model of a minister and improves as a speaker though like most of the rest he is fluent without the least style he should not get so often in a passion either or if he do should not get out of one so easily his sweet apologies are cloying his candourhe will do well to get rid of that he can make a present of it to mr huskisson who is a memorable instance of the value of knowledge which maintains a man under all circumstances and all disadvantages and will  in the lords i admire the duke the readiness with which he has adopted the air of a debater shows the man of genius there is a gruff husky sort of a downright montaignish naïveté about him which is quaint unusual and tells you plainly perceive that he is determined to be a civilian and he is as offended if you drop a hint that he occasionally wears an uniform as a servant on a holiday if you mention the word livery  lord grey speaks with feeling and is better to hear than to read though ever strong and impressive lord hollands speeches are like a refacimento of all the suppressed passages in clarendon and the notes in the new edition of bishop burnets memoirs but taste throws a delicate hue over the curious medley and the candour of a philosophic mind shows that in the library of holland house he can sometimes cease to be a partisan  one thing is clear that a man may speak very well in the house of commons and fail very completely in the house of lords there are two distinct styles requisite i intend in the course of my career if i have time to give a specimen of both in the lower house don juan may perhaps be our model in the upper house paradise lost     book v continued     chapter vii       to see ourselves as others see us  nothing was talked of in yorkshire but mr arundel dacres speech all the world flocked to castle dacre to compliment and to congratulate and an universal hope was expressed that he might come in for the county if indeed the success of his eloquence did not enable his uncle to preoccupy that honour even the calm mr dacre shared the general elation and told the duke of st james regularly every day that it was all owing to him may dacre was enthusiastic but her gratitude to him was synonymous with her love for arundel and valued accordingly the duke however felt that he had acted at once magnanimously generously and wisely the consciousness of a noble action is itself ennobling his spirit expanded with the exciting effects which his conduct had produced and he felt consolation under all his misery from the conviction that he had now claims to be remembered and perhaps regarded when he was no more among them  the bill went swimmingly through the commons the majority of two gradually swelling into eleven and the important night in the lords was at hand  lord faulconcourt writes said mr dacre that they expect only thirtyeight against us  ah that terrible house of lords said miss dacre let us see when does it come on the day after tomorrow scarcely fortyeight hours and all will be over and we shall be just where we were you and your friends manage very badly in your house she added addressing herself to the duke  i do all i can said his grace smiling burlington has my proxy  that is exactly what i complain of on such an occasion there should be no proxies personal attendance would indicate a keener interest in the result ah if i were duke of st james for one night  ah that you would be duchess of st james thought the duke but a despairing lover has no heart for jokes and so he did not give utterance to the wish he felt a little agitated and caught may dacres eye she smiled and slightly blushed as if she felt the awkwardness of her remark though too late  the duke retired early but not to sleep his mind was busied on a great deed it was past midnight before he could compose his agitated feelings to repose and by five oclock he was again up he dressed himself and then put on a rough travelling coat which with a shawl effectually disguised his person and putting in one pocket a shirt and in the other a few articles from his dressingcase the duke of st james stole out of castle dacre leaving a note for his host accounting for his sudden departure by urgent business at hauteville and promising a return in a day or two  the fresh morn had fully broke he took his hurried way through the long dewy grass and crossing the park gained the road which however was not the high one he had yet another hours rapid walk before he could reach his point of destination and when that was accomplished he found himself at a small publichouse bearing for a sign his own arms and situated in the high road opposite his own park he was confident that his person was unknown to the host or to any of the early idlers who were lingering about the mail then breakfasting  any room guard to london  room inside sir just going off  the door was opened and the duke of st james took his seat in the edinburgh and york mail he had two companions the first because apparently the most important was a hardfeatured greyheaded gentleman with a somewhat supercilious look and a mingled air of acuteness and conceit the other was a humblelooking widow in her weeds middleaged and sad these persons had recently roused themselves from their nocturnal slumbers and now after their welcome meal and hurried toilet looked as fresh as birds  well now we are off said the gentleman very neat cleanly little house this maam continued he to his companion what is the sign the hauteville arms oh hauteville that isthat is let me see the st james family ah a pretty fool that young man has made of himself by all accounts eh sir  i have reason to believe so said the duke  i suppose this is his park eh hem going to london sir  i am  ah hem hauteville park i suppose this fine ground wasted what the use of parks is i cant say  the place seems well kept up said the widow  so much the worse i wish it were in ruins  well for my part continued the widow in a low voice i think a park nearly the most beautiful thing we have foreigners you know sir  ah i know what you are going to say observed the gentleman in a curt gruffish voice it is all nonsense foreigners are fools dont talk to me of beauty a mere word what is the use of all this it produces about as much benefit to society as its owner does  and do you think his existence then perfectly useless asked the duke  to be sure i do so the world will some day or other we are opening our eyes fast men begin to ask themselves what the use of an aristocracy is that is the test sir  i think it not very difficult to demonstrate the use of an aristocracy mildly observed the duke  pooh nonsense sir i know what you are going to say but we have got beyond all that have you read this sir this article on the aristocracy in the screw and lever review  i have not sir  then i advise you to make yourself master of it and you will talk no more of the aristocracy a few more articles like this and a few more noblemen like the man who has got this park and people will open their eyes at last  i should think said his grace that the follies of the man who had got this park have been productive of evil only to himself in fact sir according to your own system a prodigal noble seems to be a very desirable member of the commonwealth and a complete leveller  we shall get rid of them all soon sir said his companion with a malignant smile  i have heard that he is very young sir remarked the widow  what is that to you or me  ah youth is a trying time let us hope the best he may turn out well yet poor soul  i hope not dont talk to me of poor souls there is a poor soul said the utilitarian pointing to an old man breaking stones on the highway that is what i call a poor soul not a young prodigal whose life has been one long career of infamous debauchery  you appear to have heard much of this young nobleman said the duke but it does not follow sir that you have heard truth  very true sir said the widow the world is very foulmouthed let us hope he is not so very bad  i tell you what my friends you know nothing about what you are talking of i dont speak without foundation you have not the least idea sir how this fellow has lived now what i am going to tell you is a fact i know it to be a fact a very intimate friend of mine who knows a person who is a very intimate friend of an intimate friend of a person who knows the duke of st james told me himself that one night they had for supperwhat do you think maamvenison cutlets each served up in a hundred pound note  mercy exclaimed the widow  and do you believe it asked the duke  believe it i know it  he is very young said the widow youth is a very trying time  nothing to do with his youth its the system the infernal system if that man had to work for his bread like everybody else do you think he would dine off bank notes no to be sure he wouldnt its the system  young people are very wild said the widow  pooh maam nonsense dont talk cant if a man be properly educated he is as capable at oneandtwenty of managing anything as at any time in his life more capable look at the men who write the screw and lever the first men in the country look at them not one of age look at the man who wrote this article on the aristocracy young duncan macmorrogh look at him i say the first man in the country by far  i never heard his name before calmly observed the duke  not heard his name not heard of young duncan macmorrogh the first man of the day by far not heard of him go and ask the marquess of sheepshead what he thinks of him go and ask lord two and two what he thinks of him duncan dines with lord two and two every week  the duke smiled and his companion proceeded  well again look at his friends there is young first principles what a «head that fellow has got here this article on india is by him hell knock up their charter he is a clerk in the india house up to the detail you see let me read you this passage on monopolies then there is young tribonian quirk by g what a mind that fellow has got by g nothing but first principles will go down with these fellows they laugh at anything else by g sir they look upon the administration of the present day as a parcel of sucking babes when i was last in town quirk told me that he would not give that for all the public men that ever existed he is keeping his terms at grays inn this article on a new code is by him shows as plain as light that by sticking close to first principles the laws of the country might be carried in every mans waistcoat pocket  the coach stopped and a colloquy ensued  any room to selby  outside or in  out to be sure  room inside only  well in then  the door opened and a singularly quaintlooking personage presented himself he was very stiff and prim in his appearance dressed in a blue coat and scarlet waistcoat with a rich bandanna handkerchief tied very neatly round his neck and a very new hat to which his head seemed little habituated  sorry to disturb you ladies and gentlemen not exactly the proper place for me dont be alarmed im always respectful wherever i am my rule through life is to be respectful  well now in with you said the guard  be respectful my friend and dont talk so to an old soldier who has served his king and his country  off they went  majestys service asked the stranger of the duke  i have not that honour  hum lawyer perhaps  not a lawyer  hum a gentleman i suppose  the duke was silent and so the stranger addressed himself to the antiaristocrat who seemed vastly annoyed by the intrusion of so low a personage  going to london sir  i tell you what my friend at once i never answer impertinent questions  no offence i hope sir sorry to offend im always respectful madam i hope i dont inconvenience you i should be sorry to do that we sailors you know are always ready to accommodate the ladies  sailor exclaimed the acute utilitarian his curiosity stifling his hauteur why just now i thought you were a soldier  well so i am  well my friend you are a conjuror then  no i aynt im a marine  a very useless person then  what do you mean  i mean to say that if the sailors were properly educated such an amphibious corps would never have been formed and some of the most atrocious sinecures ever tolerated would consequently not have existed  sinecures i never heard of him i served under lord combermere maybe you have heard of him maam a nice man a beautiful man i have seen him stand in a field like that with the shot falling about him like hail and caring no more for them than peas  if that were for bravado said the utilitarian i think it a very silly thing  bravado i never heard of him it was for his king and country  was it in india asked the widow  in a manner maam said the marine very courteously at bhurtpore up by pershy and thereabouts the lake of cashmere where all the shawls come from maybe you have heard of cashmere maam  who has not heard of the vale of cashmere hummed the duke to himself  ah i thought so said the marine all people know much the same for some have seen and some have read i cant read but i have served my king and country for fiveandtwenty years and i have used my eyes  better than reading said the duke humouring the character  ill tell you what said the marine with a knowing look i suspect there is a dd lot of lies in your books i landed in england last seventh of june and went to see st pauls this is the greatest building in the world says the man thinks i you lie i did not tell him so because i am always respectful i tell you what sir maybe you think st pauls the greatest building in the world but i tell you what its a lie i have seen one greater maybe maam you think i am telling you a lie too but i am not go and ask captain jones of the 58th i went with him i give you his name go and ask captain jones of the 58th if i be telling you a lie the building i mean is the palace of the sultan acber for i have served my king and country fiveandtwenty years last seventh of june and have seen strange things all built of precious stones maam what do you think of that all built of precious stones carnelian of which you make your seals as sure as im a sinner saved if i aynt speaking the truth i am not going to selby maybe youd like to know why i am going to selby ill tell you what fiveandtwenty years have i served my king and country last seventh of june now i begin with the beginning i ran away from home when i was eighteen you see and after the siege of bhurtpore i was sitting on a bale of silk alone and i said to myself ill go and see my mother sure as i am going to selby thats the whole i landed in england last seventh of june absent fiveandtwenty years serving my king and country i sent them a letter last night i put it in the post myself maybe i shall be there before my letter now  to be sure you will said the utilitarian what made you do such a silly thing why your letter is in this coach  well i shouldnt wonder i shall be there before my letter now all nonsense letters my wife wrote it at falmouth  you are married then said the widow  aynt i though the sweetest cretur madam though i say it before you that ever lived  why did you not bring your wife with you asked the widow  and wouldnt i be very glad to but she wouldnt come among strangers at once and so i have got a letter which she wrote for me to put in the post in case they are glad to see me and then she will come on  and you i suppose are not sorry to have a holiday said the duke  aynt i though aynt i as low about leaving her as ever i was in my life and so is the poor cretur she wont eat a bit of victuals till i come back ill be sworn not a bit ill be bound to say that and myself although i am an old soldier and served my king and country for fiveandtwenty years and so got knocked about and used to anything as it were i dont know how it is but i always feel queer whenever i am away from her i shant make a hearty meal till i see her somehow or other when i am away from her everything feels dry in the throat  you are very fond of her i see said the duke  and ought i not to be didnt i ask her three times before she said yes those are the wives for wear sir none of the fruit that falls at a shaking for me hasnt she stuck by me in every climate and in every land i was in not a fellow in the company had such a wife wouldnt i throw myself off this coach this moment to give her a moments peace that i would though dme if i wouldnt  hush hush said the widow never swear i am afraid you talk too much of your love she added with a faint smile  ah you dont know my wife maam are you married sir  i have not that happiness said the duke  well there is nothing like it but dont take the fruit that falls at a shake but this i suppose is selby  the marine took his departure having stayed long enough to raise in the young dukes mind curious feelings  as he was plunged into reverie and as the widow was silent conversation was not resumed until the coach stopped for dinner  we stop here halfanhour gentlemen said the guard mrs burnet he continued to the widow let me hand you out  they entered the parlour of the inn the duke who was ignorant of the etiquette of the road did not proceed to the discharge of his duties as the youngest guest with all the promptness desired by his fellowtravellers  now sir said an outside i will thank you for a slice of that mutton and will join you if you have no objection in a bottle of sherry  what you please sir may i have the pleasure of helping you maam  after dinner the duke took advantage of a vacant outside place  tom rawlins was the model of a guard young robust and gay he had a letter a word or a wink for all he met all seasons were the same to him night or day he was ever awake and ever alive to all the interest of the road now joining in conversation with a passenger shrewd sensible and respectful now exchanging a little elegant badinage with the coachman now bowing to a pretty girl now quizzing a passerby he was off and on his seat in an instant and in the whiff of his cigar would lock a wheel or unlock a passenger  from him the young duke learned that his fellowinside was mr duncan macmorrogh senior a writer at edinburgh and of course the father of the first man of the day tom rawlins could not tell his grace as much about the principal writer in the screw and lever review as we can for tom was no patron of our periodical literature farther than a police report in the publicans journal young duncan macmorrogh was a limb of the law who had just brought himself into notice by a series of articles in the screw and lever in which he had subjected the universe piecemeal to his critical analysis duncan macmorrogh cut up the creation and got a name his attack upon mountains was most violent and proved by its personality that he had come from the lowlands he demonstrated the inutility of all elevation and declared that the andes were the aristocracy of the globe rivers he rather patronised but flowers he quite pulled to pieces and proved them to be the most useless of existences duncan macmorrogh informed us that we were quite wrong in supposing ourselves to be the miracle of creation on the contrary he avowed that already there were various pieces of machinery of far more importance than man and he had no doubt in time that a superior race would arise got by a steamengine on a spinningjenny  the other inside was the widow of a former curate of a northumbrian village some friend had obtained for her only child a clerkship in a public office and for some time this idol of her heart had gone on prospering but unfortunately of late charles burnet had got into a bad set was now involved in a terrible scrape and as tom rawlins feared must lose his situation and go to ruin  she was half distracted when she heard it first poor creature i have known her all my life sir many the kind word and glass of ale i have had at her house and thats what makes me feel for her you see i do what i can to make the journey easy to her for it is a pull at her years god bless her there is not a better body in this world that i will say for her when i was a boy i used to be the playfellow in a manner with charley burnet a gay lad sir as ever youd wish to see in a summers day and the devil among the girls always and thats been the ruin of him and as openahearted fellow as ever lived dme id walk to the lands end to save him if it were only for his mothers sake to say nothing of himself  and can nothing be done asked the duke  why you see he is back in £ s d and to make it up the poor body must sell her all and he wont let her do it and wrote a letter like a prince no room sir as fine a letter as ever you read hilloa there what are you asleepas ever you read on a summers day i didnt see it but my mother told me it was as good as eer a one of the old gentlemans sermons mother said he my sins be upon my own head i can bear disgrace how do mr wilkins but i cannot bear to see you a beggar  poor fellow  ay sir as goodahearted fellow as ever youd wish to meet  is he involved to a great extent think you  oh a long figure sir i say betty ive got a letter for you from your sweetheart a very long figure sir here take it i should be sorry dont blush no messagei should be sorry to take two hundred pounds to pay it no i wouldnt take two hundred pounds that i wouldnt i say jacob stop at old bag smiths  night came on and the duke resumed his inside place mr macmorrogh went to sleep over his sons article and the duke feigned slumber though he was only indulging in reverie he opened his eyes and a light which they passed revealed the countenance of the widow tears were stealing down her face  i have no mother i have no one to weep for me thought the duke and yet if i had been in this youths station my career probably would have been as fatal let me assist her alas how i have misused my power when even to do this slight deed i am obliged to hesitate and consider whether it be practicable  the coach again stopped for a quarter of an hour the duke had in consideration of the indefinite period of his visit supplied himself amply with money on repairing to dacre besides his purse which was well stored for the road he had somewhat more than three hundred pounds in his notebook he took advantage of their tarrying to inclose it and its contents in a sheet of paper with these lines  an unknown friend requests mrs burnet to accept this token of his sympathy with suffering virtue  determined to find some means to put this in her possession before their parting he resumed his place the scotchman now prepared for his nights repose he produced a pillow for his back a bag for his feet and a cap for his head these and a glass of brandyandwater in time produced a due effect and he was soon fast asleep even to the widow night brought some solace the duke alone found no repose unused to travelling in public conveyances at night and unprovided with any of the ingenious expedients of a mail coach adventurer he felt all the inconveniences of an inexperienced traveller the seat was unendurably hard his back ached his head whirled the confounded sherry slight as was his portion had made him feverish and he felt at once excited and exhausted he was sad too very depressed alone and no longer surrounded with that splendour which had hitherto made solitude precious life seemed stripped of all its ennobling spirit his energy vanished he repented his rashness and the impulse of the previous night which had gathered fresh power from the dewy moon vanished he felt alone and without a friend and night passed without a moments slumber watching the driving clouds  the last fifteen miles seemed longer than the whole journey at st albans he got out took a cup of coffee with tom rawlins and although the morning was raw again seated himself by his side in the first gloomy little suburb mrs burnet got out the duke sent rawlins after her with the parcel with peremptory instructions to leave it he watched the widow protesting it was not hers his faithful emissary appealing to the direction and with delight he observed it left in her hands they rattled into london stopped in lombard street reached holborn entered an archway the coachman threw the whip and reins from his now careless hands the duke bade farewell to tom rawlins and was shown to a bed     chapter viii       the duke makes a speech  the return of morning had in some degree dissipated the gloom that had settled on the young duke during the night sound and light made him feel less forlorn and for a moment his soul again responded to his high purpose but now he was to seek necessary repose in vain his heated frame and anxious mind were alike restless he turned he tossed in his bed but he could not banish from his ear the whirling sound of his late conveyance the snore of mr macmorrogh and the voice of tom rawlins he kept dwelling on every petty incident of his journey and repeating in his mind every petty saying his determination to slumber made him even less sleepy conscious that repose was absolutely necessary to the performance of his task and dreading that the boon was now unattainable he became each moment more feverish and more nervous a crowd of halfformed ideas and images flitted over his heated brain failure misery may dacre tom rawlins boiled beef mrs burnet the aristocracy mountains and the marine and the tower of st albans cathedral hurried along in infinite confusion but there is nothing like experience in a state of distraction he remembered the hopeless but refreshing sleep he had gained after his fatal adventure at brighton he jumped out of bed and threw himself on the floor and in a few minutes from the same cause his excited senses subsided into slumber  he awoke the sun was shining through his rough shutter it was noon he jumped up rang the bell and asked for a bath the chambermaid did not seem exactly to comprehend his meaning but said she would speak to the waiter he was the first gentleman who ever had asked for a bath at the dragon with two tails the waiter informed him that he might get a bath he believed at the hummums the duke dressed and to the hummums he then took his way as he was leaving the yard he was followed by an ostler who in a voice musically hoarse thus addressed him  have you seen missis sir  do you mean me no i have not seen your missis and the duke proceeded  sir sir said the ostler running after him i think you said you had not seen missis  you think right said the duke astonished and again he walked on  sir sir said the pursuing ostler i dont think you have got any luggage  oh i beg your pardon said the duke i see it i am in your debt but i meant to return  no doubt ont sir but when gemmen dont have no luggage they sees missis before they go sir  well what am i in your debt i can pay you here  five shillings sir  here said the duke and tell me when a coach leaves this place tomorrow for yorkshire  halfpast six oclock in the morning precisely said the ostler  well my good fellow i depend upon your securing me a place and that is for yourself added his grace throwing him a sovereign now mind i depend upon you  the man stared as if he had been suddenly taken into partnership with missis at length he found his tongue  your honour may depend upon me where would you like to sit in or out back to your horses or the front get you the box if you like wheres your great coat sir ill brush it for you  the bath and the breakfast brought our hero round a good deal and at halfpast two he stole to a solitary part of st jamess park to stretch his legs and collect his senses we must now let our readers into a secret which perhaps they have already unravelled the duke had hurried to london with the determination not only of attending the debate but of participating in it his grace was no politician but the question at issue was one simple in its nature and so domestic in its spirit that few men could have arrived at his period of life without having heard its merits both too often and too amply discussed he was master of all the points of interest and he had sufficient confidence in himself to believe that he could do them justice he walked up and down conning over in his mind not only the remarks which he intended to make but the very language in which he meant to offer them as he formed sentences almost for the first time his courage and his fancy alike warmed his sanguine spirit sympathised with the nobility of the imaginary scene and inspirited the intonations of his modulated voice  about four oclock he repaired to the house walking up one of the passages his progress was stopped by the back of an individual bowing with great civility to a patronising peer and mylording him with painful repetition the nobleman was lord fitzpompey the bowing gentleman mr duncan macmorrogh the antiaristocrat and father of the first man of the day  george is it possible exclaimed lord fitzpompey i will speak to you in the house said the duke passing on and bowing to mr duncan macmorrogh  he recalled his proxy from the duke of burlington and accounted for his presence to many astonished friends by being on his way to the continent and passing through london thought he might as well be present particularly as he was about to reside for some time in catholic countries it was the last compliment that he could pay his future host give me a pinch of snuff  the debate began dont be alarmed i shall not describe it five or six peers had spoken and one of the ministers had just sat down when the duke of st james rose he was extremely nervous but he repeated to himself the name of may dacre for the hundredth time and proceeded he was nearly commencing may dacre instead of my lords but he escaped this blunder for the first five or ten minutes he spoke in almost as cold and lifeless a style as when he echoed the kings speech but he was young and seldom troubled them and was listened to therefore with indulgence the duke warmed and a courteous hear hear frequently sounded the duke became totally free from embarrassment and spoke with eloquence and energy a cheer a stranger in the house of lords rewarded and encouraged him as an irish landlord his sincerity could not be disbelieved when he expressed his conviction of the safety of emancipation but it was as an english proprietor and british noble that it was evident that his grace felt most keenly upon this important measure he described with power the peculiar injustice of the situation of the english catholics he professed to feel keenly upon this subject because his native county had made him well acquainted with the temper of this class he painted in glowing terms the loyalty the wealth the influence the noble virtues of his catholic neighbours and he closed a speech of an hours duration in which he had shown that a worn subject was susceptible of novel treatment and novel interest amid loud and general cheers the lords gathered round him and many personally congratulated him upon his distinguished success the debate took its course at three oclock the procatholics found themselves in a minority but a minority in which the prescient might have well discovered the herald of future justice the speech of the duke of st james was the speech of the night  the duke walked into whites it was crowded the first man who welcomed him was annesley he congratulated the duke with a warmth for which the world did not give him credit  i assure you my dear st james that i am one of the few people whom this display has not surprised i have long observed that you were formed for something better than mere frivolity and between ourselves i am sick of it dont be surprised if you hear that i go to algiers depend upon it that i am on the point of doing something dreadful sup with me st james said lord squib i will ask oconnell to meet you  lord fitzpompey and lord darrell were profuse in congratulations but he broke away from them to welcome the man who now advanced he was one of whom he never thought without a shudder but whom for all that he greatly liked  my dear duke of st james said arundel dacre how ashamed i am that this is the first time i have personally thanked you for all your goodness  my dear dacre i have to thank you for proving for the first time to the world that i was not without discrimination  no no said dacre gaily and easily all the congratulations and all the compliments tonight shall be for you believe me my dear friend i share your triumph  they shook hands with earnestness  may will read your speech with exultation said arundel i think we must thank her for making you an orator  the duke faintly smiled and shook his head  and how are all our yorkshire friends continued arundel i am disappointed again in getting down to them but i hope in the course of the month to pay them a visit  i shall see them in a day or two said the duke i pay mr dacre one more visit before my departure form england  are you then indeed going asked arundel in a kind voice  for ever  nay nay ever is a strong word  it becomes then my feelings however we will not talk of this can i bear any letter for you  i have just written replied arundel in a gloomy voice and with a changing countenance and therefore will not trouble you and yet  what  and yet the letter is an important letter to me the post to be sure never does miss but if it were not troubling your grace too much i almost would ask you to be its bearer  it will be there as soon said the duke for i shall be off in an hour  i will take it out of the box then said arundel and he fetched it here is the letter said he on his return pardon me if i impress upon you its importance excuse this emotion but indeed this letter decides my fate my happiness for life is dependent on its reception  he spoke with an air and voice of agitation  the duke received the letter in a manner scarcely less disturbed and with a hope that they might meet before his departure faintly murmured by one party and scarcely responded to by the other they parted  well now said the duke the farce is complete and i have come to london to be the bearer of his offered heart i like this now is there a more contemptible a more ludicrous absolutely ludicrous ass than myself fear not for its delivery most religiously shall it be consigned to the hand of its owner the fellow has paid a compliment to my honour or my simplicity i fear the last and really i feel rather proud but away with these feelings have i not seen her in his arms pah thank god i spoke at least i die in a blaze even annesley does not think me quite a fool o may dacre may dacre if you were but mine i should be the happiest fellow that ever breathed  he breakfasted and then took his way to the dragon with two tails the morning was bright and fresh and beautiful even in london joy came upon his heart in spite of all his loneliness and he was glad and sanguine he arrived just in time the coach was about to start the faithful ostler was there with his greatcoat and the duke found that he had three fellowpassengers they were lawyers and talked for the first two hours of nothing but the case respecting which they were going down into the country at woburn a despatch arrived with the newspapers all purchased one and the duke among the rest he was well reported and could now sympathise with instead of smile at the anxiety of lord darrell  the young duke of st james seems to have distinguished himself very much said the first lawyer  so i observe said the second one the leading article calls our attention to his speech as the most brilliant delivered  i am surprised said the third i thought he was quite a different sort of person  by no means said the first i have always had a high opinion of him i am not one of those who think the worse of a young man because he is a little wild  nor i said the second young blood you know is young blood  a very intimate friend of mine who knows the duke of st james well once told me rejoined the first that i was quite mistaken about him that he was a person of no common talents well read quite a man of the world and a good deal of wit too and let me tell you that in these days wit is no common thing  certainly not said the third we have no wit now  and a kindhearted generous fellow continued the first and very unaffected  i cant bear an affected man said the second without looking off his paper he seems to have made a very fine speech indeed  i should not wonder at his turning out something great said the third  i have no doubt of it said the second  many of these wild fellows do  he is not so wild as we think said the first  but he is done up said the second  is he indeed said the third perhaps by making a speech he wants a place  people dont make speeches for nothing said the third  i shouldnt wonder if he is after a place in the household said the second  depend upon it he looks to something more active said the first  perhaps he would like to be head of the admiralty said the second  or the treasury said the third  that is impossible said the first he is too young  he is as old as pitt said the third  i hope he will resemble him in nothing but his age then said the first  i look upon pitt as the first man that ever lived said the third  what said the first the man who worked up the national debt to nearly eight hundred millions  what of that said the third i look upon the national debt as the source of all our prosperity  the source of all our taxes you mean  what is the harm of taxes  the harm is that you will soon have no trade and when you have no trade you will have no duties and when you have no duties you will have no dividends and when you have no dividends you will have no law and then where is your source of prosperity said the first  but here the coach stopped and the duke got out for an hour  by midnight they had reached a town not more than thirty miles from dacre the duke was quite exhausted and determined to stop in half an hour he enjoyed that deep dreamless slumber with which no luxury can compete one must have passed restless nights for years to be able to appreciate the value of sound sleep     chapter ix       a last appeal  he rose early and managed to reach dacre at the breakfast hour of the family he discharged his chaise at the park gate and entered the house unseen he took his way along a corridor lined with plants which led to the small and favourite room in which the morning meetings of may and himself always took place when they were alone as he lightly stepped along he heard a voice that he could not mistake as it were in animated converse agitated by sounds which ever created in him emotion for a moment he paused he starts his eye sparkles with strange delight a flush comes over his panting features half of modesty half of triumph he listens to his own speech from the lips of the woman he loves she is reading to her father with melodious energy the passage in which he describes the high qualities of his catholic neighbours the intonations of the voice indicate the deep sympathy of the reader she ceases he hears the admiring exclamation of his host he rallies his strength he advances he stands before them she utters almost a shriek of delightful surprise as she welcomes him  how much there was to say how much to ask how much to answer even mr dacre poured forth questions like a boy but may she could not speak but leant forward in her chair with an eager ear and a look of congratulation that rewarded him for all his exertion everything was to be told how he went whether he slept in the mail where he went what he did whom he saw what they said what they thought all must be answered then fresh exclamations of wonder delight and triumph the duke forgot everything but his love and for three hours felt the happiest of men  at length mr dacre rose and looked at his watch with a shaking head i have a most important appointment said he and i must gallop to keep it god bless you my dear st james i could stay talking with you for ever but you must be utterly wearied now my dear boy go to bed  to bed exclaimed the duke why tom rawlins would laugh at you  and who is tom rawlins  ah i cannot tell you everything but assuredly i am not going to bed  well may i leave him to your care but do not let him talk any more  oh sir said the duke i really had forgotten i am the bearer to you sir of a letter from mr arundel dacre he gave it him  as mr dacre read the communication his countenance changed and the smile which before was on his face vanished but whether he were displeased or only serious it was impossible to ascertain although the duke watched him narrowly at length he said may here is a letter from arundel in which you are much interested  give it me then papa  no my love we must speak of this together but i am pressed for time when i come home remember he quitted the room  they were alone the duke began again talking and miss dacre put her finger to her mouth with a smile  i assure you said he i am not wearied i slept aty and the only thing i now want is a good walk let me be your companion this morning  i was thinking of paying nurse a visit what say you  oh i am ready anywhere  she ran for her bonnet and he kissed her handkerchief which she left behind and i believe everything else in the room which bore the slightest relation to her and then the recollection of arundels letter came over him and his joy fled when she returned he was standing before the fire gloomy and dull  i fear you are tired she said  not in the least  i shall never forgive myself if all this exertion make you ill  why not  because although i will not tell papa i am sure my nonsense is the cause of your having gone to london  it is probable for you are the cause of all that does not disgrace me he advanced and was about to seize her hand but the accursed miniature occurred to him and he repressed his feelings almost with a groan she too had turned away her head and was busily engaged in tending a flower  because she has explicitly declared her feelings to me and sincere in that declaration honours me by a friendship of which alone i am unworthy am i to persecute her with my dishonoured overturesthe twice rejected no no  they took their way through the park and he soon succeeded in reassuming the tone that befitted their situation traits of the debate and the debaters which newspapers cannot convey and which he had not yet recounted anecdotes of annesley and their friends and other gossip were offered for her amusement but if she were amused she was not lively but singularly unusually silent there was only one point on which she seemed interested and that was his speech when he was cheered and who particularly cheered who gathered round him and what they said after the debate on all these points she was most inquisitive  they rambled on nurse was quite forgotten and at length they found themselves in the beautiful valley rendered more lovely by the ruins of the abbey it was a place that the duke could never forget and which he ever avoided he had never renewed his visit since he first gave vent among its reverend ruins to his overcharged and most tumultuous heart  they stood in silence before the holy pile with its vaulting arches and crumbling walls mellowed by the mild lustre of the declining sun not two years had fled since here he first staggered after the breaking glimpses of selfknowledge and struggled to call order from out the chaos of his mind not two years and yet what a change had come over his existence how diametrically opposite now were all his thoughts and views and feelings to those which then controlled his fatal soul how capable as he firmly believed was he now of discharging his duty to his creator and his fellowmen and yet the boon that ought to have been the reward for all this selfcontest the sweet seal that ought to have ratified this new contract of existence was wanting  ah he exclaimed aloud and in a voice of anguish ah if i neer had left the walls of dacre how different might have been my lot  a gentle but involuntary pressure reminded him of the companion whom for once in his life he had for a moment forgotten  i feel it is madness i feel it is worse than madness but must i yield without a struggle and see my dark fate cover me without an effort oh yes here even here where i have wept over your contempt even here although i subject myself to renewed rejection letlet me tell you before we part how i adore you  she was silent a strange courage came over his spirit and with a reckless boldness and rapid voice a misty sight and total unconsciousness of all other existence he resumed the words which had broken out as if by inspiration  i am not worthy of you who is i was worthless i did not know it have not i struggled to be pure have not i sighed on my nightly pillow for your blessing oh could you read my heart and sometimes i think you can read it for indeed with all its faults it is without guile i dare to hope that you would pity me since we first met your image has not quitted my conscience for a second when you thought me least worthy when you thought me vile or mad oh by all that is sacred i was the most miserable wretch that ever breathed and flew to dissipation only for distraction  notnot for a moment have i ceased to think you the best the most beautiful the most enchanting and endearing creature that ever graced our earth even when i first dared to whisper my insolent affection believe me even then your presence controlled my spirit as no other woman had i bent to you then in pride and power the station that i could then offer you was not utterly unworthy of your perfection i am now a beggar or worse an insolvent noble and dare idare i to ask you to share the fortunes that are broken and the existence that is obscure  she turned her arm fell over his shoulder she buried her head in his breast     chapter x      love is like a dizziness  mr dacre returned home with an excellent appetite and almost as keen a desire to renew his conversation with his guest but dinner and the duke were neither to be commanded miss dacre also could not be found no information could be obtained of them from any quarter it was nearly seven oclock the hour of dinner that meal somewhat to mr dacres regret was postponed for half an hour servants were sent out and the bell was rung but no tidings mr dacre was a little annoyed and more alarmed he was also hungry and at halfpast seven he sat down to a solitary meal  about a quarterpast eight a figure rapped at the diningroom window it was the young duke the fat butler seemed astonished not to say shocked at this violation of etiquette nevertheless he slowly opened the window  anything the matter george where is may  nothing we lost our way that is all maymiss dacre desired me to say that she would not join us at dinner  i am sure something has happened  i assure you my dear sir nothing nothing at all the least unpleasant but we took the wrong turning all my fault  shall i send for the soup  no i am not hungry i will take some wine so saying his grace poured out a tumbler of claret  shall i take your graces hat asked the fat butler  dear me have i my hat on  this was not the only evidence afforded by our heros conduct that his presence of mind had slightly deserted him he was soon buried in a deep reverie and sat with a full plate but idle knife and fork before him a perfect puzzle to the fat butler who had hitherto considered his grace the very pink of propriety  george you have eaten no dinner said mr dacre  thank you a very good one indeed a remarkably good dinner give me some red wine if you please  at length they were left alone  i have some good news for you george  indeed  i think i have let rosemount  so  and exactly to the kind of person that you wanted a man who will take a pride although merely a tenant in not permitting his poor neighbours to feel the want of a landlord you will never guess lord mildmay  what did you say of lord mildmay sir  my dear fellow your wits are woolgathering i say i think i have let rosemount  oh i have changed my mind about letting rosemount  my dear duke there is no trouble which i will grudge to further your interests but really i must beg in future that you will at least apprise me when you change your mind there is nothing as we have both agreed more desirable than to find an eligible tenant for rosemount you never can expect to have a more beneficial one than lord mildmay and really unless you have positively promised the place to another person which excuse me for saying you were not authorised to do i must insist after what has passed upon his having the preference  my dear sir i only changed my mind this afternoon i couldnt tell you before i have promised it to no one but i think of living there myself  yourself oh if that be the case i shall be quite reconciled to the disappointment of lord mildmay but what in the name of goodness my dear fellow has produced this wonderful revolution in all your plans in the course of a few hours i thought you were going to mope away life on the lake of geneva or dawdle it away in florence or rome  it is very odd sir i can hardly believe it myself and yet it must be true i hear her voice even at this moment oh my dear mr dacre i am the happiest fellow that ever breathed  what is all this  is it possible my dear sir that you have not long before detected the feelings i ventured to entertain for your daughter in a word she requires only your sanction to my being the most fortunate of men  my dear friend my dear dear boy cried mr dacre rising from his chair and embracing him it is out of the power of man to impart to me any event which could afford me such exquisite pleasure indeed indeed it is to me most surprising for i had been induced to suspect george that some explanation had passed between you and may which while it accounted for your mutual esteem gave little hope of a stronger sentiment  i believe sir said the young duke with a smile i was obstinate  well this changes all our plans i have intended for this fortnight past to speak to you finally on your affairs no better time than the present and in the first place  but really this interview is confidential     chapter xi       perfection in a petticoat  they come not it is late he is already telling all she relapses into her sweet reverie her thought fixes on no subject her mind is intent on no idea her soul is melted into dreamy delight her only consciousness is perfect bliss sweet sounds still echo in her ear and still her pure pulse beats from the first embrace of passion  the door opens and her father enters leaning upon the arm of her beloved yes he has told all mr dacre approached and bending down pressed the lips of his child it was the seal to their plighted faith and told without speech that the blessing of a parent mingled with the vows of a lover no other intimation was at present necessary but she the daughter thought now only of her father that friend of her long life whose love had neer been wanting was she about to leave him she arose she threw her arms around his neck and wept  the young duke walked away that his presence might not control the full expression of her hallowed soul this jewel is mine was his thought what what have i done to be so blessed  in a few minutes he again joined them and was seated by her side and mr dacre considerately remembered that he wished to see his steward and they were left alone their eyes meet and their soft looks tell that they were thinking of each other his arm steals round the back of her chair and with his other hand he gently captures hers  first love first love how many a glowing bard has sung thy beauties how many a poor devil of a prosing novelist like myself has echoed all our superiors the poets teach us no doubt thou rosy god of young desire thou art a most bewitching little demon and yet for my part give me last love  ask a man which turned out best the first horse he bought or the one he now canters on askbut in short there is nothing in which knowledge is more important and experience more valuable than in love when we first love we are enamoured of our own imaginations our thoughts are high our feelings rise from out the deepest caves of the tumultuous tide of our full life we look around for one to share our exquisite existence and sanctify the beauties of our being  but those beauties are only in our thoughts we feel like heroes when we are but boys yet our mistress must bear a relation not to ourselves but to our imagination she must be a real heroine while our perfection is but ideal and the quick and dangerous fancy of our race will at first rise to the pitch she is all we can conceive mild and pure as youthful priests we bow down before our altar but the idol to which we breathe our warm and gushing vows and bend our eager knees all its power does it not exist only in our idea all its beauty is it not the creation of our excited fancy and then the sweetest of superstitions ends the long delusion bursts and we are left like men upon a heath when fairies vanish cold and dreary gloomy bitter harsh existence seems a blunder  but just when we are most miserable and curse the poets cunning and our own conceits there lights upon our path just like a ray fresh from the sun some sparkling child of light that makes us think we are premature at least in our resolves yet we are determined not to be taken in and try her well in all the points in which the others failed one by one her charms steal on our warming soul as one by one those of the other beauty sadly stole away and then we bless our stars and feel quite sure that we have found perfection in a petticoat  but our dukewhere are we he had read woman thoroughly and consequently knew how to value the virgin pages on which his thoughts now fixed he and may dacre wandered in the woods and nature seemed to them more beautiful from their beautiful loves they gazed upon the sky a brighter light fell oer the luminous earth sweeter to them the fragrance of the sweetest flowers and a more balmy breath brought on the universal promise of the opening year  they wandered in the woods and there they breathed their mutual adoration she to him was all in all and he to her was like a new divinity she poured forth all that she long had felt and scarcely could suppress from the moment he tore her from the insulters arms his image fixed in her heart and the struggle which she experienced to repel his renewed vows was great indeed when she heard of his misfortunes she had wept but it was the strange delight she experienced when his letter arrived to her father that first convinced her how irrevocably her mind was his  and now she does not cease to blame herself for all her past obduracy now she will not for a moment yield that he could have been ever anything but all that was pure and beautiful and good     chapter xii       another betrothal  but although we are in love business must not be utterly neglected and mr dacre insisted that the young duke should for one morning cease to wander in his park and listen to the result of his exertions during the last three months his grace listened rents had not risen but it was hoped that they had seen their worst the railroad had been successfully opposed and coals had improved the london mansion and the alhambra had both been disposed of and well the first to the new french ambassador and the second to a greyheaded stockjobber very rich who having no society determined to make solitude amusing the proceeds of these sales together with sundry sums obtained by converting into cash the stud the furniture and the bijouterie produced a most respectable fund which nearly paid off the annoying miscellaneous debts for the rest mr dacre while he agreed that it was on the whole advisable that the buildings should be completed determined that none of the estates should be sold or even mortgaged his plan was to procrastinate the termination of these undertakings and to allow each year itself to afford the necessary supplies by annually setting aside one hundred thousand pounds in seven or eight years he hoped to find everything completed and all debts cleared he did not think that the extravagance of the duke could justify any diminution in the sum which had hitherto been apportioned for the maintenance of the irish establishments but he was of opinion that the decreased portion which they as well as the western estates now afforded to the total income was a sufficient reason fourteen thousand ayear were consequently allotted to ireland and seven to pen bronnock there remained to the duke about thirty thousand per annum but then hauteville was to be kept up with this mr dacre proposed that the young people should reside at rosemount and that consequently they might form their establishment from the castle without reducing their yorkshire appointments and avail themselves without any obligation or even the opportunity of great expenses of all the advantages afforded by the necessary expenditure finally mr dacre presented his son with his town mansion and furniture and as the young duke insisted that the settlements upon her grace should be prepared in full reference to his inherited and future income this generous father at once made over to him the great bulk of his personal property amounting to upwards of a hundred thousand pounds a little ready money of which he knew the value  the duke of st james had duly informed his uncle the earl of fitzpompey of the intended change in his condition and in answer received the following letter   fitzpompey hall may 18  my dear georgeyour letter did not give us so much surprise as you expected but i assure you it gave us as much pleasure you have shown your wisdom and your taste in your choice and i am free to confess that i am acquainted with no one more worthy of the station which the duchess of st james must always fill in society and more calculated to maintain the dignity of your family than the lady whom you are about to introduce to us as our niece believe me my dear george that the notification of this agreeable event has occasioned even additional gratification both to your aunt and to myself from the reflection that you are about to ally yourself with a family in whose welfare we must ever take an especial interest and whom we may in a manner look upon as our own relatives for my dear george in answer to your flattering and most pleasing communication it is my truly agreeable duty to inform you and believe me you are the first person out of our immediate family to whom this intelligence is made known that our caroline in whose happiness we are well assured you take a lively interest is about to be united to one who may now be described as your near relative namely mr arundel dacre  it has been a long attachment though for a considerable time i confess unknown to us and indeed at first sight with carolines rank and other advantages it may not appear in a mere worldly point of view so desirable a connection as some perhaps might expect and to be quite confidential both your aunt and myself were at first a little disinclined great as our esteem and regard have ever been for him a little disinclined i say to the union but dacre is certainly the most rising man of the day in point of family he is second to none and his uncle has indeed behaved in the most truly liberal manner i assure you he considers him as a son and even if there were no other inducement the mere fact of your connection with the family would alone not only reconcile but so to say make us perfectly satisfied with the arrangement it is unnecessary to speak to you of the antiquity of the dacres arundel will ultimately be one of the richest commoners and i think it is not too bold to anticipate taking into consideration the family into which he marries and above all his connection with you that we may finally succeed in having him called up to us you are of course aware that there was once a barony in the family  everybody talks of your speech i assure you although i ever gave you credit for uncommon talents i was astonished so you are to have the vacant ribbon why did you not tell me i learnt it today from lord bobbleshim but we must not quarrel with men in love for not communicating  you ask me for news of all your old friends you of course saw the death of old annesley the new lord took his seat yesterday he was introduced by lord bloomerly i was not surprised to hear in the evening that he was about to be married to lady charlotte though the world affect to be astonished  i should not forget to say that lord annesley asked most particularly after you for him quite warm i assure you  the oddest thing has happened to your friend lord squib old colonel carlisle is dead and has left his whole fortune some say half a million to the oddest person merely because she had the reputation of being his daughter quite an odd person you understand me mrs montfort st maurice says you know her but we must not talk of these things now well squib is going to be married to her he says that he knows all his old friends will cut him when they are married and so he is determined to give them an excuse i understand she is a fine woman he talks of living at rome and florence for a year or two  lord darrell is about to marry harriet wrekin and between ourselves but dont let this go any further at present i have very little doubt that young pococurante will shortly be united to isabel connected as we are with the shropshires these excellent alliances are gratifying  i see very little of lucius grafton he seems ill  i understand for certain that her ladyship opposes the divorce on dit she has got hold of some letters through the treachery of her soubrette whom he supposed quite his creature and that your friend is rather taken in but i should not think this true people talk very loosely there was a gay party at mrs dallingtons the other night who asked very kindly after you  i think i have now written you a very long letter i once more congratulate you on your admirable selection and with the united remembrance of our circle particularly caroline who will write perhaps by this post to miss dacre believe me dear george your truly affectionate uncle  fitzpompey  pslord marylebone is very unpopular quite a brute we all miss you   it is not to be supposed that this letter conveyed the first intimation to the duke of st james of the most interesting event of which it spoke on the contrary he had long been aware of the whole affair but we have been too much engaged with his own conduct to find time to let the reader into the secret which like all secrets it is to be hoped was no secret next to gaining the affections of may dacre it was impossible for any event to occur more delightful to our hero than the present his heart had often misgiven him when he had thought of caroline now she was happy and not only happy but connected with him for life just as he wished arundel dacre too of all men he most wished to like and indeed most liked one feeling alone had prevented them from being bosom friends and that feeling had long triumphantly vanished  may had been almost from the beginning the confidante of her cousin in vain however had she beseeched him to entrust all to her father although he now repented his past feelings he could not be induced to change and not till he had entered parliament and succeeded and gained a name which would reflect honour on the family with which he wished to identify himself would he impart to his uncle the secret of his heart and gain that support without which his great object could never have been achieved the duke of st james by returning him to parliament had been the unconscious cause of all his happiness and ardently did he pray that his generous friend might succeed in what he was well aware was his secret aspiration and that his beloved cousin might yield her hand to the only man whom arundel dacre considered worthy of her     chapter xiii       joys beginning  another week brought another letter from the earl of fitzpompey  the earl of fitzpompey to the duke of st james read this alone  my dear george  i beg you will not be alarmed by the above memorandum which i thought it but prudent to prefix a very disagreeable affair has just taken place and to a degree exceedingly alarming but it might have turned out much more distressing and on the whole we may all congratulate ourselves at the result not to keep you in fearful suspense i beg to recall your recollection to the rumour which i noticed in my last of the intention of lady aphrodite grafton to oppose the divorce a few days back her brother lord wariston with whom i was previously unacquainted called upon me by appointment having previously requested a private interview the object of his seeing me was no less than to submit to my inspection the letters by aid of which it was anticipated that the divorce might be successfully opposed you will be astounded to hear that these consist of a long series of correspondence of mrs dallington veres developing i am shocked to say machinations of a very alarming nature the effect of which my dear george was no less than very materially to control your fortunes in life and those of that charming and truly admirable lady whom you have delighted us all so much by declaring to be our future relative  from the very delicate nature of the disclosures lord wariston felt the great importance of obtaining all necessary results without making them public and actuated by these feelings he applied to me both as your nearest relative and an acquaintance of sir lucius and as he expressed it and i may be permitted to repeat as one whose experience in the management of difficult and delicate negotiations was not altogether unknown in order that i might be put in possession of the facts of the case advise and perhaps interfere for the common good  under these circumstances and taking into consideration the extreme difficulty attendant upon a satisfactory arrangement of the affair i thought fit in confidence to apply to arundel whose talents i consider of the first order and only equalled by his prudence and calm temper as a relation too of more than one of the parties concerned it was perhaps only proper that the correspondence should be submitted to him  i am sorry to say my dear george that arundel behaved in a very odd manner and not at all with that discretion which might have been expected both from one of his remarkably sober and staid disposition and one not a little experienced in diplomatic life he exhibited the most unequivocal signs of his displeasure at the conduct of the parties principally concerned and expressed himself in so vindictive a manner against one of them that i very much regretted my application and requested him to be cool  he seemed to yield to my solicitations but i regret to say his composure was only feigned and the next morning he and sir lucius grafton met sir lucius fired first without effect but arundels aim was more fatal and his ball was lodged in the thigh of his adversary sir lucius has only been saved by amputation and i need not remark to you that to such a man life on such conditions is scarcely desirable all idea of a divorce is quite given over the letters in question were stolen from his cabinet by his valet and given to a soubrette of his wife whom sir lucius considered in his interest but who as you see betrayed him  for me remained the not very agreeable office of seeing mrs dallington vere i made known to her in a manner as little offensive as possible the object of my visit the scene my dear george was trying and i think it hard that the follies of a parcel of young people should really place me in such a distressing position she fainted c and wished the letters to be given up but lord wariston would not consent to this though he promised to keep their contents secret provided she quitted the country she goes directly and i am well assured which is not the least surprising part of this strange history that her affairs are in a state of great distraction the relatives of her late husband are about again to try the will and with prospect of success she has been negotiating with them for some time through the agency of sir lucius grafton and the late exposé will not favour her interests  if anything further happens my dear george depend upon my writing but arundel desires me to say that on saturday he will run down to dacre for a few days as he very much wishes to see you and all with our united remembrance to mr and miss dacre  ever my dear george  your very affectionate uncle  fitzpompey   the young duke turned with trembling and disgust from these dark terminations of unprincipled careers and these fatal evidences of the indulgence of unbridled passions how nearly too had he been shipwrecked in this moral whirlpool with what gratitude did he not invoke the beneficent providence that had not permitted the innate seeds of human virtue to be blighted in his wild and neglected soul with what admiration did he not gaze upon the pure and beautiful being whose virtue and whose loveliness were the causes of his regeneration the sources of his present happiness and the guarantees of his future joy  four years have now elapsed since the young duke of st james was united to may dacre and it would not be too bold to declare that during that period he has never for an instant ceased to consider himself the happiest and the most fortunate of men his life is passed in the agreeable discharge of all the important duties of his exalted station and his present career is by far a better answer to the lucubrations of young duncan macmorrogh than all the abstract arguments that ever yet were offered in favour of the existence of an aristocracy  hauteville house and hauteville castle proceed in regular course these magnificent dwellings will never erase simple and delightful rosemount from the grateful memory of the duchess of st james parliament and in a degree society invite the duke and duchess each year to the metropolis and mr dacre is generally their guest their most intimate and beloved friends are arundel and his wife and as lady caroline now heads the establishment of castle dacre they are seldom separated but among their most agreeable company is a young gentleman styled by courtesy dacre marquess of hauteville and his young sister who has not yet escaped from her beautiful mothers arms and who beareth the blooming title of the lady may
