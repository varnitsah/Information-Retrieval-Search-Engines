of the strange bird many people at sidderton and some nearer saw a glare on the sidderford moor but no one in sidderford saw it for most of sidderford was abed  all day the wind had been rising so that the larks on the moor chirruped fitfully near the ground or rose only to be driven like leaves before the wind the sun set in a bloody welter of clouds and the moon was hidden the glare they say was golden like a beam shining out of the sky not a uniform blaze but broken all over by curving flashes like the waving of swords it lasted but a moment and left the night dark and obscure there were letters about it in nature and a rough drawing that no one thought very like you may see it for yourselfthe drawing that was unlike the glareon page 42 of vol cclx of that publication  none in sidderford saw the light but annie hooker durgans wife was lying awake and she saw the reflection of ita flickering tongue of golddancing on the wall  she too was one of those who heard the sound the others who heard the sound were lumpy durgan the halfwit and amorys mother they said it was a sound like children singing and a throbbing of harp strings carried on a rush of notes like that which sometimes comes from an organ it began and ended like the opening and shutting of a door and before and after they heard nothing but the night wind howling over the moor and the noise of the caves under sidderford cliff amorys mother said she wanted to cry when she heard it but lumpy was only sorry he could hear no more  that is as much as anyone can tell you of the glare upon sidderford moor and the alleged music therewith and whether these had any real connexion with the strange bird whose history follows is more than i can say but i set it down here for reasons that will be more apparent as the story proceeds     the coming of the strange bird  ii   sandy bright was coming down the road from spinners carrying a side of bacon he had taken in exchange for a clock he saw nothing of the light but he heard and saw the strange bird he suddenly heard a flapping and a voice like a woman wailing and being a nervous man and all alone he was alarmed forthwith and turning all atremble saw something large and black against the dim darkness of the cedars up the hill it seemed to be coming right down upon him and incontinently he dropped his bacon and set off running only to fall headlong  he tried in vainsuch was his state of mindto remember the beginning of the lords prayer the strange bird flapped over him something larger than himself with a vast spread of wings and as he thought black he screamed and gave himself up for lost then it went past him sailing down the hill and soaring over the vicarage vanished into the hazy valley towards sidderford  and sandy bright lay upon his stomach there for ever so long staring into the darkness after the strange bird at last he got upon his knees and began to thank heaven for his merciful deliverance with his eyes downhill he went on down into the village talking aloud and confessing his sins as he went lest the strange bird should come back all who heard him thought him drunk but from that night he was a changed man and had done with drunkenness and defrauding the revenue by selling silver ornaments without a licence and the side of bacon lay upon the hillside until the tallyman from portburdock found it in the morning  the next who saw the strange bird was a solicitors clerk at iping hanger who was climbing the hill before breakfast to see the sunrise save for a few dissolving wisps of cloud the sky had been blown clear in the night at first he thought it was an eagle he saw it was near the zenith and incredibly remote a mere bright speck above the pink cirri and it seemed as if it fluttered and beat itself against the sky as an imprisoned swallow might do against a window pane then down it came into the shadow of the earth sweeping in a great curve towards portburdock and round over the hanger and so vanishing behind the woods of siddermorton park it seemed larger than a man just before it was hidden the light of the rising sun smote over the edge of the downs and touched its wings and they flashed with the brightness of flames and the colour of precious stones and so passed leaving the witness agape  a ploughman going to his work along under the stone wall of siddermorton park saw the strange bird flash over him for a moment and vanish among the hazy interstices of the beech trees but he saw little of the colour of the wings witnessing only that its legs which were long seemed pink and bare like naked flesh and its body mottled white it smote like an arrow through the air and was gone  these were the first three eyewitnesses of the strange bird  now in these days one does not cower before the devil and ones own sinfulness or see strange iridiscent wings in the light of dawn and say nothing of it afterwards the young solicitors clerk told his mother and sisters at breakfast and afterwards on his way to the office at portburdock spoke of it to the blacksmith of hammerpond and spent the morning with his fellow clerks marvelling instead of copying deeds and sandy bright went to talk the matter over with mr jekyll the primitive minister and the ploughman told old hugh and afterwards the vicar of siddermorton  they are not an imaginative race about here said the vicar of siddermorton i wonder how much of that was true barring that he thinks the wings were brown it sounds uncommonly like a flamingo     the hunting of the strange bird  iii   the vicar of siddermorton which is nine miles inland from siddermouth as the crow flies was an ornithologist some such pursuit botany antiquity folklore is almost inevitable for a single man in his position he was given to geometry also propounding occasionally impossible problems in the educational times but ornithology was his forte he had already added two visitors to the list of occasional british birds his name was wellknown in the columns of the zoologist i am afraid it may be forgotten by now for the world moves apace and on the day after the coming of the strange bird came first one and then another to confirm the ploughmans story and tell him not that it had any connection of the glare upon sidderford moor  now the vicar of siddermorton had two rivals in his scientific pursuits gully of sidderton who had actually seen the glare and who it was sent the drawing to nature and borland the natural history dealer who kept the marine laboratory at portburdock borland the vicar thought should have stuck to his copepods but instead he kept a taxidermist and took advantage of his littoral position to pick up rare sea birds it was evident to anyone who knew anything of collecting that both these men would be scouring the country after the strange visitant before twentyfour hours were out  the vicars eye rested on the back of saunders british birds for he was in his study at the time already in two places there was entered the only known british specimen was secured by the rev k hilyer vicar of siddermorton a third such entry he doubted if any other collector had that  he looked at his watchtwo he had just lunched and usually he rested in the afternoon he knew it would make him feel very disagreeable if he went out into the hot sunshineboth on the top of his head and generally yet gully perhaps was out prowling observant suppose it was something very good and gully got it  his gun stood in the corner the thing had iridiscent wings and pink legs the chromatic conflict was certainly exceedingly stimulating he took his gun  he would have gone out by the glass doors and verandah and down the garden into the hill road in order to avoid his housekeepers eye he knew his gun expeditions were not approved of but advancing towards him up the garden he saw the curates wife and her two daughters carrying tennis rackets his curates wife was a young woman of immense will who used to play tennis on his lawn and cut his roses differ from him on doctrinal points and criticise his personal behaviour all over the parish he went in abject fear of her was always trying to propitiate her but so far he had clung to his ornithology  however he went out by the front door     iv   if it were not for collectors england would be full so to speak of rare birds and wonderful butterflies strange flowers and a thousand interesting things but happily the collector prevents all that either killing with his own hands or by buying extravagantly procuring people of the lower classes to kill such eccentricities as appear it makes work for people even though acts of parliament interfere in this way for instance he is killing off the chough in cornwall the bath white butterfly the queen of spain fritillary and can plume himself upon the extermination of the great auk and a hundred other rare birds and plants and insects all that is the work of the collector and his glory alone in the name of science and this is right and as it should be eccentricity in fact is immoralitythink over it again if you do not think so nowjust as eccentricity in ones way of thinking is madness i defy you to find another definition that will fit all the cases of either and if a species is rare it follows that it is not fitted to survive the collector is after all merely like the foot soldier in the days of heavy armourhe leaves the combatants alone and cuts the throats of those who are overthrown so one may go through england from end to end in the summer time and see only eight or ten commonplace wild flowers and the commoner butterflies and a dozen or so common birds and never be offended by any breach of the monotony any splash of strange blossom or flutter of unknown wing all the rest have been collected years ago for which cause we should all love collectors and bear in mind what we owe them when their little collections are displayed these camphorated little drawers of theirs their glass cases and blottingpaper books are the graves of the rare and the beautiful the symbols of the triumph of leisure morally spent over the delights of life all of which as you very properly remark has nothing whatever to do with the strange bird     v   there is a place on the moor where the black water shines among the succulent moss and the hairy sundew eater of careless insects spreads its redstained hungry hands to the god who gives his creaturesone to feed another on a ridge thereby grow birches with a silvery bark and the soft green of the larch mingles with the dark green fir thither through the honey humming heather came the vicar in the heat of the day carrying a gun under his arm a gun loaded with swanshot for the strange bird and over his disengaged hand he carried a pocket handkerchief wherewith ever and again he wiped his beady face  he went by and on past the big pond and the pool full of brown leaves where the sidder arises and so by the road which is at first sandy and then chalky to the little gate that goes into the park there are seven steps up to the gate and on the further side six down againlest the deer escapeso that when the vicar stood in the gateway his head was ten feet or more above the ground and looking where a tumult of bracken fronds filled the hollow between two groups of beech his eye caught something particoloured that wavered and went suddenly his face gleamed and his muscles grew tense he ducked his head clutched his gun with both hands and stood still then watching keenly he came on down the steps into the park and still holding his gun in both hands crept rather than walked towards the jungle of bracken  nothing stirred and he almost feared that his eyes had played him false until he reached the ferns and had gone rustling breast high into them then suddenly rose something full of wavering colours twenty yards or less in front of his face and beating the air in another moment it had fluttered above the bracken and spread its pinions wide he saw what it was his heart was in his mouth and he fired out of pure surprise and habit  there was a scream of superhuman agony the wings beat the air twice and the victim came slanting swiftly downward and struck the grounda struggling heap of writhing body broken wing and flying bloodstained plumesupon the turfy slope behind  the vicar stood aghast with his smoking gun in his hand it was no bird at all but a youth with an extremely beautiful face clad in a robe of saffron and with iridescent wings across whose pinions great waves of colour flushes of purple and crimson golden green and intense blue pursued one another as he writhed in his agony never had the vicar seen such gorgeous floods of colour not stained glass windows not the wings of butterflies not even the glories of crystals seen between prisms no colours on earth could compare with them twice the angel raised himself only to fall over sideways again then the beating of the wings diminished the terrified face grew pale the floods of colour abated and suddenly with a sob he lay prone and the changing hues of the broken wings faded swiftly into one uniform dull grey hue  oh what has happened to me cried the angel for such it was shuddering violently hands outstretched and clutching the ground and then lying still  dear me said the vicar i had no idea he came forward cautiously excuse me he said i am afraid i have shot you  it was the obvious remark  the angel seemed to become aware of his presence for the first time he raised himself by one hand his brown eyes stared into the vicars then with a gasp and biting his nether lip he struggled into a sitting position and surveyed the vicar from top to toe  a man said the angel clasping his forehead a man in the maddest black clothes and without a feather upon him then i was not deceived i am indeed in the land of dreams     the vicar and the angel  vi   now there are some things frankly impossible the weakest intellect will admit this situation is impossible the athenæum will probably say as much should it venture to review this sunbespattered ferns spreading beech trees the vicar and the gun are acceptable enough but this angel is a different matter plain sensible people will scarcely go on with such an extravagant book and the vicar fully appreciated this impossibility but he lacked decision consequently he went on with it as you shall immediately hear he was hot it was after dinner he was in no mood for mental subtleties the angel had him at a disadvantage and further distracted him from the main issue by irrelevant iridescence and a violent fluttering for the moment it never occurred to the vicar to ask whether the angel was possible or not he accepted him in the confusion of the moment and the mischief was done put yourself in his place my dear athenæum you go out shooting you hit something that alone would disconcert you you find you have hit an angel and he writhes about for a minute and then sits up and addresses you he makes no apology for his own impossibility indeed he carries the charge clean into your camp a man he says pointing a man in the maddest black clothes and without a feather upon him then i was not deceived i am indeed in the land of dreams you must answer him unless you take to your heels or blow his brains out with your second barrel as an escape from the controversy  the land of dreams pardon me if i suggest you have just come out of it was the vicars remark  how can that be said the angel  your wing said the vicar is bleeding before we talk may i have the pleasurethe melancholy pleasureof tying it up i am really most sincerely sorry the angel put his hand behind his back and winced  the vicar assisted his victim to stand up the angel turned gravely and the vicar with numberless insignificant panting parentheses carefully examined the injured wings they articulated he observed with interest to a kind of second glenoid on the outer and upper edge of the shoulder blade the left wing had suffered little except the loss of some of the primary wingquills and a shot or so in the ala spuria but the humerus bone of the right was evidently smashed the vicar stanched the bleeding as well as he could and tied up the bone with his pocket handkerchief and the neck wrap his housekeeper made him carry in all weathers  im afraid you will not be able to fly for some time said he feeling the bone  i dont like this new sensation said the angel  the pain when i feel your bone  the what said the angel  the pain  painyou call it no i certainly dont like the pain do you have much of this pain in the land of dreams  a very fair share said the vicar is it new to you  quite said the angel i dont like it  how curious said the vicar and bit at the end of a strip of linen to tie a knot i think this bandaging must serve for the present he said ive studied ambulance work before but never the bandaging up of wing wounds is your pain any better  it glows now instead of flashing said the angel  i am afraid you will find it glow for some time said the vicar still intent on the wound  the angel gave a shrug of the wing and turned round to look at the vicar again he had been trying to keep an eye on the vicar over his shoulder during all their interview he looked at him from top to toe with raised eyebrows and a growing smile on his beautiful softfeatured face it seems so odd he said with a sweet little laugh to be talking to a man  do you know said the vicar now that i come to think of it it is equally odd to me that i should be talking to an angel i am a somewhat matteroffact person a vicar has to be angels i have always regarded asartistic conceptions  exactly what we think of men  but surely you have seen so many men  never before today in pictures and books times enough of course but i have seen several since the sunrise solid real men besides a horse or sothose unicorn things you know without hornsand quite a number of those grotesque knobby things called cows i was naturally a little frightened at so many mythical monsters and came to hide here until it was dark i suppose it will be dark again presently like it was at first phew this pain of yours is poor fun i hope i shall wake up directly  i dont understand quite said the vicar knitting his brows and tapping his forehead with his flat hand mythical monster the worst thing he had been called for years hitherto was a mediaeval anachronism by an advocate of disestablishment do i understand that you consider me asas something in a dream  of course said the angel smiling  and this world about me these rugged trees and spreading fronds  is all so very dream like said the angel just exactly what one dreams ofor artists imagine  you have artists then among the angels  all kinds of artists angels with wonderful imaginations who invent men and cows and eagles and a thousand impossible creatures  impossible creatures said the vicar  impossible creatures said the angel myths  but im real said the vicar i assure you im real  the angel shrugged his wings and winced and smiled i can always tell when i am dreaming he said  youdreaming said the vicar he looked round him  you dreaming he repeated his mind worked diffusely  he held out his hand with all his fingers moving i have it he said i begin to see a really brilliant idea was dawning upon his mind he had not studied mathematics at cambridge for nothing after all tell me please some animals of your world  of the real world real animals you know  real animals said the angel smiling whytheres griffins and dragonsand jabberwocksand cherubimand sphinxesand the hippogriffand mermaidsand satyrsand  thank you said the vicar as the angel appeared to be warming to his work thank you that is quite enough i begin to understand  he paused for a moment his face pursed up yes  i begin to see it  see what asked the angel  the griffins and satyrs and so forth its as clear  i dont see them said the angel  no the whole point is they are not to be seen in this world but our men with imaginations have told us all about them you know and even i at times  there are places in this village where you must simply take what they set before you or give offencei i say have seen in my dreams jabberwocks bogle brutes mandrakes from our point of view you know they are dream creatures  dream creatures said the angel how singular this is a very curious dream a kind of topsyturvey one you call men real and angels a myth it almost makes one think that in some odd way there must be two worlds as it were  at least two said the vicar  lying somewhere close together and yet scarcely suspecting  as near as page to page of a book  penetrating each other living each its own life this is really a delicious dream  and never dreaming of each other  except when people go a dreaming  yes said the angel thoughtfully it must be something of the sort and that reminds me sometimes when i have been dropping asleep or drowsing under the noontide sun i have seen strange corrugated faces just like yours going by me and trees with green leaves upon them and such queer uneven ground as this it must be so i have fallen into another world  sometimes began the vicar at bedtime when i have been just on the edge of consciousness i have seen faces as beautiful as yours and the strange dazzling vistas of a wonderful scene that flowed past me winged shapes soaring over it and wonderfulsometimes terribleforms going to and fro i have even heard sweet music too in my ears it may be that as we withdraw our attention from the world of sense the pressing world about us as we pass into the twilight of repose other worlds just as we see the stars those other worlds in space when the glare of day recedes and the artistic dreamers who see such things most clearly  they looked at one another  and in some incomprehensible manner i have fallen into this world of yours out of my own said the angel into the world of my dreams grown real  he looked about him into the world of my dreams  it is confusing said the vicar it almost makes one think there may be ahem four dimensions after all in which case of course he went on hurriedlyfor he loved geometrical speculations and took a certain pride in his knowledge of themthere may be any number of three dimensional universes packed side by side and all dimly dreaming of one another there may be world upon world universe upon universe its perfectly possible theres nothing so incredible as the absolutely possible but i wonder how you came to fall out of your world into mine  dear me said the angel theres deer and a stag just as they draw them on the coats of arms how grotesque it all seems can i really be awake  he rubbed his knuckles into his eyes  the halfdozen of dappled deer came in indian file obliquely through the trees and halted watching its no dreami am really a solid concrete angel in dream land said the angel he laughed the vicar stood surveying him the reverend gentleman was pulling his mouth askew after a habit he had and slowly stroking his chin he was asking himself whether he too was not in the land of dreams     vii   now in the land of the angels so the vicar learnt in the course of many conversations there is neither pain nor trouble nor death marrying nor giving in marriage birth nor forgetting only at times new things begin it is a land without hill or dale a wonderfully level land glittering with strange buildings with incessant sunlight or full moon and with incessant breezes blowing through the Æolian traceries of the trees it is wonderland with glittering seas hanging in the sky across which strange fleets go sailing none know whither there the flowers glow in heaven and the stars shine about ones feet and the breath of life is a delight the land goes on for everthere is no solar system nor interstellar space such as there is in our universeand the air goes upward past the sun into the uttermost abyss of their sky and there is nothing but beauty thereall the beauty in our art is but feeble rendering of faint glimpses of that wonderful world and our composers our original composers are those who hear however faintly the dust of melody that drives before its winds and the angels and wonderful monsters of bronze and marble and living fire go to and fro therein  it is a land of lawfor whatever is is under the lawbut its laws all in some strange way differ from ours their geometry is different because their space has a curve in it so that all their planes are cylinders and their law of gravitation is not according to the law of inverse squares and there are fourandtwenty primary colours instead of only three most of the fantastic things of our science are commonplaces there and all our earthly science would seem to them the maddest dreaming there are no flowers upon their plants for instance but jets of coloured fire that of course will seem mere nonsense to you because you do not understand most of what the angel told the vicar indeed the vicar could not realise because his own experiences being only of this world of matter warred against his understanding it was too strange to imagine  what had jolted these twin universes together so that the angel had fallen suddenly into sidderford neither the angel nor the vicar could tell nor for the matter of that could the author of this story the author is concerned with the facts of the case and has neither the desire nor the confidence to explain them explanations are the fallacy of a scientific age and the cardinal fact of the case is this that out in siddermorton park with the glory of some wonderful world where there is neither sorrow nor sighing still clinging to him on the 4th of august 1895 stood an angel bright and beautiful talking to the vicar of siddermorton about the plurality of worlds the author will swear to the angel if need be and there he draws the line     viii   i have said the angel a most unusual feelinghere have had since sunrise i dont remember ever having any feelinghere before  not pain i hope said the vicar  oh no it is quite different from thata kind of vacuous feeling  the atmospheric pressure perhaps is a little different the vicar began feeling his chin  and do you know i have also the most curious sensations in my mouthalmost as ifits so absurdas if i wanted to stuff things into it  bless me said the vicar of course youre hungry  hungry said the angel whats that  dont you eat  eat the words quite new to me  put food into your mouth you know one has to here you will soon learn if you dont you get thin and miserable and suffer a great dealpain you knowand finally you die  die said the angel thats another strange word  its not strange here it means leaving off you know said the vicar  we never leave off said the angel  you dont know what may happen to you in this world said the vicar thinking him over possibly if you are feeling hungry and can feel pain and have your wings broken you may even have to die before you get out of it again at anyrate you had better try eating for my own partahemthere are many more disagreeable things  i suppose i had better eat said the angel if its not too difficult i dont like this pain of yours and i dont like this hungry if your die is anything like it i would prefer to eat what a very odd world this is  to die said the vicar is generally considered worse than either pain or hunger it depends  you must explain all that to me later said the angel unless i wake up at present please show me how to eat if you will i feel a kind of urgency  pardon me said the vicar and offered an elbow if i may have the pleasure of entertaining you my house lies yondernot a couple of miles from here  your house said the angel a little puzzled but he took the vicars arm affectionately and the two conversing as they went waded slowly through the luxuriant bracken sun mottled under the trees and on over the stile in the park palings and so across the beeswarming heather for a mile or more down the hillside home  you would have been charmed at the couple could you have seen them the angel slight of figure scarcely five feet high and with a beautiful almost effeminate face such as an italian old master might have painted indeed there is one in the national gallery tobias and the angel by some artist unknown not at all unlike him so far as face and spirit go he was robed simply in a purplewrought saffron blouse bare kneed and barefooted with his wings broken now and a leaden grey folded behind him the vicar was a short rather stout figure rubicund redhaired cleanshaven and with bright ruddy brown eyes he wore a piebald straw hat with a black ribbon a very neat white tie and a fine gold watchchain he was so greatly interested in his companion that it only occurred to him when he was in sight of the vicarage that he had left his gun lying just where he had dropped it amongst the bracken  he was rejoiced to hear that the pain of the bandaged wing fell rapidly in intensity     parenthesis on angels  ix   let us be plain the angel of this story is the angel of art not the angel that one must be irreverent to touchneither the angel of religious feeling nor the angel of popular belief the last we all know she is alone among the angelic hosts in being distinctly feminine she wears a robe of immaculate unmitigated white with sleeves is fair with long golden tresses and has eyes of the blue of heaven just a pure woman she is pure maiden or pure matron in her robe de nuit and with wings attached to her shoulder blades her callings are domestic and sympathetic she watches over a cradle or assists a sister soul heavenward often she bears a palm leaf but one would not be surprised if one met her carrying a warmingpan softly to some poor chilly sinner she it was who came down in a bevy to marguerite in prison in the amended last scene in faust at the lyceum and the interesting and improving little children that are to die young have visions of such angels in the novels of mrs henry wood this white womanliness with her indescribable charm of lavenderlike holiness her aroma of clean methodical lives is it would seem after all a purely teutonic invention latin thought knows her not the old masters have none of her she is of a piece with that gentle innocent ladylike school of art whereof the greatest triumph is a lump in ones throat and where wit and passion scorn and pomp have no place the white angel was made in germany in the land of blonde women and the domestic sentiments she comes to us cool and worshipful pure and tranquil as silently soothing as the breadth and calmness of the starlit sky which also is so unspeakably dear to the teutonic soul we do her reverence and to the angels of the hebrews those spirits of power and mystery to raphael zadkiel and michael of whom only watts has caught the shadow of whom only blake has seen the splendour to them too do we do reverence  but this angel the vicar shot is we say no such angel at all but the angel of italian art polychromatic and gay he comes from the land of beautiful dreams and not from any holier place at best he is a popish creature bear patiently therefore with his scattered remiges and be not hasty with your charge of irreverence before the story is read     at the vicarage  x   the curates wife and her two daughters and mrs jehoram were still playing at tennis on the lawn behind the vicars study playing keenly and talking in gasps about paper patterns for blouses but the vicar forgot and came in that way  they saw the vicars hat above the rhododendrons and a bare curly head beside him i must ask him about susan wiggin said the curates wife she was about to serve and stood with a racket in one hand and a ball between the fingers of the other he really ought to have gone to see herbeing the vicar not george iah  for the two figures suddenly turned the corner and were visible the vicar arm in arm with  you see it came on the curates wife suddenly the angels face being towards her she saw nothing of the wings only a face of unearthly beauty in a halo of chestnut hair and a graceful figure clothed in a saffron garment that barely reached the knees the thought of those knees flashed upon the vicar at once he too was horrorstruck so were the two girls and mrs jehoram all horrorstruck the angel stared in astonishment at the horrorstruck group you see he had never seen anyone horrorstruck before  mister hilyer said the curates wife this is too much she stood speechless for a moment oh  she swept round upon the rigid girls come the vicar opened and shut his voiceless mouth the world hummed and spun about him there was a whirling of zephyr skirts four impassioned faces sweeping towards the open door of the passage that ran through the vicarage he felt his position went with them  mrs mendham said the vicar stepping forward mrs mendham you dont understand  oh they all said again  one two three four skirts vanished in the doorway the vicar staggered half way across the lawn and stopped aghast this comes he heard the curates wife say out of the depth of the passage of having an unmarried vicar the umbrella stand wobbled the front door of the vicarage slammed like a minute gun there was silence for a space  i might have thought he said she is always so hasty  he put his hand to his china habit with him then turned his face to his companion the angel was evidently well bred he was holding up mrs jehorams sunshadeshe had left it on one of the cane chairsand examining it with extraordinary interest he opened it what a curious little mechanism he said what can it be for  the vicar did not answer the angelic costume certainly wasthe vicar knew it was a case for a french phrasebut he could scarcely remember it he so rarely used french it was not de trop he knew anything but de trop the angel was de trop but certainly not his costume ah sans culotte  the vicar examined his visitor criticallyfor the first time he will be difficult to explain he said to himself softly  the angel stuck the sunshade into the turf and went to smell the sweet briar the sunshine fell upon his brown hair and gave it almost the appearance of a halo he pricked his finger odd he said pain again  yes said the vicar thinking aloud hes very beautiful and curious as he is i should like him best so but i am afraid i must  he approached the angel with a nervous cough     xi   those said the vicar were ladies  how grotesque said the angel smiling and smelling the sweet briar and such quaint shapes  possibly said the vicar did you ahem notice how they behaved  they went away seemed indeed to run away frightened i of course was frightened at things without wings i hope they were not frightened at my wings  at your appearance generally said the vicar glancing involuntarily at the pink feet  dear me it never occurred to me i suppose i seemed as odd to them as you did to me he glanced down and my feet you have hoofs like a hippogriff  boots corrected the vicar  boots you call them but anyhow i am sorry i alarmed  you see said the vicar stroking his chin our ladies ahem have peculiar viewsrather inartistic viewsabout ahem clothing dressed as you are i am afraid i am really afraid thatbeautiful as your costume certainly isyou will find yourself somewhat ahem somewhat isolated in society we have a little proverb when in rome ahem one must do as the romans do i can assure you that assuming you are desirous to ahem associate with usduring your involuntary stay  the angel retreated a step or so as the vicar came nearer and nearer in his attempt to be diplomatic and confidential the beautiful face grew perplexed i dont quite understand why do you keep making these noises in your throat is it die or eat or any of those  as your host interrupted the vicar and stopped  as my host said the angel  would you object pending more permanent arrangements to invest yourself ahem in a suit an entirely new suit i may say like this i have on  oh said the angel he retreated so as to take in the vicar from top to toe wear clothes like yours he said he was puzzled but amused his eyes grew round and bright his mouth puckered at the corners  delightful he said clapping his hands together what a mad quaint dream this is where are they he caught at the neck of the saffron robe  indoors said the vicar this way we will changeindoors     xii   so the angel was invested in a pair of nether garments of the vicars a shirt ripped down the back to accommodate the wings socks shoesthe vicars dress shoescollar tie and light overcoat but putting on the latter was painful and reminded the vicar that the bandaging was temporary i will ring for tea at once and send grummet down for crump said the vicar and dinner shall be earlier while the vicar shouted his orders on the landing rails the angel surveyed himself in the cheval glass with immense delight if he was a stranger to pain he was evidently no strangerthanks perhaps to dreamingto the pleasure of incongruity  they had tea in the drawingroom the angel sat on the music stool music stool because of his wings at first he wanted to lie on the hearthrug he looked much less radiant in the vicars clothes than he had done upon the moor when dressed in saffron his face shone still the colour of his hair and cheeks was strangely bright and there was a superhuman light in his eyes but his wings under the overcoat gave him the appearance of a hunchback the garments indeed made quite a terrestrial thing of him the trousers were puckered transversely and the shoes a size or so too large  he was charmingly affable and quite ignorant of the most elementary facts of civilization eating came without much difficulty and the vicar had an entertaining time teaching him how to take tea what a mess it is what a dear grotesque ugly world you live in said the angel fancy stuffing things into your mouth we use our mouths just to talk and sing with our world you know is almost incurably beautiful we get so very little ugliness that i find all this  delightful  mrs hinijer the vicars housekeeper looked at the angel suspiciously when she brought in the tea she thought him rather a queer customer what she would have thought had she seen him in saffron no one can tell  the angel shuffled about the room with his cup of tea in one hand and the bread and butter in the other and examined the vicars furniture outside the french windows the lawn with its array of dahlias and sunflowers glowed in the warm sunlight and mrs jehorams sunshade stood thereon like a triangle of fire he thought the vicars portrait over the mantel very curious indeed could not understand what it was there for you have yourself round he said apropos of the portrait why want yourself flat and he was vastly amused at the glass fire screen he found the oak chairs oddyoure not square are you he said when the vicar explained their use we never double ourselves up we lie about on the asphodel when we want to rest  the chair said the vicar to tell you the truth has always puzzled me it dates i think from the days when the floors were cold and very dirty i suppose we have kept up the habit its become a kind of instinct with us to sit on chairs anyhow if i went to see one of my parishioners and suddenly spread myself out on the floorthe natural way of iti dont know what she would do it would be all over the parish in no time yet it seems the natural method of reposing to recline the greeks and romans  what is this said the angel abruptly  thats a stuffed kingfisher i killed it  killed it  shot it said the vicar with a gun  shot as you did me  i didnt kill you you see fortunately  is killing making like that  in a way  dear me and you wanted to make me like thatwanted to put glass eyes in me and string me up in a glass case full of ugly green and brown stuff  you see began the vicar i scarcely understood  is that die asked the angel suddenly  that is dead it died  poor little thing i must eat a lot but you say you killed it why  you see said the vicar i take an interest in birds and i ahem collect them i wanted the specimen  the angel stared at him for a moment with puzzled eyes a beautiful bird like that he said with a shiver because the fancy took you you wanted the specimen  he thought for a minute do you often kill he asked the vicar     the man of science  xiii   then doctor crump arrived grummet had met him not a hundred yards from the vicarage gate he was a large rather heavylooking man with a cleanshaven face and a double chin he was dressed in a grey morning coat he always affected grey with a chequered black and white tie whats the trouble he said entering and staring without a shadow of surprise at the angels radiant face  thisahemgentleman said the vicar orahangelthe angel bowedis suffering from a gunshot wound  gunshot wound said doctor crump in july may i look at it mrangel i think you said  he will probably be able to assuage your pain said the vicar let me assist you to remove your coat  the angel turned obediently  spinal curvature muttered doctor crump quite audibly walking round behind the angel no abnormal growth hullo this is odd he clutched the left wing curious he said reduplication of the anterior limbbifid coracoid possible of course but ive never seen it before the angel winced under his hands humerus radius and ulna all there congenital of course humerus broken curious integumentary simulation of feathers dear me almost avian probably of considerable interest in comparative anatomy i never didhow did this gunshot happen mr angel  the vicar was amazed at the doctors matteroffact manner  our friend said the angel moving his head at the vicar  unhappily it is my doing said the vicar stepping forward explanatory i mistook the gentlemanthe angel ahemfor a large bird  mistook him for a large bird what next your eyes want seeing to said doctor crump ive told you so before he went on patting and feeling keeping time with a series of grunts and inarticulate mutterings but this is really a very good bit of amateur bandaging said he i think i shall leave it curious malformation this is dont you find it inconvenient mr angel  he suddenly walked round so as to look in the angels face  the angel thought he referred to the wound it is rather he said  if it wasnt for the bones i should say paint with iodine night and morning nothing like iodine you could paint your face flat with it but the osseous outgrowth the bones you know complicate things i could saw them off of course its not a thing one should have done in a hurry  do you mean my wings said the angel in alarm  wings said the doctor eigh call em wings yeswhat else should i mean  saw them off said the angel  dont you think so its of course your affair i am only advising  saw them off what a funny creature you are said the angel beginning to laugh  as you will said the doctor he detested people who laughed the things are curious he said turning to the vicar if inconvenientto the angel i never heard of such complete reduplication beforeat least among animals in plants its common enough were you the only one in your family he did not wait for a reply partial cases of the fission of limbs are not at all uncommon of course vicarsixfingered children calves with six feet and cats with double toes you know may i assist you he said turning to the angel who was struggling with the coat but such a complete reduplication and so avian too it would be much less remarkable if it was simply another pair of arms  the coat was got on and he and the angel stared at one another  really said the doctor one begins to understand how that beautiful myth of the angels arose you look a little hectic mr angelfeverish excessive brilliance is almost worse as a symptom than excessive pallor curious your name should be angel i must send you a cooling draught if you should feel thirsty in the night  he made a memorandum on his shirt cuff the angel watched him thoughtfully with the dawn of a smile in his eyes  one minute crump said the vicar taking the doctors arm and leading him towards the door  the angels smile grew brighter he looked down at his blackclad legs he positively thinks i am a man said the angel what he makes of the wings beats me altogether what a queer creature he must be this is really a most extraordinary dream     xiv   that is an angel whispered the vicar you dont understand  what said the doctor in a quick sharp voice his eyebrows went up and he smiled  but the wings  quite natural quite  if a little abnormal  are you sure they are natural  my dear fellow everything that is is natural there is nothing unnatural in the world if i thought there was i should give up practice and go into le grand chartreuse there are abnormal phenomena of course and  but the way i came upon him said the vicar  yes tell me where you picked him up said the doctor he sat down on the hall table  the vicar began rather hesitatinglyhe was not very good at story tellingwith the rumours of a strange great bird he told the story in clumsy sentencesfor knowing the bishop as he did with that awful example always before him he dreaded getting his pulpit style into his daily conversationand at every third sentence or so the doctor made a downward movement of his headthe corners of his mouth tucked away so to speakas though he ticked off the phases of the story and so far found it just as it ought to be selfhypnotism he murmured once  i beg your pardon said the vicar  nothing said the doctor nothing i assure you go on this is extremely interesting  the vicar told him he went out with his gun  after lunch i think you said interrupted the doctor  immediately after said the vicar  you should not do such things you know but go on please  he came to the glimpse of the angel from the gate  in the full glare said the doctor in parenthesis it was seventynine in the shade  when the vicar had finished the doctor pressed his lips together tighter than ever smiled faintly and looked significantly into the vicars eyes  you dont  began the vicar falteringly  the doctor shook his head forgive me he said putting his hand on the vicars arm  you go out he said on a hot lunch and on a hot afternoon probably over eighty your mind what there is of it is whirling with avian expectations i say what there is of it because most of your nervous energy is down there digesting your dinner a man who has been lying in the bracken stands up before you and you blaze away over he goesand as it happensas it happenshe has reduplicate forelimbs one pair being not unlike wings its a coincidence certainly and as for his iridescent colours and so forth have you never had patches of colour swim before your eyes before on a brilliant sunlight day are you sure they were confined to the wings think  but he says he is an angel said the vicar staring out of his little round eyes his plump hands in his pockets  ah said the doctor with his eye on the vicar i expected as much he paused  but dont you think  began the vicar  that man said the doctor in a low earnest voice is a mattoid  a what said the vicar  a mattoid an abnormal man did you notice the effeminate delicacy of his face his tendency to quite unmeaning laughter his neglected hair then consider his singular dress  the vicars hand went up to his chin  marks of mental weakness said the doctor many of this type of degenerate show this same disposition to assume some vast mysterious credentials one will call himself the prince of wales another the archangel gabriel another the deity even ibsen thinks he is a great teacher and maeterlink a new shakespeare ive just been reading all about itin nordau no doubt his odd deformity gave him an idea  but really began the vicar  no doubt hes slipped away from confinement  i do not altogether accept  you will if not theres the police and failing that advertisement but of course his people may want to hush it up its a sad thing in a family  he seems so altogether  probably youll hear from his friends in a day or so said the doctor feeling for his watch he cant live far from here i should think he seems harmless enough i must come along and see that wing again tomorrow he slid off the hall table and stood up  those old wives tales still have their hold on you he said patting the vicar on the shoulder but an angel you knowha ha  i certainly did think said the vicar dubiously  weigh the evidence said the doctor still fumbling at his watch weigh the evidence with our instruments of precision what does it leave you splashes of colour spots of fancymuscae volantes  and yet said the vicar i could almost swear to the glory on his wings  think it over said the doctor watch out hot afternoonbrilliant sunshineboiling down on your head but really i must be going it is a quarter to five ill see yourangel ha ha tomorrow again if no one has been to fetch him in the meanwhile your bandaging was really very good i flatter myself on that score our ambulance classes were a success you see good afternoon     the curate  xv   the vicar opened the door half mechanically to let out crump and saw mendham his curate coming up the pathway by the hedge of purple vetch and meadowsweet at that his hand went up to his chin and his eyes grew perplexed suppose he was deceived the doctor passed the curate with a sweep of his hand from his hat brim crump was an extraordinarily clever fellow the vicar thought and knew far more of anyones brain than one did oneself the vicar felt that so acutely it made the coming explanation difficult suppose he were to go back into the drawingroom and find just a tramp asleep on the hearthrug  mendham was a cadaverous man with a magnificent beard he looked indeed as though he had run to beard as a mustard plant does to seed but when he spoke you found he had a voice as well  my wife came home in a dreadful state he brayed out at long range  come in said the vicar come in most remarkable occurrence please come in come into the study im really dreadfully sorry but when i explain  and apologise i hope brayed the curate  and apologise no not that way this way the study  now what was that woman said the curate turning on the vicar as the latter closed the study door  what woman  pah  but really  the painted creature in light attiredisgustingly light attire to speak freelywith whom you were promenading the garden  my dear mendhamthat was an angel  a very pretty angel  the world is getting so matteroffact said the vicar  the world roared the curate grows blacker every day but to find a man in your position shamelessly openly  bother said the vicar aside he rarely swore look here mendham you really misunderstand i can assure you  very well said the curate explain he stood with his lank legs apart his arms folded scowling at his vicar over his big beard  explanations i repeat i have always considered the peculiar fallacy of this scientific age  the vicar looked about him helplessly the world had all gone dull and dead had he been dreaming all the afternoon was there really an angel in the drawingroom or was he the sport of a complicated hallucination  well said mendham at the end of a minute  the vicars hand fluttered about his chin its such a roundabout story he said  no doubt it will be said mendham harshly  the vicar restrained a movement of impatience  i went out to look for a strange bird this afternoon do you believe in angels mendham real angels  im not here to discuss theology i am the husband of an insulted woman  but i tell you its not a figure of speech this is an angel a real angel with wings hes in the next room now you do misunderstand me so  really hilyer  it is true i tell you mendham i swear it is true the vicars voice grew impassioned what sin i have done that i should entertain and clothe angelic visitants i dont know i only know thatinconvenient as it undoubtedly will bei have an angel now in the drawingroom wearing my new suit and finishing his tea and hes stopping with me indefinitely at my invitation no doubt it was rash of me but i cant turn him out you know because mrs mendhami may be a weakling but i am still a gentleman  really hilyer  i can assure you it is true there was a note of hysterical desperation in the vicars voice i fired at him taking him for a flamingo and hit him in the wing  i thought this was a case for the bishop i find it is a case for the lunacy commissioners  come and see him mendham  but there are no angels  we teach the people differently said the vicar  not as material bodies said the curate  anyhow come and see him  i dont want to see your hallucinations began the curate  i cant explain anything unless you come and see him said the vicar a man whos more like an angel than anything else in heaven or earth you simply must see if you wish to understand  i dont wish to understand said the curate i dont wish to lend myself to any imposture surely hilyer if this is not an imposition you can tell me yourself flamingo indeed     xvi   the angel had finished his tea and was standing looking pensively out of the window he thought the old church down the valley lit by the light of the setting sun was very beautiful but he could not understand the serried ranks of tombstones that lay up the hillside beyond he turned as mendham and the vicar came in  now mendham could bully his vicar cheerfully enough just as he could bully his congregation but he was not the sort of man to bully a stranger he looked at the angel and the strange woman theory was disposed of the angels beauty was too clearly the beauty of the youth  mr hilyer tells me mendham began in an almost apologetic tone that youahits so curiousclaim to be an angel  are an angel said the vicar  the angel bowed  naturally said mendham we are curious  very said the angel the blackness and the shape  i beg your pardon said mendham  the blackness and the flaps repeated the angel and no wings  precisely said mendham who was altogether at a loss we are of course curious to know something of how you came into the village in such a peculiar costume  the angel looked at the vicar the vicar touched his chin  you see began the vicar  let him explain said mendham i beg  i wanted to suggest began the vicar  and i dont want you to suggest  bother said the vicar  the angel looked from one to the other such rugose expressions flit across your faces he said  you see mrmri dont know your name said mendham with a certain diminution of suavity the case stands thus my wifefour ladies i might sayare playing lawn tennis when you suddenly rush out on them sir you rush out on them from among the rhododendra in a very defective costume you and mr hilyer  but i said the vicar  i know it was this gentlemans costume was defective naturallyit is my place in factto demand an explanation his voice was growing in volume and i must demand an explanation  the angel smiled faintly at his note of anger and his sudden attitude of determinationarms tightly folded  i am rather new to the world the angel began  nineteen at least said mendham old enough to know better thats a poor excuse  may i ask one question first said the angel  well  do you think i am a manlike yourself as the chequered man did  if you are not a man  one other question have you never heard of an angel  i warn you not to try that story upon me said mendham now back at his familiar crescendo  the vicar interrupted but mendhamhe has wings  please let me talk to him said mendham  you are so quaint said the angel you interrupt everything i have to say  but what have you to say said mendham  that i really am an angel  pshaw  there you go  but tell me honestly how you came to be in the shrubbery of siddermorton vicaragein the state in which you were and in the vicars company cannot you abandon this ridiculous story of yours  the angel shrugged his wings what is the matter with this man he said to the vicar  my dear mendham said the vicar a few words from me  surely my question is straightforward enough  but you wont tell me the answer you want and its no good my telling you any other  pshaw said the curate again and then turning suddenly on the vicar where does he come from  the vicar was in a dreadful state of doubt by this time  he says he is an angel said the vicar why dont you listen to him  no angel would alarm four ladies  is that what it is all about said the angel  enough cause too i should think said the curate  but i really did not know said the angel  this is altogether too much  i am sincerely sorry i alarmed these ladies  you ought to be but i see i shall get nothing out of you two mendham went towards the door i am convinced there is something discreditable at the bottom of this business or why not tell a simple straightforward story i will confess you puzzle me why in this enlightened age you should tell this fantastic this farfetched story of an angel altogether beats me what good can it do  but stop and look at his wings said the vicar i can assure you he has wings  mendham had his fingers on the doorhandle i have seen quite enough he said it may be this is simply a foolish attempt at a hoax hilyer  but mendham said the vicar  the curate halted in the doorway and looked at the vicar over his shoulder the accumulating judgment of months found vent i cannot understand hilyer why you are in the church for the life of me i cannot the air is full of social movements of economic change the woman movement rational dress the reunion of christendom socialism individualismall the great and moving questions of the hour surely we who follow the great reformer and here you are stuffing birds and startling ladies with your callous disregard  but mendham began the vicar  the curate would not hear him you shame the apostles with your levity but this is only a preliminary enquiry he said with a threatening note in his sonorous voice and so vanished abruptly with a violent slam from the room     xvii   are all men so odd as this said the angel  im in such a difficult position said the vicar you see he said and stopped searching his chin for an idea  im beginning to see said the angel  they wont believe it  i see that  they will think i tell lies  and  that will be extremely painful to me  painful pain said the angel i hope not  the vicar shook his head the good report of the village had been the breath of his life so far you see he said it would look so much more plausible if you said you were just a man  but im not said the angel  no youre not said the vicar so thats no good  nobody here you know has ever seen an angel or heard of oneexcept in church if you had made your debut in the chancelon sundayit might have been different but thats too late now bother nobody absolutely nobody will believe in you  i hope i am not inconveniencing you  not at all said the vicar not at all only naturally it may be inconvenient if you tell a too incredible story if i might suggest ahem  well  you see people in the world being men themselves will almost certainly regard you as a man if you say you are not they will simply say you do not tell the truth only exceptional people appreciate the exceptional when in rome one mustwell respect roman prejudices a littletalk latin you will find it better  you propose i should feign to become a man  you have my meaning at once  the angel stared at the vicars hollyhocks and thought  possibly after all he said slowly i shall become a man i may have been too hasty in saying i was not you say there are no angels in this world who am i to set myself up against your experience a mere thing of a dayso far as this world goes if you say there are no angelsclearly i must be something else i eatangels do not eat i may be a man already  a convenient view at any rate said the vicar  if it is convenient to you  it is and then to account for your presence here  if said the vicar after a hesitating moment of reflection if for instance you had been an ordinary man with a weakness for wading and you had gone wading in the sidder and your clothes had been stolen for instance and i had come upon you in that position of inconvenience the explanation i shall have to make to mrs mendhamwould be shorn at least of the supernatural element there is such a feeling against the supernatural element nowadayseven in the pulpit you would hardly believe  its a pity that was not the case said the angel  of course said the vicar it is a great pity that was not the case but at anyrate you will oblige me if you do not obtrude your angelic nature you will oblige everyone in fact there is a settled opinion that angels do not do this kind of thing and nothing is more painfulas i can testifythan a decaying settled opinion settled opinions are mental teeth in more ways than one for my own partthe vicars hand passed over his eyes for a momenti cannot but believe you are an angel surely i can believe my own eyes  we always do ours said the angel  and so do we within limits  then the clock upon the mantel chimed seven and almost simultaneously mrs hinijer announced dinner     after dinner  xviii   the angel and the vicar sat at dinner the vicar with his napkin tucked in at his neck watched the angel struggling with his soup you will soon get into the way of it said the vicar the knife and fork business was done awkwardly but with effect the angel looked furtively at delia the little waiting maid when presently they sat cracking nutswhich the angel found congenial enoughand the girl had gone the angel asked was that a lady too  well said the vicar crack noshe is not a lady she is a servant  yes said the angel she had rather a nicer shape  you mustnt tell mrs mendham that said the vicar covertly satisfied  she didnt stick out so much at the shoulders and hips and there was more of her in between and the colour of her robes was not discordantsimply neutral and her face  mrs mendham and her daughters had been playing tennis said the vicar feeling he ought not to listen to detraction even of his mortal enemy do you like these thingsthese nuts  very much said the angel crack  you see said the vicar chum chum chum for my own part i entirely believe you are an angel  yes said the angel  i shot youi saw you flutter its beyond dispute in my own mind i admit its curious and against my preconceptions butpracticallyim assured perfectly assured in fact that i saw what i certainly did see but after the behaviour of these people crack i really dont see how we are to persuade people nowadays people are so very particular about evidence so that i think there is a great deal to be said for the attitude you assume temporarily at least i think it would be best of you to do as you propose to do and behave as a man as far as possible of course there is no knowing how or when you may go back after what has happened gluck gluck gluckas the vicar refills his glassafter what has happened i should not be surprised to see the side of the room fall away and the hosts of heaven appear to take you away againtake us both away even you have so far enlarged my imagination all these years i have been forgetting wonderland but still it will certainly be wiser to break the thing gently to them  this life of yours said the angel im still in the dark about it how do you begin  dear me said the vicar fancy having to explain that we begin existence here you know as babies silly pink helpless things wrapped in white with goggling eyes that yelp dismally at the font then these babies grow larger and become even beautifulwhen their faces are washed and they continue to grow to a certain size they become children boys and girls youths and maidens crack young men and young women that is the finest time in life according to manycertainly the most beautiful full of great hopes and dreams vague emotions and unexpected dangers  that was a maiden said the angel indicating the door through which delia had disappeared  yes said the vicar that was a maiden and paused thoughtfully  and then  then said the vicar the glamour fades and life begins in earnest the young men and young women pair offmost of them they come to me shy and bashful in smart ugly dresses and i marry them and then little pink babies come to them and some of the youths and maidens that were grow fat and vulgar and some grow thin and shrewish and their pretty complexions go and they get a queer delusion of superiority over the younger people and all the delight and glory goes out of their lives so they call the delight and glory of the younger ones illusion and then they begin to drop to pieces  drop to pieces said the angel how grotesque  their hair comes off and gets dull coloured or ashen grey said the vicar i for instance he bowed his head forward to show a circular shining patch the size of a florin and their teeth come out their faces collapse and become as wrinkled and dry as a shrivelled apple corrugated you called mine they care more and more for what they have to eat and to drink and less and less for any of the other delights of life their limbs get loose in the joints and their hearts slack or little pieces from their lungs come coughing up pain  ah said the angel  pain comes into their lives more and more and then they go they do not like to go but they have toout of this world very reluctantly clutching its pain at last in their eagerness to stop  where do they go  once i thought i knew but now i am older i know i do not know we have a legendperhaps it is not a legend one may be a churchman and disbelieve stokes says there is nothing in it the vicar shook his head at the bananas  and you said the angel were you a little pink baby  a little while ago i was a little pink baby  were you robed then as you are now  oh no dear me what a queer idea had long white clothes i suppose like the rest of them  and then you were a little boy  a little boy  and then a glorious youth  i was not a very glorious youth i am afraid i was sickly and too poor to be radiant and with a timid heart i studied hard and pored over the dying thoughts of men long dead so i lost the glory and no maiden came to me and the dulness of life began too soon  and you have your little pink babies  none said the vicar with a scarce perceptible pause yet all the same as you see i am beginning to drop to pieces presently my back will droop like a wilting flowerstalk and then in a few thousand days more i shall be done with and i shall go out of this world of mine whither i do not know  and you have to eat like this every day  eat and get clothes and keep this roof above me there are some very disagreeable things in this world called cold and rain and the other people herehow and why is too long a storyhave made me a kind of chorus to their lives they bring their little pink babies to me and i have to say a name and some other things over each new pink baby and when the children have grown to be youths and maidens they come again and are confirmed you will understand that better later then before they may join in couples and have pink babies of their own they must come again and hear me read out of a book they would be outcast and no other maiden would speak to the maiden who had a little pink baby without i had read over her for twenty minutes out of my book its a necessary thing as you will see odd as it may seem to you and afterwards when they are falling to pieces i try and persuade them of a strange world in which i scarcely believe myself where life is altogether different from what they have hador desire and in the end i bury them and read out of my book to those who will presently follow into the unknown land i stand at the beginning and at the zenith and at the setting of their lives and on every seventh day i who am a man myself i who see no further than they do talk to them of the life to comethe life of which we know nothing if such a life there be and slowly i drop to pieces amidst my prophesying  what a strange life said the angel  yes said the vicar what a strange life but the thing that makes it strange to me is new i had taken it as a matter of course until you came into my life  this life of ours is so insistent said the vicar it and its petty needs its temporary pleasures crack swathe our souls about while i am preaching to these people of mine of another life some are ministering to one appetite and eating sweets othersthe old menare slumbering the youths glance at the maidens the grown men protrude white waistcoats and gold chains pomp and vanity on a substratum of carnal substance their wives flaunt garish bonnets at one another and i go on droning away of the things unseen and unrealisedeye hath not seen i read nor ear heard nor hath it entered into the imagination of man to conceive and i look up to catch an adult male immortal admiring the fit of a pair of three and sixpenny gloves it is damping year after year when i was ailing in my youth i felt almost the assurance of vision that beneath this temporary phantasm world was the real worldthe enduring world of the life everlasting but now  he glanced at his chubby white hand fingering the stem of his glass i have put on flesh since then he said pause  i have changed and developed very much the battle of the flesh and spirit does not trouble me as it did every day i feel less confidence in my beliefs and more in god i live i am afraid a quiescent life duties fairly done a little ornithology and a little chess a trifle of mathematical trifling my times are in his hands  the vicar sighed and became pensive the angel watched him and the angels eyes were troubled with the puzzle of him gluck gluck gluck went the decanter as the vicar refilled his glass     xix   so the angel dined and talked to the vicar and presently the night came and he was overtaken by yawning  yahoh said the angel suddenly dear me a higher power seemed suddenly to stretch my mouth open and a great breath of air went rushing down my throat  you yawned said the vicar do you never yawn in the angelic country  never said the angel  and yet you are immortali suppose you want to go to bed  bed said the angel wheres that  so the vicar explained darkness to him and the art of going to bed the angels it seems sleep only in order to dream and dream like primitive man with their foreheads on their knees and they sleep among the white poppy meadows in the heat of the day the angel found the bedroom arrangements quaint enough  why is everything raised up on big wooden legs he said you have the floor and then you put everything you have upon a wooden quadruped why do you do it the vicar explained with philosophical vagueness the angel burnt his finger in the candleflameand displayed an absolute ignorance of the elementary principles of combustion he was merely charmed when a line of fire ran up the curtains the vicar had to deliver a lecture on fire so soon as the flame was extinguished he had all kinds of explanations to makeeven the soap needed explaining it was an hour or more before the angel was safely tucked in for the night  hes very beautiful said the vicar descending the staircase quite tired out and hes a real angel no doubt but i am afraid he will be a dreadful anxiety all the same before he gets into our earthly way with things  he seemed quite worried he helped himself to an extra glass of sherry before he put away the wine in the cellaret     xx   the curate stood in front of the lookingglass and solemnly divested himself of his collar  i never heard a more fantastic story said mrs mendham from the basket chair the man must be mad are you sure  perfectly my dear ive told you every word every incident  well said mrs mendham and spread her hands theres no sense in it  precisely my dear  the vicar said mrs mendham must be mad  this hunchback is certainly one of the strangest creatures ive seen for a long time foreign looking with a big bright coloured face and long brown hair it cant have been cut for months the curate put his studs carefully upon the shelf of the dressingtable and a kind of staring look about his eyes and a simpering smile quite a silly looking person effeminate  but who can he be said mrs mendham  i cant imagine my dear nor where he came from he might be a chorister or something of that sort  but why should he be about the shrubbery  in that dreadful costume  i dont know the vicar gave me no explanation he simply said mendham this is an angel  i wonder if he drinks they may have been bathing near the spring of course reflected mrs mendham but i noticed no other clothes on his arm  the curate sat down on his bed and unlaced his boots  its a perfect mystery to me my dear flick flick of laces hallucination is the only charitable  you are sure george that it was not a woman  perfectly said the curate  i know what men are of course  it was a young man of nineteen or twenty said the curate  i cant understand it said mrs mendham you say the creature is staying at the vicarage  hilyer is simply mad said the curate he got up and went padding round the room to the door to put out his boots to judge by his manner you would really think he believed this cripple was an angel are your shoes out dear  theyre just by the wardrobe said mrs mendham he always was a little queer you know there was always something childish about him an angel  the curate came and stood by the fire fumbling with his braces mrs mendham liked a fire even in the summer he shirks all the serious problems in life and is always trifling with some new foolishness said the curate angel indeed he laughed suddenly hilyer must be mad he said  mrs mendham laughed too even that doesnt explain the hunchback she said  the hunchback must be mad too said the curate  its the only way of explaining it in a sensible way said mrs mendham pause  angel or no angel said mrs mendham i know what is due to me even supposing the man thought he was in the company of an angel that is no reason why he should not behave like a gentleman  that is perfectly true  you will write to the bishop of course  mendham coughed no i shant write to the bishop said mendham i think it seems a little disloyal and he took no notice of the last you know  but surely  i shall write to austin in confidence he will be sure to tell the bishop you know and you must remember my dear  that hilyer can dismiss you you were going to say my dear the mans much too weak i should have a word to say about that and besides you do all his work for him practically we manage the parish from end to end i do not know what would become of the poor if it was not for me theyd have free quarters in the vicarage tomorrow there is that goody ansell  i know my dear said the curate turning away and proceeding with his undressing you were telling me about her only this afternoon     xxi   and thus in the little bedroom over the gable we reach a first resting place in this story and as we have been hard at it getting our story spread out before you it may be perhaps well to recapitulate a little  looking back you will see that much has been done we began with a blaze of light not uniform but broken all over by curving flashes like the waving of swords and the sound of a mighty harping and the advent of an angel with polychromatic wings  swiftly dexterously as the reader must admit wings have been clipped halo handled off the glory clapped into coat and trousers and the angel made for all practical purposes a man under a suspicion of being either a lunatic or an impostor you have heard too or at least been able to judge what the vicar and the doctor and the curates wife thought of the strange arrival and further remarkable opinions are to follow  the afterglow of the summer sunset in the northwest darkens into night and the angel sleeps dreaming himself back in the wonderful world where it is always light and everyone is happy where fire does not burn and ice does not chill where rivulets of starlight go streaming through the amaranthine meadows out to the seas of peace he dreams and it seems to him that once more his wings glow with a thousand colours and flash through the crystal air of the world from which he has come  so he dreams but the vicar lies awake too perplexed for dreaming chiefly he is troubled by the possibilities of mrs mendham but the evenings talk has opened strange vistas in his mind and he is stimulated by a sense as of something seen darkly by the indistinct vision of a hitherto unsuspected wonderland lying about his world for twenty years now he has held his village living and lived his daily life protected by his familiar creed by the clamour of the details of life from any mystical dreaming but now interweaving with the familiar bother of his persecuting neighbour is an altogether unfamiliar sense of strange new things  there was something ominous in the feeling once indeed it rose above all other considerations and in a kind of terror he blundered out of bed bruised his shins very convincingly found the matches at last and lit a candle to assure himself of the reality of his own customary world again but on the whole the more tangible trouble was the mendham avalanche her tongue seemed to be hanging above him like the sword of damocles what might she not say of this business before her indignant imagination came to rest  and while the successful captor of the strange bird was sleeping thus uneasily gully of sidderton was carefully unloading his gun after a wearisome blank day and sandy bright was on his knees in prayer with the window carefully fastened annie durgan was sleeping hard with her mouth open and amorys mother was dreaming of washing and both of them had long since exhausted the topics of the sound and the glare lumpy durgan was sitting up in his bed now crooning the fragment of a tune and now listening intently for a sound he had heard once and longed to hear again as for the solicitors clerk at iping hanger he was trying to write poetry about a confectioners girl at portburdock and the strange bird was quite out of his head but the ploughman who had seen it on the confines of siddermorton park had a black eye that had been one of the more tangible consequences of a little argument about birds legs in the ship it is worthy of this passing mention since it is probably the only known instance of an angel causing anything of the kind     morning  xxii   the vicar going to call the angel found him dressed and leaning out of his window it was a glorious morning still dewy and the rising sunlight slanting round the corner of the house struck warm and yellow upon the hillside the birds were astir in the hedges and shrubbery up the hillsidefor it was late in augusta plough drove slowly the angels chin rested upon his hands and he did not turn as the vicar came up to him  hows the wing said the vicar  id forgotten it said the angel is that yonder a man  the vicar looked thats a ploughman  why does he go to and fro like that does it amuse him  hes ploughing thats his work  work why does he do it it seems a monotonous thing to do  it is admitted the vicar but he has to do it to get a living you know to get food to eat and all that kind of thing  how curious said the angel do all men have to do that do you  oh no he does it for me does my share  why asked the angel  oh in return for things i do for him you know we go in for division of labour in this world exchange is no robbery  i see said the angel with his eyes still on the ploughmans heavy movements  what do you do for him  that seems an easy question to you said the vicar but reallyits difficult our social arrangements are rather complicated its impossible to explain these things all at once before breakfast dont you feel hungry  i think i do said the angel slowly still at the window and then abruptly somehow i cant help thinking that ploughing must be far from enjoyable  possibly said the vicar very possibly but breakfast is ready wont you come down  the angel left the window reluctantly  our society explained the vicar on the staircase is a complicated organisation  yes  and it is so arranged that some do one thing and some another  and that lean bent old man trudges after that heavy blade of iron pulled by a couple of horses while we go down to eat  yes you will find it is perfectly just ah mushrooms and poached eggs its the social system pray be seated possibly it strikes you as unfair  im puzzled said the angel  the drink im sending you is called coffee said the vicar i daresay you are when i was a young man i was puzzled in the same way but afterwards comes a broader view of things these black things are called mushrooms they look beautiful other considerations all men are brothers of course but some are younger brothers so to speak there is work that requires culture and refinement and work in which culture and refinement would be an impediment and the rights of property must not be forgotten one must render unto cæsar do you know instead of explaining this matter now this is yours i think i will lend you a little book to read chum chum chumthese mushrooms are well up to their appearance which sets the whole thing out very clearly     the violin  xxiii   after breakfast the vicar went into the little room next his study to find a book on political economy for the angel to read for the angels social ignorances were clearly beyond any verbal explanations the door stood ajar  what is that said the angel following him a violin he took it down  you play said the vicar  the angel had the bow in his hand and by way of answer drove it across the strings the quality of the note made the vicar turn suddenly  the angels hand tightened on the instrument the bow flew back and flickered and an air the vicar had never heard before danced in his ears the angel shifted the fiddle under his dainty chin and went on playing and as he played his eyes grew bright and his lips smiled at first he looked at the vicar then his expression became abstracted he seemed no longer to look at the vicar but through him at something beyond something in his memory or his imagination something infinitely remote undreamt of hitherto  the vicar tried to follow the music the air reminded him of a flame it rushed up shone flickered and danced passed and reappeared noit did not reappear another airlike it and unlike it shot up after it wavered vanished then another the same and not the same it reminded him of the flaring tongues that palpitate and change above a newly lit fire there are two airsor motifs which is itthought the vicar he knew remarkably little of musical technique they go dancing up one pursuing the other out of the fire of the incantation pursuing fluctuating turning up into the sky there below was the fire burning a flame without fuel upon a level space and there two flirting butterflies of sound dancing away from it up one over another swift abrupt uncertain  flirting butterflies were they what was the vicar thinking of where was he in the little room next to his study of course and the angel standing in front of him smiling into his face playing the violin and looking through him as though he was only a window that motif again a yellow flare spread fanlike by a gust and now one then with a swift eddying upward flight the other the two things of fire and light pursuing one another again up into that clear immensity  the study and the realities of life suddenly faded out of the vicars eyes grew thinner and thinner like a mist that dissolves into air and he and the angel stood together on a pinnacle of wrought music about which glittering melodies circled and vanished and reappeared he was in the land of beauty and once more the glory of heaven was upon the angels face and the glowing delights of colour pulsated in his wings himself the vicar could not see but i cannot tell you of the vision of that great and spacious land of its incredible openness and height and nobility for there is no space there like ours no time as we know it one must needs speak by bungling metaphors and own in bitterness after all that one has failed and it was only a vision the wonderful creatures flying through the æther saw them not as they stood there flew through them as one might pass through a whisp of mist the vicar lost all sense of duration all sense of necessity  ah said the angel suddenly putting down the fiddle  the vicar had forgotten the book on political economy had forgotten everything until the angel had done for a minute he sat quite still then he woke up with a start he was sitting on the old ironbound chest  really he said slowly you are very clever  he looked about him in a puzzled way i had a kind of vision while you were playing i seemed to see what did i see it has gone  he stood up with a dazzled expression upon his face i shall never play the violin again he said i wish you would take it to your roomand keep it and play to me again i did not know anything of music until i heard you play i do not feel as though i had ever heard any music before  he stared at the angel then about him at the room i have never felt anything of this kind with music before he said he shook his head i shall never play again     the angel explores the village  xxiv   very unwisely as i think the vicar allowed the angel to go down into the village by himself to enlarge his ideas of humanity unwisely because how was he to imagine the reception the angel would receive not thoughtlessly i am afraid he had always carried himself with decorum in the village and the idea of a slow procession through the little street with all the inevitable curious remarks explanations pointings was too much for him the angel might do the strangest things the village was certain to think them peering faces whos he got now besides was it not his duty to prepare his sermon in good time the angel duly directed went down cheerfully by himselfstill innocent of most of the peculiarities of the human as distinguished from the angelic turn of mind  the angel walked slowly his white hands folded behind his hunched back his sweet face looking this way and that he peered curiously into the eyes of the people he met a little child picking a bunch of vetch and honeysuckle looked in his face and forthwith came and put them in his hand it was about the only kindness he had from a human being saving only the vicar and one other he heard mother gustick scolding that granddaughter of hers as he passed the door you brazen faggityou said mother gustick you trumpery baggage  the angel stopped startled at the strange sounds of mother gusticks voice put yer best cloes on and yer feather in yer at and off you goes to meet en fal lal and me at ome slaving for ye tis a fancy lady youll be wantin to be my gal a walkin touch and go with yer idleness and finery  the voice ceased abruptly and a great peace came upon the battered air most grotesque and strange said the angel still surveying this wonderful box of discords walking touch and go he did not know that mrs gustick had suddenly become aware of his existence and was scrutinizing his appearance through the windowblind abruptly the door flew open and she stared out into the angels face a strange apparition grey and dusty hair and the dirty pink dress unhooked to show the stringy throat a discoloured gargoyle presently to begin spouting incomprehensible abuse  now then mister began mrs gustick have ye nothin better to do than listen at peoples doors for what you can pick up  the angel stared at her in astonishment  dyear said mrs gustick evidently very angry indeed listenin  have you any objection to my hearing  object to my hearing course i have whad yer think you aint such a ninny  but if ye didnt want me to hear why did you cry out so loud i thought  you thought softiethats what you are you silly girt staring gaby what dont know any better than to come holding yer girt mouth wide open for all that you can catch holt on and then off up there to tell you great fatfaced talebearin sillybilly id be ashamed to come poking and peering round quiet peoples houses  the angel was surprised to find that some inexplicable quality in her voice excited the most disagreeable sensations in him and a strong desire to withdraw but resisting this he stood listening politely as the custom is in the angelic land so long as anyone is speaking the entire eruption was beyond his comprehension he could not perceive any reason for the sudden projection of this vituperative head out of infinity so to speak and questions without a break for an answer were outside his experience altogether  mrs gustick proceeded with her characteristic fluency assured him he was no gentleman enquired if he called himself one remarked that every tramp did as much nowadays compared him to a stuck pig marvelled at his impudence asked him if he wasnt ashamed of himself standing there enquired if he was rooted to the ground was curious to be told what he meant by it wanted to know whether he robbed a scarecrow for his clothes suggested that an abnormal vanity prompted his behaviour enquired if his mother knew he was out and finally remarking i got somethinll move you my gentleman disappeared with a ferocious slamming of the door  the interval struck the angel as singularly peaceful his whirling mind had time to analyse his sensations he ceased bowing and smiling and stood merely astonished  this is a curious painful feeling said the angel almost worse than hungry and quite different when one is hungry one wants to eat i suppose she was a woman here one wants to get away i suppose i might just as well go  he turned slowly and went down the road meditating he heard the cottage door reopen and turning his head saw through intervening scarlet runners mrs gustick with a steaming saucepan full of boiling cabbage water in her hand  tis well you went mister stolen breeches came the voice of mrs gustick floating down through the vermilion blossoms dont you come peeping and prying round this yer cottage again or ill learn ye manners i will  the angel stood in a state of considerable perplexity he had no desire to come within earshot of the cottage againever he did not understand the precise import of the black pot but his general impression was entirely disagreeable there was no explaining it  i mean it said mrs gustick crescendo drat iti mean it  the angel turned and went on a dazzled look in his eyes  she was very grotesque said the angel very much more than the little man in black and she means it but what she means i dont know he became silent i suppose they all mean something he said presently still perplexed     xxv   then the angel came in sight of the forge where sandy brights brother was shoeing a horse for the carter from upmorton two hobbledehoys were standing by the forge staring in a bovine way at the proceedings as the angel approached these two and then the carter turned slowly through an angle of thirty degrees and watched his approach staring quietly and steadily at him the expression on their faces was one of abstract interest  the angel became selfconscious for the first time in his life he drew nearer trying to maintain an amiable expression on his face an expression that beat in vain against their granitic stare his hands were behind him he smiled pleasantly looking curiously at the to him incomprehensible employment of the smith but the battery of eyes seemed to angle for his regard trying to meet the three pairs at once the angel lost his alertness and stumbled over a stone one of the yokels gave a sarcastic cough and was immediately covered with confusion at the angels enquiring gaze nudging his companion with his elbow to cover his disorder none spoke and the angel did not speak  so soon as the angel had passed one of the three hummed this tune in an aggressive tone  illustration music  then all three of them laughed one tried to sing something and found his throat contained phlegm the angel proceeded on his way  whos e then said the second hobbledehoy  ping ping ping went the blacksmiths hammer  spose hes one of these here foweners said the carter from upmorton däamned silly fool he do look to be sure  tas the way with them foweners said the first hobbledehoy sagely  got something very like the ump said the carter from upmorton däääämned if e ent  then the silence healed again and they resumed their quiet expressionless consideration of the angels retreating figure  very like the ump et is said the carter after an enormous pause     xxvi   the angel went on through the village finding it all wonderful enough they begin and just a little while and then they end he said to himself in a puzzled voice but what are they doing meanwhile once he heard some invisible mouth chant inaudible words to the tune the man at the forge had hummed  thats the poor creature the vicar shot with that great gun of his said sarah glue of 1 church cottages peering over the blind  he looks frenchified said susan hopper peering through the interstices of that convenient veil on curiosity  he has sweet eyes said sarah glue who had met them for a moment  the angel sauntered on the postman passed him and touched his hat to him further down was a dog asleep in the sun he went on and saw mendham who nodded distantly and hurried past the curate did not care to be seen talking to an angel in the village until more was known about him there came from one of the houses the sound of a child screaming in a passion that brought a puzzled look to the angelic face then the angel reached the bridge below the last of the houses and stood leaning over the parapet watching the glittering little cascade from the mill  they begin and just a little while and then they end said the weir from the mill the water raced under the bridge green and dark and streaked with foam  beyond the mill rose the square tower of the church with the churchyard behind it a spray of tombstones and wooden headboards splashed up the hillside a half dozen of beech trees framed the picture  then the angel heard a shuffling of feet and the gride of wheels behind him and turning his head saw a man dressed in dirty brown rags and a felt hat grey with dust who was standing with a slight swaying motion and fixedly regarding the angelic back beyond him was another almost equally dirty pushing a knife grinders barrow over the bridge  mornin said the first person smiling weakly goomorn he arrested an escaping hiccough  the angel stared at him he had never seen a really fatuous smile before who are you said the angel  the fatuous smile faded no your business whoaaam wishergoomorn  carm on said the man with the grindstone passing on his way  wishergoomorn said the dirty man in a tone of extreme aggravation carncher answerme  carm on you fool said the man with the grindstonereceding  i dont understand said the angel  donunderstan siml enough wishergoomorn willyanswerme wontchr gemwishergem goomorn cusom answer goomorn no gem haverteachyer  the angel was puzzled the drunken man stood swaying for a moment then he made an unsteady snatch at his hat and threw it down at the angels feet ver well he said as one who decides great issues  carm on said the voice of the man with the grindstonestopping perhaps twenty yards off  you wan fight you  the angel failed to catch the word ill show yer not answer gems goomorn  he began to struggle with his jacket think im drun he said i show yer the man with the grindstone sat down on the shaft to watch carm on he said the jacket was intricate and the drunken man began to struggle about the road in his attempts to extricate himself breathing threatenings and slaughter slowly the angel began to suspect remotely enough that these demonstrations were hostile mur wun know yer when i done wi yer said the drunken man coat almost over his head  at last the garment lay on the ground and through the frequent interstices of his reminiscences of a waistcoat the drunken tinker displayed a fine hairy and muscular body to the angels observant eyes he squared up in masterly fashion  take the paint off yer he remarked advancing and receding fists up and elbows out  carm on floated down the road  the angels attention was concentrated on two huge hairy black fists that swayed and advanced and retreated come on dyer say ill show yer said the gentleman in rags and then with extraordinary ferocity my crikey ill show yer  suddenly he lurched forward and with a newborn instinct and raising a defensive arm as he did so the angel stepped aside to avoid him the fist missed the angelic shoulder by a hairsbreadth and the tinker collapsed in a heap with his face against the parapet of the bridge the angel hesitated over the writhing dusty heap of blasphemy for a moment and then turned towards the mans companion up the road lemmeget up said the man on the bridge lemmeget up you swine ill show yer  a strange disgust a quivering repulsion came upon the angel he walked slowly away from the drunkard towards the man with the grindstone  what does it all mean said the angel i dont understand it  dam fool says its is silver weddin answered the man with the grindstone evidently much annoyed and then in a tone of growing impatience he called down the road once more carm on  silver wedding said the angel what is a silver wedding  jest is rot said the man on the barrow but es always avin some scuse like that fair sickenin it is lars week it wus is bloomin birthday and then e adnt ardly got sober orf a comlimentary drunk to my noo barrer carm on you fool  but i dont understand said the angel why does he sway about so why does he keep on trying to pick up his hat like thatand missing it  why said the tinker well this is a blasted innocent country why because es blind wot else carm ondam yer because es just as full as e can old thats why  the angel noticing the tone of the second tinkers voice judged it wiser not to question him further but he stood by the grindstone and continued to watch the mysterious evolutions on the bridge  carm on i shall ave to go and pick up that at i suppose es always at it i neer ad such a blooming pard before always at it e is  the man with the barrow meditated taint as if e was a gentleman and adnt no livin to get an es such a reckless fool when e gets a bit on goes offerin out everyone e meets there you go im blessed if e didnt offer out a ole bloomin salvation army no judgment in it oh carm on carm on ave to go and pick this bloomin at up now i spose e dont care wot trouble e gives  the angel watched the second tinker walk back and with affectionate blasphemy assist the first to his hat and his coat then he turned absolutely mystified towards the village again     xxvii   after that incident the angel walked along past the mill and round behind the church to examine the tombstones  this seems to be the place where they put the broken pieces said the angelreading the inscriptions curious wordrelict resurgam then they are not done with quite what a huge pile it requires to keep her down it is spirited of her  hawkins said the angel softly hawkins the name is strange to me he did not die then it is plain enoughjoined the angelic hosts may 17 1863 he must have felt as much out of place as i do down here but i wonder why they put that little pot thing on the top of this monument curious there are several others aboutlittle stone pots with a rag of stiff stone drapery over them  just then the boys came pouring out of the national school and first one and then several stopped agape at the angels crooked black figure among the white tombs ent e gart a bääk on en remarked one critic  es got air like a girl said another  the angel turned towards them he was struck by the queer little heads sticking up over the lichenous wall he smiled faintly at their staring faces and then turned to marvel at the iron railings that enclosed the fitzjarvis tomb a queer air of uncertainty he said slabs piles of stone these railings are they afraid do these dead ever try and get up again theres an air of repressionfortification  gét yer air cut gét yer air cut sang three little boys together  curious these human beings are said the angel that man yesterday wanted to cut off my wings now these little creatures want me to cut off my hair and the man on the bridge offered to take the paint off me they will leave nothing of me soon  where did you get that at sang another little boy where did you get them cloes  they ask questions that they evidently do not want answered said the angel i can tell from the tone he looked thoughtfully at the little boys i dont understand the methods of human intercourse these are probably friendly advances a kind of ritual but i dont know the responses i think i will go back to the little fat man in black with the gold chain across his stomach and ask him to explain it is difficult  he turned towards the lych gate oh said one of the little boys in a shrill falsetto and threw a beechnut husk it came bounding across the churchyard path the angel stopped in surprise  this made all the little boys laugh a second imitating the first said oh and hit the angel his astonishment was really delicious they all began crying oh and throwing beechnut husks one hit the angels hand another stung him smartly by the ear the angel made ungainly movements towards them he spluttered some expostulation and made for the roadway the little boys were amazed and shocked at his discomfiture and cowardice such sawney behaviour could not be encouraged the pelting grew vigorously you may perhaps be able to imagine those vivid moments daring small boys running in close and delivering shots milder small boys rushing round behind with flying discharges milton screevers mongrel dog was roused to yelping ecstacy at the sight and danced full of wild imaginings nearer and nearer to the angelic legs  hi hi said a vigorous voice i never did wheres mr jarvis manners manners you young rascals  the youngsters scattered right and left some over the wall into the playground some down the street  frightful pest these boys are getting said crump coming up im sorry they have been annoying you  the angel seemed quite upset i dont understand he said these human ways  yes of course unusual to you hows your excrescence  my what said the angel  bifid limb you know how is it now youre down this way come in come in and let me have a look at it again you young roughs and meanwhile these little louts of ours will be getting off home theyre all alike in these villages cant understand anything abnormal see an oddlooking stranger chuck a stone no imagination beyond the parish ill give you physic if i catch you annoying strangers again  i suppose its what one might expect come along this way  so the angel horribly perplexed still was hurried into the surgery to have his wound redressed     lady hammergallows view  xxviii   in siddermorton park is siddermorton house where old lady hammergallow lives chiefly upon burgundy and the little scandals of the village a dear old lady with a ropy neck a ruddled countenance and spasmodic gusts of odd temper whose three remedies for all human trouble among her dependents are a bottle of gin a pair of charity blankets or a new crown piece the house is a mileandahalf out of siddermorton almost all the village is hers saving a fringe to the south which belongs to sir john gotch and she rules it with an autocratic rule refreshing in these days of divided government she orders and forbids marriages drives objectionable people out of the village by the simple expedient of raising their rent dismisses labourers obliges heretics to go to church and made susan dangett who wanted to call her little girl euphemia have the infant christened maryanne she is a sturdy broad protestant and disapproves of the vicars going bald like a tonsure she is on the village council which obsequiously trudges up the hill and over the moor to her and as she is a trifle deaf speaks all its speeches into her speaking trumpet instead of a rostrum she takes no interest now in politics but until last year she was an active enemy of that gladstone she has parlour maids instead of footmen to do her waiting because of hockley the american stockbroker and his four titans in plush  she exercises what is almost a fascination upon the village if in the barparlour of the cat and cornucopia you swear by god no one would be shocked but if you swore by lady hammergallow they would probably be shocked enough to turn you out of the room when she drives through siddermorton she always calls upon bessy flump the postmistress to hear all that has happened and then upon miss finch the dressmaker to check back bessy flump sometimes she calls upon the vicar sometimes upon mrs mendham whom she snubs and even sometimes on crump her sparkling pair of greys almost ran over the angel as he was walking down to the village  so thats the genius said lady hammergallow and turned and looked at him through the gilt glasses on a stick that she always carried in her shrivelled and shaky hand lunatic indeed the poor creature has rather a pretty face im sorry ive missed him  but she went on to the vicarage nevertheless and demanded news of it all the conflicting accounts of miss flump miss finch mrs mendham crump and mrs jehoram had puzzled her immensely the vicar hard pressed did all he could to say into her speaking trumpet what had really happened he toned down the wings and the saffron robe but he felt the case was hopeless he spoke of his protégé as mr angel he addressed pathetic asides to the kingfisher the old lady noticed his confusion her queer old head went jerking backwards and forwards now the speaking trumpet in his face when he had nothing to say then the shrunken eyes peering at him oblivious of the explanation that was coming from his lips a great many ohs and ahs she caught some fragments certainly  you have asked him to stop with youindefinitely said lady hammergallow with a great idea taking shape rapidly in her mind  i didperhaps inadvertentlymake such  and you dont know where he comes from  not at all  nor who his father is i suppose said lady hammergallow mysteriously  no said the vicar  now said lady hammergallow archly and keeping her glasses to her eye she suddenly dug at his ribs with her trumpet  my dear lady hammergallow  i thought so dont think i would blame you mr hilyer she gave a corrupt laugh that she delighted in the world is the world and men are men and the poor boys a cripple eh a kind of judgment in mourning i noticed it reminds me of the scarlet letter the mothers dead i suppose its just as well reallyim not a narrow womani respect you for having him really i do  but lady hammergallow  dont spoil everything by denying it it is so very very plain to a woman of the world that mrs mendham she amuses me with her suspicions such odd ideas in a curates wife but i hope it didnt happen when you were in orders  lady hammergallow i protest upon my word  mr hilyer i protest i know not anything you can say will alter my opinion one jot dont try i never suspected you were nearly such an interesting man  but this suspicion is unendurable  we will help him together mr hilyer you may rely upon me it is most romantic she beamed benevolence  but lady hammergallow i must speak  she gripped her eartrumpet resolutely and held it before her and shook her head  he has quite a genius for music vicar so i hear  i can assure you most solemnly  i thought so and being a cripple  you are under a most cruel  i thought that if his gift is really what that jehoram woman says  an unjustifiable suspicion that ever a man  i dont think much of her judgment of course  consider my position have i gained no character  it might be possible to do something for him as a performer  have ibother its no good  and so dear vicar i propose to give him an opportunity of showing us what he can do i have been thinking it all over as i drove here on tuesday next i will invite just a few people of taste and he shall bring his violin eigh and if that goes well i will see if i can get some introductions and really push him  but lady lady hammergallow  not another word said lady hammergallow still resolutely holding her speaking trumpet before her and clutching her eyeglasses i really must not leave those horses cutler is so annoyed if i keep them too long he finds waiting tedious poor man unless there is a publichouse near she made for the door  damn said the vicar under his breath he had never used the word since he had taken orders it shows you how an angels visit may disorganize a man  he stood under the verandah watching the carriage drive away the world seemed coming to pieces about him had he lived a virtuous celibate life for thirty odd years in vain the things of which these people thought him capable he stood and stared at the green cornfield opposite and down at the straggling village it seemed real enough and yet for the first time in his life there was a queer doubt of its reality he rubbed his chin then turned and went slowly upstairs to his dressingroom and sat for a long time staring at a garment of some yellow texture know his father he said and he is immortal and was fluttering about his heaven when my ancestors were marsupials i wish he was there now  he got up and began to feel the robe  i wonder how they get such things said the vicar then he went and stared out of the window i suppose everything is wonderful even the rising and setting of the sun i suppose there is no adamantine ground for any belief but one gets into a regular way of taking things this disturbs it i seem to be waking up to the invisible it is the strangest of uncertainties i have not felt so stirred and unsettled since my adolescence     further adventures of the angel in the village  xxix   thats all right said crump when the bandaging was replaced its a trick of memory no doubt but these excrescences of yours dont seem nearly so large as they did yesterday i suppose they struck me rather forcibly stop and have lunch with me now youre down here midday meal you know the youngsters will be swallowed up by school again in the afternoon  i never saw anything heal so well in my life he said as they walked into the diningroom your blood and flesh must be as clean and free from bacteria as they make em whatever stuff there is in your head he added sotto voce  at lunch he watched the angel narrowly and talked to draw him out  journey tire you yesterday he said suddenly  journey said the angel oh my wings felt a little stiff  not to be had said crump to himself suppose i must enter into it  so you flew all the way eigh no conveyance  there wasnt any way explained the angel taking mustard i was flying up a symphony with some griffins and fiery cherubim and suddenly everything went dark and i was in this world of yours  dear me said crump and thats why you havent any luggage he drew his serviette across his mouth and a smile flickered in his eyes  i suppose you know this world of ours pretty well watching us over the adamantine walls and all that kind of thing eigh  not very well we dream of it sometimes in the moonlight when the nightmares have fanned us to sleep with their wings  ah yesof course said crump very poetical way of putting it wont you take some burgundy its just beside you  theres a persuasion in this world you know that angels visits are by no means infrequent perhaps some of yourfriends have travelled they are supposed to come down to deserving persons in prisons and do refined nautches and that kind of thing faust business you know  ive never heard of anything of the kind said the angel  only the other day a lady whose baby was my patient for the time beingindigestionassured me that certain facial contortions the little creature made indicated that it was dreaming of angels in the novels of mrs henry wood that is spoken of as an infallible symptom of an early departure i suppose you cant throw any light on that obscure pathological manifestation  i dont understand it at all said the angel puzzled and not clearly apprehending the doctors drift  getting huffy said crump to himself sees im poking fun at him theres one thing im curious about do the new arrivals complain much about their medical attendants ive always fancied there must be a good deal of hydropathic talk just at first i was looking at that picture in the academy only this june  new arrivals said the angel i really dont follow you  the doctor stared dont they come  come said the angel who  the people who die here  after theyve gone to pieces here  thats the general belief you know  people like the woman who screamed out of the door and the blackfaced man and his volutations and the horrible little things that threw huskscertainly not i never saw such creatures before i fell into this world  oh but come said the doctor youll tell me next your official robes are not white and that you cant play the harp  theres no such thing as white in the angelic land said the angel its that queer blank colour you get by mixing up all the others  why my dear sir said the doctor suddenly altering his tone you positively know nothing about the land you come from whites the very essence of it  the angel stared at him was the man jesting he looked perfectly serious  look here said crump and getting up he went to the sideboard on which a copy of the parish magazine was lying he brought it round to the angel and opened it at the coloured supplement heres some real angels he said you see its not simply the wings make the angel white you see with a curly whisp of robe sailing up into the sky with their wings furled those are angels on the best authority hydroxyl kind of hair one has a bit of a harp you see and the other is helping this wingless ladykind of larval angel you knowupward  oh but really said the angel those are not angels at all  but they are said crump putting the magazine back on the sideboard and resuming his seat with an air of intense satisfaction i can assure you i have the best authority  i can assure you  crump tucked in the corners of his mouth and shook his head from side to side even as he had done to the vicar no good he said cant alter our ideas just because an irresponsible visitor  if these are angels said the angel then i have never been in the angelic land  precisely said crump ineffably selfsatisfied that was just what i was getting at  the angel stared at him for a minute roundeyed and then was seized for the second time by the human disorder of laughter  ha ha ha said crump joining in i thought you were not quite so mad as you seemed ha ha ha  and for the rest of the lunch they were both very merry for entirely different reasons and crump insisted upon treating the angel as a dorg of the highest degree     xxx   after the angel had left crumps house he went up the hill again towards the vicarage butpossibly moved by the desire to avoid mrs gustickhe turned aside at the stile and made a detour by the larks field and bradleys farm  he came upon the respectable tramp slumbering peacefully among the wildflowers he stopped to look struck by the celestial tranquillity of that individuals face and even as he did so the respectable tramp awoke with a start and sat up he was a pallid creature dressed in rusty black with a brokenspirited crush hat cocked over one eye good afternoon he said affably how are you  very well thank you said the angel who had mastered the phrase  the respectable tramp eyed the angel critically padding the hoof matey he said like me  the angel was puzzled by him why asked the angel do you sleep like this instead of sleeping up in the air on a bed  well im blowed said the respectable tramp why dont i sleep in a bed well its like this sandringhams got the painters in theres the drains up in windsor castle and i avent no other ouse to go to you avent the price of a arf pint in your pocket ave yer  i have nothing in my pocket said the angel  is this here village called siddermorton said the tramp rising creakily to his feet and pointing to the clustering roofs down the hill  yes said the angel they call it siddermorton  i know it i know it said the tramp and a very pretty little village it is too he stretched and yawned and stood regarding the place ouses he said reflectively projucewaving his hand at the cornfields and orchards looks cosy dont it  it has a quaint beauty of its own said the angel  it as a quaint beauty of its ownyes lord id like to sack the blooming place i was born there  dear me said the angel  yes i was born there ever heard of a pithed frog  pithed frog said the angel no  its a thing these here vivisectionists do they takes a frog and they cuts out his brains and they shoves a bit of pith in the place of em thats a pithed frog wellthat there village is full of pithed human beings  the angel took it quite seriously is that so he said  thats soyou take my word for it everyone of them as ad their brains cut out and chunks of rotten touchwood put in the place of it and you see that little red place there  thats called the national school said the angel  yesthats where they piths em said the tramp quite in love with his conceit  really thats very interesting  it stands to reason said the tramp if they ad brains theyd ave ideas and if they ad ideas theyd think for themselves and you can go through that village from end to end and never meet anybody doing as much pithed human beings they are i know that village i was born there and i might be there now a toilin for my betters if i adnt struck against the pithin  is it a painful operation asked the angel  in parts though it aint the heads gets hurt and it lasts a long time they take em young into that school and they says to them come in ere and well improve your minds they says and in the little kiddies go as good as gold and they begins shovin it into them bit by bit and ard and dry shovin out the nice juicy brains dates and lists and things out they comes no brains in their eads and wound up nice and tight ready to touch their ats to anyone who looks at them why one touched is at to me yesterday and they runs about spry and does all the dirty work and feels thankful theyre allowed to live they take a positive pride in ard work for its own sake arter they bin pithed see that chap ploughin  yes said the angel is he pithed  rather else hed be paddin the hoof this pleasant weatherlike me and the blessed apostles  i begin to understand said the angel rather dubiously  i knew you would said the philosophical tramp i thought you was the right sort but speaking serious aint it ridiculouscenturies and centuries of civilization and look at that poor swine there sweatin isself empty and trudging up that illside es english e is e belongs to the top race in creation e does es one of the rulers of indjer its enough to make a nigger laugh the flag thats braved a thousand years the battle an the breezethats is flag there never was a country was as great and glorious as this never and thats wot it makes of us ill tell you a little story about them parts as you seems to be a bit of a stranger theres a chap called gotch sir john gotch they calls im and when e was a young gent from oxford i was a little chap of eight and my sister was a girl of seventeen their servant she was but lord everybodys eard that storyits common enough of im or the likes of im  i havent said the angel  all thats pretty and lively of the gals they chucks into the gutters and all the men with a pennorth of spunk or adventure all who wont drink what the curates wife sends em instead of beer and touch their hats promiscous and leave the rabbits and birds alone for their betters gets drove out of the villages as rough characters patriotism talk about improvin the race wots left aint fit to look a nigger in the face a chinaman ud be ashamed of em  but i dont understand said the angel i dont follow you  at that the philosophic tramp became more explicit and told the angel the simple story of sir john gotch and the kitchenmaid its scarcely necessary to repeat it you may understand that it left the angel puzzled it was full of words he did not understand for the only vehicle of emotion the tramp possessed was blasphemy yet though their tongues differed so he could still convey to the angel some of his own probably unfounded persuasion of the injustice and cruelty of life and of the utter detestableness of sir john gotch  the last the angel saw of him was his dusty black back receding down the lane towards iping hanger a pheasant appeared by the roadside and the philosophical tramp immediately caught up a stone and sent the bird clucking with a viciously accurate shot then he disappeared round the corner     mrs jehorams breadth of view  xxxi   i heard some one playing the fiddle in the vicarage as i came by said mrs jehoram taking her cup of tea from mrs mendham  the vicar plays said mrs mendham i have spoken to george about it but its no good i do not think a vicar should be allowed to do such things its so foreign but there he   i know dear said mrs jehoram but i heard the vicar once at the schoolroom i dont think this was the vicar it was quite clever some of it quite smart you know and new i was telling dear lady hammergallow this morning i fancy  the lunatic very likely these halfwitted people my dear i dont think i shall ever forget that dreadful encounter yesterday  nor i  my poor girls they are too shocked to say a word about it i was telling dear lady ham  quite proper of them it was dreadful dear for them  and now dear i want you to tell me franklydo you really believe that creature was a man  you should have heard the violin  i still more than half suspect jessie  mrs mendham leant forward as if to whisper  mrs jehoram helped herself to cake im sure no woman could play the violin quite like i heard it played this morning  of course if you say so that settles the matter said mrs mendham mrs jehoram was the autocratic authority in siddermorton upon all questions of art music and belleslettres her late husband had been a minor poet then mrs mendham added a judicial still  do you know said mrs jehoram im half inclined to believe the dear vicars story  how good of you jessie said mrs mendham  but really i dont think he could have had any one in the vicarage before that afternoon i feel sure we should have heard of it i dont see how a strange cat could come within four miles of siddermorton without the report coming round to us the people here gossip so  i always distrust the vicar said mrs mendham i know him  yes but the story is plausible if this mr angel were someone very clever and eccentric  he would have to be very eccentric to dress as he did there are degrees and limits dear  but kilts said mrs jehoram  are all very well in the highlands  mrs jehorams eyes had rested upon a black speck creeping slowly across a patch of yellowishgreen up the hill  there he goes said mrs jehoram rising across the cornfield im sure thats him i can see the hump unless its a man with a sack bless me minnie heres an opera glass how convenient for peeping at the vicarage yes its the man he is a man with such a sweet face  very unselfishly she allowed her hostess to share the opera glass for a minute there was a rustling silence  his dress said mrs mendham is quite respectable now  quite said mrs jehoram  pause  he looks cross  and his coat is dusty  he walks steadily enough said mrs mendham or one might think this hot weather  another pause  you see dear said mrs jehoram putting down the lorgnette what i was going to say was that possibly he might be a genius in disguise  if you can call next door to nothing a disguise  no doubt it was eccentric but ive seen children in little blouses not at all unlike him so many clever people are peculiar in their dress and manners a genius may steal a horse where a bankclerk may not look over the hedge very possibly hes quite well known and laughing at our arcadian simplicity and really it wasnt so improper as some of these new women bicycling costumes i saw one in one of the illustrated papers only a few days agothe new budget i thinkquite tights you know dear noi cling to the genius theory especially after the playing im sure the creature is original perhaps very amusing in fact i intend to ask the vicar to introduce me  my dear cried mrs mendham  im resolute said mrs jehoram  im afraid youre rash said mrs mendham geniuses and people of that kind are all very well in london but hereat the vicarage  we are going to educate the folks i love originality at any rate i mean to see him  take care you dont see too much of him said mrs mendham ive heard the fashion is quite changing i understand that some of the very best people have decided that genius is not to be encouraged any more these recent scandals  only in literature i can assure you dear in music  nothing you can say my dear said mrs mendham going off at a tangent will convince me that that persons costume was not extremely suggestive and improper     a trivial incident  xxxii   the angel came thoughtfully by the hedge across the field towards the vicarage the rays of the setting sun shone on his shoulders and touched the vicarage with gold and blazed like fire in all the windows by the gate bathed in the sunlight stood little delia the waiting maid she stood watching him under her hand it suddenly came into the angels mind that she at least was beautiful and not only beautiful but alive and warm  she opened the gate for him and stood aside she was sorry for him for her elder sister was a cripple he bowed to her as he would have done to any woman and for just one moment looked into her face she looked back at him and something leapt within her  the angel made an irresolute movement your eyes are very beautiful he said quietly with a remote wonder in his voice  oh sir she said starting back the angels expression changed to perplexity he went on up the pathway between the vicars flowerbeds and she stood with the gate held open in her hand staring after him just under the rosetwined verandah he turned and looked at her  she still stared at him for a moment and then with a queer gesture turned round with her back to him shutting the gate as she did so and seemed to be looking down the valley towards the church tower     the warp and the woof of things  xxxiii   at the dinner table the angel told the vicar the more striking of his days adventures  the strange thing said the angel is the readiness of you human beingsthe zest with which you inflict pain those boys pelting me this morning  seemed to enjoy it said the vicar i know  yet they dont like pain said the angel  no said the vicar they dont like it  then said the angel i saw some beautiful plants rising with a spike of leaves two this way and two that and when i caressed one it caused the most uncomfortable  stinging nettle said the vicar  at any rate a new sort of pain and another plant with a head like a coronet and richly decorated leaves spiked and jagged  a thistle possibly  and in your garden the beautiful sweetsmelling plant  the sweet briar said the vicar i remember  and that pink flower that sprang out of the box  out of the box said the vicar  last night said the angel that went climbing up the curtains flame  ohthe matches and the candles yes said the vicar  then the animals a dog today behaved most disagreeably and these boys and the way in which people speak everyone seems anxiouswilling at any rateto give this pain every one seems busy giving pain  or avoiding it said the vicar pushing his dinner away before him yesof course its fighting everywhere the whole living world is a battlefieldthe whole world we are driven by pain here how it lies on the surface this angel sees it in a day  but why does everyoneeverythingwant to give pain asked the angel  it is not so in the angelic land said the vicar  no said the angel why is it so here  the vicar wiped his lips with his napkin slowly it is so he said pain said he still more slowly is the warp and the woof of this life do you know he said after a pause it is almost impossible for me to imagine  a world without pain and yet as you played this morning  but this world is different it is the very reverse of an angelic world indeed a number of peopleexcellent religious peoplehave been so impressed by the universality of pain that they think after death things will be even worse for a great many of us it seems to me an excessive view but its a deep question almost beyond ones power of discussion  and incontinently the vicar plumped into an impromptu dissertation upon necessity how things were so because they were so how one had to do this and that even our food said the vicar what said the angel is not obtained without inflicting pain said the vicar  the angels face went so white that the vicar checked himself suddenly or he was just on the very verge of a concise explanation of the antecedents of a leg of lamb there was a pause  bythebye said the angel suddenly have you been pithed like the common people     the angels debut  xxxiv   when lady hammergallow made up her mind things happened as she resolved and though the vicar made a spasmodic protest she carried out her purpose and got audience angel and violin together at siddermorton house before the week was out a genius the vicar has discovered she said so with eminent foresight putting any possibility of blame for a failure on the vicars shoulders the dear vicar tells me she would say and proceed to marvellous anecdotes of the angels cleverness with his instrument but she was quite in love with her ideashe had always had a secret desire to play the patroness to obscure talent hitherto it had not turned out to be talent when it came to the test  it would be such a good thing for him she said his hair is long already and with that high colour he would be beautiful simply beautiful on a platform the vicars clothes fitting him so badly makes him look quite like a fashionable pianist already and the scandal of his birthnot told of course but whisperedwould bequite an inducementwhen he gets to london that is  the vicar had the most horrible sensations as the day approached he spent hours trying to explain the situation to the angel other hours trying to imagine what people would think still worse hours trying to anticipate the angels behaviour hitherto the angel had always played for his own satisfaction the vicar would startle him every now and then by rushing upon him with some new point of etiquette that had just occurred to him as for instance its very important where you put your hat you know dont put it on a chair whatever you do hold it until you get your tea you know and thenlet me seethen put it down somewhere you know the journey to siddermorton house was accomplished without misadventure but at the moment of introduction the vicar had a spasm of horrible misgivings he had forgotten to explain introductions the angels naïve amusement was evident but nothing very terrible happened  rummy looking greaser said mr rathbone slater who devoted considerable attention to costume wants grooming no manners grinned when he saw me shaking hands did it chic enough i thought  one trivial misadventure occurred when lady hammergallow welcomed the angel she looked at him through her glasses the apparent size of her eyes startled him his surprise and his quick attempt to peer over the brims was only too evident but the vicar had warned him of the ear trumpet  the angels incapacity to sit on anything but a music stool appeared to excite some interest among the ladies but led to no remarks they regarded it perhaps as the affectation of a budding professional he was remiss with the teacups and scattered the crumbs of his cake abroad you must remember he was quite an amateur at eating he crossed his legs he fumbled over the hat business after vainly trying to catch the vicars eye the eldest miss papaver tried to talk to him about continental watering places and cigarettes and formed a low opinion of his intelligence  the angel was surprised by the production of an easel and several books of music and a little unnerved at first by the sight of lady hammergallow sitting with her head on one side watching him with those magnified eyes through her gilt glasses  mrs jehoram came up to him before he began to play and asked him the name of the charming piece he was playing the other afternoon the angel said it had no name and mrs jehoram thought music ought never to have any names and wanted to know who it was by and when the angel told her he played it out of his head she said he must be quite a genius and looked open and indisputably fascinating admiration at him the curate from iping hanger who was professionally a kelt and who played the piano and talked colour and music with an air of racial superiority watched him jealously  the vicar who was presently captured and set down next to lady hammergallow kept an anxious eye ever angelward while she told him particulars of the incomes made by violinistsparticulars which for the most part she invented as she went along she had been a little ruffled by the incident of the glasses but had decided that it came within the limits of permissible originality  so figure to yourself the green saloon at siddermorton park an angel thinly disguised in clerical vestments and with a violin in his hands standing by the grand piano and a respectable gathering of quiet nice people nicely dressed grouped about the room anticipatory gabbleone hears scattered fragments of conversation  he is incog said the very eldest miss papaver to mrs pirbright isnt it quaint and delicious jessica jehoram says she saw him at vienna but she cant remember the name the vicar knows all about him but he is so close  how hot and uncomfortable the dear vicar is looking said mrs pirbright ive noticed it before when he sits next to lady hammergallow she simply will not respect his cloth she goes on  his tie is all askew said the very eldest miss papaver and his hair it really hardly looks as though he had brushed it all day  seems a foreign sort of chap affected all very well in a drawingroom said george harringay sitting apart with the younger miss pirbright but for my part give me a masculine man and a feminine woman what do you think  ohi think so too said the younger miss pirbright  guineas and guineas said lady hammergallow ive heard that some of them keep quite stylish establishments you would scarcely credit it  i love music mr angel i adore it it stirs something in me i can scarcely describe it said mrs jehoram who is it says that delicious antithesis life without music is brutality music without life is dear me perhaps you remember music without lifeits ruskin i think  im sorry that i do not said the angel i have read very few books  how charming of you said mrs jehoram i wish i didnt i sympathise with you profoundly i would do the same only we poor womeni suppose its originality we lack and down here one is driven to the most desperate proceedings  hes certainly very pretty but the ultimate test of a man is his strength said george harringay what do you think  ohi think so too said the younger miss pirbright  its the effeminate man who makes the masculine woman when the glory of a man is his hair whats a woman to do and when men go running about with beautiful hectic dabs  oh george you are so dreadfully satirical today said the younger miss pirbright im sure it isnt paint  im really not his guardian my dear lady hammergallow of course its very kind indeed of you to take such an interest  are you really going to improvise said mrs jehoram in a state of cooing delight  sssh said the curate from iping hanger  then the angel began to play looking straight before him as he did so thinking of the wonderful things of the angelic land and yet insensibly letting the sadness he was beginning to feel steal over the fantasia he was playing when he forgot his company the music was strange and sweet when the sense of his surroundings floated into his mind the music grew capricious and grotesque but so great was the hold of the angelic music upon the vicar that his anxieties fell from him at once so soon as the angel began to play mrs jehoram sat and looked rapt and sympathetic as hard as she could though the music was puzzling at times and tried to catch the angels eye he really had a wonderfully mobile face and the tenderest shades of expression and mrs jehoram was a judge george harringay looked bored until the younger miss pirbright who adored him put out her mousy little shoe to touch his manly boot and then he turned his face to catch the feminine delicacy of her coquettish eye and was comforted the very eldest miss papaver and mrs pirbright sat quite still and looked churchy for nearly four minutes  then said the eldest miss papaver in a whisper i always enjoy violin music so much and mrs pirbright answered we get so little nice music down here and miss papaver said he plays very nicely and mrs pirbright such a delicate touch and miss papaver does willie keep up his lessons and so to a whispered conversation  the curate from iping hanger sat he felt in full view of the company he had one hand curled round his ear and his eyes hard and staring fixedly at the pedestal of the hammergallow sèvres vase he supplied by the movements of his mouth a kind of critical guide to any of the company who were disposed to avail themselves of it it was a generous way he had his aspect was severely judicial tempered by starts of evident disapproval and guarded appreciation the vicar leaned back in his chair and stared at the angels face and was presently rapt away in a wonderful dream lady hammergallow with quick jerky movements of the head and a low but insistent rustling surveyed and tried to judge of the effect of the angelic playing mr rathboneslater stared very solemnly into his hat and looked very miserable and mrs rathboneslater made mental memoranda of mrs jehorams sleeves and the air about them all was heavy with exquisite musicfor all that had ears to hear  scarcely affected enough whispered lady hammergallow hoarsely suddenly poking the vicar in the ribs the vicar came out of dreamland suddenly eigh shouted the vicar startled coming up with a jump sssh said the curate from iping hanger and everyone looked shocked at the brutal insensibility of hilyer so unusual of the vicar said the very eldest miss papaver to do things like that the angel went on playing  the curate from iping hanger began making mesmeric movements with his index finger and as the thing proceeded mr rathboneslater got amazingly limp he solemnly turned his hat round and altered his view the vicar lapsed from an uneasy discomfort into dreamland again lady hammergallow rustled a great deal and presently found a way of making her chair creak and at last the thing came to an end lady hammergallow exclaimed delicious though she had never heard a note and began clapping her hands at that everyone clapped except mr rathboneslater who rapped his hat brim instead the curate from iping hanger clapped with a judicial air  so i said clap clap clap if you cannot cook the food my way clap clap clap you must go said mrs pirbright clapping vigorously this music is a delightful treat  it is i always revel in music said the very eldest miss papaver and did she improve after that  not a bit of it said mrs pirbright  the vicar woke up again and stared round the saloon did other people see these visions or were they confined to him alone surely they must all see  and have a wonderful command of their feelings it was incredible that such music should not affect them hes a trifle gauche said lady hammergallow jumping upon the vicars attention he neither bows nor smiles he must cultivate oddities like that every successful executant is more or less gauche  did you really make that up yourself said mrs jehoram sparkling her eyes at him as you went along really it is wonderful nothing less than wonderful  a little amateurish said the curate from iping hanger to mr rathboneslater a great gift undoubtedly but a certain lack of sustained training there were one or two little things  i would like to talk to him  his trousers look like concertinas said mr rathboneslater he ought to be told that its scarcely decent  can you do imitations mr angel said lady hammergallow  oh do do some imitations said mrs jehoram i adore imitations  it was a fantastic thing said the curate of iping hanger to the vicar of siddermorton waving his long indisputably musical hands as he spoke a little involved to my mind i have heard it before somewherei forget where he has genius undoubtedly but occasionally he isloose there is a certain deadly precision wanting there are years of discipline yet  i dont admire these complicated pieces of music said george harringay i have simple tastes im afraid there seems to me no tune in it theres nothing i like so much as simple music tune simplicity is the need of the age in my opinion we are so over subtle everything is farfetched home grown thoughts and home sweet home for me what do you think  oh i think soquite said the younger miss pirbright  well amy chattering to george as usual said mrs pirbright across the room  as usual ma said the younger miss pirbright glancing round with a bright smile at miss papaver and turning again so as not to lose the next utterance from george  i wonder if you and mr angel could manage a duet said lady hammergallow to the curate from iping hanger who was looking preternaturally gloomy  im sure i should be delighted said the curate from iping hanger brightening up  duets said the angel the two of us then he can play i understoodthe vicar told me  mr wilmerdings is an accomplished pianist interrupted the vicar  but the imitations said mrs jehoram who detested wilmerdings  imitations said the angel  a pig squeaking a cock crowing you know said mr rathboneslater and added lower best fun you can get out of a fiddlemy opinion  i really dont understand said the angel a pig crowing  you dont like imitations said mrs jehoram nor do ireally i accept the snub i think they degrade  perhaps afterwards mr angel will relent said lady hammergallow when mrs pirbright had explained the matter to her she could scarcely credit her eartrumpet when she asked for imitations she was accustomed to get imitations  mr wilmerdings had seated himself at the piano and had turned to a familiar pile of music in the recess what do you think of that barcarole thing of spohrs he said over his shoulder i suppose you know it the angel looked bewildered  he opened the folio before the angel  what an odd kind of book said the angel what do all those crazy dots mean at that the vicars blood ran cold  what dots said the curate  there said the angel with incriminating finger  oh come said the curate  there was one of those swift short silences that mean so much in a social gathering  then the eldest miss papaver turned upon the vicar does not mr angel play from ordinary musicfrom the ordinary notation  i have never heard said the vicar getting red now after the first shock of horror i have really never seen  the angel felt the situation was strained though what was straining it he could not understand he became aware of a doubtful an unfriendly look upon the faces that regarded him impossible he heard mrs pirbright say after that beautiful music the eldest miss papaver went to lady hammergallow at once and began to explain into her eartrumpet that mr angel did not wish to play with mr wilmerdings and alleged an ignorance of written music  he cannot play from notes said lady hammergallow in a voice of measured horror nonsense  notes said the angel perplexed are these notes  its carrying the joke too farsimply because he doesnt want to play with wilmerdings said mr rathboneslater to george harringay  there was an expectant pause the angel perceived he had to be ashamed of himself he was ashamed of himself  then said lady hammergallow throwing her head back and speaking with deliberate indignation as she rustled forward if you cannot play with mr wilmerdings i am afraid i cannot ask you to play again she made it sound like an ultimatum her glasses in her hand quivered violently with indignation the angel was now human enough to appreciate the fact that he was crushed  what is it said little lucy rustchuck in the further bay  hes refused to play with old wilmerdings said tommy rathboneslater what a lark the old girls purple she thinks heaps of that ass wilmerdings  perhaps mr wilmerdings you will favour us with that delicious polonaise of chopins said lady hammergallow everybody else was hushed the indignation of lady hammergallow inspired much the same silence as a coming earthquake or an eclipse mr wilmerdings perceived he would be doing a real social service to begin at once and be it entered to his credit now that his account draws near its settlement he did  if a man pretend to practise an art said george harringay he ought at least to have the conscience to study the elements of it what do you  oh i think so too said the younger miss pirbright  the vicar felt that the heavens had fallen he sat crumpled up in his chair a shattered man lady hammergallow sat down next to him without appearing to see him she was breathing heavily but her face was terribly calm everyone sat down was the angel grossly ignorant or only grossly impertinent the angel was vaguely aware of some frightful offence aware that in some mysterious way he had ceased to be the centre of the gathering he saw reproachful despair in the vicars eye he drifted slowly towards the window in the recess and sat down on the little octagonal moorish stool by the side of mrs jehoram and under the circumstances he appreciated at more than its proper value mrs jehorams kindly smile he put down the violin in the window seat     xxxv   mrs jehoram and the angel apartmr wilmerdings playing  i have so longed for a quiet word with you said mrs jehoram in a low tone to tell you how delightful i found your playing  i am glad it pleased you said the angel  pleased is scarcely the word said mrs jehoram i was movedprofoundly these others did not understand i was glad you did not play with him  the angel looked at the mechanism called wilmerdings and felt glad too the angelic conception of duets is a kind of conversation upon violins but he said nothing  i worship music said mrs jehoram i know nothing about it technically but there is something in ita longing a wish  the angel stared at her face she met his eyes  you understand she said i see you understand he was certainly a very nice boy sentimentally precocious perhaps and with deliciously liquid eyes  there was an interval of chopin op 40 played with immense precision  mrs jehoram had a sweet face still in shadow with the light falling round her golden hair and a curious theory flashed across the angels mind the perceptible powder only supported his view of something infinitely bright and lovable caught tarnished coarsened coated over  do you said the angel in a low tone are you  separated from  your world  as you are whispered mrs jehoram  this is socold said the angel so harsh he meant the whole world  i feel it too said mrs jehoram referring to siddermorton home  there are those who cannot live without sympathy she said after a sympathetic pause and times when one feels alone in the world fighting a battle against it all laughing flirting hiding the pain of it  and hoping said the angel with a wonderful glanceyes  mrs jehoram who was an epicure of flirtations felt the angel was more than redeeming the promise of his appearance indisputably he worshipped her do you look for sympathy she said or have you found it  i think said the angel very softly leaning forward i think i have found it  interval of chopin op 40 the very eldest miss papaver and mrs pirbright whispering lady hammergallow glasses up looking down the saloon with an unfriendly expression at the angel mrs jehoram and the angel exchanging deep and significant glances  her name said the angel mrs jehoram made a movement is delia she is  delia said mrs jehoram sharply slowly realising a terrible misunderstanding a fanciful name why no not that little housemaid at the vicarage  the polonaise terminated with a flourish the angel was quite surprised at the change in mrs jehorams expression  i never did said mrs jehoram recovering to make me your confidant in an intrigue with a servant really mr angel its possible to be too original  then suddenly their colloquy was interrupted     xxxvi   this section is so far as my memory goes the shortest in the book  but the enormity of the offence necessitates the separation of this section from all other sections  the vicar you must understand had done his best to inculcate the recognised differentiae of a gentleman never allow a lady to carry anything said the vicar say permit me and relieve her always stand until every lady is seated always rise and open a door for a lady and so forth all men who have elder sisters know that code  and the angel who had failed to relieve lady hammergallow of her teacup danced forward with astonishing dexterity leaving mrs jehoram in the window seat and with an elegant permit me rescued the teatray from lady hammergallows pretty parlourmaid and vanished officiously in front of her the vicar rose to his feet with an inarticulate cry     xxxvii   hes drunk said mr rathboneslater breaking a terrific silence thats the matter with him  mrs jehoram laughed hysterically  the vicar stood up motionless staring oh i forgot to explain servants to him said the vicar to himself in a swift outbreak of remorse i thought he did understand servants  really mr hilyer said lady hammergallow evidently exercising enormous selfcontrol and speaking in panting spasms really mr hilyeryour genius is too terrible i must i really must ask you to take him home  so to the dialogue in the corridor of alarmed maidservant and wellmeaning but shockingly gauche angelappears the vicar his botryoidal little face crimson gaunt despair in his eyes and his necktie under his left ear  come he saidstruggling with emotion come away i i am disgraced for ever  and the angel stared for a second at him and obeyedmeekly perceiving himself in the presence of unknown but evidently terrible forces  and so began and ended the angels social career  in the informal indignation meeting that followed lady hammergallow took the informal chair i feel humiliated she said the vicar assured me he was an exquisite player i never imagined  he was drunk said mr rathboneslater you could tell it from the way he fumbled with his tea  such a fiasco said mrs mergle  the vicar assured me said lady hammergallow the man i have staying with me is a musical genius he said his very words  his ears must be burning anyhow said tommy rathboneslater  i was trying to keep him quiet said mrs jehoram by humouring him and do you know the things he said to methere  the thing he played said mr wilmerdingsi must confess i did not like to charge him to his face but really it was merely drifting  just fooling with a fiddle eigh said george harringay well i thought it was beyond me so much of your fine music is  oh george said the younger miss pirbright  the vicar was a bit on tooto judge by his tie said mr rathboneslater its a dashed rummy go did you notice how he fussed after the genius  one has to be so very careful said the very eldest miss papaver  he told me he is in love with the vicars housemaid said mrs jehoram i almost laughed in his face  the vicar ought never to have brought him here said mrs rathboneslater with decision     the trouble of the barbed wire  xxxviii   so ingloriously ended the angels first and last appearance in society vicar and angel returned to the vicarage crestfallen black figures in the bright sunlight going dejectedly the angel deeply pained that the vicar was pained the vicar dishevelled and desperate intercalating spasmodic remorse and apprehension with broken explanations of the theory of etiquette they do not understand said the vicar over and over again they will all be so very much aggrieved i do not know what to say to them it is all so confused so perplexing and at the gate of the vicarage at the very spot where delia had first seemed beautiful stood horrocks the village constable awaiting them he held coiled up about his hand certain short lengths of barbed wire  good evening horrocks said the vicar as the constable held the gate open  evenin sir said horrocks and added in a kind of mysterious undertone could i speak to you a minute sir  certainly said the vicar the angel walked on thoughtfully to the house and meeting delia in the hall stopped her and crossexamined her at length over differences between servants and ladies  youll excuse my taking the liberty sir said horrocks but theres trouble brewin for that crippled gent you got stayin here  bless me said the vicar you dont say so  sir john gotch sir hes very angry indeed sir his language sir but i felt bound to tell you sir hes certain set on taking out a summons on account of that there barbed wire certain set sir he is  sir john gotch said the vicar wire i dont understand  he asked me to find out who did it course ive had to do my duty sir naturally a disagreeable one  barbed wire duty i dont understand you horrocks  im afraid sir theres no denying the evidence ive made careful enquiries sir and forthwith the constable began telling the vicar of a new and terrible outrage committed by the angelic visitor  but we need not follow that explanation in detailor the subsequent confession for my own part i think there is nothing more tedious than dialogue it gave the vicar a new view of the angelic character a vignette of the angelic indignation a shady lane sunmottled sweet hedges full of honeysuckle and vetch on either side and a little girl gathering flowers forgetful of the barbed wire which all along the sidderford road fenced in the dignity of sir john gotch from bounders and the detested million then suddenly a gashed hand a bitter outcry and the angel sympathetic comforting inquisitive explanations sobset and thenaltogether novel phenomenon in the angelic careerpassion a furious onslaught upon the barbed wire of sir john gotch barbed wire recklessly handled slashed bent and broken yet the angel acted without personal malicesaw in the thing only an ugly and vicious plant that trailed insidiously among its fellows finally the angels explanations gave the vicar a picture of the angel alone amidst his destruction trembling and amazed at the sudden force not himself that had sprung up within him and set him striking and cutting amazed too at the crimson blood that trickled down his fingers  it is still more horrible said the angel when the vicar explained the artificial nature of the thing if i had seen the man who put this sillycruel stuff there to hurt little children i know i should have tried to inflict pain upon him i have never felt like this before i am indeed becoming tainted and coloured altogether by the wickedness of this world  to think too that you men should be so foolish as to uphold the laws that let a man do such spiteful things yesi know you will say it has to be so for some remoter reason that is a thing that only makes me angrier why cannot an act rest on its own merits as it does in the angelic land  that was the incident the history of which the vicar now gradually learnt getting the bare outline from horrocks the colour and emotion subsequently from the angel the thing had happened the day before the musical festival at siddermorton house  have you told sir john who did it asked the vicar and are you sure  quite sure sir there can be no doubting it was your gentleman sir ive not told sir john yet sir but i shall have to tell sir john this evening meaning no offence to you sir as i hopes youll see its my duty sir besides which  of course said the vicar hastily certainly its your duty and what will sir john do  hes dreadful set against the person who did itdestroying property like thatand sort of slapping his arrangements in the face  pause horrocks made a movement the vicar tie almost at the back of his neck now a most unusual thing for him stared blankly at his toes  i thought id tell you sir said horrocks  yes said the vicar thanks horrocks thanks he scratched the back of his head you might perhaps  i think its the best way  quite sure mr angel did it  sherlock omes sir couldnt be cocksurer  then id better give you a little note to the squire     xxxix   the vicars tabletalk at dinner that night after the angel had stated his case was full of grim explanations prisons madness  its too late to tell the truth about you now said the vicar besides thats impossible i really do not know what to say we must face our circumstances i suppose i am so undecidedso torn its the two worlds if your angelic world were only a dream or if this world were only a dreamor if i could believe either or both dreams it would be all right with me but here is a real angel and a real summonshow to reconcile them i do not know i must talk to gotch but he wont understand nobody will understand  i am putting you to terrible inconvenience i am afraid my appalling unworldliness  its not you said the vicar its not you i perceive you have brought something strange and beautiful into my life its not you its myself if i had more faith either way if i could believe entirely in this world and call you an abnormal phenomenon as crump does but no terrestrial angelic angelic terrestrial seesaw  still gotch is certain to be disagreeable most disagreeable he always is it puts me into his hands he is a bad moral influence i know drinking gambling worse still one must render unto cæsar the things that are cæsars and he is against disestablishment  then the vicar would revert to the social collapse of the afternoon you are so very fundamental you know he saidseveral times  the angel went to his own room puzzled but very depressed every day the world had frowned darker upon him and his angelic ways he could see how the trouble affected the vicar yet he could not imagine how he could avert it it was all so strange and unreasonable twice again too he had been pelted out of the village  he found the violin lying on his bed where he had laid it before dinner and taking it up he began to play to comfort himself but now he played no delicious vision of the angelic land the iron of the world was entering into his soul for a week now he had known pain and rejection suspicion and hatred a strange new spirit of revolt was growing up in his heart he played a melody still sweet and tender as those of the angelic land but charged with a new note the note of human sorrow and effort now swelling into something like defiance dying now into a plaintive sadness he played softly playing to himself to comfort himself but the vicar heard and all his finite bothers were swallowed up in a hazy melancholy a melancholy that was quite remote from sorrow and besides the vicar the angel had another hearer of whom neither angel nor vicar was thinking     delia  xl   she was only four or five yards away from the angel in the westward gable the diamondpaned window of her little white room was open she knelt on her box of japanned tin and rested her chin on her hands her elbows on the windowsill the young moon hung over the pine trees and its light cool and colourless lay softly upon the silentsleeping world its light fell upon her white face and discovered new depths in her dreaming eyes her soft lips fell apart and showed the little white teeth  delia was thinking vaguely wonderfully as girls will think it was feeling rather than thinking clouds of beautiful translucent emotion drove across the clear sky of her mind taking shape that changed and vanished she had all that wonderful emotional tenderness that subtle exquisite desire for selfsacrifice which exists so inexplicably in a girls heart exists it seems only to be presently trampled under foot by the grim and gross humours of daily life to be ploughed in again roughly and remorselessly as the farmer ploughs in the clover that has sprung up in the soil she had been looking out at the tranquillity of the moonlight long before the angel began to playwaiting then suddenly the quiet motionless beauty of silver and shadow was suffused with tender music  she did not move but her lips closed and her eyes grew even softer she had been thinking before of the strange glory that had suddenly flashed out about the stooping hunchback when he spoke to her in the sunset of that and of a dozen other glances chance turns even once the touching of her hand that afternoon he had spoken to her asking strange questions now the music seemed to bring his very face before her his look of half curious solicitude peering into her face into her eyes into her and through her deep down into her soul he seemed now to be speaking directly to her telling her of his solitude and trouble oh that regret that longing for he was in trouble and how could a servantgirl help him this softspoken gentleman who carried himself so kindly who played so sweetly the music was so sweet and keen it came so near to the thought of her heart that presently one hand tightened on the other and the tears came streaming down her face  as crump would tell you people do not do that kind of thing unless there is something wrong with the nervous system but then from the scientific point of view being in love is a pathological condition   i am painfully aware of the objectionable nature of my story here i have even thought of wilfully perverting the truth to propitiate the lady reader but i could not the story has been too much for me i do the thing with my eyes open delia must remain what she really wasa servant girl i know that to give a mere servant girl or at least an english servant girl the refined feelings of a human being to present her as speaking with anything but an intolerable confusion of aspirates places me outside the pale of respectable writers association with servants even in thought is dangerous in these days i can only plead pleading vainly i know that delia was a very exceptional servant girl possibly if one enquired it might be found that her parentage was upper middleclassthat she was made of the finer upper middleclass clay and this perhaps may avail me better i will promise that in some future work i will redress the balance and the patient reader shall have the recognised article enormous feet and hands systematic aspiration of vowels and elimination of aspirates no figure only middleclass girls have figuresthe thing is beyond a servantgirls means a fringe by agreement and a cheerful readiness to dispose of her selfrespect for halfacrown that is the accepted english servant the typical english woman when stripped of money and accomplishments as she appears in the works of contemporary writers but delia somehow was different i can only regret the circumstanceit was altogether beyond my control     doctor crump acts  xli   early the next morning the angel went down through the village and climbing the fence waded through the waisthigh reeds that fringe the sidder he was going to bandram bay to take a nearer view of the sea which one could just see on a clear day from the higher parts of siddermorton park and suddenly he came upon crump sitting on a log and smoking crump always smoked exactly two ounces per weekand he always smoked it in the open air  hullo said crump in his healthiest tone hows the wing  very well said the angel the pains gone  i suppose you know you are trespassing  trespassing said the angel  i suppose you dont know what that means said crump  i dont said the angel  i must congratulate you i dont know how long you will last but you are keeping it up remarkably well i thought at first you were a mattoid but youre so amazingly consistent your attitude of entire ignorance of the elementary facts of life is really a very amusing pose you make slips of course but very few but surely we two understand one another  he smiled at the angel you would beat sherlock holmes i wonder who you really are  the angel smiled back with eyebrows raised and hands extended its impossible for you to know who i am your eyes are blind your ears deaf your soul dark to all that is wonderful about me its no good my telling that i fell into your world  the doctor waved his pipe not that please i dont want to pry if you have your reasons for keeping quiet only i would like you to think of hilyers mental health he really believes this story  the angel shrugged his dwindling wings  you did not know him before this affair hes changed tremendously he used to be neat and comfortable for the last fortnight hes been hazy with a faraway look in his eyes he preached last sunday without his cuff links and something wrong with his tie and he took for his text eye hath not seen nor ear heard he really believes all this nonsense about the angelland the man is verging on monomania  you will see things from your own standpoint said the angel  everyone must at any rate i think it jolly regrettable to see this poor old fellow hypnotized as you certainly have hypnotized him i dont know where you come from nor who you are but i warn you im not going to see the old boy made a fool of much longer  but hes not being made a fool of hes simply beginning to dream of a world outside his knowledge  it wont do said crump im not one of the dupe class you are either of two thingsa lunatic at large which i dont believe or a knave nothing else is possible i think i know a little of this world whatever i do of yours very well if you dont leave hilyer alone i shall communicate with the police and either clap you into a prison if you go back on your story or into a madhouse if you dont its stretching a point but i swear id certify you insane tomorrow to get you out of the village its not only the vicar as you know i hope thats plain now what have you to say  with an affectation of great calm the doctor took out his penknife and began to dig the blade into his pipe bowl his pipe had gone out during this last speech  for a moment neither spoke the angel looked about him with a face that grew pale the doctor extracted a plug of tobacco from his pipe and flung it away shut his penknife and put it in his waistcoat pocket he had not meant to speak quite so emphatically but speech always warmed him  prison said the angel madhouse let me see then he remembered the vicars explanation not that he said he approached crump with eyes dilated and hands outstretched  i knew you would know what those things meantat any rate sit down said crump indicating the tree trunk beside him by a movement of the head  the angel shivering sat down on the tree trunk and stared at the doctor  crump was getting out his pouch you are a strange man said the angel your beliefs are likea steel trap  they are said crumpflattered  but i tell youi assure you the thing is soi know nothing or at least remember nothing of anything i knew of this world before i found myself in the darkness of night on the moorland above sidderford  where did you learn the language then  i dont know only i tell youbut i havent an atom of the sort of proof that would convince you  and you really said crump suddenly coming round upon him and looking into his eyes you really believe you were eternally in a kind of glorious heaven before then  i do said the angel  pshaw said crump and lit his pipe he sat smoking elbow on knee for some time and the angel sat and watched him then his face grew less troubled  it is just possible he said to himself rather than to the angel and began another piece of silence  you see he said when that was finished there is such a thing as double personality a man sometimes forgets who he is and thinks he is someone else leaves home friends and everything and leads a double life there was a case in nature only a month or so ago the man was sometimes english and righthanded and sometimes welsh and lefthanded when he was english he knew no welsh when he was welsh he knew no english hm  he turned suddenly on the angel and said home he fancied he might revive in the angel some latent memory of his lost youth he went on dadda pappa daddy mammy pappy father dad governor old boy mother dear mother ma mumsy no good what are you laughing at  nothing said the angel you surprised me a littlethat is all a week ago i should have been puzzled by that vocabulary  for a minute crump rebuked the angel silently out of the corner of his eye  you have such an ingenuous face you almost force me to believe you you are certainly not an ordinary lunatic your mindexcept for your isolation from the pastseems balanced enough i wish nordau or lombroso or some of these saltpetriere men could have a look at you down here one gets no practice worth speaking about in mental cases theres one idiotand hes just a damned idiot of an idiot all the rest are thoroughly sane people  possibly that accounts for their behaviour said the angel thoughtfully  but to consider your general position here said crump ignoring his comment i really regard you as a bad influence here these fancies are contagious it is not simply the vicar there is a man named shine has caught the fad and he has been in the drink for a week off and on and offering to fight anyone who says you are not an angel then a man over at sidderford is i hear affected with a kind of religious mania on the same tack these things spread there ought to be a quarantine in mischievous ideas and i have heard another story  but what can i do said the angel suppose i am quite unintentionally doing mischief  you can leave the village said crump  then i shall only go into another village  thats not my affair said crump go where you like only go leave these three people the vicar shine the little servant girl whose heads are all spinning with galaxies of angels  but said the angel face your world i tell you i cant and leave delia i dont understand i do not know how to set about getting work and food and shelter and i am growing afraid of human beings  fancies fancies said crump watching him mania  its no good my persisting in worrying you he said suddenly but certainly the situation is impossible as it stands he stood up with a jerk  goodmorning mrangel he said the long and the short of it isi say it as the medical adviser of this parishyou are an unhealthy influence we cant have you you must go  he turned and went striding through the grass towards the roadway leaving the angel sitting disconsolately on the tree trunk an unhealthy influence said the angel slowly staring blankly in front of him and trying to realise what it meant     sir john gotch acts  xlii   sir john gotch was a little man with scrubby hair a small thin nose sticking out of a face crackled with wrinkles tight brown gaiters and a riding whip ive come you see he said as mrs hinijer closed the door  thank you said the vicar im obliged to you im really obliged to you  glad to be of any service to you said sir john gotch angular attitude  this business said the vicar this unfortunate business of the barbed wireis really you know a most unfortunate business  sir john gotch became decidedly more angular in his attitude it is he said  this mr angel being my guest  no reason why he should cut my wire said sir john gotch briefly  none whatever  may i ask who this mr angel is asked sir john gotch with the abruptness of long premeditation  the vicars fingers jumped to his chin what was the good of talking to a man like sir john gotch about angels  to tell you the exact truth said the vicar there is a little secret  lady hammergallow told me as much  the vicars face suddenly became bright red  do you know said sir john with scarcely a pause hes been going about this village preaching socialism  good heavens said the vicar no  he has he has been buttonholing every yokel he came across and asking them why they had to work while wei and you you knowdid nothing he has been saying we ought to educate every man up to your level and mineout of the rates i suppose as usual he has been suggesting that wei and you you knowkeep these people downpith em  dear me said the vicar i had no idea  he has done this wirecutting as a demonstration i tell you as a socialistic demonstration if we dont come down on him pretty sharply i tell you we shall have the palings down in flinders lane next and the next thing will be ricks afire and every damned i beg your pardon vicar i know im too fond of that word every blessed pheasants egg in the parish smashed i know these  a socialist said the vicar quite put out i had no idea  you see why i am inclined to push matters against our gentleman though he is your guest it seems to me he has been taking advantage of your paternal  oh not paternal said the vicar really  i beg your pardon vicarit was a slip of your kindness to go mischiefmaking everywhere setting class against class and the poor man against his bread and butter  the vicars fingers were at his chin again  so theres one of two things said sir john gotch either that guest of yours leaves the parish ori take proceedings thats final  the vicars mouth was all askew  thats the position said sir john jumping to his feet if it were not for you i should take proceedings at once as it isam i to take proceedings or no  you see said the vicar in horrible perplexity  well  arrangements have to be made  hes a mischiefmaking idler i know the breed but ill give you a week  thank you said the vicar i understand your position i perceive the situation is getting intolerable  sorry to give you this bother of course said sir john  a week said the vicar  a week said sir john leaving   the vicar returned after accompanying gotch out and for a long time he remained sitting before the desk in his study plunged in thought a week he said after an immense silence here is an angel a glorious angel who has quickened my soul to beauty and delight who has opened my eyes to wonderland and something more than wonderland  and i have promised to get rid of him in a week what are we men made of how can i tell him  he began to walk up and down the room then he went into the diningroom and stood staring blankly out at the cornfield the table was already laid for lunch presently he turned still dreaming and almost mechanically helped himself to a glass of sherry     the sea cliff  xliii   the angel lay upon the summit of the cliff above bandram bay and stared out at the glittering sea sheer from under his elbows fell the cliff five hundred and seven feet of it down to the datum line and the seabirds eddied and soared below him the upper part of the cliff was a greenish chalky rock the lower twothirds a warm red marbled with gypsum bands and from halfadozen places spurted jets of water to fall in long cascades down its face the swell frothed white on the flinty beach and the water beyond where the shadows of an outstanding rock lay was green and purple in a thousand tints and marked with streaks and flakes of foam the air was full of sunlight and the tinkling of the little waterfalls and the slow soughing of the seas below now and then a butterfly flickered over the face of the cliff and a multitude of sea birds perched and flew hither and thither  the angel lay with his crippled shrivelled wings humped upon his back watching the gulls and jackdaws and rooks circling in the sunlight soaring eddying sweeping down to the water or upward into the dazzling blue of the sky long the angel lay there and watched them going to and fro on outspread wings he watched and as he watched them he remembered with infinite longing the rivers of starlight and the sweetness of the land from which he came and a gull came gliding overhead swiftly and easily with its broad wings spreading white and fair against the blue and suddenly a shadow came into the angels eyes the sunlight left them he thought of his own crippled pinions and put his face upon his arm and wept  a woman who was walking along the footpath across the cliff field saw only a twisted hunchback dressed in the vicar of siddermortons castoff clothes sprawling foolishly at the edge of the cliff and with his forehead on his arm she looked at him and looked again the silly creature has gone to sleep she said and though she had a heavy basket to carry came towards him with an idea of waking him up but as she drew near she saw his shoulders heave and heard the sound of his sobbing  she stood still a minute and her features twitched into a kind of grin then treading softly she turned and went back towards the pathway tis so hard to think of anything to say she said poor afflicted soul  presently the angel ceased sobbing and stared with a tearstained face at the beach below him  this world he said wraps me round and swallows me up my wings grow shrivelled and useless soon i shall be nothing more than a crippled man and i shall age and bow myself to pain and die i am miserable and i am alone  then he rested his chin on his hands upon the edge of the cliff and began to think of delias face with the light in her eyes the angel felt a curious desire to go to her and tell her of his withered wings to place his arms about her and weep for the land he had lost delia he said to himself very softly and presently a cloud drove in front of the sun     mrs hinijer acts  xliv   mrs hinijer surprised the vicar by tapping at his study door after tea begging your pardon sir said mrs hinijer but might i make so bold as to speak to you for a moment  certainly mrs hinijer said the vicar little dreaming of the blow that was coming he held a letter in his hand a very strange and disagreeable letter from his bishop a letter that irritated and distressed him criticising in the strongest language the guests he chose to entertain in his own house only a popular bishop living in a democratic age a bishop who was still half a pedagogue could have written such a letter  mrs hinijer coughed behind her hand and struggled with some respiratory disorganisation the vicar felt apprehensive usually in their interviews he was the most disconcerted invariably so when the interview ended  well he said  may i make so bold sir as to arst when mr angel is agoing cough  the vicar started to ask when mr angel is going he repeated slowly to gain time another  im sorry sir but ive been used to waitin on gentlefolks sir and youd hardly imagine how it feels quite to wait on such as im  such as  im do i understand you mrs hinijer that you dont like mr angel  you see sir before i came to you sir i was at lord dundollers seventeen years and you sirif you will excuse meare a perfect gentleman yourself sirthough in the church and then  dear dear said the vicar and dont you regard mr angel as a gentleman  im sorry to ave to say it sir  but what dear me surely  im sorry to ave to say it sir but when a party goes turning vegetarian suddenly and putting out all the cooking and hasnt no proper luggage of his own and borrys shirts and socks from his ost and dont know no better than to try his knife at peas as i seed my very self and goes talking in odd corners to the housemaids and folds up his napkin after meals and eats with his fingers at minced veal and plays the fiddle in the middle of the night keeping everybody awake and stares and grins at his elders agetting upstairs and generally misconducts himself with things that i can scarcely tell you all one cant help thinking sir thought is free sir and one cant help coming to ones own conclusions besides which there is talk all over the village about himwhat with one thing and another i know a gentleman when i sees a gentleman and i know a gentleman when i dont see a gentleman and me and susan and george weve talked it over being the upper servants so to speak and experienced and leaving out that girl delia who i only hope wont come to any harm through him and depend upon it sir that mr angel aint what you think he is sir and the sooner he leaves this house the better  mrs hinijer ceased abruptly and stood panting but stern and with her eyes grimly fixed on the vicars face  really mrs hinijer said the vicar and then oh lord  what have i done said the vicar suddenly starting up and appealing to the inexorable fates what have i done  theres no knowing said mrs hinijer though a deal of talk in the village  bother said the vicar going and staring out of the window then he turned look here mrs hinijer mr angel will be leaving this house in the course of a week is that enough  quite said mrs hinijer and i feel sure sir  the vicars eyes fell with unwonted eloquence upon the door     the angel in trouble  xlv   the fact is said the vicar this is no world for angels  the blinds had not been drawn and the twilight outer world under an overcast sky seemed unspeakably grey and cold the angel sat at table in dejected silence his inevitable departure had been proclaimed since his presence hurt people and made the vicar wretched he acquiesced in the justice of the decision but what would happen to him after his plunge he could not imagine something very disagreeable certainly  there is the violin said the vicar only after our experience  i must get you clothesa general outfit dear me you dont understand railway travelling and coinage taking lodgings eatinghouses i must come up at least and see you settled get work for you but an angel in london working for his living that grey cold wilderness of people what will become of you if i had one friend in the world i could trust to believe me  i ought not to be sending you away  do not trouble overmuch for me my friend said the angel at least this life of yours ends and there are things in it there is something in this life of yours your care for me i thought there was nothing beautiful at all in life  and i have betrayed you said the vicar with a sudden wave of remorse why did i not face them allsay this is the best of life what do these everyday things matter  he stopped suddenly what do they matter he said  i have only come into your life to trouble it said the angel  dont say that said the vicar you have come into my life to awaken me i have been dreamingdreaming dreaming this was necessary and that dreaming that this narrow prison was the world and the dream still hangs about me and troubles me that is all even your departure am i not dreaming that you must go  when he was in bed that night the mystical aspect of the case came still more forcibly before the vicar he lay awake and had the most horrible visions of his sweet and delicate visitor drifting through this unsympathetic world and happening upon the cruellest misadventures his guest was an angel assuredly he tried to go over the whole story of the past eight days again he thought of the hot afternoon the shot fired out of sheer surprise the fluttering iridescent wings the beautiful saffronrobed figure upon the ground how wonderful that had seemed to him then his mind turned to the things he had heard of the other world to the dreams the violin had conjured up to the vague fluctuating wonderful cities of the angelic land he tried to recall the forms of the buildings the shapes of the fruits upon the trees the aspect of the winged shapes that traversed its ways they grew from a memory into a present reality grew every moment just a little more vivid and his troubles a little less immediate and so softly and quietly the vicar slipped out of his troubles and perplexities into the land of dreams     xlvi   delia sat with her window open hoping to hear the angel play but that night there was to be no playing the sky was overcast yet not so thickly but that the moon was visible high up a broken cloudlace drove across the sky and now the moon was a hazy patch of light and now it was darkened and now rode clear and bright and sharply outlined against the blue gulf of night and presently she heard the door into the garden opening and a figure came out under the drifting pallor of the moonlight  it was the angel but he wore once more the saffron robe in the place of his formless overcoat in the uncertain light this garment had only a colourless shimmer and his wings behind him seemed a leaden grey he began taking short runs flapping his wings and leaping going to and fro amidst the drifting patches of light and the shadows of the trees delia watched him in amazement he gave a despondent cry leaping higher his shrivelled wings flashed and fell a thicker patch in the cloudfilm made everything obscure he seemed to spring five or six feet from the ground and fall clumsily she saw him in the dimness crouching on the ground and then she heard him sobbing  hes hurt said delia pressing her lips together hard and staring i ought to help him  she hesitated then stood up and flitted swiftly towards the door went slipping quietly downstairs and out into the moonlight the angel still lay upon the lawn and sobbed for utter wretchedness  oh what is the matter said delia stooping over him and touching his head timidly  the angel ceased sobbing sat up abruptly and stared at her he saw her face moonlit and soft with pity what is the matter she whispered are you hurt  the angel stared about him and his eyes came to rest on her face delia he whispered  are you hurt said delia  my wings said the angel i cannot use my wings  delia did not understand but she realised that it was something very dreadful it is dark it is cold whispered the angel i cannot use my wings  it hurt her unaccountably to see the tears on his face she did not know what to do  pity me delia said the angel suddenly extending his arms towards her pity me  impulsively she knelt down and took his face between her hands i do not know she said but i am sorry i am sorry for you with all my heart  the angel said not a word he was looking at her little face in the bright moonlight with an expression of uncomprehending wonder in his eyes this strange world he said  she suddenly withdrew her hands a cloud drove over the moon what can i do to help you she whispered i would do anything to help you  he still held her at arms length perplexity replacing misery in his face this strange world he repeated  both whispered she kneeling he sitting in the fluctuating moonlight and darkness of the lawn   delia said mrs hinijer suddenly projecting from her window delia is that you  they both looked up at her in consternation  come in at once delia said mrs hinijer if that mr angel was a gentleman which he isnt hed feel ashamed of hisself and you an orphan too     the last day of the visit  xlvii   on the morning of the next day the angel after he had breakfasted went out towards the moor and mrs hinijer had an interview with the vicar what happened need not concern us now the vicar was visibly disconcerted he must go he said certainly he must go and straightway he forgot the particular accusation in the general trouble he spent the morning in hazy meditation interspersed by a spasmodic study of skiff and waterlows price list and the catalogue of the medical scholastic and clerical stores a schedule grew slowly on a sheet of paper that lay on the desk before him he cut out a selfmeasurement form from the tailoring department of the stores and pinned it to the study curtains this was the kind of document he was making  1 black melton frock coat patts £3 10s   trousers 2 pairs or one  1 cheviot tweed suit write for patterns selfmeas  the vicar spent some time studying a pleasing array of model gentlemen they were all very nicelooking but he found it hard to imagine the angel so transfigured for although six days had passed the angel remained without any suit of his own the vicar had vacillated between a project of driving the angel into portbroddock and getting him measured for a suit and his absolute horror of the insinuating manners of the tailor he employed he knew that tailor would demand an exhaustive explanation besides which one never knew when the angel might leave so the six days had passed and the angel had grown steadily in the wisdom of this world and shrouded his brightness still in the ample retirement of the vicars newest clothes  1 soft

the vicar loved c it gave things such a precise and businesslike air  1 leather portmanteau had better see these  and so forthmeanderingly it kept the vicar busy until lunch time though his heart ached  the angel did not return to lunch this was not so very remarkableonce before he had missed the midday meal yet considering how short was the time they would have together now he might perhaps have come back doubtless he had excellent reasons though for his absence the vicar made an indifferent lunch in the afternoon he rested in his usual manner and did a little more to the list of requirements he did not begin to feel nervous about the angel till teatime he waited perhaps half an hour before he took tea odd said the vicar feeling still more lonely as he drank his tea  as the time for dinner crept on and no angel appeared the vicars imagination began to trouble him he will come in to dinner surely said the vicar caressing his chin and beginning to fret about the house upon inconsiderable errands as his habit was when anything occurred to break his routine the sun set a gorgeous spectacle amidst tumbled masses of purple cloud the gold and red faded into twilight the evening star gathered her robe of light together from out the brightness of the sky in the west breaking the silence of evening that crept over the outer world a corncrake began his whirring chant the vicars face grew troubled twice he went and stared at the darkening hillside and then fretted back to the house again mrs hinijer served dinner your dinners ready she announced for the second time with a reproachful intonation yes yes said the vicar fussing off upstairs  he came down and went into his study and lit his reading lamp a patent affair with an incandescent wick dropping the match into his wastepaper basket without stopping to see if it was extinguished then he fretted into the diningroom and began a desultory attack on the cooling dinner  dear reader the time is almost ripe to say farewell to this little vicar of ours     xlviii   sir john gotch still smarting over the business of the barbed wire was riding along one of the grassy ways through the preserves by the sidder when he saw strolling slowly through the trees beyond the undergrowth the one particular human being he did not want to see  im damned said sir john gotch with immense emphasis if this isnt altogether too much  he raised himself in the stirrups hi he shouted you there  the angel turned smiling  get out of this wood said sir john gotch  why said the angel  im  said sir john gotch meditating some cataclysmal expletive but he could think of nothing more than damned get out of this wood he said  the angels smile vanished why should i get out of this wood he said and stood still  neither spoke for a full half minute perhaps and then sir john gotch dropped out of his saddle and stood by the horse  now you must rememberlest the angelic hosts be discredited herebythat this angel had been breathing the poisonous air of this struggle for existence of ours for more than a week it was not only his wings and the brightness of his face that suffered he had eaten and slept and learnt the lesson of painhad travelled so far on the road to humanity all the length of his visit he had been meeting more and more of the harshness and conflict of this world and losing touch with the glorious altitudes of his own  you wont go eigh said gotch and began to lead his horse through the bushes towards the angel the angel stood all his muscles tight and his nerves quivering watching his antagonist approach  get out of this wood said gotch stopping three yards away his face white with rage his bridle in one hand and his riding whip in the other  strange floods of emotion were running through the angel who are you he said in a low quivering voice who am ithat you should order me out of this place what has the world done that men like you  youre the fool who cut my barbed wire said gotch threatening if you want to know  your barbed wire said the angel was that your barbed wire are you the man who put down that barbed wire what right have you  dont you go talking socialist rot said gotch in short gasps this woods mine and ive a right to protect it how i can i know your kind of muck talking rot and stirring up discontent and if you dont get out of it jolly sharp  well said the angel a brimming reservoir of unaccountable energy  get out of this damned wood said gotch flashing into the bully out of sheer alarm at the light in the angels face  he made one step towards him with the whip raised and then something happened that neither he nor the angel properly understood the angel seemed to leap into the air a pair of grey wings flashed out at the squire he saw a face bearing down upon him full of the wild beauty of passionate anger his riding whip was torn out of his hand his horse reared behind him pulled him over gained his bridle and fled  the whip cut across his face as he fell back stung across his face again as he sat on the ground he saw the angel radiant with anger in the act to strike again gotch flung up his hands pitched himself forward to save his eyes and rolled on the ground under the pitiless fury of the blows that rained down upon him  you brute cried the angel striking wherever he saw flesh to feel you bestial thing of pride and lies you who have overshadowed the souls of other men you shallow fool with your horses and dogs to lift your face against any living thing learn learn learn  gotch began screaming for help twice he tried to clamber to his feet got to his knees and went headlong again under the ferocious anger of the angel presently he made a strange noise in his throat and ceased even to writhe under his punishment  then suddenly the angel awakened from his wrath and found himself standing panting and trembling one foot on a motionless figure under the green stillness of the sunlit woods  he stared about him then down at his feet where among the tangled dead leaves the hair was matted with blood the whip dropped from his hands the hot colour fled from his face pain he said why does he lie so still  he took his foot off gotchs shoulder bent down towards the prostrate figure stood listening kneltshook him awake said the angel then still more softly awake  he remained listening some minutes or more stood up sharply and looked round him at the silent trees a feeling of profound horror descended upon him wrapped him round about with an abrupt gesture he turned what has happened to me he said in an awestricken whisper  he started back from the motionless figure dead he said suddenly and turning panic stricken fled headlong through the wood     xlix   it was some minutes after the footsteps of the angel had died away in the distance that gotch raised himself on his hand by jove he said crumps right  cut at the head too  he put his hand to his face and felt the two weals running across it hot and fat ill think twice before i lift my hand against a lunatic again said sir john gotch  he may be a person of weak intellect but im damned if he hasnt a pretty strong arm phew hes cut a bit clean off the top of my ear with that infernal lash  that infernal horse will go galloping to the house in the approved dramatic style little madamll be scared out of her wits and i  i shall have to explain how it all happened while she vivisects me with questions  im a jolly good mind to have spring guns and mantraps put in this preserve confound the law     l   but the angel thinking that gotch was dead went wandering off in a passion of remorse and fear through the brakes and copses along the sidder you can scarcely imagine how appalled he was at this last and overwhelming proof of his encroaching humanity all the darkness passion and pain of life seemed closing in upon him inexorably becoming part of him chaining him to all that a week ago he had found strange and pitiful in men  truly this is no world for an angel said the angel it is a world of war a world of pain a world of death anger comes upon one  i who knew not pain and anger stand here with blood stains on my hands i have fallen to come into this world is to fall one must hunger and thirst and be tormented with a thousand desires one must fight for foothold be angry and strike  he lifted up his hands to heaven the ultimate bitterness of helpless remorse in his face and then flung them down with a gesture of despair the prison walls of this narrow passionate life seemed creeping in upon him certainly and steadily to crush him presently altogether he felt what all we poor mortals have to feel sooner or laterthe pitiless force of the things that must be not only without us but where the real trouble lies within all the inevitable tormenting of ones high resolves those inevitable seasons when the better self is forgotten but with us it is a gentle descent made by imperceptible degrees over a long space of years with him it was the horrible discovery of one short week he felt he was being crippled caked over blinded stupefied in the wrappings of this life he felt as a man might feel who has taken some horrible poison and feels destruction spreading within him  he took no account of hunger or fatigue or the flight of time on and on he went avoiding houses and roads turning away from the sight and sound of a human being in a wordless desperate argument with fate his thoughts did not flow but stood banked back in inarticulate remonstrance against his degradation chance directed his footsteps homeward and at last after nightfall he found himself faint and weary and wretched stumbling along over the moor at the back of siddermorton he heard the rats run and squeal in the heather and once a noiseless big bird came out of the darkness passed and vanished again and he saw without noticing it a dull red glow in the sky before him     li   but when he came over the brow of the moor a vivid light sprang up before him and refused to be ignored he came on down the hill and speedily saw more distinctly what the glare was it came from darting and trembling tongues of fire golden and red that shot from the windows and a hole in the roof of the vicarage a cluster of black heads all the village in fact except the firebrigadewho were down at aylmers cottage trying to find the key of the machinehousecame out in silhouette against the blaze there was a roaring sound and a humming of voices and presently a furious outcry there was a shouting of no nocome back and an inarticulate roar  he began to run towards the burning house he stumbled and almost fell but he ran on he found black figures running about him the flaring fire blew gustily this way and that and he smelt the smell of burning  she went in said one voice she went in  the mad girl said another  stand back stand back cried others  he found himself thrusting through an excited swaying crowd all staring at the flames and with the red reflection in their eyes  stand back said a labourer clutching him  what is it said the angel what does this mean  theres a girl in the house and she cant get out  went in after a fiddle said another  tas hopeless he heard someone else say  i was standing near her i heerd her says she i can get his fiddle i heerd herjust like that i can get his fiddle  for a moment the angel stood staring then in a flash he saw it all saw this grim little world of battle and cruelty transfigured in a splendour that outshone the angelic land suffused suddenly and insupportably glorious with the wonderful light of love and selfsacrifice he gave a strange cry and before anyone could stop him was running towards the burning building there were cries of the hunchback the fowener  the vicar whose scalded hand was being tied up turned his head and he and crump saw the angel a black outline against the intense red glare of the doorway it was the sensation of the tenth of a second yet both men could not have remembered that transitory attitude more vividly had it been a picture they had studied for hours together then the angel was hidden by something massive no one knew what that fell incandescent across the doorway     lii   there was a cry of delia and no more but suddenly the flames spurted out in a blinding glare that shot upward to an immense height a blinding brilliance broken by a thousand flickering gleams like the waving of swords and a gust of sparks flashing in a thousand colours whirled up and vanished just then and for a moment by some strange accident a rush of music like the swell of an organ wove into the roaring of the flames  the whole village standing in black knots heard the sound except gaffer siddons who is deafstrange and beautiful it was and then gone again lumpy durgan the idiot boy from sidderford said it began and ended like the opening and shutting of a door  but little hetty penzance had a pretty fancy of two figures with wings that flashed up and vanished among the flames  and after that it was she began to pine for the things she saw in her dreams and was abstracted and strange it grieved her mother sorely at the time she grew fragile as though she was fading out of the world and her eyes had a strange faraway look she talked of angels and rainbow colours and golden wings and was for ever singing an unmeaning fragment of an air that nobody knew until crump took her in hand and cured her with fattening dietary syrup of hypophosphites and cod liver oil     the epilogue   and there the story of the wonderful visit ends the epilogue is in the mouth of mrs mendham there stand two little white crosses in the siddermorton churchyard near together where the brambles come clambering over the stone wall one is inscribed thomas angel and the other delia hardy and the dates of the deaths are the same really there is nothing beneath them but the ashes of the vicars stuffed ostrich you will remember the vicar had his ornithological side i noticed them when mrs mendham was showing me the new de la beche monument mendham has been vicar since hilyer died the granite came from somewhere in scotland said mrs mendham and cost ever so muchi forget how muchbut a wonderful lot its quite the talk of the village  mother said cissie mendham you are stepping on a grave  dear me said mrs mendham how heedless of me and the cripples grave too but really youve no idea how much this monument cost them  these two people by the bye said mrs mendham were killed when the old vicarage was burnt its rather a strange story he was a curious person a hunchbacked fiddler who came from nobody knows where and imposed upon the late vicar to a frightful extent he played in a pretentious way by ear and we found out afterwards that he did not know a note of musicnot a note he was exposed before quite a lot of people among other things he seems to have been carrying on as people say with one of the servants a sly little drab but mendham had better tell you all about it the man was halfwitted and curiously deformed its strange the fancies girls have  she looked sharply at cissie and cissie blushed to the eyes  she was left in the house and he rushed into the flames in an attempt to save her quite romanticisnt it he was rather clever with the fiddle in his uneducated way  all the poor vicars stuffed skins were burned at the same time it was almost all he cared for he never really got over the blow he came to stop with usfor there wasnt another house available in the village but he never seemed happy he seemed all shaken i never saw a man so changed i tried to stir him up but it was no goodno good at all he had the queerest delusions about angels and that kind of thing it made him odd company at times he would say he heard music and stare quite stupidly at nothing for hours together he got quite careless about his dress he died within a twelvemonth of the fire  the end  turnbull and spears printers edinburgh
