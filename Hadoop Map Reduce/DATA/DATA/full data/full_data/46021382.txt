selection of his letters and a sketch of his life i had already in 1892 when he was anxiousneedlessly as it turned outas to the provision he might be able to leave for his family received from him a suggestion that some kind of a book might be made out of the monthly journalletters which he had been in the habit of writing me from samoa letters begun at first with no thought of publication and simply in order to maintain our intimacy so far as might be undiminished by separation this part of his wishes i was able to carry out promptly and the result appeared under the title vailima letters in the autumn following his death 1895 lack of leisure delayed the execution of the remaining part for one thing the body of correspondence which came in from various quarters turned out much larger than had been anticipated he did not love writing letters and will be found somewhere in the following pages referring to himself as one essentially and originally incapable of the art epistolary that he was a bad correspondent had come to be an accepted view among his friends but in truth it was only during one period of his life that he at all deserved such a reproach1 at other times as became apparent after his death he had shown a degree of industry and spirit in letterwriting extraordinary considering his health and his occupations it was indeed he and not his friends as will abundantly appear in the course of these volumes who oftenest had cause to complain of answers neglected or delayed his letters it is true were often the most informal in the world and he generally neglected to date them a habit which is the despair of editors but after his own whim and fashion he wrote a vast number so that the work of sifting copying and arranging was long and laborious it was not until the autumn of 1899 that the letters to his family and friends were ready for publication and in the meantime the task of writing the life had been taken over by his cousin and my friend mr graham balfour who completed it two years later  in considering the scale and plan on which my friends instruction should be carried out i quote with the change of a word or two from my introduction of 1899 it seemed necessary to take into account not his own always modest opinion of himself but the place which he seemed likely to take ultimately in the worlds regard the four or five years following the death of a writer much applauded in his lifetime are generally the years when the decline of his reputation begins if it is going to suffer decline at all at present certainly stevensons name seems in no danger of going down on the stream of daily literary reference and allusion it floats more actively than ever in another sense its vitality is confirmed by the material test of continued sales and of the market since we have lost him other writers whose beginnings he watched with sympathetic interest have come to fill a greater immediate place in public attention but none has exercised stevensons peculiar and personal power to charm to attach and to inspirit by his study of perfection in form and stylequalities for which his countrymen in general have been apt to care littlehe might seem destined to give pleasure chiefly to the fastidious and the artistically minded but as to its matter the main appeal of his work is not to any mental tastes and fashions of the few it is rather to universal hereditary instincts to the primitive sources of imaginative excitement and entertainment in the race  the voice of the advocatus diaboli has been heard against him as it is right and proper that it should be heard against any man before his reputation can be held fully established one such advocate in this country has thought to dispose of him by the charge of externality but the reader who remembers things like the seafrenzy of gordon darnaway or the dialogue of markheim with his other self in the house of murder or the rebaptism of the spirit of seraphina in the forest dews or the failure of herrick to find in the waters of the island lagoon a last release from dishonour or the death of goguelat or the appeal of kirstie elliot in the midnight chambersuch a reader can only smile at a criticism like this and put it by these and a score of other passages breathe the essential poetry and significance of things as they reveal themselves to true masters only they are instinct at once with the morality and the romance which lie deep together at the soul of nature and experience not in vain had stevenson read the lesson of the lanternbearers and hearkened to the music of the pipes of pan he was feeling his way all his life towards a fuller mastery of his means preferring always to leave unexpressed what he felt that he could not express adequately and in much of his work was content merely to amuse himself and others but even when he is playing most fancifully with his art and his readers as in the shudders tempered with laughter of the suicide club or the airy sentimental comedy of providence and the guitar or the schoolboy historical inventions of dickon crookback and the old sailor arblaster a writer of his quality cannot help striking notes from the heart of life and the inwardness of things deeper than will ever be struck or even apprehended by another who labours with never a smile either of his own or of his readers upon the most solemn enterprises of realistic fiction but is born without the magicians touch and insight  another advocate on the same side in the united states has made much of the supposed dependence of this author on his models and classed him among writers whose inspiration is imitative and secondhand but this is to be quite misled by the wellknown passage of stevensons own in which he speaks of himself as having in his prentice years played the sedulous ape to many writers of different styles and periods in doing this he was not seeking inspiration but simply practising the use of the tools which were to help him to express his own inspirations truly he was always much of a reader but it was life not books that always in the first degree allured and taught him    he loved of life the myriad sides    pain prayer or pleasure act or sleep    as wallowing narwhals love the deep  so with just selfknowledge he wrote of himself and the books which he most cared for and lived with were those of which the writers seemedto quote again a phrase of his ownto have been eavesdropping at the door of his heart those which told of experiences or cravings after experience pains pleasures or conflicts of the spirit which in the eagerness of youthful living and thinking had already been his own no man in fact was ever less inclined to take anything at secondhand the root of all originality was in him in the shape of an extreme natural vividness of perception imagination and feeling an instinctive and inbred unwillingness to accept the accepted and conform to the conventional was of the essence of his character whether in life or art and was a source to him both of strength and weakness he would not follow a general ruleleast of all if it was a prudential ruleof conduct unless he was clear that it was right according to his private conscience nor would he join in youth in the ordinary social amusements of his class when he had once found out that they did not amuse him nor wear their clothes if he could not feel at ease and be himself in them nor use whether in speech or writing any trite or inanimate form of words that did not faithfully and livingly express his thought a readier acceptance alike of current usages and current phrases might have been better for him but was simply not in his nature no reader of this book will close it i am sure without feeling that he has been throughout in the company of a spirit various indeed and manymooded but profoundly sincere and real ways that in another might easily have been mere signs of affectation were in him the true expression of a nature ten times more spontaneously itself and individually alive than that of others selfconsciousness in many characters that possess it deflects and falsifies conduct and so does the dramatic instinct stevenson was selfconscious in a high degree but only as a part of his general activity of mind only in so far as he could not help being an extremely intelligent spectator of his own doings and feelings these themselves came from springs of character and impulse much too deep and strong to be diverted he loved also with a childs or actors gusto to play a part and make a drama out of life but the part was always for the moment his very own he had it not in him to pose for anything but what he truly was  when a man so constituted had once mastered his craft of letters he might take up whatever instrument he pleased with the instinctive and just confidence that he would play upon it to a tune and with a manner of his own this is indeed the true mark and test of his originality he has no need to be or to seem especially original in the form and mode of literature which he attempts by his choice of these he may at any time give himself and his reader the pleasure of recalling like a familiar air some strain of literary association but in so doing he only adds a secondary charm to his work the vision the temperament the mode of conceiving and handling are in every case personal to himself he may try his hand in youth at a sentimental journey but r l s cannot choose but be at the opposite pole of human character and feeling from laurence sterne in tales of mystery allegorical or other he may bear in mind the precedent of edgar poe and yet there is nothing in style and temper much wider apart than markheim and jekyll and hyde are from the murders in the rue morgue or william wilson he may set out to tell a pirate story for boys exactly in the ancient way and it will come from him not in the ancient way at all but reminted marked with a sharpness and saliency in the characters a private stamp of buccaneering ferocity combined with smiling humour an energy of vision and happy vividness of presentment which are shiningly his own another time he may desert the paths of kingston and ballantyne for those of sir walter scott but literature presents few stronger contrasts than between any scene of waverley or redgauntlet and any scene of the master of ballantrae or catriona whether in their strength or weakness and it is the most loyal lovers of the older master who take the greatest pleasure in reading the work of the younger so much less opulently gifted as is probablethough we must remember that stevenson died at the age when scott wrote waverleyso infinitely more careful of his gift stevenson may even blow upon the pipe of burns and yet his tune will be no echo but one which utters the heart and mind of a scots maker who has his own outlook on life his own special and profitable vein of smiling or satirical contemplation  not by reason then of externality for sure nor yet of imitativeness will this writer lose his hold on the attention and regard of his countrymen the debate before his place in literature is settled must rather turn on other points as whether the genial essayist and egoist or the romantic inventor and narrator was the stronger in himwhether the montaigne and pepys elements prevailed in his literary composition or the scott and dumas elementsa question indeed which among those who care for him most has always been at issue or again what degree of true inspiring and illuminating power belongs to the gospel or gospels airily encouraging or gravely didactic which are set forth in the essays with so captivating a grace or whether in romance and tale he had a power of inventing and constructing a whole fable comparable to his admitted power of conceiving and presenting single scenes and situations in a manner which stamps them indelibly on the readers mind and whether his figures are sustained continuously by the true spontaneous breath of creation or are but transitorily animated at happy moments by flashes of spiritual and dramatic insight aided by the conscious devices of his singularly adroit and spirited art these are questions which no criticism but that of time can solve to contend as some do that strong creative impulse and so keen an artistic selfconsciousness as stevensons was cannot exist together is quite idle the truth of course is that the deepseated energies of imaginative creation are found sometimes in combination and sometimes not in combination with an artistic intelligence thus keenly conscious of its own purpose and watchful of its own working  once more it may be questioned whether among the many varieties of work which stevenson has left all distinguished by a grace and precision of workmanship which are the rarest qualities in english art there are any which can be pointed to as absolute masterpieces such as the future cannot be expected to let die let the future decide what is certain is that posterity must either be very well or very ill occupied if it can consent to give up so much sound entertainment and better than entertainment as this writer afforded his contemporaries in the meantime among judicious readers on both sides of the atlantic stevenson stands i think it may safely be said as a true master of english prose scarcely surpassed for the union of lenity and lucidity with suggestive pregnancy and poetic animation for harmony of cadence and the wellknit structure of sentences and for the art of imparting to words the vital quality of things and making them convey the precisesometimes let it be granted the too curiously preciseexpression of the very shade and colour of the thought feeling or vision in his mind he stands moreover as the writer who in the last quarter of the nineteenth century has handled with the most of freshness and inspiriting power the widest range of established literary formsthe moral critical and personal essay travels sentimental and other romances and short tales both historical and modern parables and tales of mystery boys stories of adventure memoirsnor let lyrical and meditative verse both english and scottish and especially nursery verse a new vein for genius to work in be forgotten to some of these forms stevenson gave quite new life through all alike he expressed vividly an extremely personal way of seeing and being a sense of nature and romance of the aspects of human existence and problems of human conduct which was essentially his own and in so doing he contrived to make friends and even lovers of his readers those whom he attracts at all and there is no writer who attracts every one are drawn to him over and over again finding familiarity not lessen but increase the charm of his work and desiring ever closer intimacy with the spirit and personality which they divine behind it  as to the fitting scale then on which to treat the memory of a man who fills five years after his death such a place as this in the general regard and who has desired that a selection from his letters shall be made public the word selection has evidently to be given a pretty liberal interpretation readers it must be supposed will scarce be content without the opportunity of a fairly ample intercourse with such a man as he was accustomed to reveal himself in writing to his familiars in choosing from among the material before me i still quote from the introduction of 1899 i have used the best discretion that i could stevensons feelings and relations throughout life were in almost all directions so warm and kindly that very little had to be suppressed from fear of giving pain2 on the other hand he drew people towards him with so much confidence and affection and met their openness with so much of his own that an editor could not but feel the frequent risk of inviting readers to trespass too far on purely private affairs and feelings including those of the living this was a point upon which in his lifetime he felt strongly that excellent critic mr walter raleigh has noticed as one of the merits of stevensons personal essays and accounts of travel that few men have written more or more attractively of themselves without ever taking the public unduly into familiarity or overstepping proper bounds of reticence public prying into private lives the propagation of gossip by the press and printing of private letters during the writers lifetime were things he hated once indeed he very superfluously gave himself a dangerous cold by dancing before a bonfire in his garden at the news of a society editor having been committed to prison and the only approach to a difference he ever had with one of his lifelong friends arose from the publication without permission of one of his letters written during his first pacific voyage  how far then must i regard his instructions about publication as authorising me to go after his death beyond the limits which he had been so careful in observing and desiring others to observe in life how much may now fairly become public of that which had been held sacred and hitherto private among his friends to cut out all that is strictly personal and intimate were to leave his story untold and half the charm of his character unrevealed to put in too much were to break all bonds of that privacy which he so carefully regarded while he lived i know not if i have at all been able to hit the mean and to succeed in making these letters as it has been my object to make them present without offence or intrusion a just a living and proportionate picture of the man as far as they will yield it there is one respect in which his own practice and principle has had to be in some degree violated if the work was to be done at all except in the single case of the essay ordered south he would never in writing for the public adopt the invalid point of view or invite any attention to his infirmities to me he says the medicine bottles on my chimney and the blood on my handkerchief are accidents they do not colour my view of life and i should think myself a trifler and in bad taste if i introduced the world to these unimportant privacies but from his letters to his family and friends these matters could not possibly be left out the tale of his life in the years when he was most of a correspondent was in truth a tale of daily and nightly battle against weakness and physical distress and danger to those who loved him the incidents of this battle were communicated sometimes gravely sometimes laughingly i have greatly cut down such bulletins but could not possibly omit them altogether  in 1911 twelve years after the above words were written the estimate expressed in them of stevensons qualities as a writer and of the place he seemed likely to maintain in the affections of english readers all the world over had been amply confirmed by the lapse of time the sale of his works kept increasing rather than diminishing editions kept multiplying a new generation of readers had found life and letters nature and human nature touched by him at so many points with so vivifying and illuminating a charm that it had become scarcely possible to take up any newspaper or magazine and not find some reference to his work and name both series of letterseven one mainly concerned as the vailima letters are with matters of interest both remote and transitoryhad been read in edition after edition and readers had been and were continually asking for more the time was thought to have come for a new and definitive edition in which the two series of letters already published should be thrown into one and as much new material added as could be found suitable the task of carrying out this scheme fell again upon me the new edition constituted in effect a nearly complete epistolary autobiography it contained not less than a hundred and fifty of stevensons letters hitherto unpublished they dated from all periods of his life those written in the brilliant and troubled days of his youth predominating and giving a picture perhaps unique in its kind of a character and talent in the making the present edition is a reprint of the edition of 1911 with a few errors of transcription and one or two of date corrected and with a very few new letters added  much of course remains and ought to remain unprinted some of the outpourings of the early time are too sacred and intimate for publicity many of the letters of his maturer years are dry business letters of no general interest many others are mere scraps tossed in jest to his familiars and full of catchwords and codewords current in their talk but meaningless to outsiders above all many have to be omitted because they deal with the intimate affairs of private persons stevenson has been sometimes called an egoist as though he had been one in the practical sense as well as in the sense of taking a lively interest in his own moods and doings nothing can be more untrue the letters printed in these volumes are indeed for the most part about himself but it was of himself that his correspondents of all things most cared to hear if the letters concerned with the private affairs of other people could be printed as of course they cannot the balance would come more than even we should see him throwing himself with sympathetic ardour and without thought of self into the cares and interests of his correspondents and should learn to recognise him as having been truly the helper in many a relation where he might naturally have been taken for the person helped  as to the form in which the letters are now presented they fill three volumes instead of the four of the 1911 edition the division into fourteen sections according to date being retained as to the text it is faithful to the original except in so far as i have freely used the editorial privilege of omission when i thought it desirable and as i have not felt myself bound to reproduce slips and oddities however characteristic of spelling in formal matters like the use of quotemarks italics and so forth i have adopted a more uniform practice than his which was very casual and variable  to some readers perhapsfrom this point i again resume my introduction of 1899 but with more correction and abridgmentto some perhaps the very lack of art as a correspondent to which stevenson as above quoted pleads guilty may give the reading an added charm and flavour what he could do as an artist in letters we know i remember sir john millais a shrewd and very independent judge of books calling across to me at a dinnertable you know stevenson dont you and then going on well i wish you would tell him from me if he cares to know that to my mind he is the very first of living artists i dont mean writers merely but painters and all of us nobody living can see with such an eye as that fellow and nobody is such a master of his tools but in his letters excepting a few written in youth and having more or less the character of exercises and a few in after years which were intended for the public eye stevenson the deliberate artist is scarcely forthcoming at all he does not care a fig for order or logical sequence or congruity or for striking a key of expression and keeping it but becomes simply the most spontaneous and unstudied of human beings he has at his command the whole vocabularies of the english and scottish languages classical and slang with good stores of the french and tosses and tumbles them about irresponsibly to convey the impression or affection the mood or freak of the moment pouring himself out in all manner of rhapsodical confessions and speculations grave or gay notes of observation and criticism snatches of remembrance and autobiography moralisings on matters uppermost for the hour in his mind comments on his own work or other peoples or mere idle fun and foolery  by this medley of moods and manners stevensons letters at their best come nearer than anything else to the fullblooded charm and variety of his conversation nearer yet not quite near for it was in company only that his genial spirit rose to his very best few men probably have had in them such a richness and variety of human nature and few can ever have been better gifted than he was to express the play of being that was in him by means of the apt expressive word and the animated look and gesture divers et ondoyant in the words of montaigne beyond other men he seemed to contain within himself a whole troop of singularly assorted characters though prose was his chosen medium of expression he was by temperament a born poet to whom the world was full of enchantment and of latent romance only waiting to take shape and substance in the forms of art it was his birthright                      to hear   the great bell beating far and near   the odd unknown enchanted gong   that on the road hales men along   that from the mountain calls afar   that lures the vessel from a star   and with a still aerial sound   makes all the earth enchanted ground  he had not only the poets mind but the poets senses in youth ginger was only too hot in his mouth and the chimes at midnight only too favourite a music at the same time he was not less a born preacher and moralist and son of the covenanters after his fashion he had about him as has been said little spirit of social or other conformity but an active and searching private conscience kept him for ever calling in question both the grounds of his own conduct and the validity of the accepted codes and compromises of society he must try to work out a scheme of morality suitable to his own case and temperament which found the prohibitory law of moses chill and uninspiring but in the sermon on the mount a strong incentive to all those impulses of pity and charity to which his heart was prone in early days his sense of social injustice and the inequalities of human opportunity made him inwardly much of a rebel who would have embraced and acted on theories of socialism or communism could he have found any that did not seem to him at variance with ineradicable instincts of human nature all his life the artist and the moralist in him alike were in rebellion against the bourgeois spiritagainst timid negative and shuffling substitutes for active and courageous welldoingand declined to worship at the shrine of what he called the bestial goddesses comfort and respectability the moralist in him helped the artist by backing with the force of a highly sensitive conscience his instinctive love of perfection in his work the artist qualified the moralist by discountenancing any preference for the harsh the sour or the selfmortifying forms of virtue and encouraging the love for all tender or heroic glowing generous and cheerful forms  above all things perhaps stevenson was by instinct an adventurer and practical experimentalist in life many poets are content to dream and many perhaps most moralists to preach stevenson must ever be doing and undergoing he was no sentimentalist to pay himself with fine feelings whether for mean action or slack inaction he had an insatiable zest for all experiences not the pleasurable only but including the more harsh and bitingthose that bring home to a man the pinch and sting of existence as it is realised by the disinherited of the world and excluding only what he thought the prim the conventional the deadalive and the cutanddry on occasion the experimentalist and man of adventure in him would enter into special partnership with the moralist and man of conscience he was prone to plunge into difficult social passes and ethical dilemmas which he might sometimes more wisely have avoided for the sake of trying to behave in them to the utmost according to his own personal sense of the obligations of honour duty and kindness in yet another part of his being he cherished as his great countryman scott had done before him an intense underlying longing for the life of action danger and command action colvin action i remember his crying eagerly to me with his hand on my arm as we lay basking for his healths sake in a boat off the scented shores of the cap martin another timethis was on his way to a winter cure at davossome friend had given him general hamleys operations of warin which he writes to his father i am drowned a thousand fathoms deep and o that i had been a soldier is still my cry fortunately with all these ardent and divers instincts there were present two invaluable gifts besides that of humour which for all his stress of being and vivid consciousness of self saved him from ever seeing himself for long together out of a just proportion and kept wholesome laughter always ready at his lips and that of a most tender and loyal heart which through all his experiments and agitations made the law of kindness the one ruling law of his life in the end lack of health determined his career giving the chief part in his life to the artist and man of imagination and keeping the man of action a prisoner in the sickroom until by a singular turn of destiny he was able to wring a real prolonged and romantically successful adventure out of that voyage to the pacific which had been in its origin the last despairing resource of the invalid  again it was characteristic of this multiple personality that he never seemed to be cramped like the rest of us at any given time of life within the limits of his proper age but to be child boy young man and old man all at once there was never a time in his life when stevenson had to say with st augustine behold my childhood is dead but i am alive the child lived on always in him not in memory only but in real survival with all its freshness of perception unimpaired and none of its play instincts in the least degree extinguished or made ashamed as for the perennial boy in stevenson that is too apparent to need remark it was as a boy for boys that he wrote the best known of his books treasure island and with all boys that he met provided they were really boys and not prigs nor puppies he was instantly and delightedly at home at the same time even when i first knew him he showed already surprising occasional traits and glimpses of old sagacity of premature lifewisdom and experience  once more it is said that in every poet there must be something of the woman if to be quick in sympathy and feeling ardent in attachment and full of pity for the weak and suffering is to be womanly stevenson was certainly all those he was even like a woman in being greek artidakrus easily moved to tears at the touch of pity or affection or even at any specially poignant impression of art or beauty but yet if any one word were to be chosen for the predominant quality of his character and example i suppose that word would be manly in his gentle and complying nature there were strains of iron tenacity and will occasionally even let it be admitted of perversity and scottish thrawnness he had both kinds of physical couragethe active delighting in danger and the passive unshaken in endurance in the moral courage of facing situations and consequences of readiness to pay for faults committed of outspokenness admitting no ambiguous relations and clearing away the clouds from human intercourse i have not known his equal the great sir walter himself as this book will prove was not more manfully free from artistic jealousy or irritability under criticism or more unfeignedly inclined to exaggerate the qualities of other peoples work and to underrate those of his own of the humorous and engaging parts of vanity and egoism which led him to make infinite talk and fun about himself and use his own experiences as a key for unlocking the confidences of others stevenson had plenty but of the morose and fretful parts never a shade a little irish girl he wrote once during a painful crisis of his life is now reading my book aloud to her sister at my elbow they chuckle and i feel flatteredyours r l s psnow they yawn and i am indifferent such a wisely conceived thing is vanity if only vanity so conceived were commoner and whatever might be the abstract and philosophical value of that somewhat grimly stoical conception of the universe of conduct and duty at which in mature years he had arrived want of manliness is certainly not its fault take the kind of maxims which he was accustomed to forge for his own guidanceacts may be forgiven not even god can forgive the hangerback choose the best if you can or choose the worst that which hangs in the wind dangles from a gibbet shall i said feeblemind and the echo said fie do i love said loveless and the echo laughed a fault known is a fault cured to the strong but to the weak it is a fetter riveted the mean man doubts the greathearted is deceived greatheart was deceived very well said greatheart i have not forgotten my umbrella said the careful man but the lightning struck him shame had a fine bed but where was slumber once he was in jail he slept with this moralist maxims meant actions and where shall we easily find a much manlier spirit of wisdom than this  there was yet another and very different side to stevenson which struck others more than it struck myself namely that of the freakish or elvish irresponsible madcap or jester which sometimes appeared in him it is true that his demoniac quickness of wit and intelligence suggested occasionally a spirit of air and fire rather than one of earth that he was abundantly given to all kinds of quirk and laughter and that there was no jest saving the unkind he would not make and relish the late mr j a symonds always called him sprite qualifying the name however by the epithets most fantastic but most human to me the essential humanity was always the thing most apparent in a fire well nourished of seasoned shiptimber the flames glance fantastically and of many colours but the glow at heart is ever deep and strong it was at such a glow that the friends of stevenson were accustomed to warm their hands while they admired and were entertained by the shifting lights  it was only in company as i have said that all these many lights and colours could be seen in full play he would begin no matter howperhaps with a jest at some absurd adventure of his own perhaps with the recitation in his vibrating voice and full scotch accent of some snatch of poetry that was haunting him perhaps with a rhapsody of analytic delight over some minute accident of beauty or expressiveness that had struck him in man woman child or external nature and forthwith the floodgates would be opened and the talk would stream on in endless never importunate flood and variety a hundred fictitious characters would be invented and launched on their imaginary careers a hundred ingenious problems of conduct and cases of honour would be set and solved romantic voyages would be planned and followed out in vision with a thousand incidents the possibilities of life and art would be illuminated with searchlights of bewildering range and penetration sober argument and high poetic eloquence alternating with coruscations of insanely apposite slangthe earthiest jape anon shooting up into the empyrean and changing into the most ethereal fantasythe stalest and most vulgarised forms of speech gaining brilliancy and illuminating power from some hitherto undreamtof applicationand all the while an atmosphere of goodwill diffusing itself from the speaker a glow of eager benignity and affectionate laughter emanating from his presence till every one about him seemed to catch something of his own gift and inspiration this sympathetic power of inspiring others was the special and distinguishing note of stevensons conversation he would keep a houseful or a single companion entertained all day and day after day and half the nights yet never seemed to monopolise the talk or absorb it rather he helped every one about him to discover and to exercise unexpected powers of their own  imagine all this helped by the most speaking of presences a steady penetrating fire in the brown wideset eyes a compelling power and richness in the smile courteous waving gestures of the arms and long nervous hands a lit cigarette generally held between the fingers continual rapid shiftings and pacings to and fro as he conversed rapid but not flurried nor awkward for there was a grace in his attenuated but wellcarried figure and his movements were light deft and full of spring there was something for strangers and even for friends to get over in the queer garments which in youth it was his whim to wearthe badge as they always seemed to me partly of a genuine carelessness certainly of a genuine lack of cash the little he had was always absolutely at the disposal of his friends partly of a deliberate detachment from any particular social class or caste partly of his love of pickles and adventures which he thought befel a man thus attired more readily than another but this slender slovenly nondescript apparition longvisaged and longhaired had only to speak in order to be recognised in the first minute for a witty and charming gentleman and within the first five for a master spirit and man of genius there were indeed certain stolidly conventional and superciliously official kinds of persons both at home and abroad who were incapable of looking beyond the clothes and eyed him always with frozen suspicion this attitude used sometimes in youth to drive him into fits of flaming anger which put him helplessly at a disadvantage unless or until he could call the sense of humour to his help apart from these his human charm was the same for all kinds of people without distinction of class or caste for worldlywise old great ladies whom he reminded of famous poets in their youth for his brother artists and men of letters perhaps above all for the ordinary clubman for his physicians who could never do enough for him for domestic servants who adored him for the english policeman even on whom he often tried quite in vain to pass himself as one of the criminal classes for the shepherd the street arab or the tramp the common seaman the beachcomber or the polynesian highchief even in the imposed silence and restraint of extreme sickness the power and attraction of the man made themselves felt and there seemed to be more vitality and fire of the spirit in him as he lay exhausted and speechless in bed than in an ordinary roomful of people in health  but i have strayed from my purpose which was only to indicate that in the best of these letters of stevensons you have some echo far away indeed but yet the nearest of his talktalk which could not possibly be taken down and of which nothing remains save in the memory of his friends an impression magical and never to be effaced       sidney colvin   footnotes    1 from 1876 to 1879see p 185    2 the point was one on which stevenson himself felt strongly in a     letter of instructions to his wife found among his posthumous papers     he writes it is never worth while to inflict pain upon a snail for     any literary purpose and where events may appear to be favourable     to me and contrary to others i would rather be misunderstood than     cause a pang to any one whom i have known far less whom i have     loved whether an editor or biographer would be justified in     carrying out this principle to the full may perhaps be doubted              the letters   of robert louis stevenson            18681882              the letters   of robert louis stevenson     i  student days at edinburgh  travels and excursions  18681873   the following section consists chiefly of extracts from the correspondence and journals addressed by louis stevenson as a lad of eighteen to twentytwo to his father and mother during summer excursions to the scottish coast or to the continent there exist enough of them to fill a volume but it is not in letters of this kind to his family that a young man unbosoms himself most freely and these are perhaps not quite devoid of the qualities of the guidebook and the descriptive exercise nevertheless they seem to me to contain enough signs of the future masterwriter enough of character observation and skill in expression to make a certain number worth giving by way of an opening chapter to the present book among them are interspersed four or five of a different character addressed to other correspondents and chiefly to his lifelong friend and intimate mr charles baxter  on both sides of the house stevenson came of interesting stock his grandfather was robert stevenson civil engineer highly distinguished as the builder of the bell rock lighthouse by this robert stevenson his three sons and two of his grandsons now living the business of civil engineers in general and of official engineers to the commissioners of northern lights in particular has been carried on at edinburgh with high credit and public utility for almost a century thomas stevenson the youngest of the three sons of the original robert was robert louis stevensons father he was a man not only of mark zeal and inventiveness in his profession but of a strong and singular personality a staunch friend and sagacious adviser trenchant in judgment and demonstrative in emotion outspoken dogmaticdespotic even in little things but withal essentially chivalrous and softhearted apt to pass with the swiftest transition from moods of gloom or sternness to those of tender or freakish gaiety and commanding a gift of humorous and figurative speech second only to that of his more famous son  thomas stevenson was married to margaret isabella youngest daughter of the rev lewis balfour for many years minister of the parish of colinton in midlothian this mr balfour described by his grandson in the essay called the manse was of the stock of the balfours of pilrig and grandson to that james balfour professor first of moral philosophy and afterwards of the law of nature and of nations who was held in particular esteem as a philosophical controversialist by david hume his wife henrietta smith a daughter of the rev george smith of galston to whose gift as a preacher burns refers scoffingly in the holy fair is said to have been a woman of uncommon beauty and charm of manner their daughter mrs thomas stevenson suffered in early and middle life from chest and nerve troubles and her son may have inherited from her some of his constitutional weakness capable cultivated companionable affectionate she was a determined looker at the bright side of things and hence better skilled perhaps to shut her eyes to troubles or differences among those she loved than understandingly to compose or heal them conventionally minded one might have thought her but for the surprising readiness with which in later life she adapted herself to conditions of life and travel the most unconventional possible the son and only child of these two robert louis baptized robert lewis balfour3 was born on november 13 1850 at 8 howard place edinburgh his health was infirm from the first and he was with difficulty kept alive by the combined care of his mother and a most devoted nurse alison cunningham to whom his lifelong gratitude will be found touchingly expressed in the course of the following letters in 1858 he was near dying of a gastric fever and was at all times subject to acute catarrhal and bronchial affections and extreme nervous excitability  in january 1853 stevensons parents moved to inverleith terrace and in may 1857 to 17 heriot row which continued to be their edinburgh home until the death of thomas stevenson in 1887 much of the boys time was also spent in the manse of colinton on the water of leith the home of his maternal grandfather illhealth prevented him getting much regular or continuous schooling he attended first 185861 a preparatory school kept by a mr henderson in india street and next at intervals for some time after the autumn of 1861 the edinburgh academy  schooling was interrupted in the end of 1862 and first half of 1863 by excursions with his parents to germany the riviera and italy the love of wandering which was a rooted passion in stevensons nature thus began early to find satisfaction for a few months in the autumn of 1863 when his parents had been ordered for a second time to mentone for the sake of his mothers health he was sent to a boardingschool kept by a mr wyatt at spring grove near london it is not my intention to treat the reader to the series of childish and boyish letters of these days which parental fondness has preserved but here is one written from his english school when he was about thirteen which is both amusing in itself and had a certain influence on his destiny inasmuch as his appeal led to his being taken out to join his parents on the french riviera which from these days of his boyhood he never ceased to love and for which the longing amid the gloom of edinburgh winters often afterwards gripped him by the heart        spring grove school 12th november 1863  ma chere mamanjai recu votre lettre aujourdhui et comme le jour prochaine est mon jour de naisance je vous Ã©crit ce lettre ma grande

acquired a complete reading and speaking with a less complete writing mastery of the language and was as much at home with french ways of thought and life as with english  for one more specimen of his boyish style it may be not amiss to give the text of another appeal which dates from two and a half years later and is also typical of much in his lifes conditions both then and later        2

1864 to 1867 stevensons education was conducted chiefly at mr thomsons private school in frederick street edinburgh and by private tutors in various places to which he travelled for his own or his parents health these travels included frequent visits to such scottish health resorts as bridge of allan dunoon rothesay north berwick lasswade and peebles and occasional excursions with his father on his nearer professional rounds to the scottish coasts and lighthouses from 1867 the family life became more settled between edinburgh and swanston cottage lothianburn a country home in the pentlands which mr stevenson first rented in that year and the scenery and associations of which sank deeply into the young mans spirit and vitally affected his after thoughts and his art  by this time louis stevenson seemed to show signs of outgrowing his early infirmities of health he was a lover to a degree even beyond his strength of outdoor life and exercise though not of sports and it began to be hoped that as he grew up he would be fit to enter the family profession of civil engineer he was accordingly entered as a student at edinburgh university and for several winters attended classes there with such regularity as his health and inclinations permitted this was in truth but small the mind on fire with its own imaginations and eager to acquire its own experiences in its own way does not take kindly to the routine of classes and repetitions nor could the desultory mode of schooling enforced upon him by illhealth answer much purpose by way of discipline according to his own account he was at college as he had been at school an inveterate idler and truant but outside the field of school and college routine he showed an eager curiosity and activity of mind he was of a conversable temper so he says of himself and insatiably curious in the aspects of life and spent much of his time scraping acquaintance with all classes of men and womenkind of one class indeed and that was his own he had soon had enough at least in so far as it was to be studied at the dinners dances and other polite entertainments of ordinary edinburgh society of these he early wearied at home he made himself pleasant to all comers but for his own resort chose out a very few houses mostly those of intimate college companions into which he could go without constraint and where his inexhaustible flow of poetic imaginative and laughing talk seems generally to have rather puzzled his hearers than impressed them on the other hand during his endless private rambles and excursions whether among the streets and slums the gardens and graveyards of the city or farther afield among the pentland hills or on the shores of forth he was never tired of studying character and seeking acquaintance among the classes more nearly exposed to the pinch and stress of life  in the eyes of anxious elders such vagrant ways naturally take on the colours of idleness and a love of low company stevenson was however in his own fashion an eager student of books as well as of man and nature he read precociously and omnivorously in the belleslettres including a very wide range of english poetry fiction and essays and a fairly wide range of french and was a genuine student of scottish history especially from the time of the persecutions down and to some extent of history in general the art of literature was already his private passion and something within him even already told him that it was to be his lifes work on all his truantries he went pencil and copybook in hand trying to fit his impression of the scene to words to compose original rhymes tales dialogues and dramas or to imitate the style and cadences of the author he at the moment preferred for three or four years nevertheless he tried dutifully if halfheartedly to prepare himself for the family profession in 1868 the year when the following correspondence opens he went to watch the works of the firm in progress first at anstruther on the coast of fife and afterwards at wick in 1869 he made the tour of the orkneys and shetlands on board the steam yacht of the commissioners of northern lights and in 1870 the tour of the western islands preceded by a stay on the isle of earraid where the works of the dhu heartach lighthouse were then in progress he was a favourite although a very irregular pupil of the professor of engineering fleeming jenkin whose friendship and that of mrs jenkin were of great value to him and whose life he afterwards wrote and must have shown some aptitude for the family calling inasmuch as in 1871 he received the silver medal of the edinburgh society of arts for a paper on a suggested improvement in lighthouse apparatus the outdoor and seafaring parts of an engineers life were in fact wholly to his taste but he looked instinctively at the powers and phenomena of waves and tide of storm and current reef cliff and rock with the eye of the poet and artist and not those of the practician and calculator for desk work and office routine he had an unconquerable aversion and his physical powers had they remained at their best must have proved quite unequal to the workshop training necessary to the practical engineer accordingly in 1871 it was agreed not without natural reluctance on his fathers part that he should give up the hereditary vocation and read for the bar literature on which his heart was set and in which his early attempts had been encouraged being held to be by itself no profession or at least one altogether too irregular and undefined for the next several years therefore he attended law classes instead of engineering and science classes in the university giving to the subject a certain amount of serious although fitful attention until he was called to the bar in 1875  so much for the course of stevensons outward life during these days at edinburgh to tell the story of his inner life would be a far more complicated task and cannot here be attempted even briefly the ferment of youth was more acute and more prolonged in him than in most men even of genius in the introduction i have tried to give some notion of the many various strains and elements which met in him and which were in these days pulling one against another in his halfformed being at a great expense of spirit and body add the storms which from time to time attacked him of shivering repulsion from the climate and conditions of life in the city which he yet deeply and imaginatively loved the moods of spiritual revolt against the harsh doctrines of the creed in which he had been brought up and to which his parents were deeply his father even passionately attached the seasons of temptation to which he was exposed alike by temperament and circumstance to seek solace among the crude allurements of the city streets  in the later and maturer correspondence which will appear in these volumes the agitations of the writers early days are often enough referred to in retrospect in the boyish letters to his parents which make up the chief part of this first section they naturally find no expression at all nor will these letters be found to differ much in any way from those of any other lively and observant lad who is also something of a reader and has some natural gift of writing at the end of the section i have indeed printed one cry of the heart written not to his parents but about them and telling of the strain which matters of religious difference for a while brought into his home relations the attachment between the father and son from childhood was exceptionally strong but the father was staunchly wedded to the hereditary creeds and dogmas of scottish calvinistic christianity while the course of the young mans reading with the spirit of the generation in which he grew up had loosed him from the bonds of that theology and even of dogmatic christianity in general and had taught him to respect all creeds alike as expressions of the cravings and conjectures of the human spirit in face of the unsolved mystery of things rather than to cling to any one of them as a revelation of ultimate truth the shock to the father was great when his sons opinions came to his knowledge and there ensued a time of extremely painful discussion and private tension between them in due time this cloud upon a family life otherwise very harmonious and affectionate passed quite away but the greater the love the greater the pain when i first knew stevenson this trouble gave him no peace and it has left a strong trace upon his mind and work see particularly the parable called the house of eld in his collection of fables and the many studies of difficult paternal and filial relations which are to be found in the story of a lie the misadventures of john nicholson the wrecker and weir of hermiston     to thomas stevenson      in july 1868 r l s went to watch the harbour works at anstruther    and afterwards those at wick of his private moods and occupations in    the anstruther days he has told in retrospect in the essay random    memories the coast of fife here are some passages from letters    written at the time to his

side of the most limited dimensions was at once the scenery and the proscenium the manager told us that his scenes were sixteen by sixtyfour and so could not be got in though i knew or at least felt sure that there were no such scenes in the poor mans possession i could not laugh as did the major part of the audience at this shift to escape criticism we saw a wretched farce and some comic songs were sung the manager sang one but it came grimly from his throat the whole receipt of the evening was 5s and 3d out of which had to come room gas and town drummer we left soon and i must say came out as sad as i have been for ever so long i think that manager had a soul above comic songs i said this to young m who is a phillistine matthew arnolds philistine you understand and he replied how much happier would he be as a common workingman i told him i thought he would be less happy earning a comfortable living as a shoemaker than he was starving as an actor with such artistic work as he had to do but the phillistine wouldnt see it you observe that i spell philistine time about with one and two ls  as we went home we heard singing and went into the porch of the schoolhouse to listen a

during his stay at wick in a private hotel    on the harbour brae kept by a mr sutherland4       wick friday september 11 1868  my dear mother  wick lies at the end or elbow of an open triangular bay hemmed on either side by shores either cliff or steep earthbank of no great height the grey houses of pulteney extend along the southerly shore almost to the cape and it is about halfway down this shoreno sixsevenths way downthat the new breakwater extends athwart the bay  certainly wick in itself possesses no beauty bare grey shores grim grey houses grim grey sea not even the gleam of red tiles not even the greenness of a tree the southerly heights when i came here were black with people fishers waiting on wind and night now all the sys stornoway boats have beaten out of the bay and the wick men stay indoors or wrangle on the quays with dissatisfied fishcurers kneehigh in brine mud and herring refuse the day when the boats put out to go home to the hebrides the girl here told me there was a black wind and on going out i found the epithet as justifiable as it was picturesque a cold black southerly wind with occasional rising showers of rain it was a fine sight to see the boats beat out ateeth of it  in wick i have never heard any one greet his neighbour with the usual fine day or good morning both come shaking their heads and both say breezy breezy and such is the atrocious quality of the climate that the remark is almost invariably justified by the fact  the streets are full of the highland fishers lubberly stupid inconceivably lazy and heavy to move you bruise against them tumble over them elbow them against the wallall to no purpose they will not budge and you are forced to leave the pavement every step  to the south however is as fine a piece of coast scenery as i ever saw great black chasms huge black cliffs rugged and overhung gullies natural arches and deep green pools below them almost too deep to let you see the gleam of sand among the darker weed there are deep caves too in one of these lives a tribe of gipsies the men are always drunk simply and truthfully always from morning to evening the great villainouslooking fellows are either sleeping off the last debauch or hulking about the cove in the horrors the cave is deep high and airy and might be made comfortable enough but they just live among heaped boulders damp with continual droppings from above with no more furniture than two or three tin pans a truss of rotten straw and a few ragged cloaks in winter the surf bursts into the mouth and often forces them to abandon it  an Ã©meute of disappointed fishers was feared and two ships of war are in the bay to render assistance to the municipal authorities this is the ides and to all intents and purposes said ides are passed still there is a good deal of disturbance many drunk men and a double supply of police i saw them sent for by some people and enter an inn in a pretty good hurry what it was for i do not know  you would see by papas letter about the carpenter who fell off the staging i dont think i was ever so much excited in my life the man was back at his work and i asked him how he was but he was a highlander andneed i

pause in a voice of some contrition well if i am a drunken brute its only once in the twelvemonth and that was the end of him the insult rankled in his mind and he retired to rest he is a fishcurer a

motherthe last two days have been dreadfully hard and i was so tired in the evenings that i could not write in fact last night i went to sleep immediately after dinner or very nearly so my hours have been 102 and 37 out in the lighter or the small boat in a long heavy roll from the noreast when the dog was taken out he got awfully ill one of the men geordie grant by name and surname followed shoot with considerable Ã©clat but wonderful to relate i kept well my hands are all skinned blistered discoloured and engrained with tar some of which latter has established itself under my nails in a position of such natural strength that it defies all my efforts to dislodge it the worst work i had was when david macdonalds eldest and i took the charge ourselves he remained in the lighter to tighten or slacken the guys as we raised the pole towards the perpendicular with two men i was with four men in the boat we dropped an anchor out a good bit then tied a cord to the pole took a turn round the sternmost thwart with it and pulled on the anchor line as the great big wet hawser came in it soaked you to the skin i was the sternest used by way of variety for sternmost of the lot and had to coil ita work which involved from its being so stiff and your being busy pulling with all your might no little trouble and an extra ducking we got it up and just as we were going to sing victory one of the guys slipped in the pole totteredwent over on its side again like a shot and behold the end of our labour  you see i have been roughing it and though some parts of the letter may be neither very comprehensible nor very interesting to you i think that perhaps it might amuse willie traquair who delights in all such dirty jobs  the first day i forgot to mention was like midwinter for cold and rained incessantly so hard that the livid white of our coldpinched faces wore a sort of inflamed rash on the windward side  i am not a bit the worse of it except forementioned state of hands a slight crick in my neck from the rain running down and general stiffness from pulling hauling and tugging for dear life  we have got double weights at the guys and hope to get it up like a

that many would be glad to have such feet whatever shoes they had on unfortunately fishers and seafaring men are too facile to be compared with this looks like enjoyment better speck than anster  i have done with frivolity this morning i was awakened by mrs sutherland at the door theres a ship ashore at shaltigoe as my senses slowly flooded i heard the whistling and the roaring of wind and the

the eu conservative club murdoch at greenock i spent a dismal evening though i found a pretty walk next day on board the iona i had maggie thomson to tarbet craig a wellread pleasant medical to ardrishaig and professor mrs and all the little fleeming jenkinseses to oban  at oban that night it was delicious mr stephensons yacht lay in the bay and a splendid band on board played delightfully the waters of the bay were as smooth as a millpond and in the dusk the black shadows of the hills stretched across to our very feet and the lights were reflected in long lines at intervals blue lights were burned on the water and rockets were sent up sometimes great stars of clear fire fell from them until the bay received and quenched them i hired a boat and skulled round the yacht in the dark when i came in a very pleasant englishman on the steps fell into talk with me till it was time to go to bed  next morning i slept on or i should have gone to glencoe as it was it was blazing hot so i hired a boat pulled all forenoon along the coast and had a delicious bathe on a beautiful white beach coming home i cotogaid my englishman lunched alongside of him and his sister and took a walk with him in the afternoon during which i find that he was travelling with a servant kept horses et cetera at dinner he wished me to sit beside him and his sister but there was no room when he came out he told me why he was so empressÃ© on this point he had found out my name and that i was connected with lighthouses and his sister wished to know if i were any relative of the stevenson in ballantynes lighthouse all evening he his sister i and mr hargrove of hargrove and fowler sate in front of the hotel i asked mr h if he knew who my friend was yes he said i never met him before but my partner knows him he is a man of old family and the solicitor of highest standing about sheffield at night he said now if youre down in my neighbourhood you must pay me a visit i am very fond of young men about me and i should like a visit from you very much i can take you through any factory in sheffield and ill drive you all about the dookeries he then wrote me down his address and we parted huge friends he still keeping me up to visiting him  hitherto i had enjoyed myself amazingly but today has been the crown in the morning i met bough on board with whom i am both surprised and delighted he and i have read the same books and discuss chaucer shakespeare marlowe fletcher webster and all the old authors he can quote verses by the page and has really a very pretty literary taste altogether with all his roughness and buffoonery a more pleasant clever fellow you may seldom see i was very much surprised with him and he with me where the devil did you read all these books says he and in my heart i echo the question one amusing thing i must say we were both talking about travelling and i said i was so fond of travelling alone from the people one met and grew friendly with ah says he but youve such a pleasant manner you knowquite captivated my old woman you didshe couldnt talk of anything else here was a compliment even in sam boughs sneering tones that rather tickled my vanity and really my social successes of the last few days the best of which is yet to come are enough to turn anybodys head to continue after a little go in with samuel he going up on the bridge i looked about me to see who there was and mine eye lighted on two girls one of whom was sweet and pretty talking to an old gentleman eh bien says i to myself that seems the best investment on board so i sidled up to the old gentleman got into conversation with him and so with the damsel and thereupon having used the patriarch as a ladder i kicked him down behind me who should my damsel prove but amy sinclair daughter of sir tollemache she certainly was the simplest most naÃ¯ve specimen of girlhood ever i saw by getting brandy and biscuit and generally coaching up her cousin who was sick i ingratiated myself and so kept her the whole way to iona taking her into the cave at staffa and generally making myself as gallant as possible i was never so much pleased with anything in my life as her amusing absence of mauvaise honte she was so sorry i wasnt going on to oban again didnt know how she could have enjoyed herself if i hadnt been there and was so sorry we hadnt met on the crinan when we came back from staffa she and her aunt went down to have lunch and a minute after up comes miss amy to ask me if i wouldnt think better of it and take some lunch with them i couldnt resist that of course so down i went and there she displayed the full extent of her innocence i must be sure to come to thurso castle the next time i was in caithness and upper norwood whence she would take me all over the crystal palace when i was near london and most complete of all she offered to call on us in edinburgh wasnt it deliciousshe is a girl of sixteen or seventeen too and the latter i think i never yet saw a girl so innocent and fresh so perfectly modest without the least trace of prudery  coming off staffa sam bough who had been in huge force the whole time drawing in miss amys sketchbook and making himself agreeable or otherwise to everybody pointed me out to a parson and said thats him this was alexander ross and his wife  the last stage of the steamer now approached miss amy and i lamenting pathetically that iona was so near people meet in this way quoth she and then lose sight of one another so soon we all landed together bough and i and the rosses with our baggage and went together over the ruins i was here left with the cousin and the aunt during which i learned that said cousin sees me every sunday in st stephens oho thought i at the every the aunt was very anxious to know who that strange wild man was didnt i wish samuel in tophet of course in reply i drew it strong about eccentric genius and my never having known him before and a good deal that was perhaps strained to the extremest limit of the fact  the steamer left and miss amy and her cousin waved their handkerchiefs until my arm in answering them was nearly broken i believe womens arms must be better made for this exercise mine ache still and i regretted at the time that the handkerchief had seen service altogether however i was left in a pleasant frame of mind  being thus left alone bough i the rosses professor blackie and an englishman called m these people were going to remain the night except the professor who is resident there at present they were going to dine en compagnie and wished us to join the party but we had already committed ourselves by mistake to the wrong hotel and besides we wished to be off as soon as wind and tide were against us to earraid we went up bough selected a place for sketching and blocked in the sketch for mrs r and we all talked together bough told us his family history and a lot of strange things about old cumberland life among others how he had known john peel of pleasant memory in song and of how that worthy hunted at five down we go to the argyll hotel and wait dinner brothnice brothfresh herrings and fowl had been promised at 550 i get the shovel and tongs and drum them at the stairhead till a response comes from below that the nice broth is at hand i boast of my engineering and bough compares me to the abbot of arbroath who originated the inchcape bell at last in comes the tureen and the handmaid lifts the cover rice soup i yell o no none o that for meyes says bough savagely but miss amy didnt take me downstairs to eat salmon accordingly he is helped how his face fell i imagine myself in the accident ward of the infirmary quoth he it was purely and simply rice and water after this we have another weary pause and then herrings in a state of mash and potatoes like iron send the potatoes out to prussia for grapeshot was the suggestion i dined off broken herrings and dry bread at last the supreme moment comes and the fowl in a lordly dish is carried in on the cover being raised there is something so forlorn and miserable about the aspect of the animal that we both roar with laughter then bough taking up knife and fork turns the swarry over and over shaking doubtfully his head theres an aspect of quiet resistance about the beggar says he that looks bad however to work he falls until the sweat stands on his brow and a dismembered leg falls dull and leadenlike on to my dish to eat it was simply impossible i did not know before that flesh could be so tough the strongest jaws in england says bough piteously harpooning his dry morsel couldnt eat this leg in less than twelve hours nothing for it now but to order boat and bill that fowl says bough to the landlady is of a breed i know i knew the cut of its jib whenever it was put down that was the grandmother of the cock that frightened peteri thought it was a historical animal says i what a shame to kill it its as bad as eating whittingtons cat or the dog of montargisnana its no so old says the landlady but it eats hardeats i cry where do you find that very little of that verb with us so with more raillery we pay six shillings for our festival and run over to earraid shaking the dust of the argyll hotel from off our feet  i can write no more just now and i hope you will be able to decipher so much for it contains matter really the whole of yesterdays work would do in a novel without one little bit of embellishment and indeed few novels are so amusing bough miss amy mrs ross blackie m the parsonall these were such distinct characters the incidents were so entertaining and the scenery so fine that the whole would have made a novelists fortune  my dear fatherno landing today as the sea runs high on the rock they are at the second course of the first story on the rock i have as yet had no time here so this is greek a and greek Ã´ of my business newsyour affectionate son       r l stevenson     to mrs churchill babington      this is addressed to a favourite cousin of the balfour clan married    to a cambridge colleague of mine professor churchill babington of    learned and amiable memory whose home was at the college living of    cockfield near bury st edmunds here stevenson had visited them in    the previous year mrs hutchinson is of course lucy hutchinsons    famous life of her husband the regicide       swanston cottage lothianburn summer 1871  my dear maudif you have forgotten the handwritingas is like enoughyou will find the name of a former correspondent dont know how to spell that word at the end i have begun to write to you before now but always stuck somehow and left it to drown in a drawerful of like fiascos this time i am determined to carry through though i have nothing specially to say  we look fairly like summer this morning the trees are blackening out of their spring greens the warmer suns have melted the hoarfrost of daisies of the paddock and the blackbird i fear already beginning to stint his pipe of mellower dayswhich is very apposite i cant spell anything todayone p or two and pretty all the same we have been having shocking weathercold winds and grey skies  i have been reading heaps of nice books but i cant go back so far i am reading clarendons hist rebell at present with which i am more pleased than i expected which is saying a good deal it is a pet idea of mine that one gets more real truth out of one avowed partisan than out of a dozen of your sham impartialistswolves in sheeps clothingsimpering honesty as they suppress documents after all what one wants to know is not what people did but why they did itor rather why they thought they did it and to learn that you should go to the men themselves their very falsehood is often more than another mans truth  i have possessed myself of mrs hutchinson which of course i admire etc but is there not an irritating deliberation and correctness about her and everybody connected with her if she would only write bad grammar or forget to finish a sentence or do something or other that looks fallible it would be a relief i sometimes wish the old colonel had got drunk and beaten her in the bitterness of my spirit i know i felt a weight taken off my heart when i heard he was extravagant it is quite possible to be too good for this evil world and unquestionably mrs hutchinson was the way in which she talks of herself makes ones blood run cold therei am glad to have got that outbut dont say it to anybodyseal of secrecy  please tell mr babington that i have never forgotten one of his drawingsa rubens i thinka woman holding up a model ship that woman had more life in her than ninety per cent of the lame humans that you see crippling about this earth  by the way that is a feature in art which seems to have come in with the italians your old greek statues have scarce enough vitality in them to keep their monstrous bodies fresh withal a shrewd country attorney in a turned white neckcloth and rusty blacks would just take one of these agamemnons and ajaxes quietly by his beautiful strong arm trot the unresisting statue down a little gallery of legal shams and turn the poor fellow out at the other end naked as from the earth he came there is more latent life more of the coiled spring in the sleeping dog about a recumbent figure of michael angelos than about the most excited of greek statues the very marble seems to wrinkle with a wild energy that we never feel except in dreams  i think this letter has turned into a sermon but i had nothing interesting to talk about  i do wish you and mr babington would think better of it and come north this summer we should be so glad to see you both do reconsider itbelieve me my dear maud ever your most affectionate cousin       louis stevenson     to alison cunningham      the following is the first which has been preserved of many letters    to the admirable nurse whose care during his ailing childhood had    done so much both to preserve stevensons life and awaken his love of    tales and poetry and of whom until his death he thought with the    utmost constancy of affection the letter bears no sign of date or    place but by the handwriting would seem to belong to this year       1871  my dear cummyi was greatly pleased by your letter in many ways of course i was glad to hear from you you know you and i have so many old stories between us that even if there was nothing else even if there was not a very sincere respect and affection we should always be glad to pass a nod i say even if there was not but you know right well there is do not suppose that i shall ever forget those long bitter nights when i coughed and coughed and was so unhappy and you were so patient and loving with a poor sick child indeed cummy i wish i might become a man worth talking of if it were only that you should not have thrown away your pains  happily it is not the result of our acts that makes them brave and noble but the acts themselves and the unselfish love that moved us to do them inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these my dear old nurse and you know there is nothing a man can say nearer his heart except his mother or his wifemy dear old nurse god will make good to you all the good that you have done and mercifully forgive you all the evil and next time when the spring comes round and everything is beginning once again if you should happen to think that you might have had a child of your own and that it was hard you should have spent so many years taking care of some one elses prodigal just you think thisyou have been for a great deal in my life you have made much that there is in me just as surely as if you had conceived me and there are sons who are more ungrateful to their own mothers than i am to you for i am not ungrateful my dear cummy and it is with a very sincere emotion that i write myself your little boy       louis     to charles baxter      after a winter of troubled health stevenson had gone to dunblane for    a change in early spring and thence writes to his college companion    and lifelong friend mr charles baxter       dunblane friday 5th march 1872  my dear baxterby the date you may perhaps understand the purport of my letter without any words wasted about the matter i cannot walk with you tomorrow and you must not expect me i came yesterday afternoon to bridge of allan and have been very happy ever since as every place is sanctified by the eighth sense memory i walked up here this morning three miles tudieu a good stretch for me and passed one of my favourite places in the world and one that i very much affect in spirit when the body is tied down and brought immovably to anchor on a sickbed it is a meadow and bank on a corner on the river and is connected in my mind inseparably with virgils eclogues hic corulis mistos inter consedimus ulmos or something very like that the passage begins only i know my shortwinded latinity must have come to grief over even this much of quotation and here to a wish is just such a cavern as menalcas might shelter himself withal from the bright noon and with his lips curled backward pipe himself blue in the face while messieurs les arcadiens would roll out those cloying hexameters that sing themselves in ones mouth to such a curious lilting chant  in such weather one has the birds need to whistle and i who am specially incompetent in this art must content myself by chattering away to you on this bit of paper all the way along i was thanking god that he had made me and the birds and everything just as they are and not otherwise for although there was no sun the air was so thrilled with robins and blackbirds that it made the heart tremble with joy and the leaves are far enough forward on the underwood to give a fine promise for the future even myself as i say i would not have had changed in one iota this forenoon in spite of all my idleness and guthries lost paper which is ever present with mea horrible phantom  no one can be alone at home or in a quite new place memory and you must go hand in hand with at least decent weather if you wish to cook up a proper dish of solitude it is in these little flights of mine that i get more pleasure than in anything else now at present i am supremely uneasy and restlessalmost to the extent of pain but o how i enjoy it and how i shall enjoy it afterwards please god if i get years enough allotted to me for the thing to ripen in when i am a very old and very respectable citizen with white hair and bland manners and a gold watch i shall hear three crows cawing in my heart as i heard them this morning i vote for old age and eighty years of retrospect yet after all i dare say a short shrift and a nice green grave are about as desirable  poor devil how i am wearying you cheer up two pages more and my letter reaches its term for i have no more paper what delightful things inns and waiters and bagmen are if we didnt travel now and then we should forget what the feeling of life is the very cushion of a railway carriagethe things restorative to the touch i cant write confound it thats because i am so tired with my walk believe me ever your affectionate friend       r l stevenson     to charles baxter      the spec is of course the famous and historical debating society    the speculative society of edinburgh university to which stevenson    had been elected on the strength of his conversational powers and to    whose meetings he contributed several essays       dunblane tuesday 9th april 1872  my dear baxteri dont know what you mean i know nothing about the standing committee of the spec did not know that such a body existed and even if it doth exist must sadly repudiate all association with such goodly fellowship i am a rural voluptuary at present that is what is the matter with me the spec may go whistle as for c baxter esq who is he one baxter or bagster a secretary i say to mine acquaintance is at present disquieting my leisure with certain illegal uncharitable unchristian and unconstitutional documents called business letters the affair is in the hands of the police do you hear that you evildoer sending business letters is surely a far more hateful and slimy degree of wickedness than sending threatening letters the man who throws grenades and torpedoes is less malicious the devil in redhot hell rubs his hands with glee as he reckons up the number that go forth spreading pain and anxiety with each delivery of the post  i have been walking today by a colonnade of beeches along the brawling allan my character for sanity is quite gone seeing that i cheered my lonely way with the following in a triumphant chaunt thank god for the grass and the firtrees and the crows and the sheep and the sunshine and the shadows of the firtrees i hold that he is a poor mean devil who can walk alone in such a place and in such weather and doesnt set up his lungs and cry back to the birds and the river follow follow follow me come hither come hither come hitherhere shall you seeno enemyexcept a very slight remnant of winter and its rough weather my bedroom when i awoke this morning was full of birdsongs which is the greatest pleasure in life come hither come hither come hither and when you come bring the third part of the earthly paradise you can get it for me in elliots for two and tenpence 2s 10d business habits also bring an ounce of honeydew from wilsons       r l s     to mrs thomas stevenson      in the previous year 1871 it had become apparent that stevenson was    neither fitted by bodily health nor by inclination for the family    profession of civil engineer accordingly his summer excursions were    no longer to the harbour works and lighthouses of scotland but to    the ordinary scenes of holiday travel abroad       brussels thursday 25th july 1872  my dear motheri am here at last sitting in my room without coat or waistcoat and with both window and door open and yet perspiring like a terracotta jug or a gruyÃ¨re cheese  we had a very good passage which we certainly deserved in compensation for having to sleep on the cabin floor and finding absolutely nothing fit for human food in the whole filthy embarkation we made up for lost time by sleeping on deck a good part of the forenoon when i woke simpson was still sleeping the sleep of the just on a coil of ropes and as appeared afterwards his own hat so i got a bottle of bass and a pipe and laid hold of an old frenchman of somewhat filthy aspect fiat experimentum in corpore vili to try my french upon i made very heavy weather of it the frenchman had a very pretty young wife but my french always deserted me entirely when i had to answer her and so she soon drew away and left me to her lord who talked of french politics africa and domestic economy with great vivacity from ostend a smokinghot journey to brussels at brussels we went off after dinner to the parc if any person wants to be happy i should advise the parc you sit drinking iced drinks and smoking penny cigars under great old trees the band place covered walks etc are all lit up and you cant fancy how beautiful was the contrast of the great masses of lamplit foliage and the dark sapphire night sky with just one blue star set overhead in the middle of the largest patch in the dark walks too there are crowds of people whose faces you cannot see and here and there a colossal white statue at the corner of an alley that gives the place a nice artificial eighteenth century sentiment there was a good deal of summer lightning blinking overhead and the black avenues and white statues leapt out every minute into shortlived distinctness  i get up to add one thing more there is in the hotel a boy in whom i take the deepest interest i cannot tell you his age but the very first time i saw him when i was at dinner yesterday i was very much struck with his appearance there is something very leonine in his face with a dash of the negro especially if i remember aright in the mouth he has a great quantity of dark hair curling in great rolls not in little corkscrews and a pair of large dark and very steady bold bright eyes his manners are those of a prince i felt like an overgrown ploughboy beside him he speaks english perfectly but with i think sufficient foreign accent to stamp him as a russian especially when his manners are taken into account i dont think i ever saw any one who looked like a hero before after breakfast this morning i was talking to him in the court when he mentioned casually that he had caught a snake in the riesengebirge i have it here he said would you like to see it i said yes and putting his hand into his breastpocket he drew forth not a dried serpent skin but the head and neck of the reptile writhing and shooting out its horrible tongue in my face you may conceive what a fright i got i send off this single sheet just now in order to let you know i am safe across but you must not expect letters often       r l stevenson  psthe snake was about a yard long but harmless   and now he says quite tame     to mrs thomas stevenson       hotel landsberg frankfurt monday 29th july 1872   last night i met with rather an amusing adventurette seeing a church door open i went in and was led by most importunate fingerbills up a long stair to the top of the tower the father smoking at the door the mother and the three daughters received me as if i was a friend of the family and had come in for an evening visit the youngest daughter about thirteen i suppose and a pretty little girl had been learning english at the school and was anxious to play it off upon a real veritable englander so we had a long talk and i was shown photographs etc marie and i talking and the others looking on with evident delight at having such a linguist in the family as all my remarks were duly translated and communicated to the rest it was quite a good german lesson there was only one contretemps during the whole interviewthe arrival of another visitor in the shape surely the last of gods creatures a woodworm of the most unnatural and hideous appearance with one great striped horn sticking out of his nose like a boltsprit if there are many woodworms in germany i shall come home the most courageous men in the world must be entomologists i had rather be a liontamer  today i got rather a curiositylieder und balladen von robert burns translated by one silbergleit and not so ill done either armed with which i had a swim in the main and then bread and cheese and bavarian beer in a sort of cafÃ© or at least the german substitute for a cafÃ© but what a falling off after the heavenly forenoons in brussels  i have bought a meerschaum out of local sentiment and am now very low and nervous about the bargain having paid dearer than i should in england and got a worse article if i can form a judgment  do write some more somebody tomorrow i expect i shall go into lodgings as this hotel work makes the money disappear like butter in a furnacemeanwhile believe me ever your affectionate son       r l stevenson     to mrs thomas stevenson        hotel landsberg thursday 1st august 1872   yesterday i walked to eckenheim a village a little way out of frankfurt and turned into the alehouse in the room which was just such as it would have been in scotland were the landlady two neighbours and an old peasant eating raw sausage at the far end i soon got into conversation and was astonished when the landlady having asked whether i were an englishman and received an answer in the affirmative proceeded to inquire further whether i were not also a scotchman it turned out that a scotch doctora professora poetwho wrote booksgross wie dashad come nearly every day out of frankfurt to the eckenheimer wirthschaft and had left behind him a most savoury memory in the hearts of all its customers one man ran out to find his name for me and returned with the news that it was cobie scobie i suspect and during his absence the rest were pouring into my ears the fame and acquirements of my countryman he was in some undecipherable manner connected with the queen of england and one of the princesses he had been in turkey and had there married a wife of immense wealth they could find apparently no measure adequate to express the size of his books in one way or another he had amassed a princely fortune and had apparently only one sorrow his daughter to wit who had absconded into a kloster with a considerable slice of the mothers geld i told them we had no klosters in scotland with a certain feeling of superiority no more had they i was toldhier ist unser kloster and the speaker motioned with both arms round the taproom although the first torrent was exhausted yet the doctor came up again in all sorts of ways and with or without occasion throughout the whole interview as for example when one man taking his pipe out of his mouth and shaking his head remarked Ã propos of nothing and with almost defiant conviction er war ein feiner mann der herr doctor and was answered by another with yaw yaw und trank immer rothen wein  setting aside the doctor who had evidently turned the brains of the entire village they were intelligent people one thing in particular struck me their honesty in admitting that here they spoke bad german and advising me to go to coburg or leipsic for germansie sprechen da rein clean said one and they all nodded their heads together like as many mandarins and repeated rein so rein in chorus  of course we got upon scotland the hostess said die schottlÃ¤nder trinken gern schnapps which may be freely translated scotchmen are horrid fond of whisky it was impossible of course to combat such a truism and so i proceeded to explain the construction of toddy interrupted by a cry of horror when i mentioned the hot water and thence as i find is always the case to the most ghastly romancing about scottish scenery and manners the highland dress and everything national or local that i could lay my hands upon now that i have got my german burns i lean a good deal upon him for opening a conversation and read a few translations to every yawning audience that i can gather i am grown most insufferably national you see i fancy it is a punishment for my want of it at ordinary times now what do you think there was a waiter in this very hotel but alas he is now gone who sang from morning to night as my informant said with a shrug at the recollection what but s ist lange her the german version of auld lang syne so you see madame the finest lyric ever written will make its way out of whatsoever corner of patois it found its birth in    mein herz ist im hochland mein herz ist nicht hier    mein herz ist im hochland im grÃ¼nen revier    im grÃ¼nen reviere zu jagen das reh    mein herz ist im hochland wo immer ich geh  i dont think i need translate that for you  there is one thing that burthens me a good deal in my patriotic garrulage and that is the black ignorance in which i grope about everything as for example when i gave yesterday a full and i fancy a startlingly incorrect account of scotch education to a very stolid german on a garden bench he sat and perspired under it however with much composure i am generally glad enough to fall back again after these political interludes upon burns toddy and the highlands  i go every night to the theatre except when there is no opera i cannot stand a play yet but i am already very much improved and can understand a good deal of what goes on  friday august 2 1872in the evening at the theatre i had a great laugh lord allcash in fra diavolo with his white hat red guidebooks and bad german was the piÃ¨cederÃ©sistance from a humorous point of view and i had the satisfaction of knowing that in my own small way i could minister the same amusement whenever i chose to open my mouth  i am just going off to do some german with simpsonyour affectionate son       r l stevenson     to thomas stevenson        frankfurt rosengasse 13 august 4 1872  my dear fatheryou will perceive by the head of this page that we have at last got into lodgings and powerfully mean ones too if i were to call the street anything but shady i should be boasting the people sit at their doors in shirtsleeves smoking as they do in seven dials of a sunday  last night we went to bed about ten for the first time householders in germanyreal teutons with no deception spring or false bottom about halfpast one there began such a trumpeting shouting pealing of bells and scurrying hither and thither of feet as woke every person in frankfurt out of their first sleep with a vague sort of apprehension that the last day was at hand the whole street was alive and we could hear people talking in their rooms or crying to passersby from their windows all around us at last i made out what a man was saying in the next room it was a fire in sachsenhausen he said sachsenhausen is the suburb on the other side of the main and he wound up with one of the most tremendous falsehoods on record hier alles ruhthere all is still if it can be said to be still in an engine factory or in the stomach of a volcano when it is meditating an eruption he might have been justified in what he said but not otherwise the tumult continued unabated for near an hour but as one grew used to it it gradually resolved itself into three bells answering each other at short intervals across the town a man shouting at ever shorter intervals and with superhuman energy feuerim sachsenhausen and the almost continuous winding of all manner of bugles and trumpets sometimes in stirring flourishes and sometimes in mere tuneless wails occasionally there was another rush of feet past the window and once there was a mighty drumming down between us and the river as though the soldiery were turning out to keep the peace this was all we had of the fire except a great cloud all flushed red with the glare above the roofs on the other side of the gasse but it was quite enough to put me entirely off my sleep and make me keenly alive to three or four gentlemen who were strolling leisurely about my person and every here and there leaving me somewhat as a keepsake however everything has its compensation and when day came at last and the sparrows awoke with trills and carolets the dawn seemed to fall on me like a sleeping draught i went to the window and saw the sparrows about the eaves and a great troop of doves go strolling up the paven gasse seeking what they may devour and so to sleep despite fleas and firealarms and clocks chiming the hours out of neighbouring houses at all sorts of odd times and with the most charming want of unanimity  we have got settled down in frankfurt and like the place very much simpson and i seem to get on very well together we suit each other capitally and it is an awful joke to be living two wouldbe advocates and one a baronet in this supremely mean abode  the abode is however a great improvement on the hotel and i think we shall grow quite fond of itever your affectionate son       r l stevenson     to mrs thomas stevenson        13 rosengasse frankfurt tuesday morning august 1872   last night i was at the theatre and heard die judin la juive and was thereby terribly excited at last in the middle of the fifth act which was perfectly beastly i had to slope i could stand even seeing the cauldron with the sham fire beneath and the two hateful executioners in red but when at last the girls courage breaks down and grasping her fathers arm she cries outo so shudderfullyi thought it high time to be out of that galÃ¨re and so i do not know yet whether it ends well or ill but if i ever afterwards find that they do carry things to the extremity i shall think more meanly of my species it was raining and cold outside so i went into a bierhalle and sat and brooded over a schnitt halfglass for nearly an hour an opera is far more real than real life to me it seems as if stage illusion and particularly this hardest to swallow and most conventional illusion of them allan operawould never stale upon me i wish that life was an opera i should like to live in one but i dont know in what quarter of the globe i shall find a society so constituted besides it would soon pall imagine asking for threekreuzer cigars in recitative or giving the washerwoman the inventory of your dirty clothes in a sustained and flourishous aria  i am in a right good mood this morning to sit here and write to you but not to give you news there is a great stir of life in a quiet almost country fashion all about us here some one is hammering a beefsteak in the rezdechaussÃ©e there is a great clink of pitchers and noise of the pumphandle at the public well in the little squarekin round the corner the children all seemingly within a month and certainly none above five that always go halting and stumbling up and down the roadway are ordinarily very quiet and sit sedately puddling in the gutter trying i suppose poor little devils to understand their muttersprache but they too make themselves heard from time to time in little incomprehensible antiphonies about the drift that comes down to them by their rivers from the strange lands higher up the gasse above all there is here such a twittering of canaries i can see twelve out of our window and such continual visitation of grey doves and bignosed sparrows as make our little byestreet into a perfect aviary  i look across the gasse at our opposite neighbour as he dandles his baby about and occasionally takes a spoonful or two of some pale slimy nastiness that looks like dead porridge if you can take the conception these two are his only occupations all day long you can hear him singing over the brat when he is not eating or see him eating when he is not keeping baby besides which there comes into his house a continual round of visitors that puts me in mind of the luncheon hour at home as he has thus no ostensible avocation we have named him the ws to give a flavour of respectability to the street  enough of the gasse the weather is here much colder it rained a good deal yesterday and though it is fair and sunshiny again today and we can still sit of course with our windows open yet there is no more excuse for the siesta and the bathe in the river except for cleanliness is no longer a necessity of life the main is very swift in one part of the baths it is next door to impossible to swim against it and i suspect that out in the open it would be quite impossibleadieu my dear mother and believe me ever your affectionate son       robert louis stevenson          rentier     to charles baxter      on the way home with sir walter simpson

blame me not that this epistle     is the first you have from me       idleness has held me fettered       but at last the times are bettered   and once more i wet my whistle     here in france beside the sea    all the green and idle weather     i have had in sun and shower       such an easy warm subsistence       such an indolent existence   i should find it hard to sever     day from day and

you know how they never perish     how in time of later art       memories consecrate and sweeten       these defaced and tempestbeaten   flowers of former years we cherish     half a life against our heart    most those lovefruits withered greenly     those frail sickly amourettes       how they brighten with the distance       take new strength and new existence   till we see them sitting queenly     crowned and courted by regrets    all that loveliest and best is     aureolefashion round their head       they that looked in life but plainly       how they stir our spirits vainly   when they come to us alcestis     like returning from the dead    not the old love but another     bright she comes at memorys call       our forgotten vows reviving       to a newer livelier living   as the dead child to the mother     seems the fairest child of all    thus our goethe sacred master     travelling backward thro his youth       surely wandered wrong in trying       to renew the old undying   loves that cling in memory faster     than they ever lived in truth  so en voilÃ  assez de mauvais vers let us finish with a word or two in honest prose tho indeed i shall so soon be back again and if you be in town as i hope so soon get linked again down the lothian road by a cigar or two and a liquor that it is perhaps scarce worth the postage to send my letter on before me i have just been long enough away to be satisfied and even anxious to get home again and talk the matter over with my friends i shall have plenty to tell you and principally plenty that i do not care to write and i daresay you too will have a lot of gossip what about ferrier is the ljr think you to go naked and unashamed this winter he with his charming idiosyncrasy was in my eyes the vineleaf that preserved our selfrespect all the rest of us are such shadows compared to his fullflavoured personality but i must not spoil my own dÃ©but i am trenching upon one of the essayettes which i propose to introduce as a novelty this year before that august assembly for we must not let it die it is a sickly baby but what with nursing and pap and the like i do not see why it should not have a stout manhood after all and perhaps a green old age eh when we are old if we ever should be that too will be one of those cherished memories i have been so rhapsodizing over we must consecrate our room we must make it a museum of bright recollections so that we may go back there whiteheaded and say vixi after all new countries sun music and all the rest can never take down our gusty rainy smoky grim old city out of the first place that it has been making for itself in the bottom of my soul by all pleasant and hard things that have befallen me for these past twenty years or so my heart is buried theresay in

see bob give him my news or if you have the letter about you let him see itever your affct friend       r l stevenson     to charles baxter      through the jesting tenor of this letter is to be discerned a vein of    more than half serious thinking very characteristic of r l s alike    as youth and man       17 heriot row edinburgh october 1872  my dear baxteri am gumboiled and face swollen to an unprecedented degree it is very depressing to suffer from gibber that cannot be brought to a head i cannot speak it because my face is so swollen and stiff that enunciation must be deliberatea thing your true gibberer cannot hold up his head under and writ gibber is somehow not gibber at all it does not come forth does not flow with that fine irrational freedom that it loves in speechit does not afford relief to the packed bosom  hence i am suffering from suppressed gibberan uneasy complaint and like all cases of suppressed humours this hath a nasty tendency to the brain therefore the more confused i get the more i lean on thuss and hences and therefores you must not be down upon me most noble festus altho this letter should smack of some infirmity of judgment i speak the words of soberness and truth and would you were not almost but altogether as i am except this swelling lord lord if we could change personalities how we should hate it how i should rebel at the office repugn under the ulster coat and repudiate your monkish humours thus unjustly and suddenly thrust upon poor infidel me and as for youwhy my dear charles a mouse that hath its lodging in a cats ear would not be so uneasy as you in your new conditions i do not see how your temperament would come thro the feverish longings to do things that cannot then or perhaps ever be accomplished the feverish unrests and damnable indecisions that it takes all my easygoing spirits to come through a vane can live out anything in the shape of a wind and that is how i can be and am a more serious person than you just as the light french seemed very serious to sterne light l stevenson can afford to bob about over the top of any deep sea of prospect or retrospect where ironclad c baxter would incontinently go down with all hands a fool is generally the wisest person out the wise man must shut his eyes to all the perils and horrors that lie round him but the cap and bells can go bobbing along the most slippery ledges and the bauble will not stir up sleeping lions hurray for motley for a good sound insouciance for a healthy philosophic carelessness  my dear baxter a word in your earscdont you wish you were a foolsc how easy the world would go on with youliterally on castors the only reason a wise man can assign for getting drunk is that he wishes to enjoy for a while the blessed immunities and sunshiny weather of the land of fooldom but a fool who dwells ever there has no excuse at all that is a happy land if you likeand not so far away either take a fools advice and let us strive without ceasing to get into it hark in your ear again they allow people to reason in that land i wish i could take you by the hand and lead you away into its pleasant boundaries there is no customhouse on the frontier and you may take in what books you will there are no manners and customs but men and women grow up like trees in a still wellwalled garden at their own sweet will there is no prescribed or customary follyno motley cap or bauble out of the well of each ones own innate absurdity he is allowed and encouraged freely to draw and to communicate and it is a strange thing how this natural fooling comes so nigh to ones better thoughts of wisdom and stranger still that all this discord of people speaking in their own natural moods and keys masses itself into a far more perfect harmony than all the dismal official unison in which they sing in other countries partsinging seems best all the world over  i who live in england must wear the hackneyed symbols of the profession to show that i have at least consular immunities coming as i do out of another land where they are not so wise as they are here but fancy that god likes what he makes and is not best pleased with us when we deface and dissemble all that he has given us and put about us to one common standard ofhightytightywhen was a jester obliged to finish his sentence i cut so strong a pirouette that all my bells jingle and come down in an attitude with one hand upon my hip the evenings entertainment is overand if our kyind friends  hurrah i feel relieved i have put out my gibber and if you have read thus far you will have taken it in i wonder if you will ever come this length i shall try a trap for you and insult you here on this last page o baxter what a damned humbug you are thereshall this insult bloom

shows exactly in    what spirit he took it       17 heriot row edinburgh sunday february 2 1873  my dear baxterthe thunderbolt has fallen with a vengeance now on friday night after leaving you in the course of conversation my father put me one or two questions as to beliefs which i candidly answered i really hate all lying so much nowa new found honesty that has somehow come out of my late illnessthat i could not so much as hesitate at the time but if i had foreseen the real hell of everything since i think i should have lied as i have done so often before i so far thought of my father but i had forgotten my mother and now they are both ill both silent both as down in the mouth as ifi can find no simile you may fancy how happy it is for me if it were not too late i think i could almost find it in my heart to retract but it is too late and again am i to live my whole life as one falsehood of course it is rougher than hell upon my father but can i help it they dont see either that my game is not the lighthearted scoffer that i am not as they call me a careless infidel i believe as much as they do only generally in the inverse ratio i am i think as honest as they can be in what i hold i have not come hastily to my views i reserve as i told them many points until i acquire fuller information and do not think i am thus justly to be called horrible atheist  now what is to take place what a curse i am to my parents o lord what a pleasant thing it is to have just damned the happiness of probably the only two people who care a damn about you in the world  what is my life to be at this rate what you rascal answeri have a pistol at your throat if all that i hold true and most desire to spread is to be such death and worse than death in the eyes of my father and mother what the devil am i to do  here is a good heavy cross with a vengeance and all rough with rusty nails that tear your fingers only it is not i that have to carry it alone i hold the light end but the heavy burden falls on these two  donti dont know what i was going to say i am an abject idiot which all things considered is not remarkableever your affectionate and horrible atheist       r l

year 1873 was a critical one in stevensons life late in july he went for the second time to pay a visit to cockfield rectory the pleasant suffolk home of his cousin mrs churchill babington and her husband another guest at the same time was mrs sitwellnow my wifean intimate friend and connection by marriage of the hostess i was shortly due to join the party when mrs sitwell wrote telling me of the fine young spirit she had found under her friends roof and suggesting that i should hasten my visit so as to make his acquaintance before he left i came accordingly and from that time on the fine young spirit became a leading interest both in her life and mine he had thrown himself on her sympathies in that troubled hour of his youth with entire dependence almost from the first and clung to her devotedly for the next two years as to an inspirer consoler and guide under her influence he began for the first time to see his way in life and to believe hopefully and manfully in his own powers and future to encourage such hopes further and to lend what hand one could towards their fulfilment became quickly one of the first of cares and pleasures it was impossible not to recognise in this very unacademical type of scottish youth a spirit the most interesting and full of promise his social charm was already at its height and quite irresistible but inwardly he was full of trouble and selfdoubt if he could steer himself or be steered safely through the difficulties of youth and if he could learn to write with half the charm and genius that shone from his presence and conversation there seemed room to hope for the highest from him he went back to edinburgh in the beginning of september full of new hope and heart it had been agreed that while still reading as his parents desired for the bar he should try seriously to get ready for publication some essays which he had already on handone on walt whitman one on john knox one on roads and the spirit of the roadand should so far as possible avoid topics of dispute in the home circle  but after a while the news of him was not favourable those differences with his father which had been weighing almost morbidly upon his highstrung nature were renewed by midoctober his letters told of failing health he came to london and instead of presenting himself as had been proposed to be examined for admission to one of the london inns of court he was forced to consult the late sir andrew clark who found him suffering from acute nerve exhaustion with some threat of danger to the lungs he was ordered to break at once with edinburgh for a time and to spend the winter in a more soothing climate and surroundings he went accordingly to mentone a place he had delighted in as a boy ten years before and during a stay of six months made a slow but for the time being a pretty complete recovery i visited him twice during the winter and the second time found him coming fairly to himself again in the southern peace and sunshine he was busy with the essay ordered south and with that on victor hugos romances which was afterwards his first contribution to the cornhill magazine was full of a thousand dreams and projects for future work and was passing his invalid days pleasantly meanwhile in the companionship of two kind and accomplished russian ladies who took to him warmly and of their children the following record of the time is drawn from his correspondence partly with his parents and partly with myself but chiefly from the journalletters containing a full and intimate record of his daily moods and doings which he was accustomed to send off weekly or oftener to mrs sitwell     to mrs thomas stevenson      this is from his cousins house in suffolk some of the impressions    then received of the contrasts between scotland and england were    later worked out in the essay the foreigner at home printed at the    head of memories and portraits       cockfield rectory sudbury suffolk tuesday july 28 1873  my dear motheri am too happy to be much of a correspondent yesterday we were away to melford and lavenham both exceptionally placid beautiful old english towns melford scattered all round a big green with an elizabethan hall and park great screens of trees that seem twice as high as trees should seem and everything else like what ought to be in a novel and what one never expects to see in reality made me cry out how good we were to live in scotland for the many hundredth time i cannot get over my astonishmentindeed it increases every dayat the hopeless gulf that there is between england and scotland and english and scotch nothing is the same and i feel as strange and outlandish here as i do in france or germany everything by the wayside in the houses or about the people strikes me with an unexpected unfamiliarity i walk among surprises for just where you think you have them something wrong turns up  i got a little law read yesterday and some german this morning but on the whole there are too many amusements going for much work as for correspondence i have neither heart nor time for it today       r l s     to mrs sitwell      after leaving cockfield stevenson spent a few days in london and a    few with me in a cottage i then had at norwood this and the    following letters were written in the next days after his return    home bob in the last paragraph is robert alan mowbray stevenson    an elder cousin to whom louis had been from boyhood devotedly    attached afterwards known as the brilliant paintercritic and author    of velasquez etc       17 heriot row edinburgh monday september 1st 1873  i have arrived as you see without accident but i never had a more wretched journey in my life i could not settle to read anything i bought darwins last book in despair for i knew i could generally read darwin but it was a failure however the book served me in good stead for when a couple of children got in at newcastle i struck up a great friendship with them on the strength of the illustrations these two children a girl of nine and a boy of six had never before travelled in a railway so that everything was a glory to them and they were never tired of watching the telegraph posts and trees and hedges go racing past us to the tail of the train and the girl i found quite entered into the most daring personifications that i could make a little way on about alnmouth they had their first sight of the sea and it was wonderful how loath they were to believe that what they saw was water indeed it was very still and grey and solidlooking under a sky to match it was worth the fare yet a little farther on to see the delight of the girl when she passed into another country with the black tweed under our feet crossed by the lamps of the passenger bridge i remember the first time i had gone into another country over the same river from the other side  bob was not at the station when i arrived but a friend of his brought me a letter and he is to be in the first thing tomorrow do you know i think yesterday and the day before were the two happiest days of my life i would not have missed last month for eternityever yours       r l s     to mrs sitwell      the paper on roads herein mentioned had been planned during walks    at cockfield was offered to and rejected by the saturday review and    ultimately accepted by mr hamerton for the portfolio and was the    first regular or paid contribution of stevenson to periodical    literature       17 heriot row edinburgh saturday september 6 1873  i have been today a very long walk with my father through some of the most beautiful ways hereabouts the day was cold with an iron windy sky and only glorified now and then with autumn sunlight for it is fully autumn with us with a blight already over the greens and a keen wind in the morning that makes one rather timid of ones tub when it finds its way indoors  i was out this evening to call on a friend and coming back through the wet crowded lamplit streets was singing after my own fashion du hast diamanten und perlen when i heard a poor cripple man in the gutter wailing over a pitiful scotch air his clubfoot supported on the other knee and his whole woebegone body propped sideways against a crutch the nearest lamp threw a strong light on his worn sordid face and the three boxes of lucifer matches that he held for sale my own false notes stuck in my chest how well off i am is the burthen of my songs all day longdrum ist so wohl mir in der welt and the ugly reality of the cripple man was an intrusion on the beautiful world in which i was walking he could no more sing than i could and his voice was cracked and rusty and altogether perished to think that that wreck may have walked the streets some night years ago as glad at heart as i was and promising himself a future as golden and honourable  sunday 1120 ami wonder what you are doing nowin church likely at the te deum everything here is utterly silent i can hear mens footfalls streets away the whole life of edinburgh has been sucked into sundry pious edifices the gardens below my windows are steeped in a diffused sunlight and every tree seems standing on tiptoes strained and silent as though to get its head above its neighbours and listen you know what i mean dont you how trees do seem silently to assert themselves on an occasion i have been trying to write roads until i feel as if i were standing on my head but i mean roads and shall do something to them  i wish i could make you feel the hush that is over everything only made the more perfect by rare interruptions and the rich placid light and the still autumnal foliage houses you know stand all about our gardens solid steady blocks of houses all look empty and asleep  monday nightthe drums and fifes up in the castle are sounding the guardcall through the dark and there is a great rattle of carriages without i have had i must tell you my bed taken out of this room so that i am alone in it with my books and two tables and two chairs and a coalskuttle or scuttle  and a dÃ©bris of broken pipes in a corner and my old school playbox so full of papers and books that the lid will not shut down standing reproachfully in the midst there is something in it that is still a little gaunt and vacant it needs a little populous disorder over it to give it the feel of homeliness and perhaps a bit more furniture just to take the edge off the sense of illimitable space eternity and a future state and the like that is brought home to one even in this small attic by the wide empty floor  you would require to know what only i can ever know many grim and many maudlin passages out of my past life to feel how great a change has been made for me by this past summer let me be ever so poor and threadpaper a soul i am going to try for the best  these good booksellers of mine have at last got a werther without illustrations i want you to like charlotte werther himself has every feebleness and vice that could tend to make his suicide a most virtuous and commendable action and yet i like werther tooi dont know why except that he has written the most delightful letters in the world note by the way the passage under date june 21st not far from the beginning it finds a voice for a great deal of dumb uneasy pleasurable longing that we have all had times without number i looked that up the other day for roads so i know the reference but you will find it a garden of flowers from beginning to end all through the passion keeps steadily rising from the thunderstorm at the countryhousethere was thunder in that story tooup to the last wild delirious interview either lotte was no good at all or else werther should have remained alive after that either he knew his woman too well or else he was precipitate but an idiot like that is hopeless and yet he wasnt an idioti make reparation and will offer eighteen pounds of best wax at his tomb poor devil he was only the weakestor at least a very weak strong man       r l s     to mrs sitwell        17 heriot row edinburgh friday september 12 1873   i was over last night contrary to my own wish in leven fife and this morning i had a conversation of which i think some account might interest you i was up with a cousin who was fishing in a milllade and a shower of rain drove me for shelter into a tumbledown steading attached to the mill there i found a labourer cleaning a byre with whom i fell into talk the man was to all appearance as heavy as hÃ©bÃ©tÃ© as any english clodhopper but i knew i was in scotland and launched out forthright into education and politics and the aims of ones life i told him how i had found the peasantry in suffolk and added that their state had made me feel quite pained and downhearted it but to do that he said to onybody that thinks at a then again he said that he could not conceive how anything could daunt or cast down a man who had an aim in life they that have had a guid schoolin and do nae mair whatever they do they have done but him that has aye something ayont need never be weary i have had to mutilate the dialect much so that it might be comprehensible to you but i think the sentiment will keep even through a change of words something of the heartsome ring of encouragement that it had for me and that from a man cleaning a byre you see what john knox and his schools have done  saturdaythis has been a charming day for me from morning to now 5 pm first i found your letter and went down and read it on a seat in those public gardens of which you have heard already after lunch my father and i went down to the coast and walked a little way along the shore between granton and cramond this has always been with me a very favourite walk the firth closes gradually together before you the coast runs in a series of the most beautifully moulded bays hill after hill wooded and softly outlined trends away in front till the two shores join together when the tide is out there are great gleaming flats of wet sand over which the gulls go flying and crying and every cape runs down into them with its little spit of wall and trees we lay together a long time on the beach the sea just babbled among the stones and at one time we heard the hollow sturdy beat of the paddles of an unseen steamer somewhere round the cape i am glad to say that the peace of the day and scenery was not marred by any unpleasantness between us two  i am unhappily off my style and can do nothing well indeed i fear i have marred roads finally by patching at it when i was out of the humour only i am beginning to see something great about john knox and queen mary i like them both so much that i feel as if i could write the history fairly  sundayit has rained and blown chilly out of the east all day this was my first visit to church since the last sunday at cockfield i was alone and read the minor prophets and thought of the past all the time a sentimental calvinist preacheda very odd animal as you may fancyand to him i did not attend very closely all afternoon i worked until halfpast four when i went out under an umbrella and cruised about the empty wet glimmering streets until near dinner time  i have finished roads today and send it off to you to see the lord knows whether it is worth anythingsome of it pleases me a good deal but i fear it is quite unfit for any possible magazine however i wish you to see it as you know the humour in which it was conceived walking alone and very happily about the suffolk highways and byeways on several splendid sunny afternoonsbelieve me ever your faithful friend       robert louis stevenson  mondayi have looked over roads again and i am aghast at its feebleness it is the trial of a very prentice hand indeed shall i ever learn to do anything well however it shall go to you for the reasons given above     to mrs sitwell      after an outpouring about difficulties at home       edinburgh tuesday september 16 1873   i must be very strong to have all this vexation and still to be well i was weighed the other day and the gross weight of my large person was eight stone six does it not seem surprising that i can keep the lamp alight through all this gusty weather in so frail a lantern and yet it burns cheerily  my mother is leaving for the country this morning and my father and i will be alone for the best part of the week in this house then on friday i go south to dumfries till monday i must write small or i shall have a tremendous budget by then  720 pmi must tell you a thing i saw today i was going down to portobello in the train when there came into the next compartment third class an artisan strongly marked with smallpox and with sunken heavy eyesa face hard and unkind and without anything lovely there was a woman on the platform seeing him off at first sight with her one eye blind and the whole cast of her features strongly plebeian and even vicious she seemed as unpleasant as the man but there was something beautifully soft a sort of light of tenderness as on some dutch madonna that came over her face when she looked at the man they talked for a while together through the window the man seemed to have been asking money ye ken the last time she said i gave ye two shillins for your ludgin and ye said it died off into whisper plainly falstaff and dame quickly over again the man laughed unpleasantly even cruelly and said something and the woman turned her back on the carriage and stood a long while so and do what i might i could catch no glimpse of her expression although i thought i saw the heave of a sob in her shoulders at last after the train was already in motion she turned round and put two shillings into his hand i saw her stand and look after us with a perfect heaven of love on her facethis poor oneeyed madonnauntil the train was out of sight but the man sordidly happy with his gains did not put himself to the inconvenience of one glance to thank her for her illdeserved kindness  i have been up at the spec and looked out a reference i wanted the whole town is drowned in white wet vapour off the sea everything drips and soaks the very statues seem wet to the skin i cannot pretend to be very cheerful i did not see one contented face in the streets and the poor did look so helplessly chill and dripping without a stitch to change or so much as a fire to dry themselves at or perhaps money to buy a meal or perhaps even a bed my heart shivers for them  dumfries fridayall my thirst for a little warmth a little sun a little corner of blue sky avails nothing without the rain falls with a long drawn swish and the night is as dark as a vault there is no wind indeed and that is a blessed change after the unruly bedlamite gusts that have been charging against one round street corners and utterly abolishing and destroying all that is peaceful in life nothing sours my temper like these coarse termagant winds i hate practical joking and your vulgarest practical joker is your flaw of wind  i have tried to write some verses but i find i have nothing to say that has not been already perfectly said and perfectly sung in adelaÃ¯de i have so perfect an idea out of that song the great alps a wonder in the starlightthe river strong from the hills and turbulent and loudly audible at nightthe country a scented frÃ¼hlingsgarten of orchards and deep wood where the nightingales harboura sort of german flavour over alland this lovedrunken man wandering on by sleeping village and silent town pours out of his full heart einst o wunder einst etc i wonder if i am wrong about this being the most beautiful and perfect thing in the worldthe only marriage of really accordant words and musicboth drunk with the same poignant unutterable sentiment  today in glasgow my father went off on some business and my mother and i wandered about for two hours we had lunch together and were very merry over what the people at the restaurant would think of usmother and son they could not suppose us to be  saturdayand today it camewarmth sunlight and a strong hearty living wind among the trees i found myself a new being my father and i went off a long walk through a country most beautifully wooded and various under a range of hills you should have seen one place where the wood suddenly fell away in front of us down a long steep hill between a double row of trees with one small fairhaired child framed in shadow in the foreground and when we got to the foot there was the little kirk and kirkyard of irongray among broken fields and woods by the side of the bright rapid river in the kirkyard there was a wonderful congregation of tombstones upright and recumbent on four legs after our scotch fashion and of flatarmed firtrees one gravestone was erected by scott at a cost i learn of Â£70 to the poor woman who served him as heroine in the heart of midlothian and the inscription in its stiff jedediah cleishbotham fashion is not without something touching7 we went up the stream a little further to where two covenanters lie buried in an oakwood the tombstone as the custom is containing the details of their grim little tragedy in funnily bad rhyme one verse of which sticks in my memory    we died their furious rage to stay    near to the kirk of irongray  we then fetched a long compass round about through holywood kirk and lincluden ruins to dumfries but the walk came sadly to grief as a pleasure excursion before our return  sundayanother beautiful day my father and i walked into dumfries to church when the service was done i noted the two halberts laid against the pillar of the churchyard gate and as i had not seen the little weekly pomp of civic dignitaries in our scotch country towns for some years i made my father wait you should have seen the provost and three bailies going stately away down the sunlit street and the two town servants strutting in front of them in red coats and cocked hats and with the halberts most conspicuously shouldered we saw burnss housea place that made me deeply sadand spent the afternoon down the banks of the nith i had not spent a day by a river since we lunched in the meadows near sudbury the air was as pure and clear and sparkling as spring water beautiful graceful outlines of hill and wood shut us in on every side and the swift brown river fled smoothly away from before our eyes rippled over with oily eddies and dimples white gulls had come up from the sea to fish and hovered and flew hither and thither among the loops of the stream by good fortune too it was a dead calm between my father and me do you know i find these rows harder on me than ever i get a funny swimming in the head when they come on that i had not beforeand the like when i think of them       r l s     to mrs sitwell        edinburgh monday 22nd september 1873  i have just had another disagreeable tonight it is difficult indeed to steer steady among the breakers i am always touching ground generally it is my own blame for i cannot help getting friendly with my father whom i do love and so speaking foolishly with my mouth i have yet to learn in ordinary conversation that reserve and silence that i must try to unlearn in the matter of the feelings  the news that roads would do reached me in good season i had begun utterly to despair of doing anything certainly i do not think i should be in a hurry to commit myself about the covenanters the whole subject turns round about me and so branches out to this side and that that i grow bewildered and one cannot write discreetly about any one little corner of an historical period until one has an organic view of the whole i have howevergiven life and healthgreat hope of my covenanters indeed there is a lot of precious dust to be beaten out of that stack even by a very infirm hand  much lateri can scarcely see to write just now so please excuse we have had an awful scene all that my father had to say has been put forthnot that it was anything new only it is the devil to hear i dont know what to dothe world goes hopelessly round about me there is no more possibility of doing living being anything but a beast and theres the end of it  it is eleven i think for a clock struck o lord there has been a deal of time through our hands since i went down to supper all this has come from my own folly i somehow could not think the gulf so impassable and i read him some notes on the duke of argyll8i thought he would agree so far and that we might have some rational discussion on the rest and nowafter some hourshe has told me that he is a weak man and that i am driving him too far and that i know not what i am doing o dear god this is bad work  i have lit a pipe and feel calmer i say my dear friend i am killing my fatherhe told me tonight by the way that i alienated utterly my motherand this is the result of my attempt to start fair and fresh and to do my best for all of them  i must wait till tomorrow ere i finish i am tonight too excited  tuesdaythe sun is shining today which is a great matter and altogether the gale having blown off again i live in a precarious lull on the whole i am not displeased with last night i kept my eyes open through it all and i think not only avoided saying anything that could make matters worse in the future but said something that may do good but a little better or a little worse is a trifle i lay in bed this morning awake for i was tired and cold and in no special hurry to rise and heard my father go out for the papers and then i lay and wishedo if he would only whistle when he comes in again but of course he did not i have stopped that pipe  now you see i have written to you this time and sent it off for both of which god forgive meever your faithful friend r l s  my father and i together can put about a year through in half an hour look here you mustnt take this too much to heart i shall be all right in a few hours its impossible to depress me and of course when you cant do anything theres no need of being depressed its all waste tissue       l     to mrs sitwell        edinburgh wednesday september 24th 1873  i have found another flowering isle all this beautiful quiet sunlit day i have been out in the country down by the sea on my favourite coast between granton and queensferry there was a delicate delicious haze over the firth and sands on one side and on the other was the shadow of the woods all riven with great golden rifts of sunshine a little faint talk of waves upon the beach the wild strange crying of seagulls over the sea and the hoarse woodpigeons and shrill sweet robins full of their autumn lovemaking among the trees made up a delectable concerto of peaceful noises i spent the whole afternoon among these sights and sounds with simpson and we came home from queensferry on the outside of the coach and four along a beautiful way full of ups and downs among woody uneven country laid out fifty years ago i suppose by my grandfather on the notion of hogarths line of beauty you see my taste for roads is hereditary  fridayi was wakened this morning by a long flourish of bugles and a roll upon the drumsthe rÃ©veillÃ© at the castle i went to the window it was a grey quiet dawn a few people passed already up the street between the gardens already i heard the noise of an early cab somewhere in the distance most of the lamps had been extinguished but not all and there were two or three lit windows in the opposite faÃ§ade that showed where sick people and watchers had been awake all night and knew not yet of the new cool day this appealed to me with a special sadness how often in the old times my nurse and i had looked across at these and sympathised  i wish you would read michelets louis quatorze et la rÃ©vocation de lÃ‰dit de nantes i read it out in the garden and the autumnal trees and weather and my own autumnal humour and the pitiable prolonged tragedies of madame and of moliÃ¨re as they look darkling and sombre out of their niches in the great gingerbread faÃ§ade of the grand Ã‚ge go wonderfully hand in hand  i wonder if my revised paper has pleased the saturday if it has not i shall be rather sorryno very sorry indeedbut not surprised and certainly not hurt it will be a great disappointment but i am glad to say that among all my queasy troublesome feelings i have not a sensitive vanity not that i am not as conceited as you know me to be only i go easy over the coals in that matter  i have been out reading hallam in the garden and have been talking with my old friend the gardener a man of singularly hard favour and few teeth he consulted me this afternoon on the choice of books premising that his taste ran mainly on war and travel on travel i had to own at once my ignorance i suggested kinglake but he had read that and so finding myself here unhorsed i turned about and at last recollected southeys lives of the admirals and the volumes of macaulay containing the wars of william can you think of any other for this worthy man i believe him to hold me in as high an esteem as any one can do and i reciprocate his respect for he is quite an intelligent companion  on saturday morning i read morleys article aloud to bob in one of the walks of the public garden i was full of it and read most excitedly and we were ever as we went to and fro passing a bench where a man sat reading the bible aloud to a small circle of the devout this man is well known to me sits there all day sometimes reading sometimes singing sometimes distributing tracts bob laughed much at the opposition preachersi never noticed it till he called my attention to the other but it did not seem to me like oppositiondoes it to youeach in his way was teaching what he thought best  last night after reading walt whitman a long while for my attempt to write about him i got tÃªtemontÃ©e rushed out up to m s came in took out leaves of grass and without giving the poor unbeliever time to object proceeded to wade into him with favourite passages i had at least this triumph that he swore he must read some more of himever your faithful friend       louis stevenson     to mrs sitwell      on the question of the authorship of the ode to the cuckoo which    burke thought the most beautiful lyric in our language the debate    was between the claims of john logan minister of south leith    17451785 and his friend and fellowworker michael bruce those of    logan have i believe been now vindicated past doubt       edinburgh saturday october 4 1873  it is a little sharp today but bright and sunny with a sparkle in the air which is delightful after four days of unintermitting rain in the streets i saw two men meet after a long separation it was plain they came forward with a little run and leaped at each others hands you never saw such bright eyes as they both had it put one in a good humour to see it  8 pmi made a little more out of my work than i have made for a long while back though even now i cannot make things fall into sentencesthey only sprawl over the paper in bald orphan clauses then i was about in the afternoon with baxter and we had a good deal of fun first rhyming on the names of all the shops we passed and afterwards buying needles and quack drugs from openair vendors and taking much pleasure in their inexhaustible eloquence every now and then as we went arthurs seat showed its head at the end of a street now today the blue sky and the sunshine were both entirely wintry and there was about the hill in these glimpses a sort of thin unreal crystalline distinctness that i have not often seen excelled as the sun began to go down over the valley between the new town and the old the evening grew resplendent all the gardens and lowlying buildings sank back and became almost invisible in a mist of wonderful sun and the castle stood up against the sky as thin and sharp in outline as a castle cut out of paper baxter made a good remark about princes street that it was the most elastic street for length that he knew sometimes it looks as it looked tonight interminable a way leading right into the heart of the red sundown sometimes again it shrinks together as if for warmth on one of the withering clear eastwindy days until it seems to lie underneath your feet  i want to let you see these verses from an ode to the cuckoo written by one of the ministers of leith in the middle of last centurythe palmy days of edinburghwho was a friend of hume and adam smith and the whole constellation the authorship of these beautiful verses has been most truculently fought about but whoever wrote them and it seems as if this logan had they are lovely    what time the pea puts on the bloom      thou fliest the vocal vale    an annual guest in other lands      another spring to hail     sweet bird thy bower is ever green      thy sky is ever clear    thou hast no sorrow in thy song      no winter in thy year     o could i fly id fly with thee      wed make on joyful wing    our annual visit oer the globe      companions of the spring  sundayi have been at church with my mother where we heard arise shine sung excellently well and my mother was so much upset with it that she nearly had to leave church this was the antidote however to fifty minutes of solid sermon varra heavy i have been sticking in to walt whitman nor do i think i have ever laboured so hard to attain so small a success still the thing is taking shape i think i know a little better what i want to say all through and in process of time possibly i shall manage to say it i must say i am a very bad workman mais jai du courage i am indefatigable at rewriting and bettering and surely that humble quality should get me on a little  monday october 6it is a magnificent glimmering moonlight night with a wild great west wind abroad flapping above one like an immense banner and every now and again swooping furiously against my windows the wind is too strong perhaps and the trees are certainly too leafless for much of that wide rustle that we both remember there is only a sharp angry sibilant hiss like breath drawn with the strength of the elements through shut teeth that one hears between the gusts only i am in excellent humour with myself for i have worked hard and not altogether fruitlessly and i wished before i turned in just to tell you that things were so my dear friend i feel so happy when i think that you remember me kindly i have been up tonight lecturing to a friend on life and duties and what a man could do a coal off the altar had been laid on my lips and i talked quite above my average and hope i spread what you would wish to see spread into one persons heart and with a new light upon it  i shall tell you a story last friday i went down to portobello in the heavy rain with an uneasy wind blowing par rafales off the sea or en rafales should it be or what as i got down near the beach a poor woman oldish and seemingly lately at least respectable followed me and made signs she was drenched to the skin and looked wretched below wretchedness you know i did not like to look back at her it seemed as if she might misunderstand and be terribly hurt and slighted so i stood at the end of the streetthere was no one else within sight in the wetand lifted up my hand very high with some money in it i heard her steps draw heavily near behind me and when she was near enough to see i let the money fall in the mud and went off at my best walk without ever turning round there is nothing in the story and yet you will understand how much there is if one chose to set it forth you see she was so ugly and you know there is something terribly miserably pathetic in a certain smile a certain sodden aspect of invitation on such faces it is so terrible that it is in a way sacred it means the outside of degradation and what is worst of all in life false position i hope you understand me rightlyever your faithful friend       robert louis stevenson     to mrs sitwell        edinburgh tuesday october 14 1873  my father has returned in better health and i am more delighted than i can well tell you the one trouble that i can see no way through is that his health or my mothers should give way tonight as i was walking along princes street i heard the bugles sound the recall i do not think i had ever remarked it before there is something of unspeakable appeal in the cadence i felt as if something yearningly cried to me out of the darkness overhead to come thither and find rest one felt as if there must be warm hearts and bright fires waiting for one up there where the buglers stood on the damp pavement and sounded their friendly invitation forth into the night  wednesdayi may as well tell you exactly about my health i am not at all ill have quite recovered only i am what mm les mÃ©decins call below par which in plain english is that i am weak with tonics decent weather and a little cheerfulness that will go away in its turn and i shall be all right again  i am glad to hear what you say about the exam until quite lately i have treated that pretty cavalierly for i say honestly that i do not mind being plucked i shall just have to go up again we travelled with the lord advocate the other day and he strongly advised me in my fathers hearing to go to the english bar and the lord advocates advice goes a long way in scotland it is a sort of special legal revelation dont misunderstand me i dont of course want to be plucked but so far as my style of knowledge suits them i cannot make much betterment on it in a month if they wish scholarship more exact i must take a new lease altogether  thursdaymy head and eyes both gave in this morning and i had to take a day of complete idleness i was in the open air all day and did no thought that i could avoid and i think i have got my head between my shoulders again however i am not going to do much i dont want you to run away with any fancy about my being ill given a person weak and in some trouble and working longer hours than he is used to and you have the matter in a nutshell you should have seen the sunshine on the hill today it has lost now that crystalline clearness as if the medium were springwater you see i am stupid but it retains that wonderful thinness of outline that makes the delicate shape and hue savour better in ones mouth like fine wine out of a finelyblown glass the birds are all silent now but the crows i sat a long time on the stairs that lead down to duddingston locha place as busy as a great town during frost but now solitary and silent and when i shut my eyes i heard nothing but the wind in the trees and you know all that went through me i dare say without my saying it  11i am now all right i do not expect any tic tonight and shall be at work again tomorrow i have had a day of open air only a little modified by le capitaine fracasse before the diningroom fire i must write no more for i am sleepy after two nights to quote my book sinon blanches du moins grises and so i must go to bed and faithfully hoggishly slumberyour faithful       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin      on the advice of the lord advocate it had been agreed that stevenson    should present himself for admission as a student at one of the    london inns of court and should come to town after the middle of    october to be examined for that purpose the following two letters    refer to this purpose and to the formalities required for effecting    it       edinburgh oct 15 1873 wednesday  my dear colvinof course i knew as well as you that i was merely running before an illness but i thought i should be in time to escape however i was knocked over on monday night with a bad sore throat fever rheumatism and a threatening of pleurisy which last is i think gone i still hope to be able to get away early next week though i am not very clear as to how i shall manage the journey if i dont get away on wednesday at latest i lose my excuse for going at all and i do wish to escape a little while  i shall see about the form when i get home which i hope will be tomorrow i was taken ill in a friends house and have not yet been moved  how could a brokendown engineer expect to make anything of roads requiescant when we get well and if we get well we shall do something betteryours sincerely       r l stevenson  ye couche of pain     to sidney colvin        edinburgh october 16 1873 thursday  my dear colvini am at my wits end about this abominable form of admission i dont know what the devil it is i havent got one even if i did and so cant sign  monday night is the very earliest on which even if i go on mending at the very great pace i have made already i can hope to be in london myself but possibly it is only intimation that requires to be made on tuesday morning and one may possess oneself of a form of admission up to the eleventh hour i send herewith a letter which i must ask you to cherish as i count it a sort of talisman perhaps you may understand it i dont  if you dont understand it please do not trouble and we must just hope that tuesday morning will be early enough to do all of course i fear the exam will spin me indeed after this bodily and spiritual crisis i should not dream of coming up at all only that i require it as a pretext for a moments escape which i want much  i am so glad that roads has got in i had almost as soon have it in the portfolio as the saturday the p is so nicely printed and i am gourmet in type i dont know how to thank you for your continual kindness to me and i am afraid i do not even feel grateful enoughyou have let your kindnesses come on me so easilyyours sincerely       louis stevenson     to mrs sitwell      when stevenson a few days later came to london it was before the    physicians and not the lawyers that he must present himself and the    result of an examination by sir andrew clark was his prompt and    peremptory despatch to mentone for a winters rest and sunshine at a    distance from all causes of mental agitation this episode of his    life gave occasion to the essay ordered south the only one of his    writings in which he took the invalid point of view or allowed his    health troubles in any degree to colour his work travelling south by    slow stages he wrote on the way a long diaryletter from which    extracts  follow       avignon november 1873  i have just read your letter upon the top of the hill beside the church and castle the whole air was filled with sunset and the sound of bells and i wish i could give you the least notion of the southernness and provenÃ§ality of all that i saw  i cannot write while i am travelling cest un dÃ©faut but so it is i must have a certain feeling of being at home and my head must have time to settle the new images oppress me and i have a fever of restlessness on me you must not be disappointed at such shabby letters and besides remember my poor head and the fanciful crawling in the spine  i am back again in the stage of thinking there is nothing the matter with me which is a good sign but i am wretchedly nervous anything like rudeness i am simply babyishly afraid of and noises and especially the sounds of certain voices are the devil to me a blind poet whom i found selling his immortal works in the streets of sens captivated me with the remarkable equable strength and sweetness of his voice and i listened a long while and bought some of the poems and now this voice after i had thus got it thoroughly into my head proved false metal and a really bad and horrible voice at bottom it haunted me some time but i think i am done with it now  i hope you dont dislike reading bad style like this as much as i do writing it it hurts me when neither words nor clauses fall into their places much as it would hurt you to sing when you had a bad cold and your voice deceived you and missed every other note i do feel so inclined to break the pen and write no more and here Ã propos begins my back  after dinnerit blows tonight from the north down the valley of the rhone and everything is so cold that i have been obliged to indulge in a fire there is a fine crackle and roar of burning wood in the chimney which is very homely and companionable though it does seem to postulate a town all white with snow outside  i have bought saintebeuves chateaubriand and am immensely delighted with the critic chateaubriand is more antipathetic to me than anyone else in the world  i begin to wish myself arrived tonight travelling when one is not quite well has a good deal of unpleasantness one is easily upset by cross incidents and wants that belle humeur and spirit of adventure that makes a pleasure out of what is unpleasant  tuesday november 11ththere theres a date for you i shall be in mentone for my birthday with plenty of nice letters to read i went away across the rhone and up the hill on the other side that i might see the town from a distance avignon followed me with its bells and drums and bugles for the old city has no equal for multitude of such noises crossing the bridge and seeing the brown turbid water foam and eddy about the piers one could scarce believe ones eyes when one looked down upon the stream and saw the smooth blue mirroring tree and hill over on the other side the sun beat down so furiously on the white road that i was glad to keep in the shadow and when the occasion offered to turn aside among the oliveyards it was nine years and six months since i had been in an oliveyard i found myself much changed not so gay but wiser and more happy i read your letter again and sat awhile looking down over the tawny plain and at the fantastic outline of the city the hills seemed just fainting into the sky even the great peak above carpentras lord knows how many metres above the sea seemed unsubstantial and thin in the breadth and potency of the sunshine  i should like to stay longer here but i cant i am driven forward by restlessness and leave this afternoon about two i am just going out now to visit again the church castle and hill for the sake of the magnificent panorama and besides because it is the friendliest spot in all avignon to me  lateryou cannot picture to yourself anything more steeped in hard bright sunshine than the view from the hill the immovable inky shadow of the old bridge on the fleeting surface of the yellow river seemed more solid than the bridge itself just in the place where i sat yesterday evening a shaven man in a velvet cap was studying musicevidently one of the singers for la muette de portici at the theatre tonight i turned back as i went away the white christ stood out in strong relief on his brown cross against the blue sky and the four kneeling angels and lanterns grouped themselves about the foot with a symmetry that was almost laughable the musician read on at his music and counted time with his hand on the stone step  menton november 12thmy first enthusiasm was on rising at orange and throwing open the shutters such a great living flood of sunshine poured in upon me that i confess to having danced and expressed my satisfaction aloud in the middle of which the boots came to the door with hot water to my great confusion  today has been one long delight coming to a magnificent climax on my arrival here i gave up my baggage to an hotel porter and set off to walk at once i was somewhat confused as yet as to my directions for the station of course was new to me and the hills had not sufficiently opened out to let me recognise the peaks suddenly as i was going forward slowly in this confusion of mind i was met by a great volley of odours out of the lemon and orange gardens and the past linked on to the present and in a moment in the twinkling of an eye the whole scene fell before me into order and i was at home i nearly danced again  i suppose i must send off this tonight to notify my arrival in safety and goodhumour and i think in good health before relapsing into the old weekly vein i hope this time to send you a weekly dose of sunshine from the south instead of the jet of snell edinburgh east wind that used to wasever your faithful friend       r l s     to mrs thomas stevenson        hÃ´tel du pavillon menton november 13 1873  my dear motherthe place is not where i thought it is about where the old post office was the hÃ´tel de londres is no more an hotel i have found a charming room in the hÃ´tel du pavillon just across the road from the princes villa it has one window to the south and one to the east with a superb view of mentone and the hills to which i move this afternoon in the old great place there is a kiosque for the sale of newspapers a string of omnibuses perhaps thirty go up and down under the planetrees of the turin road on the occasion of each train the promenade has crossed both streams and bids fair to reach the cap martin the old chapel near freemans house at the entrance to the gorbio valley is now entirely submerged under a shining new villa with pavilion annexed over which in all the pride of oak and chestnut and divers coloured marbles i was shown this morning by the obliging proprietor the princes palace itself is rehabilitated and shines afar with white windowcurtains from the midst of a garden all trim borders and greenhouses and carefully kept walks on the other side the villas are more thronged together and they have arranged themselves shelf after shelf behind each other i see the glimmer of new buildings too as far eastward as grimaldi and a viaduct carries i suppose the railway past the mouth of the bone caves f bacon lord chancellor made the remark that time was the greatest innovator it is perhaps as meaningless a remark as was ever made but as bacon made it i suppose it is better than any that i could make does it not seem as if things were fluid they are displaced and altered in ten years so that one has difficulty even with a memory so very vivid and retentive for that sort of thing as mine in identifying places where one lived a long while in the past and which one has kept piously in mind during all the interval nevertheless the hills i am glad to say are unaltered though i dare say the torrents have given them many a shrewd scar and the rains and thaws dislodged many a boulder from their heights if one were only keen enough to perceive it the sea makes the same noise in the shingle and the lemon and orange gardens still discharge in the still air their fresh perfume and the people have still brown comely faces and the pharmacie gros still dispenses english medicines and the invalids eheu still sit on the promenade and trifle with their fingers in the fringes of shawls and wrappers and the shop of pascal amarante still in its present bright consummate flower of aggrandisement and new paint offers everything that it has entered into peoples hearts to wish for in the idleness of a sanatorium and the chÃ¢teau des morts is still at the top of the town and the fort and the jetty are still at the foot only there are now two jetties andi am out of breath to be continued in our next  for myself i have come famously through the journey and as i have written this letter for the first time for ever so long with ease and even pleasure i think my head must be better i am still no good at coming down hills or stairs and my feet are more consistently cold than is quite comfortable but these apart i feel well and in good spirits all round  i have written to nice for letters and hope to get them tonight continue to address poste restante take care of yourselves  this is my birthday by the wayo i said that before adieuever your affectionate son       r l stevenson     to mrs sitwell        menton november 13 1873  i must pour out my disgust at the absence of a letter my birthday nearly gone and devil a letteri beg pardon after all now i think of it it is only a week since i left  i have here the nicest room in mentone let me explain ah theres the bell for the table dhÃ´te now to see if there is anyone conversable within these walls  in the interval my letters have come none from you but one from bob which both pained and pleased me he cannot get on without me at all he writes he finds that i have been the whole world for him that he only talked to other people in order that he might tell me afterwards about the conversation should ii really dont know quite what to feel i am so much astonished and almost more astonished that he should have expressed it than that he should feel it he never would have said it i know i feel a strange sense of weight and responsibilityever your faithful friend r l s     to mrs sitwell      in the latter part of this letter will be found the germ of the essay    ordered south       menton sunday november 23 1873  my dear friendi sat a long while up among the olive yards today at a favourite corner where one has a fair view down the valley and on to the blue floor of the sea i had a horace with me and read a little but horace when you try to read him fairly under the open heaven sounds urban and you find something of the escaped townsman in his descriptions of the country just as somebody said that morriss seapieces were all taken from the coast i tried for long to hit upon some language that might catch ever so faintly the indefinable shifting colour of olive leaves and above all the changes and little silverings that pass over them like blushes over a face when the wind tosses great branches to and fro but the muse was not favourable a few birds scattered here and there at wide intervals on either side of the valley sang the little broken songs of late autumn and there was a great stir of insect life in the grass at my feet the path up to this coign of vantage where i think i shall make it a habit to ensconce myself a while of a morning is for a little while common to the peasant and a little clear brooklet it is pleasant in the tempered grey daylight of the olive shadows to see the people picking their way among the stones and the water and the brambles the women especially with the weights poised on their heads and walking all from the hips with a certain graceful deliberation  tuesdayi have been to nice today to see dr bennet he agrees with clark that there is no disease but i finished up my day with a lamentable exhibition of weakness i could not remember french or at least i was afraid to go into any place lest i should not be able to remember it and so could not tell when the train went at last i crawled up to the station and sat down on the steps and just steeped myself there in the sunshine until the evening began to fall and the air to grow chilly this long rest put me all right and i came home here triumphantly and ate dinner well there is the full true and particular account of the worst day i have had since i left london i shall not go to nice again for some time to come  thursdayi am today quite recovered and got into mentone today for a book which is quite a creditable walk as an intellectual being i have not yet begun to reexist my immortal soul is still very nearly extinct but we must hope the best now do take warning by me i am set up by a beneficent providence at the corner of the road to warn you to flee from the hebetude that is to follow being sent to the south is not much good unless you take your soul with you you see and my soul is rarely with me here i dont see much beauty i have lost the key i can only be placid and inert and see the bright days go past uselessly one after another therefore dont talk foolishly with your mouth any more about getting liberty by being ill and going south viÃ¢ the sickbed it is not the old freeborn bird that gets thus to freedom but i know not what manacled and hidebound spirit incapable of pleasure the clay of a man go south why i saw more beauty with my eyes healthfully alert to see in two wet windy february afternoons in scotland than i can see in my beautiful olive gardens and grey hills in a whole week in my low and lost estate as the shorter catechism puts it somewhere it is a pitiable blindness this blindness of the soul i hope it may not be long with me so remember to keep well and remember rather anything than not to keep well and again i say anything rather than not to keep well  not that i am unhappy mind you i have found the words alreadyplacid and inert that is what i am i sit in the sun and enjoy the tingle all over me and i am cheerfully ready to concur with any one who says that this is a beautiful place and i have a sneaking partiality for the newspapers which would be all very well if one had not fallen from heaven and were not troubled with some reminiscence of the ineffable aurore  to sit by the sea and to be conscious of nothing but the sound of the waves and the sunshine over all your body is not unpleasant but i was an archangel once  fridayif you knew how old i felt i am sure this is what age brings with itthis carelessness this disenchantment this continual bodily weariness i am a man of seventy o medea kill me or make me young again9  today has been cloudy and mild and i have lain a great while on a bench outside the garden wall my usual place now and looked at the dovecoloured sea and the broken roof of cloud but there was no seeing in my eye let us hope tomorrow will be more profitable       r l s     to mrs sitwell      the history of the scruples and ideas of duty in regard to money    expressed in the following letter is set forth and further explained    in retrospect in the fragment called lay morals written in 1879    the walt whitman essay here mentioned is not that afterwards printed    in men and books but an earlier and more enthusiastic version mr    dowson of whom stevenson lost sight after these riviera days was    the father of the unfortunate poet ernest dowson his acquaintance    was the first result of stevensons search for anyone conversable    in the hotel       menton sunday november 30 1873  my dear friendtoday is as hot as it has been in the sun and as i was a little tired and seedy i went down and just drank in sunshine a strong wind has risen out of the west the great big dead leaves from the roadside planes scuttled about and chased one another over the gravel round me with a noise like little waves under the keel of a boat and jumped up sometimes on to my lap and into my face i lay down on my back at last and looked up into the sky the white corner of the hotel with a wide projection at the top stood out in dazzling relief and there was nothing else save a few of the plane leaves that had got up wonderfully high and turned and eddied and flew here and there like little pieces of gold leaf to break the extraordinary sea of blue it was bluer than anything in the world here wonderfully blue and looking deeply peaceful although in truth there was a high wind blowing  i am concerned about the plane leaves hitherto it has always been a great feature to see these trees standing up head and shoulders and chesthead and body in factabove the wonderful bluegreygreens of the olives in one glory of red gold much more of this wind and the gold i fear will be all spent  920i must write you another little word i have found here a new friend to whom i grow daily more devotedgeorge sand i go on from one novel to another and think the last i have read the most sympathetic and friendly in tone until i have read another it is a life in dreamland have you read mademoiselle merquem  mondayi did not quite know last night what to say to you about mlle merquem if you want to be unpleasantly moved read it  i am gloomy and out of spirits tonight in consequence of a ridiculous scene at the table dhÃ´te where a parson whom i rather liked took offence at something i said and we had almost a quarrel it was mopped up and stifled like spilt wine with a napkin but it leaves an unpleasant impression  i have again ceased all work because i felt that it strained my head a little and so i have resumed the tedious task of waiting with folded hands for better days but thanks to george sand and the sunshine i am very jolly  that last word was so much out of key that i could sit no longer and went away to seek out my clergyman and apologise to him he was gone to bed i dont know what makes me take this so much to heart i suppose its nerves or pride or something but i am unhappy about it i am going to drown my sorrows in consuelo and burn some incense in my pipe to the god of contentment and forgetfulness  i do not know but i hope if i can only get better i shall be a help to you soon in every way and no more a trouble and burthen all my difficulties about life have so cleared away the scales have fallen from my eyes and the broad road of my duty lies out straight before me without cross or hindrance i have given up all hope all fancy rather of making literature my hold i see that i have not capacity enough my life shall be if i can make it my only business i am desirous to practise now rather than to preach for i know that i should ever preach badly and men can more easily forgive faulty practice than dull sermons if colvin does not think that i shall be able to support myself soon by literature i shall give it up and go horrible as the thought is to me into an office of some sort the first and main question is that i must live by my own hands after that come the others  you will not regard me as a madman i am sure it is a very rational aberration at least to try to put your beliefs into practice strangely enough it has taken me a long time to see this distinctly with regard to my whole creed but i have seen it at last praised be my sickness and my leisure i have seen it at last the sun of my duty has risen i have enlisted for the first time and after long coquetting with the shilling under the banner of the holy ghost10  815if you had seen the moon last night it was like transfigured sunshine as clear and mellow only showing everything in a new wonderful significance the shadows of the leaves on the road were so strangely black that dowson and i had difficulty in believing that they were not solid or at least pools of dark mire and the hills and the trees and the white italian houses with lit windows o nothing could bring home to you the keenness and the reality and the wonderful unheimlichkeit of all these when the moon rises every night over the italian coast it makes a long path over the sea as yellow as gold  how i happened to be out in the moonlight yesterday was that dowson and i spent the evening with an odd man called bates who played italian music to us with great feeling all which was quite a dissipation in my still existence  fridayi cannot endure to be dependent much longer it stops my mouth something i must find shortly i mean when i am able for anything however i am much better already and have been writing not altogether my worst although not very well walt whitman is stopped i have bemired it so atrociously by working at it when i was out of humour that i must let the colour dry and alas what i have been doing in its place doesnt seem to promise any money however it is all practice and it interests myself extremely i have now received Â£80 some Â£55 of which still remain all this is more debt to civilisation and my fellowmen when shall i be able to pay it back you do not know how much this money question begins to take more and more importance in my eyes every day it is an old phrase of mine that money is the atmosphere of civilised life and i do hate to take the breath out of other peoples nostrils i live here at the rate of more than Â£3 a week and i do nothing for it if i didnt hope to get well and do good work yet and more than repay my debts to the world i should consider it right to invest an extra franc or two in laudanum but i will repay italways your faithful friend       robert louis stevenson     to charles baxter        menton december 1873  my dear baxterat last i must write i must say straight out that i am not recovering as i could wish i am no stronger than i was when i came here and i pay for every walk beyond say a quarter of a mile in length by one or two or even three days of more or less prostration therefore let nobody be down upon me for not writing i was very thankful to you for answering my letter and for the princely action of simpson in writing to me i mean before i had written to him i was ditto to an almost higher degree i hope one or another of you will write again soon and remember i still live in hope of reading grahame murrays address  i have not made a joke upon my living soul since i left london o except one a very small one that i had made before and that i very timidly repeated in a halfexhilarated state towards the close of dinner like one of those deadalive flies that we see pretending to be quite light and full of the frivolity of youth in the first sunshiny days it was about mothers meetings and it was damned small and it was my ewe lambthe lord knows i couldnt have made another to save my lifeand a clergyman quarrelled with me and there was as nearly an explosion as could be this has not fostered my leaning towards pleasantry i felt that it was a very cold hard world that night  my dear charles is the sky blue at mentone was that your question well it depends upon what you call blue its a question of taste i suppose is the sky blue you poor critter you never saw blue sky worth being called blue in the same day with it and i should rather fancy that the sun did shine i should and the moon doesnt shine either o no this last is sarcastic mentone is one of the most beautiful places in the world and has always had a very warm corner in my heart since first i knew it eleven years ago  11th decemberi live in the same hotel with lord x he has black whiskers and has been successful in raising some kids rather a melancholy success they are weedy looking kids in highland clo they have a tutor with them who respires piety and that kind of humble yourlordshipsmostobedient sort of gentlemanliness that noblemens tutors have generally they all get livings these men and silvery hair and a gold watch from their attached pupil and they sit in the porch and make the watch repeat for their little grandchildren and tell them long stories beginning when i was private tutor in the family of etc and the grandchildren cock snooks at them behind their backs and go away whenever they can to get the groom to teach them bad words  sidney colvin will arrive here on saturday or sunday so i shall have someone to jaw with and seriously this is a great want i have not been all these weeks in idleness as you may fancy without much thinking as to my future and i have a great deal in view that may or may not be possible that i do not yet know but that is at least an object and a hope before me i cannot help recurring to seriousness a moment before i stop for i must say that living here a good deal alone and having had ample time to look back upon my past i have become very serious all over if i can only get back my health by god i shall not be as useless as i have beenever yours mon vieux       robert louis stevenson     to mrs sitwell        menton december 1873 sunday  the first violet there is more sweet trouble for the heart in the breath of this small flower than in all the wines of all the vineyards of europe i cannot contain myself i do not think so small a thing has ever given me such a princely festival of pleasure i feel as if my heart were a little bunch of violets in my bosom and my brain is pleasantly intoxicated with the wonderful odour i suppose i am writing nonsense but it does not seem nonsense to me is it not a wonderful odour is it not something incredibly subtle and perishable it is like a wind blowing to one out of fairyland no one need tell me that the phrase is exaggerated if i say that this violet sings it sings with the same voice as the march blackbird and the same adorable tremor goes through ones soul at the hearing of it  mondayall yesterday i was under the influence of opium i had been rather seedy during the night and took a dose in the morning and for the first time in my life it took effect upon me i had a day of extraordinary happiness and when i went to bed there was something almost terrifying in the pleasures that besieged me in the darkness wonderful tremors filled me my head swam in the most delirious but enjoyable manner and the bed softly oscillated with me like a boat in a very gentle ripple it does not make me write a good style apparently which is just as well lest i should be tempted to renew the experiment and some verses which i wrote turn out on inspection to be not quite equal to kubla khan however i was happy and the recollection is not troubled by any reaction this morning  wednesdaydo you know i think i am much better i really enjoy things and i really feel dull occasionally neither of which was possible with me before and though i am still tired and weak i almost think i feel a stirring among the dry bones o i should like to recover and be once more well and happy and fit for work and then to be able to begin really to my life to have done for the rest of time with preluding and doubting and to take hold of the pillars strongly with samsonto burn my ships with whoever did it o i begin to feel my spirits come back to me again at the thought  thursdayi sat along the beach this morning under some reeds or canesi know not which they are everything was so tropical nothing visible but the glaring white shingle the blue sea the blue sky and the green plumes of the canes thrown out against the latter some ten or fifteen feet above my head the noise of the surf alone broke the quiet i had somehow got ueber allen gipfeln ist ruh into my head and i was happy for i do not know how long sitting there and repeating to myself these lines it is wonderful how things somehow fall into a full satisfying harmony and out of the fewest elements there is established a sort of small perfection it was so this morning i did not want anything further     to mrs sitwell      in the third week of december i went out to join my friend for a part    of the christmas vacation and found him without tangible disease    but very weak and ailing illhealth and anxiety however neither    then nor at any time diminished his charm as a companion he left    mentone to meet me at the old town of monaco where we spent a few    days and from whence these stray notes of nature and human nature    were written       monaco tuesday december 1873  we have been out all day in a boat lovely weather and almost dead calm only the most infinitesimal and indeterminate of oscillations moved us hither and thither the sails were duly set and flapped about idly overhead our boatman was a man of a delightful humour who told us many tales of the sea notably one of a doctor who was an englishman and who seemed almost an epitome of vicesdrunken dishonest and utterly without faith and yet he was a charmant garÃ§on he told us many amusing circumstances of the doctors incompetence and dishonesty and imitated his accent with a singular success i couldnt quite see that he was a charming garÃ§ono ouicomme caractÃ¨re un charmant garÃ§on we landed on that cap martin the place of firs and rocks and myrtle and rosemary of which i spoke to you as we pulled along in the fresh shadow the wonderfully clean scents blew out upon us as if from islands of spiceonly how much better than cloves and cinnamon  fridaycolvin and i are sitting on a seat on the battlemented gardens of old monaco the day is grey and clouded with a little red light on the horizon and the sea hundreds of feet below us is a sort of purple dovecolour shrubgeraniums firs and aloes cover all available shelves and terraces and where these become impossible the prickly pear precipitates headlong downwards its bunches of oval plates so that the whole face of the cliff is covered with an arrested fall please excuse clumsy language a sort of fall of the evil angels petrified midway on its career white gulls sail past below us every now and then sometimes singly sometimes by twos and threes and sometimes in a great flight the sharp perfume of the shrubgeraniums fills the air  i cannot write in any sense of the word but i am as happy as can be and wish to notify the fact before it passes the sea is blue grey purple and green very subdued and peaceful earlier in the day it was marbled by small keen specks of sun and larger spaces of faint irradiation but the clouds have closed together now and these appearances are no more voices of children and occasional crying of gulls the mechanical noise of a gardener somewhere behind us in the scented thicket and the faint report and rustle of the waves on the precipice far below only break in upon the quietness to render it more complete and perfect       robert louis stevenson     to mrs thomas stevenson      after spending a few days in one of the more retired hotels of monte    carlo we went on to mentone and settled at the hotel mirabeau long    since i believe defunct near the eastern extremity of the town    the little american girl mentioned in the last paragraph is the same    we shall meet later under her full name of marie johnstone       hotel mirabeau menton january 2nd 1874  here i am over in the east bay of mentone where i am not altogether sorry to find myself i move so little that i soon exhaust the immediate neighbourhood of my dwelling places our reason for coming here was however very simple hobsons choice mentone during my absence has filled marvellously  continue to address p r11 menton and try to conceive it as possible that i am not a drivelling idiot when i wish an address changed it is quite on the cards that i shall be able to find language explicit enough to express the desire my whole desire is to avoid complication of addresses it is quite fatal if two p rs have contradictory orders they will continue to play battledoor and shuttlecock with an unhappy epistle which will never get farther afield but perish there miserably  you act too much on the principle that whatever i do is done unwisely and that whatever i do not has been culpably forgotten this is wounding to my natral vanity  i have not written for three days i think but what days they were very cold and i must say i was able thoroughly to appreciate the blessings of mentone old smoko this winter would evidently have been very summary with me i could not stand the cold at all i exhausted all my own and all colvins clothing i then retired to the house and then to bed in a condition of sorrow for myself unequalled the sun is forth again laus deo and the wind is milder and i am greatly reestablished a certain asperity of temper still lingers however which colvin supports with much mildness  in this hotel i have a room on the first floor luxury however is not altogether regardless of expense we only pay 13 francs per day312 more than at the pavillon on the third floorand beggars must not be choosers we were very nearly houseless the night we came and it is rarely that such winds of adversity blow men into kings palaces  looking over what has gone before it seems to me that it is not strictly polite i beg to withdraw all that is offensive  at table dhÃ´te we have some people who amuse us much two americans who would try to pass for french people and their daughter the most charming of little girls both colvin and i have planned an abduction already the whole hotel is devoted to her and the waiters continually do smuggle out comfits and fruit and pudding to her  all wellever your affectionate son       robert louis stevenson     to mrs thomas stevenson      the mlaren herein mentioned was of course the distinguished scotch    politician and social reformer duncan mlaren for sixteen years    mp for edinburgh       menton sunday january 4 1874  my dear motherwe have here fallen on the very pink of hotels i do not say that it is more pleasantly conducted than the pavillon for that were impossible but the rooms are so cheery and bright and new and then the food i never i think so fully appreciated the phrase the fat of the land as i have done since i have been here installed there was a dish of eggs at dÃ©jeÃ»ner the other day over the memory of which i lick my lips in the silent watches  now that the cold has gone again i continue to keep well in body and already i begin to walk a little more my head is still a very feeble implement and easily set aspinning and i can do nothing in the way of work beyond reading books that may i hope be of some use to me afterwards  i was very glad to see that mlaren was sat upon and principally for the reason why deploring as i do much of the action of the trades unions these conspiracy clauses and the whole partiality of the master and servant act are a disgrace to our equal laws equal laws become a byeword when what is legal for one class becomes a criminal offence for another it did my heart good to hear that man tell mlaren how as he had talked much of getting the franchise for working men he must now be content to see them use it now they had got it this is a smooth stone well planted in the foreheads of certain dilettanti radicals after mlarens fashion who are willing to give the working men words and wind and votes and the like and yet think to keep all the advantages just or unjust of the wealthier classes without abatement i do hope wise men will not attempt to fight the working men on the head of this notorious injustice any such step will only precipitate the action of the newly enfranchised classes and irritate them into acting hastily when what we ought to desire should be that they should act warily and little for many years to come until education and habit may make them the more fit  all this intended for my father is much after the fashion of his own correspondence i confess it has left my own head exhausted i hope it may not produce the same effect on yours but i want him to look really into this question both sides of it and not the representations of rabid middleclass newspapers sworn to support all the little tyrannies of wealth and i know he will be convinced that this is a case of unjust law and that however desirable the end may seem to him he will not be jesuit enough to think that any end will justify an unjust law  here ends the political sermon of your affectionate and somewhat dogmatical son       robert louis stevenson     to mrs thomas stevenson      in the first week of january i went for some necessary work to paris    with the intention of returning towards the end of the month the    following letter introduces the russian sisters madame zassetsky    and madame garschine whose society and that of their children was to    do so much to cheer stevenson during his remaining months on the    riviera the french painter robinet sometimes in his day known as    le raphael des cailloux from the minuteness of detail which he put    into his provenÃ§al coast landscapes was a chivalrous and    affectionate soul in whom r l s delighted in spite of his fervent    clerical and royalist opinions       menton january 7 1874  my dear motheri received yesterday two most charming lettersthe nicest i have had since i leftdecember 26th and january 1st this morning i got january 3rd  into the bargain with marie the american girl who is grace itself and comes leaping and dancing simply like a wavelike nothing else and who yesterday was queen out of the epiphany cake and chose robinet the french painter as her favori with the most pretty confusion possibleinto the bargain with marie we have two little russian girls with the youngest of whom a little polyglot button of a threeyear old i had the most laughable little scene at lunch today i was watching her being fed with great amusement her face being as broad as it is long and her mouth capable of unlimited extension when suddenly her eye catching mine the fashion of her countenance was changed and regarding me with a really admirable appearance of offended dignity she said something in italian which made everybody laugh much it was explained to me that she had said i was very polisson to stare at her after this she was somewhat taken up with me and after some examination she announced emphatically to the whole table in german that i was a mÃ¤dchen which word she repeated with shrill emphasis as though fearing that her proposition would be called in questionmÃ¤dchen mÃ¤dchen mÃ¤dchen mÃ¤dchen this hasty conclusion as to my sex she was led afterwards to revise i am informed but her new opinion which seems to have been something nearer the truth was announced in a third language quite unknown to me and probably russian to complete the scroll of her accomplishments she was brought round the table after the meal was over and said goodbye to me in very commendable english  the weather i shall say nothing about as i am incapable of explaining my sentiments upon that subject before a lady but my health is really greatly improved i begin to recognise myself occasionally now and again not without satisfaction  please remember me very kindly to professor swan i wish i had a story to send him but story lord bless you i have none to tell sir unless it is the foregoing adventure with the little polyglot the best of that depends on the significance of polisson which is beautifully out of place  saturday 10th januarythe little russian kid is only two and a half she speaks six languages she and her sister Ã¦t 8 and may johnstone Ã¦t 8 are the delight of my life last night i saw them all dancingo it was jolly kids are what is the matter with me after the dancing we allthat is the two russian ladies robinet the french painter mr and mrs johnstone two governesses and fitful kids joining us at intervalsplayed a game of the stool of repentance in the gallic idiom  oi have not told you that colvin is gone however he is coming back again has left clothes in pawn to meever your affectionate son       robert louis stevenson     to mrs thomas stevenson        menton sunday 11th january 1874  in many ways this hotel is more amusing than the pavillon there are the children to begin with and then there are games every eveningthe stool of repentance question and answer etc and then we speak french although that is not exactly an advantage in so far as personal brilliancy is concerned  i am in lovely health again today iwalked as far as the pont st louis very nearly besides walking and knocking about among the olives in the afternoon i do not make much progress with my french but i do make a little i think i was pleased with my success this evening though i do not know if others shared the satisfaction  the two russian ladies are from georgia all the way they do not at all answer to the description of georgian slaves however being graceful and refined and only goodlooking after you know them a bit  please remember me very kindly to the jenkins and thank them for having asked about me tell mrs j that i am engaged perfecting myself in the gallic idiom in order to be a worthier vatel for the future monsieur folletÃ© our host is a vatel by the way he cooks himself and is not insensible to flattery on the score of his table i began of course to complain of the wine part of the routine of life at mentone i told him that where one found a kitchen so exquisite one astonished oneself that the wine was not up to the same form et voilÃ  prÃ©cisÃ©ment mon cÃ´tÃ© faible monsieur he replied with an indescribable amplitude of gesture que voulezvous moi je suis cuisinier it was as though shakespeare called to account for some such peccadillo as the bohemian seaport should answer magnificently that he was a poet so folletÃ© lives in a golden zone of a certain sorta golden or rather torrid zone whence he issues twice daily purple as to his faceand all these clouds and vapours and ephemeral winds pass far below him and disturb him not  he has another hobby howeverhis garden round which it is his highest pleasure to lead the unwilling guest whenever he is not in the kitchen he is hanging round loose seeking whom he may show his garden to much of my time is passed in studiously avoiding him and i have brought the art to a very extreme pitch of perfection the fox often hunted becomes waryever your affectionate son       robert louis stevenson       to mrs sitwell        menton tuesday 13th january 1874   i lost a philipine to little mary johnstone last night so today i sent her a rubbishing dolls toilet and a little note with it with some verses telling how happy children made every one near them happy also and advising her to keep the lines and some day when she was grown a stately demoiselle it would make her glad to know she gave pleasure long ago all in a very lame fashion with just a note of prose at the end telling her to mind her doll and the dog and not trouble her little head just now to understand the bad verses for some time when she was ill as i am now they would be plain to her and make her happy she has just been here to thank me and has left me very happy children are certainly too good to be true  yesterday i walked too far and spent all the afternoon on the outside of my bed went finally to rest at nine and slept nearly twelve hours on the stretch bennet the doctor when told of it this morning augured well for my recovery he said youth must be putting in strong of course i ought not to have slept at all as it was i dreamed horridly but not my usual dreams of social miseries and misunderstandings and all sorts of crucifixions of the spirit but of good cheery physical thingsof long successions of vaulted dimly lit cellars full of black water in which i went swimming among toads and unutterable cold blind fishes now and then these cellars opened up into sort of domed musichall places where one could land for a little on the slope of the orchestra but a sort of horror prevented one from staying long and made one plunge back again into the dead waters then my dream changed and i was a sort of siamese pirate on a very high deck with several others the ship was almost captured and we were fighting desperately the hideous engines we used and the perfectly incredible carnage that we effected by means of them kept me cheery as you may imagine especially as i felt all the time my sympathy with the boarders and knew that i was only a prisoner with these horrid malays then i saw a signal being given and knew they were going to blow up the ship i leaped right off and heard my captors splash in the water after me as thick as pebbles when a bit of river bank has given way beneath the foot i never heard the ship blow up but i spent the rest of the night swimming about some piles with the whole sea full of malays searching for me with knives in their mouths they could swim any distance under water and every now and again just as i was beginning to reckon myself safe a cold hand would be laid on my ankleugh  however my long sleep troubled as it was put me all right again and i was able to work acceptably this morning and be very jolly all day this evening i have had a great deal of talk with both the russian ladies they talked very nicely and are bright likable women both they come from georgia  wednesday 1030we have all been to tea tonight at the russians villa tea was made out of a samovar which is something like a small steam engine and whose principal advantage is that it burns the fingers of all who lay their profane touch upon it after tea madame z played russian airs very plaintive and pretty so the evening was muscovite from beginning to end madame gs daughter danced a tarantella which was very pretty  whenever nelitchka criesand she never cries except from painall that one has to do is to start malbrook sen vaten guerre she cannot resist the attraction she is drawn through her sobs into the air and in a moment there is nellie singing with the glad look that comes into her face always when she sings and all the tears and pain forgotten  it is wonderful before i shut this up how that child remains ever interesting to me nothing can stale her infinite variety and yet it is not very various you see her thinking what she is to do or to say next with a funny grave air of reserve and then the face breaks up into a smile and it is probably berecchino said with that sudden little jump of the voice that one knows in children as the escape of a jackinthebox and somehow i am quite happy after that       r l s     to mrs sitwell        menton january 1874 wednesday  my dear friendit is still so cold i cannot tell you how miserable the weather is i have begun my walt whitman again seriously many winds have blown since i last laid it down when sickness took me in edinburgh it seems almost like an illconsidered jest to take up these old sentences written by so different a person under circumstances so different and try to string them together and organise them into something anyway whole and comely it is like continuing another mans book almost every word is a little out of tune to me now but i shall pull it through for all that and make something that will interest you yet on this subject that i had proposed to myself and partly planned already before i left for cockfield last july  i am very anxious to hear how you are my own health is quite very good i am a healthy octogenarian very old i thank you and of course not so active as a young man but hale withal a lusty december this is so such is r l s  i am a little bothered about bob a little afraid that he is living too poorly the fellow he chums with spends only two francs a day on food with a little excess every day or two to keep body and soul together and though bob is not so austere i am afraid he draws it rather too fine himself  fridaywe have all got our photographs it is pretty fair they say of me and as they are particular in the matter of photographs and besides partial judges i suppose i may take that for proven of nellie there is one quite adorable the weather is still cold my walt whitman at last looks really well i think it is going to get into shape in spite of the long gestation  sundaystill cold and grey and a high imperious wind off the sea i see nothing particularly couleur de rose this morning but i am trying to be faithful to my creed and hope o yes one can do something to make things happier and better and to give a good example before men and show them how goodness and fortitude and faith remain undiminished after they have been stripped bare of all that is formal and outside we must do that you have done it already and i shall follow and shall make a worthy life and you must live to approve of me       r l s     to mrs sitwell      the following are two different impressions of the mediterranean    dated on two different mondays in  january  yes i am much better very much better i think i may say although it is funny how i have ceased to be able to write with the improvement of my health do you notice how for some time back you have had no descriptions of anything the reason is that i cant describe anything no words come to me when i see a thing i want awfully to tell you today about a little piece of green sea and gulls and clouded sky with the usual golden mountainbreaks to the southward it was wonderful the sea near at hand was living emerald the white breasts and wings of the gulls as they circled abovehigh above evenwere dyed bright green by the reflection and if you could only have seen or if any right word would only come to my pen to tell you how wonderfully these illuminated birds floated hither and thither under the grey purples of the sky                                       today has been windy but not cold the sea was troubled and had a fine fresh saline smell like our own seas and the sight of the breaking waves and above all the spray that drove now and again in my face carried me back to storms that i have enjoyed o how much in other places still as madame zassetsky justly remarked there is something irritating in a stormy sea whose waves come always to the same spot and never farther it looks like playing at passion it reminds one of the loathsome sham waves in a stage ocean     to sidney colvin        menton january 1874  my dear colvini write to let you know that my cousin may possibly come to paris before you leave he will likely look you up to hear about me etc i want to tell you about him before you see him as i am tired of people misjudging him you know me now well bob is just such another mutton only somewhat farther wandered he has all the same elements of character that i have no two people were ever more alike only that the world has gone more unfortunately for him although more evenly besides which he is really a gentleman and an admirable true friend which is not a common article i write this as a letter of introduction in case he should catch you ere you leave  mondayno letters today sacrÃ© chien dieu de dieuand i have written with exemplary industry but i am hoping that no news is good news and shall continue so to hope until all is blueever yours       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin      it had been a very cold christmas at monaco and monte carlo and    stevenson had no adequate overcoat so it was agreed that when i went    to paris i should try and find him a warm cloak or wrap i amused    myself looking for one suited to his taste for the picturesque and    piratical in apparel and found one in the style of 183040 dark    blue and flowing and fastening with a snake buckle       menton january 1874 friday  my dear colvinthank you very much for your note this morning i am stupid again can do nothing at all am no good comme plumitif i think it must be the cold outside at least that would explain my addled head and intense laziness  o why did you tell me about that cloak why didnt you buy it isnt it in julius cÃ¦sar that pompey blamesno not pompey but a friend of pompeyswell pompeys friend i mean the friend of pompeyblames somebody else who was his friendthat is who was the friend of pompeys friendbecause he the friend of pompeys friend had not done something right off but had come and asked him pompeys friend whether he the friend of pompeys friend ought to do it or no there i fold my hands with some complacency thats a piece of very good narration i am getting into good form these classical instances are always distracting i was talking of the cloak its awfully dear are there no cheap and nasty imitations think of thatif however it were the opinion ahem of competent persons that the great cost of the mantle in question was no more than proportionate to its durability if it were to be a joy for ever if it would cover my declining years and survive me in anything like integrity for the comfort of my executors ifi have the wordif the price indicates as it seems the quality of perdurability in the fabric if in fact it would not be extravagant but only the leariest economy to lay out Â£5  15  in a single mantle without seam and without price and ifand ifit really fastens with an agrafei would buy it but not unless if not a cheap imitation would be the moveever yours       r l s     to mrs thomas stevenson      the following is in answer to a set of numbered questions of which    the first three are of no general interest       menton monday january 19th 1874  answers to a series of questions                                       4 nelitchka or nelitska as you know already by this time is my adorable kids name her laugh does more good to ones health than a month at the seaside as she said today herself when asked whether she was a boy or a girl after having denied both with gravity she is an angel  5 o no her brain is not in a chaos it is only the brains of those who hear her it is all plain sailing for her she wishes to refuse or deny anything and there is the english no fank you ready to her hand she wishes to admire anything and there is the german schÃ¶n she wishes to sew which she does with admirable seriousness and clumsiness and there is the french coudre she wishes to say she is ill and there is the russian bulla she wishes to be down on any one and there is the italian berecchino she wishes to play at a railway train and there is her own original word collie say the o with a sort of gaelic twirl and all these words are equally good  7 i am called m stevenson by everybody except nelitchka who calls me m berecchino  8 the weather today is no end as bright and as warm as ever i have been out on the beach all afternoon with the russians madame garschine has been reading russian to me and i cannot tell prose from verse in that delectable tongue which is a pity johnson came out to tell us that corsica was visible and there it was over a white sweltering sea just a little darker than the pallid blue of the sky and when one looked at it closely breaking up into sunbrightened peaks  i may mention that robinet has never heard an englishman with so little accent as i haveahemahemehwhat do you say to that i dont suppose i have said five sentences in english today all french all bad french alas  i am thought to be looking better madame zassetsky said i was all green when i came here first but that i am all right in colour now and she thinks fatter i am very partial to the russians i believe they are rather partial to me i am supposed to be an esprit observateur Ã€ mon age cest Ã©tonnant comme je suis observateur  the second volume of clÃ©ment marot has come where and o where is the firstever your affectionate       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin      the bottle here mentioned is a story that had been some time in    hand called the curate of anstruthers bottle afterwards abandoned    like so many early attempts of the same kind       menton january 1874  my dear s ci suppose this will be my last note then i think you will find everything very jolly here i am very jolly myself i worked six hours today i am occupied in transcribing the bottle which is pleasant work to me i find much in it that i still think excellent and much that i am doubtful about my convention is so terribly difficult that i have to put out much that pleases me and much that i still preserve i only preserve with misgiving i wonder if my convention is not a little too hard and too much in the style of those decadent curiosities poems without the letter e poems going with the alphabet and the like and yet the idea if rightly understood and treated as a convention always and not as an abstract principle should not so much hamper one as it seems to do the idea is not of course to put in nothing but what would naturally have been noted and remembered and handed down but not to put in anything that would make a person stop and sayhow could this be known without doubt it has the advantage of making one rely on the essential interest of a situation and not cocker up and validify feeble intrigue with incidental fine writing and scenery and pyrotechnic exhibitions of inappropriate cleverness and sensibility i remember bob once saying to me that the quadrangle of edinburgh university was a good thing and our having a talk as to how it could be employed in different arts i then stated that the different doors and staircases ought to be brought before a reader of a story not by mere recapitulation but by the use of them by the descent of different people one after another by each of them and that the grand feature of shadow and the light of the one lamp in the corner should also be introduced only as they enabled people in the story to see one another or prevented them and finally that whatever could not thus be worked into the evolution of the action had no right to be commemorated at all after all it is a story you are telling not a place you are to describe and everything that does not attach itself to the story is out of place  this is a lecture not a letter and it seems rather like sending coals to newcastle to write a lecture to a subsidised professor i hope you have seen bob by this time i know he is anxious to meet you and i am in great anxiety to know what you think of his prospectsfrankly of course as for his person i dont care a damn what you think of it i am casehardened in that matter  i wrote a french note to madame zassetsky the other day and there were no errors in it the complete gaul as you may seeever yours       robert louis stevenson     to mrs sitwell        menton january 1874   last night i had a quarrel with the american on politics it is odd how it irritates you to hear certain political statements made he was excited and he began suddenly to abuse our conduct to america i of course admitted right and left that we had behaved disgracefully as we had until somehow i got tired of turning alternate cheeks and getting duly buffeted and when he said that the alabama money had not wiped out the injury i suggested in language i remember of admirable directness and force that it was a pity they had taken the money in that case he lost his temper at once and cried out that his dearest wish was a war with england whereupon i also lost my temper and thundering at the pitch of my voice i left him and went away by myself to another part of the garden a very tender reconciliation took place and i think there will come no more harm out of it we are both of us nervous people and he had had a very long walk and a good deal of beer at dinner that explains the scene a little but i regret having employed so much of the voice with which i have been endowed as i fear every person in the hotel was taken into confidence as to my sentiments just at the very juncture when neither the sentiments nor perhaps the language had been sufficiently considered  fridayyou have not yet heard of my bookfour great scotsmenjohn knox david hume robert burns walter scott these their lives their work the social media in which they lived and worked with if i can so make it the strong current of the race making itself felt underneath and throughoutthis is my idea you must tell me what you think of it the knox will really be new matter as his life hitherto has been disgracefully written and the events are romantic and rapid the character very strong salient and worthy much interest as to the future of scotland and as to that part of him which was truly modern under his hebrew disguise hume of course the urbane cheerful gentlemanly letterwriting eighteenth century full of attraction and much that i dont yet know as to his work burns the sentimental side that there is in most scotsmen his poor troubled existence how far his poems were his personally and how far national the question of the framework of society in scotland and its fatal effect upon the finest natures scott again the ever delightful man sane courageous admirable the birth of romance in a dawn that was a sunset snobbery

and brevity the signature is good but not original  i should rather think i had lost my heart to the wee princess her mother demanded the other day Ã€ quand les noces which mrs stevenson will translate for you in case you dont see it yourself  i had a political quarrel last night with the american it was a real quarrel for about two minutes we relieved our feelings and separated but a mutual feeling of shame led us to a most moving reconciliation in which the american vowed he would shed his best blood for england in looking back upon the interview i feel that i have learned something i scarcely appreciated how badly england had behaved and how well she deserves the hatred the americans bear her it would have made you laugh if you could have been present and seen your unpatriotic son thundering anathemas in the moonlight against all those that were not the friend of england johnson being nearly as nervous as i we were both very ill after it which added a further pathos to the reconciliation  there is no good in sending this off today as i have sent another letter this morning already  o a remark of the princesss amused me the other day somebody wanted to give

the post has been at its old games a letter of the 31st and one of the 2nd arrive at the same moment  i have had a great pleasure mrs andrews had a book of scotch airs which i brought over here and set madame z to work upon they are so like russian airs that they cannot contain their astonishment i was quite out of my mind with delight the flowers of the forestauld lang synescots wha haewandering williejock o hazeldeanmy boy tammie which my father whistles so ofteni had no conception how much i loved them the air which pleased madame zassetsky the most was hey johnnie cope are ye waukin yet it is certainly no end and i was so proud that they were appreciated no triumph of my own i am sure could ever give me such vainglorious satisfaction you remember perhaps how conceited i was to find auld lang syne popular in its german dress but even that was nothing to the pleasure i had yesterday at the success of our dear airs  the edition is called the songs of scotland without words for the pianoforte edited by j t surenne published by wood in george street as these people have been so kind to me i wish you would get a copy of this and send it out if that should be too dear or anything mr mowbray would be able to tell you what is the best substitute would he not this i really would like you to do as madame proposes to hire a copyist to copy those she likes and so it is evident she wants themever your affectionate son       robert louis stevenson     to thomas stevenson      with reference to the political allusions in the following it will be    remembered that this was the date of mr gladstones dissolution    followed by his defeat at the polls notwithstanding his declared    intention of abolishing the incometax       menton february 1st 1874  i am so sorry to hear of poor mr ms death he was really so amiable and kind that no one could help liking him and carrying away a pleasant recollection of his simple happy ways i hope you will communicate to all the family how much i feel with them  madame zassetsky is nelitchkas mamma they have both husbands and they are in russia and the ladies are both here for their health they make it very pleasant for me here today we all went a drive to the cap martin and the cap was adorable in the splendid sunshine  i read j h a macdonalds speech with interest his sentiments are quite good i think i would support him against mlaren at once what has disgusted me most as yet about this election is the detestable proposal to do away with the income tax is there no shame about the easy classes will those who have nine hundred and ninetynine thousandths of the advantage of our society never consent to pay a single tax unless it is to be paid also by those who have to bear the burthen and heat of the day with almost none of the reward and the selfishness here is detestable because it is so deliberate a man may not feel poverty very keenly and may live a quiet selfpleasing life in pure thoughtlessness but it is quite another matter when he knows thoroughly what the issues are and yet wails pitiably because he is asked to pay a little more even if it does fall hardly sometimes than those who get almost none of the benefit it is like the healthy child crying because they do not give him a goody as they have given to his sick brother to take away the taste of the dose i have not expressed myself clearly but for all that you ought to understand i think  friday february 6ththe wine has arrived and a dozen of it has been transferred to me it is much better than folletÃ©s stuff we had a masquerade last night at the villa marina nellie in a little red satin cap in a red satin suit of boys clothes with a funny little black tail that stuck out behind her and wagged as she danced about the room and gave her a look of puss in boots pella as a contadina monsieur robinet as an old woman and mademoiselle as an old lady with blue spectacles  yesterday we had a visit from one of whom i had often heard from mrs sellarandrew lang he is goodlooking delicate oxfordish etc  my cloak is the most admirable of all garments for warmth unequalled for a sort of pensive roman stateliness sometimes warming into romantic guitarism it is simply without concurrent it starts alone if you could see me in my cloak it would impress you i am hugely better i think i stood the cold these last few days without trouble instead of taking to bed as i did at monte carlo i hope you are going to send the scotch music  i am stupid at letterwriting again i dont know why i hope it may not be permanent in the meantime you must take what you can get and be hopeful the russian ladies are as kind and nice as everever your affectionate son       robert louis stevenson     to mrs sitwell        menton february 6 1874 friday  last night we had a masquerade at the villa marina pella was dressed as a contadina and looked beautiful and little nellie in red satin cap and wonderful red satin jacket and little breeches as of a nondescript impossible boy to which madame garschine had slily added a little black tail that wagged comically behind her as she danced about the room and got deliriously tilted up over the middle bar of the back of her chair as she sat at tea with an irresistible suggestion of puss in bootswell nellie thus masqueraded to get back to my sentence again was all that i could have imagined she held herself so straight and stalwart and had such an infinitesimal dignity of carriage and then her big baby face already quite definitely marked with her sex came in so funnily atop that she got clear away from all my power of similes and resembled nothing in the world but nellie in masquerade then there was robinet in a white night gown old womans cap mutch in my vernacular snuffbox and crutch doubled up and yet leaping and gyrating about the floor with incredible agility and lastly mademoiselle in a sort of elderly walkingdress and with blue spectacles and all this incongruous impossible world went tumbling and dancing and going hand in hand in flying circles to the music until it was enough to make one forget one was in this wicked world with conservative majorities and presidents macmahon and all other abominations about one  also last night will be memorable to me for another reason madame zassetsky having given me a light as to my own intellect they were talking about things in history remaining in their minds because they had assisted them to generalisations and i began to explain how things remained in my mind yet more vividly for no reason at all she got interested and made me give her several examples then she said with her little falsetto of discovery mais cest que vous Ãªtes tout simplement enfant this mot i have reflected on at leisure and there is some truth in it long may i be so yesterday too i finished ordered south and at last had some pleasure and contentment with it s c has sent it off to macmillans this morning and i hope it may be accepted i dont care whether it is or no except for the allimportant lucre the end of it is good whether the able editor sees it or noever your faithful friend

only consolation i can offer you  madame garschine is ill i am sorry to say and was confined to bed all yesterday which made a great difference to our little society Ã€ propos of which what keeps me here is just precisely the said society these people are so nice and kind and intelligent and then as i shall never see them any more i have a disagreeable feeling about making the move with ordinary people in england you have more or less chance of reencountering one another at least you may see their death in the papers but with these people they die for me and i die for them when we separate

soft warm cloudy and soft again in provincial sense very interesting i find robertson and dugald stewarts life of him a source of unquenchable laughter dugald stewart is not much better than mccrie12 and puts me much in mind of him by the way i want my father to find out whether any more of knoxs works was ever issued than the five volumes as i have them there are some letters that i am very anxious to see not printed in any of the five and perhaps still in ms  i suppose you are now home again in auld reekie that abode of bliss does not much attract me yet a bit  colvin leaves at the end of this week i fancy  how badly yours sincerely writes o madame zassetsky has a theory that dumbarton drums is an epitome of my character and talents she plays it and goes into ecstasies over it taking everybody to witness that each note as she plays it is the moral of berecchino berecchino is my stereotype name in the world now i am announced as m berecchino a german handmaiden came to the hotel the other night asking for m berecchino said handmaiden supposing in good faith that sich was my name  your letter come o i am all right now about the parting because it will not be death as we are to write of course the correspondence will drop off but thats no odds it breaks the back of the troubleever your affectionate son       robert louis stevenson     to mrs thomas stevenson        menton monday march 9th 1874  we have all been getting photographed and the proofs are to be seen today how they will look i know not madame zassetsky arranged me for mine and then said to the photographer cest mon fils il vient davoir dixneuf ans il est tout fier de sa jeune moustache tÃ¢chez de la faire paraÃ®tre and then bolted leaving me solemnly alone with the artist the artist was quite serious and explained that he would try to faire ressortir ce que veut madame la princesse to the best of his ability he bowed very much to me after this in quality of prince you see i bowed in

and spain i am certainly in no humour and in no state of health for voyages and travels towards the end of may see end up to which time i seem to see my plans i might be up to it or i might not i think not myself i have given up all idea of going on to italy though it seems a pity when one is so near and spain seems to me in the same category but for all that it need not interfere with your voyage thither i would not lose the chance if i wanted  iv moneyi am much obliged that makes Â£180 now this money irks me one feels it more than when living at home however if i have health i am in a fair way to make a bit of a livelihood for myself now please dont take this up wrong dont suppose i am thinking of the transaction between you and me i think of the transaction between me and mankind i think of all this money wasted in keeping up a structure that may never be worth itall this good money sent after bad i shall be seriously angry if you take me up wrong  v roadsthe familiar false

incapacity to write  the only new cloud on my horizon i mean this in no menacing sense is the prince i have philosophical and artistic discussions with the prince he is capable of talking for two hours upon end developing his theory of everything under heaven from his first position which is that there is no straight line doesnt that sound like a game of my fathersi beg your pardon you havent read iti dont mean my father i mean tristram shandys he is very clever and it is an immense joke to hear him unrolling all the problems of lifephilosophy science what you willin this charmingly cutanddry hereweareagain kind of manner he is better to listen to than to argue withal when you differ from him he lifts up his voice and thunders and you know that the thunder of an excited foreigner often miscarries one stands aghast marvelling how such a colossus of a man in such a great commotion of spirit can open his mouth so much and emit such a still small voice at the hinder end of it all all this while he walks about the room smokes cigarettes occupies divers chairs for divers brief spaces and casts his huge arms to the four winds like the sails of a mill he is a most sportive prince

again between the eyes  today i hadnt arranged all my plans till five oclock i hired a poor old cabman whose uncomfortable vehicle and sorry horse make everyone despise him and set off to get money and say farewells it was a dark misty evening the mist was down over all the hills the peachtrees in beautiful pink bloom arranged my plans that merits a word by the way if i can be bothered i have half arranged to go to gÃ¶ttingen in summer to a course of lectures galitzin is responsible for this he tells me the professor is to law what darwin has been to natural history and i should like to understand roman law and a knowledge of law is so necessary for all i hope to do  my poor old cabman his one horse made me threequarters of an hour too late for dinner but i had not the heart to discharge him and take another poor soul he was so pleased with his pourboire i have made madame zassetsky promise to employ him often so he will be something the better for me little as he will know

paris in may 1874 stevenson went to live with his parents at swanston and edinburgh and resumed his reading for the bar illness and absence had done their work and the old harmony of the home was henceforth quite reestablished in his spare time during the next year he worked hard at his chosen art trying his hand at essays short stories criticisms and prose poems in all this experimental writing he had neither the aims nor the facility of the journalist but strove always after the higher qualities of literature and was never satisfied with what he had done to find for all he had to say words of vital aptness and animationto communicate as much as possible of what he has somewhere called the incommunicable thrill of thingswas from the first his endeavour in literature nay more it was the main passion of his life and the instrument that should serve his purpose could not be forged in haste neither was it easy for this past master of the random the unexpected the brilliantly backforemost and topsyturvy in talk to learn in writing the habit of orderly arrangement and organic sequence which even the lightest forms of literature cannot lack  in the course of this summer stevensons excursions included a week or two spent with me at hampstead during which he joined the savile club and made some acquaintance with london literary society a yachting trip with his friend sir walter simpson in the western islands of scotland a journey to barmouth and llandudno with his parents and in the late autumn a walking tour in buckinghamshire the scottish winter 187475 tried him severely as scottish winters always did but was enlivened by a new and what was destined to be a very fruitful and intimate friendship the origin of which was described in the following letters namely that of mr w e henley in april 1875 he made his first visit in the company of his cousin r a m stevenson to the artist haunts of the forest of fontainebleau whence he returned to finish his reading for the scottish bar and face the examination which was before him in july during all this year as will be seen his chief almost his exclusive correspondents and confidants continued to be the same as

care i have got quite a lot of victor hugo done and not i think so badly pitching into this work has straightened me up a good deal it is the devils own weather but that is a trifle i must know when cornhill must see it i can send some of it in a week easily but i still have to read the laughing man13 and i mean to wait until i get to london and have the loan of that from you if i buy anything more this production will not pay itself the first part is not too well written though it has good stuff in it  my people have made no objection to my going to gÃ¶ttingen but my body has made i think very strong objections and you know if it is cold here it must be colder there it is a sore pity that was a great chance for me and it is gone i know very well that between galitzin and this swell professor i should have become a good specialist in law and how that would have changed and bettered all my work it is easy to see however i must just be content to live as i have begun an ignorant chicy pennyaliner may the lord have mercy on my soul  going home not very well is an astonishing good hold for me i shall simply be a prince  have you had any thought about diana of the ephesians i will straighten up a play for you but it may take years a play is a thing just like a story it begins to disengage itself and then unrolls gradually in block it will disengage itself some day for me

we are now at swanston cottage lothianburn edinburgh the garden is but little clothed yet for you know here we are six hundred feet above the sea it is very cold and has sleeted this morning everything wintry i am very jolly however having finished victor hugo and just looking round to see what i should next take up i have been reading roman law and calvin this morning  eveningi went up the hill a little this afternoon the air was invigorating but it was so cold that my scalp was sore with this high wintry wind and the grey sky and faint northern daylight it was quite wonderful to hear such a clamour of blackbirds coming up to me out of the woods and the bleating of sheep being shorn in a field near the garden and to see golden patches of blossom already on the furze and delicate green shoots upright and beginning to frond out among last years russet bracken flights of crows were passing continually between the wintry leaden sky and the wintry coldlooking hills it was the oddest conflict of seasons a wee rabbitthis years making beyond questionran out from under my feet and was in a pretty perturbation until he hit upon a lucky juniper and blotted himself there promptly evidently this gentleman had not had much experience of life  i have made an arrangement with my people i am to have Â£84 a yeari only asked for Â£80 on mature reflectionand as i should soon make a good bit by my pen i shall be very comfortable we are all as jolly as can be together so that is a great thing gained  wednesdayyesterday i received a letter that gave me much pleasure from a poor fellowstudent of mine who has been all winter very ill and seems to be but little better even now he seems very much pleased with ordered south a month ago he says i could scarcely have ventured to read it today i felt on reading it as i did on the first day that i was able to sun myself a little in the open air and much more to the like effect it is very gratifyingever your faithful friend       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin      mr john morley had asked for a notice by r l s for the    fortnightly review which he was then editing of lord lyttons newly    published volume fables in song       swanston lothianburn edinburgh may 1874  all right ill see what i can do before i could answer i had to see the book and my good father after trying at all our libraries bought it for me i like the book that is some of it and ill try to lick up four or five pages for the fortnightly  it is still as cold as cold hereaway and the spring hammering away at the new year in despite poor spring scattering flowers with red hands and preparing for summers triumphs all in a shudder herself health still good and the humour for work enduring  jenkin wrote to say he would second me in such a kind little notelet i shall go in for it the savile i mean whether victor hugo is accepted or not being now a man of means have i told you by the way that i have now an income of Â£84 or as i

wednesday may 1874  struggling away at fables in song i am much afraid i am going to make a real failure the time is so short and i am so out of the humour otherwise very calm and jolly cold still impossible  thursdayi feel happier about the fables and it is warmer a bit but my body is most decrepit and i can just manage to be cheery and tread down hypochondria under foot by work i lead such a funny life utterly without interest or pleasure outside of my work nothing indeed but work all day long except a short walk alone on the cold hills and meals and a couple of pipes with my father in the evening it is surprising how it suits me and how happy i keep  fridaymy dear stevenson how do you do do you annoying yourself or no when we go to the olivses it allways rememberse us you nelly and my aunt went away and when the organ come and play the soldaten it mak us think of nelly it is so sad i allmoste went away i make my baths and then we go to franzensbad will you come to see us  there is pellas letter facsimile punctuation spelling and all mme garschines was rather sad and gave me the blues a bit i think it very likely i may run over to franzensbad for a week or so this autumn if i am wanted that is to say i shall be able to afford it easily  i have got on rather better with the fables perhaps it wont be a failure though i fear today the sun shone brightly although the wind was cold i was up the hill a good time it is very solemn to see the top of one hill steadfastly regarding you over the shoulder of another i never before today fully realised the haunting of such a gigantic face as it peers over into a valley and seems to command all corners i had a long talk with the shepherd about foreign lands and sheep a russian had once been on the farm as a pupil he told me that he had the utmost pity for the russians capacities since dictionary and all he had never managed to understand him it must be remembered that my friend the shepherd spoke scotch of the broadest and often enough employs words which i do not understand myself  saturdayi have received such a nice long letter four sides from leslie stephen today about my victor hugo it is accepted this ought to have made me gay but it hasnt i am not likely to be much of a tonic tonight i have been very cynical over myself today partly perhaps because i have just finished some of the deedest rubbish about lord lyttons fables that an intelligent editor ever shot into his wastepaper basket if morley prints it i shall be glad but my respect for him will be shaken       r l s     to sidney colvin      enclosing mr leslie stephens letter accepting the article on victor    hugo the first of stevensons many contributions to the cornhill    magazine       edinburgh may 1874  my dear colvini send you l stephens letter which is certainly very kind and jolly to get14 i wrote some stuff about lord lytton but i had not the heart to submit it to you i sent it direct to morley with a spartan billet god knows it is bad enough but it cost me labour incredible i was so out of the vein it would have made you weep to see me digging the rubbish out of my seven wits with groanings unutterable i certainly mean to come to london and likely before long if all goes well so on that ground i cannot force you to come to scotland still the weather is now warm and jolly and of course it would not be expensive to live here so long as that did not bore you if you could see the hills out of my window tonight you would start incontinent however do as you will and if the mountain will not come to mahomet mahomet will come to the mountain in due time mahomet being me and the mountain you qed frsever yours       robert louis stevenson     to mrs sitwell        swanston may 1874 tuesday  another cold day yet i have been along the hillside wondering much at idiotic sheep and raising partridges at every second step one little plover is the object of my firm adherence i pass his nest every day and if you saw how he flies by me and almost into my face crying and flapping his wings to direct my attention from his little treasure you would have as kind a heart to him as i today i saw him not although i took my usual way and i am afraid that some person has abused his simple wiliness and harried as we say in scotland the nest i feel much righteous indignation against such imaginary aggressor however one must not be too chary of the lower forms today i sat down on a treestump at the skirt of a little strip of planting and thoughtlessly began to dig out the touchwood with an end of twig i found i had carried ruin death and universal consternation into a little community of ants and this set me athinking of how close we are environed with frail lives so that we can do nothing without spreading havoc over all manner of perishable homes and interests and affections and so on to my favourite mood of an holy terror for all action and all inaction equallya sort of shuddering revulsion from the necessary responsibilities of life we must not be too scrupulous of others or we shall die conscientiousness is a sort of moral opium an excitant in small doses perhaps but at bottom a strong narcotic  saturdayi have been two days in edinburgh and so had not the occasion to write to you morley has accepted the fables and i have seen it in proof and think less of it than ever however of course i shall send you a copy of the magazine without fail and you can be as disappointed as you like or the reverse if you can i would willingly recall it if i could  try by way of change byrons mazeppa you will be astonished it is grand and no mistake and one sees through it a fire and a passion and a rapid intuition of genius that makes one rather sorry for ones own generation of better writers andi dont know what to say i was going to say smaller men but thats not right read it and you will feel what i cannot express dont be put out by the beginning persevere and you will find yourself thrilled before you are at an end with it  sundaythe white mist has obliterated the hills and lies heavily round the cottage as though it were laying siege to it the trees wave their branches in the wind with a solemn melancholy manner like people swaying themselves to and fro in pain i am alone in the house all the world being gone to church and even in here at the side of the fire the air clings about one like a wet blanket yet this morning when i was just awake i had thought it was going to be a fine day first a cock crew loudly and beautifully and often then followed a long interval of silence and darkness the grey morning began to get into my room and then from the other side of the garden a blackbird executed one long flourish and in a moment as if a spring had been touched or a sluicegate opened the whole garden just brimmed and ran over with birdsongsever your faithful friend       robert louis stevenson     to mrs sitwell      for a part of june stevenson had come south spending most of his    time in lodgings with me at hampstead where he got the idea for part    of his essay notes on the movements of young children and making    his first appearance at the savile club trouble awaited him after    his return       swanston june 1874 wednesday  news reaches me that bob is laid down with diphtheria and you know what that means  nighti am glad to say that i have on the whole a good account of bob and i do hope he may pull through in spite of all i went down and saw the doctor but it is not thought right that i should go in to see him in case of contagion you know it is a very contagious malady  thursdayit is curious how calm i am in such a case i wait with perfect composure for farther news i can do nothing why should i disturb myself and yet if things go wrong i shall be in a fine way i can tell you  how curiously we are built up into our false positions the other day having toothache and the black dog on my back generally i was rude to one of the servants at the dinnertable and nothing of course can be more disgusting than for a man to speak harshly to a young woman who will lose her place if she speak back to him and of course i determined to apologise well do you know it was perhaps four days before i found courage enough and i felt as red and ashamed as could be why because i had been rude not a bit of it because i was doing a thing that would be called ridiculous in thus apologising i did not know i had so much respect of middleclass notions before this is my right hand which i must cut off hold the arm please oncetwicethrice the offensive member is amputated let us hope i shall never be such a cad any more as to be ashamed of being a gentleman  nighti suppose i must have been more affected than i thought at least i found i could not work this morning and had to go out the whole garden was filled with a high westerly wind coming straight out of the hills and richly scented with furzeor whins as we would say the trees were all in a tempest and roared like a heavy surf the paths all strewn with fallen appleblossom and leaves i got a quiet seat behind a yew and went away into a meditation i was very happy after my own fashion and whenever there came a blink of sunshine or a bird whistled higher than usual or a little powder of white appleblossom came over the hedge and settled about me in the grass i had the gladdest little flutter at my heart and stretched myself for very voluptuousness i wasnt altogether taken up with my private pleasures however and had many a look down ugly vistas in the future for bob and others but we must all be content and brave and look eagerly for these little passages of happiness by the wayside and go on afterwards savouring them under the tongue  fridayour garden has grown beautiful at last beautiful with fresh foliage and daisied grass the sky is still cloudy and the day perhaps even a little gloomy but under this grey roof in this shaded temperate light how delightful the new summer is  when i shall come to london must always be problematical like all my movements and of course this sickness of bobs makes it still more uncertain if all goes well i may have to go to the country and take care of him in his convalescence but i shall come shortly do not hurry to write to me i had rather you had ten minutes more of good friendly sleep than i a longer letter and you know i am rather partial to your letters yesterday by the bye i received the proof of victor hugo it is not nicely written but the stuff is capital i think modesty is my most remarkable quality i may remark in passing  130i was out behind the yew hedge reading the comtesse de rudolstadt when i found my eyes grow weary and looked up from the book o the rest of the quiet greens and whites of the daisied surface i was very peaceful but it began to sprinkle rain and so i fain to come in for a moment and chat with you by the way i must send you consuelo you said you had quite forgotten it if i remember aright and surely a book that could divert me when i thought myself on the very edge of the grave from the work that i so much desired and was yet unable to do and from many painful thoughts should somewhat support and amuse you under all the hard things that may be coming upon you if you should wonder why i am writing to you so voluminously know that it is because i am not suffering myself to work and in idleness as in death etc  saturdayi have had a very cruel day i heard this morning that yesterday bob had been very much worse and i went down to portobello with all sorts of horrible presentiments i was glad when i turned the corner and saw the blinds still up he was definitely better if the word definitely can be used about such a detestably insidious complaint i have ordered consuelo for you and you should have it soon this week i mean next week of course i am thinking when you will receive this letter not of now when i am writing it  i am so tired but i am very hopeful all will be well some time if it be only when we are dead one thing i see so clearly death is the end neither of joy nor sorrow let us pass into the clods and come up again as grass and flowers we shall still be this wonderful shrinking sentient matterwe shall still thrill to the sun and grow relaxed and quiet after rain and have all manner of pains and pleasures that we know not of now consciousness and ganglia and suchlike are after all but theories and who knows this god may not be cruel when all is done he may relent and be good to us Ã  la fin des fins think of how he tempers our afflictions to us of how tenderly he mixes in bright joys with the grey web of trouble and care that we call our life think of how he gives who takes away out of the bottom of the miry clay i write this and i look forward confidently i have faith after all i believe i hope i will not have it reft from me there is something good behind it all bitter and terrible as it seems the infinite majesty as it will be always in regard to us the bubbles of an hour the infinite majesty must have moments if it were no more of greatness must sometimes be touched with a feeling for our infirmities must sometimes relent and be clement to those frail playthings that he has made and made so bitterly alive must it not be so my dear friend out of the depths i cry i feel it now when i am most painfully conscious of his cruelty he must relent he must reward he must give some indemnity if it were but in the quiet of a daisy tasting of the sun and the soft rain and the sweet shadow of trees for all the dire fever that he makes us bear in this poor existence we make too much of this human life of ours it may be that two clods together two flowers together two grown trees together touching each other deliciously with their spread leaves it may be that these dumb things have their own priceless sympathies surer and more untroubled than ours  i dont know quite whether i have wandered forgive me i feel as if i had relieved myself so perhaps it may not be unpleasant for you eitherbelieve me ever your faithful friend       robert louis stevenson     to mrs sitwell        swanston sunday june 1874  dear friendi fear to have added something to your troubles by telling you of the grief in which i find myself but one cannot always come to meet a friend smiling although we should try for the best cheer possible all today i have been very weary resting myself after the trouble and fatigue of yesterday the day was warm enough but it blew a whole gale of wind and the noise and the purposeless rude violence of it somehow irritated and depressed me there was good news however though the anxiety must still be long o peace peace whither are you fled and where have you carried my old quiet humour i am so bitter and disquiet and speak even spitefully to people and somehow though i promise myself amendment day after day finds me equally rough and sour to those about me but this would pass with good health and good weather and at bottom i am not unhappy the soil is still good although it bears thorns and the time will come again for flowers  wednesdayi got your letter this morning and have to thank you so much for it bob is much better and i do hope out of danger today has been more glorious than i can tell you it has been the first day of blue sky that we have had and it was happiness for a week to see the clear bright outline of the hills and the glory of sunlit foliage and the darkness of green shadows and the big white clouds that went voyaging overhead deliberately my two cousins from portobello were here and they and i and maggie ended the afternoon by lying half an hour together on a shawl the big cloud had all been carded out into a thin luminous white gauze miles away and miles away too seemed the little black birds that passed between this and us as we lay with faces upturned the similarity of what we saw struck in us a curious similarity of mood and in consequence of the small size of the shawl we all lay so close that we half pretended half felt we had lost our individualities and had become merged and mixed up in a quadruple existence we had the shadow of an umbrella over ourselves and when any one reached out a brown hand into the golden sunlight overhead we all feigned that we did not know whose hand it was until at last i dont really think we quite did little black insects also passed over us and in the same half wanton manner we pretended we could not distinguish them from the birds there was a splendid sunlit silence about us and as katharine said the heavens seemed to be dropping oil on us or honeydewit was all so bland  thursday eveningi have seen bob again and i am charmed at his convalescence le bon dieu has been so bon this time heres his health still the danger is not over by a good way it is so miserable a thing for reverses  i hear the wind outside roaring among our leafy trees as the surf on some loud shore the hilltop is whelmed in a passing rainshower and the mist lies low in the valleys but the night is warm and in our little sheltered garden it is fair and pleasant and the borders and hedges and evergreens and boundary trees are all distinct in an equable diffusion of light from the buried moon and the day not altogether passed away my dear friend as i hear the wind rise and die away in that tempestuous world of foliage i seem to be conscious of i know not what breath of creation i know what this warm wet wind of the west betokens i know how already in this mornings sunshine we could see all the hills touched and accentuated with little delicate golden patches of young fern how day by day the flowers thicken and the leaves unfold how already the year is atiptoe on the summit of its finished youth and i am glad and sad to the bottom of my heart at the knowledge if you knew how different i am from what i was last year how the knowledge of you has changed and finished me you would be glad and sad alsoever your faithful friend       robert louis stevenson     to mrs sitwell      the strain of anxiety recorded in the two last letters had given a    shake to stevensons own health and it was agreed that he should go    for a yachting tour with sir walter simpson in the inner hebrides       edinburgh june 1874 thursday  i have been made so miserable by chopins marche funÃ¨bre try two of schuberts songs ich unglÃ¼ckselige atlas and du schÃ¶nes fischermÃ¤dchenthey are very jolly i have read aloud my deathcycle from walt whitman this evening i was very much affected myself never so much before and it fetched the auditory considerable reading these things that i like aloud when i am painfully excited is the keenest artistic pleasure i know it does seem strange that these dependent artssinging acting and in its small way reading aloud seem the best rewarded of all arts i am sure it is more exciting for me to read than it was for w w to write and how much more must this be so with singing  fridayi am going in the yacht on wednesday i am not right yet and i hope the yacht will set me up i am too tired tonight to make more of it goodbyeever your faithful friend       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin        edinburgh june 1874 friday  my dear colvini am seedyvery seedy i may say i am quite unfit for any

tontine hotel up to friday morning as i dont quite know my future address i hope you are better and that it was not that spell of work you had that did the harm it is to my spurt of work that i am

notes this is a nuisance however i am pretty happy only wearying for news of you and for your address  fridayÃ€ la bonne heure i hear where you are and that you are apparently fairish well that is good at least i am full of reformation work up to the eyes in it and begin to feel learned a beautiful day outside though something cold       r l s     to sidney colvin      of the projects here mentioned that of the little book of essays on    the enjoyment of the world never took shape nor were those    contributions towards it which he printed in the portfolio ever    republished until after the writers death the appeal to the    clergy of the church of scotland was printed in 1874 published as a    pamphlet in february 1875 and attracted i believe no attention    whatever the fables must have been some of the earliest numbers of    the series continued at odd times till near the date of his death and    published posthumously i do not know which but should guess the    house of eld yellow paint and perhaps those in the vein of    celtic mystery the touchstone the poor thing the song of    tomorrow       swanston summer 1874 tuesday  my dear colvinwhat is new with you there is nothing new with me knox and his females begin to get out of restraint altogether the subject expands so damnably i know not where to cut it off i have another paper for the ptfl15 on the stocks a sequel to the two others also that is to say a word in season as to contentment and a hint to the careless to look around them for disregarded pleasures seeley wrote to me asking me to propose something i suppose he meanswell i suppose i dont know what he means but i shall write to him if you think it wise when i send him this paper saying that my writing is more a matter of gods disposition than of mans proposal that i had from roads upward ever intended to make a little budget of little papers all with this intention before them call it ethical or Ã¦sthetic as you will and thus i shall leave it to him if he likes to regard this little budget as slowly they come forth as a unity in its own small way twelve or twenty such essays some of them mainly ethical and expository put together in a little book with narrow print in each page antique vine leaves about and the following title    xii or xx essays on the enjoyment of the world               by robert louis stevenson                 a motto in italics                       publisher                    place and date  you know the class of old book i have in my head i smack my lips would it not be nice i am going to launch on scotch ecclesiastical affairs in a tract addressed to the clergy in which doctrinal matters being laid aside i contend simply that they should be just and dignified men at a certain crisis this for the honour of humanity its authorship must of course be secret or the publication would be useless you shall have a copy of course and may god help you to understand it  i have done no more to my fables i find i must let things take their time i am constant to my schemes but i must work at them fitfully as the humour moves  to return i wonder if i have to make a budget of such essays as i dream whether seeley would publish them i should give them unity you know by the doctrinal essays nor do i think these would be the least agreeable you must give me your advice and tell me whether i should throw out this delicate feeler to r s16 or if not what i am to say to this proposal business  i shall go to england or wales with parents shortly after which dash to poland before setting in for the dismal session at edinburgh  spirits good with a general sense of hollowness underneath wanity of wanities etcever yours       robert louis stevenson  psparents capital thanks principally to them yours truly still rather bitter but less so     to sidney colvin      the last paragraph of the following means that dr appleton the    amiable and indefatigable editor of the academy then recently    founded had been a little disturbed in mind by some of the    contributions of his brilliant young friend but allowed his academic    conscience to be salved by the fact of their signature       swanston summer 1874  my dear colvinam i mad have i lived thus long and have you known me thus long to no purpose do you imagine i could ever write an essay a month or promise an essay even every three months i declare i would rather die than enter into any such arrangement the essays must fall from me essay by essay as they ripen and all that my communication with seeley would effect would be to make him see more in them than mere occasional essays or at least look far more faithfully in which spirit men rarely look in vain you know both roads and my little girls17 are a part of the scheme which dates from early at mentone my word to seeley therefore would be to inform him of what i hope will lie ultimately behind them of how i regard them as contributions towards a friendlier and more thoughtful way of looking about one etc one other purpose of telling him would be that i should feel myself more at liberty to write as i please and not bound to drag in a tag about art every time to make it more suitable tying myself down to time is an impossibility you know my own description of myself as a person with a poetic character and no poetic talent just as my prose muse has all the ways of a poetic one and i must take my essays as they come to me if i got 12 of em done in two years i should be pleased never please let yourself imagine that i am fertile i am constipated in the brains  look here appleton dined here last night and was delightful after the manner of our appleton i was none the less pleased because i was somewhat amused to hear of your kind letter to him in defence of my productions i was amused at the tranquil dishonesty with which he told me that i must put my name to all i write and then all will be wellyours ever       r l s     to mrs sitwell      written on an expedition to wales with his parents       train between edinburgh and chester august 8 1874  my father and mother reading i think i shall talk to you for a moment or two this morning at swanston the birds poor creatures had the most troubled hour or two evidently there was a hawk in the neighbourhood not one sang and the whole garden thrilled with little notes of warning and terror i did not know before that the voice of birds could be so tragically expressive i had always heard them before express their trivial satisfaction with the blue sky and the return of daylight really they almost frightened me i could hear mothers and wives in terror for those who were dear to them it was easy to translate i wish it were as easy to write but it is very hard in this flying train or i would write you more  chesteri like this place much but somehow i feel glad when i get among the quiet eighteenth century buildings in cosy places with some elbow room about them after the older architecture this other is bedevilled and furtive it seems to stoop i am afraid of trapdoors and could not go pleasantly into such houses i dont know how much of this is legitimately the effect of the architecture little enough possibly possibly far the most part of it comes from bad historical novels and the disquieting statuary that garnishes some faÃ§ades  on the way today i passed through my dear cumberland country nowhere to as great a degree can one find the combination of lowland and highland beauties the outline of the blue hills is broken by the outline of many tumultuous treeclumps and the broad spaces of moorland are balanced by a network of deep hedgerows that might rival suffolk in the foregroundhow a railway journey shakes and discomposes one mind and body i grow blacker and blacker in humour as the day goes on and when at last i am let out and have the fresh air about me it is as though i were born again and the sick fancies flee away from my mind like swans in spring  i want to come back on what i have said about eighteenth century and middleage houses i do not know if i have yet explained to you the sort of loyalty of urbanity that there is about the one to my mind the spirit of a country orderly and prosperous a flavour of the presence of magistrates and welltodo merchants in bagwigs the clink of glasses at night in firelit parlours something certain and civic and domestic is all about these quiet staid shapely houses with no character but their exceeding shapeliness and the comely external utterance that they make of their internal comfort now the others are as i have said both furtive and bedevilled they are sly and grotesque they combine their sort of feverish grandeur with their sort of secretive baseness after the manner of a charles the ninth they are peopled for me with persons of the same fashion dwarfs and sinister people in cloaks are about them and i seem to divine crypts and as i said trapdoors o god be praised that we live in this good daylight and this good peace  barmouth august 9thtoday we saw the cathedral at chester and far more delightful saw and heard a certain inimitable verger who took us round he was full of a certain recondite faraway humour that did not quite make you laugh at the time but was somehow laughable to recollect moreover he had so far a just imagination and could put one in the right humour for seeing an old place very much as according to my favourite text scotts novels and poems do for one his account of the monks in the scriptorium with their cowls over their heads in a certain sheltered angle of the cloister where the big cathedral building kept the sun off the parchments was all that could be wished and so too was what he added of the others pacing solemnly behind them and dropping ever and again on their knees before a little shrine there is in the wall to keep em in the frame of mind you will begin to think me unduly biassed in this vergers favour if i go on to tell you his opinion of me we got into a little side chapel whence we could hear the choir children at practice and i stopped a moment listening to them with i dare say a very bright face for the sound was delightful to me ah says he youre very fond of music i said i was yes i could tell that by your head he answered theres a deal in that head and he shook his own solemnly i said it might be so but i found it hard at least to get it out then my father cut in brutally said anyway i had no ear and left the verger so distressed and shaken in the foundations of his creed that i hear he got my father aside afterwards and said he was sure there was something in my face and wanted to know what it was if not music he was relieved when he heard that i occupied myself with literature which word note here i do now spell correctly goodnight and heres the vergers health  fridayyesterday received the letter you know of i have finished my portfolio paper not very good but with things in it i dont know if they will take it and i have got a good start made with my john knox articles the weather here is rainy and miserable and windy it is warm and not over boisterous for a certain sort of pleasure this place as i have made my first real inquisition into it tonight is curious enough all the days i have been here i have been at work and so i was quite new to it  saturdaya most beautiful day we took a most beautiful drive also up the banks of the river the heather and furze are in flower at once and make up a splendid richness of colour on the hills the trees were beautiful there was a bit of winding road with larches on one hand and oaks on the other the oaks were in shadow and printed themselves off at every corner on the sunlit background of the larches we passed a little family of children by the roadside the youngest of all sat a good way apart from the others on the summit of a knoll it was ensconced in an old teabox out of which issued its head and shoulders in a blue cloak and scarlet hat o if you could have seen its dignity it was deliciously humorous and this little piece of comic selfsatisfaction was framed in wonderfully by the hills and the sunlit estuary we saw another child in a cottage garden she had been sick it seemed and was taking the air quietly for healths sake over her pale face she had decorated herself with all available flowers and weeds and she was driving one chair as a horse sitting in another by way of carriage we cheered her as we passed and she acknowledged the compliment like a queen i like children better every day i think and most other things less john knox goes on and a horrible story of a nurse which i think almost too cruel to go on with i wonder why my stories are always so nasty18 i am still well and in good spirits i say by the way have you any means of finding madame garschines address if you have communicate with me i fear my last letter has been too late to catch her at franzensbad and so i shall

that i havent done so always but i shall do it with a high hand now  it is raining here and i have been working at john knox and at the horrid story i have in hand and walking in the rain do you know this story of mine is horrible i only work at it by fits and starts because i feel as if it were a sort of crime against humanityit is so cruel  wednesdayi saw such nice children again today one little fellow alone by the roadside putting a stick into a spout of water and singing to himselfso wrapt up that we had to poke him with our umbrellas to attract his attention and again two solid fleshly grave doublechinned burgomasters in black with black hats on em riding together in what they call i think a double perambulator my father is such fun here he is always skipping about into the drawingroom and speaking to all the girls and telling them god knows what about us all my mother and i are the old people who sit aloof receive him as a sort of prodigal when he comes back to us and

taken my paper which is as i now think not to beat about the bush bad however there are pretty things in it i fancy we shall see what you shall say  sundayi took my usual walk before turning in last night and dallied over it a little it was a cool dark solemn night starry but the sky charged with big black clouds the lights in house windows you could see but the houses themselves were lost in the general blackness a church clock struck eleven as i went past and rather startled me the whiteness of the road was all i had to go by i heard an express train roaring away down the coast into the night and dying away sharply in the distance it was like the noise of an enormous rocket or a shot world one would fancy i suppose the darkness made me a little fanciful but when at first i was puzzled by this great sound in the night between sea and hills i thought half seriously that it might be a world broken loosethis world to wit i stood for i suppose five seconds with this lookingfor of destruction in my head not exactly frightened but put out and i wanted badly not to be overwhelmed where i was unless i could cry out a farewell with a great voice over the ruin and make myself

macmillans    magazine and afterwards in familiar studies of men and books       swanston wednesday autumn 1874  i have been hard at work all yesterday and besides had to write a long letter to bob so i found no time until quite late and then was sleepy last night it blew a fearful gale i was kept awake about a couple of hours and could not get to sleep for the horror of the winds noise the whole house shook and mind you our house is a house a great castle of jointed stone that would weigh up a street of english houses so that when it quakes as it did last night it means something but the quaking was not what put me about it was the horrible howl of the wind round the corner the audible haunting of an incarnate anger about the house the evil spirit that was abroad and above all the shuddering silent pauses when the storms heart stands dreadfully still for a moment o how i hate a storm at night they have been a great influence in my life i am sure for i can remember them so far backlong before i was six at least for we left the house in which i remember listening to them times without number when i was six and in those days the storm had for me a perfect impersonation as durable and unvarying as any heathen deity i always heard it as a horseman riding past with his cloak about his head and somehow always carried away and riding past again and being baffled yet once more ad infinitum all night long i think i wanted him to get past but i am not sure i know only that i had some interest either for or against in the matter and i used to lie and hold my breath not quite frightened but in a state of miserable exaltation  my first john knox is in proof and my second is on the anvil it is very good of me so to do for i want so much to get to my real tour and my sham tour the real tour first it is always working in my head and if i can only turn on the right sort of style at the right moment i am not much afraid of it one thing bothers me what with hammering at this j k and writing necessary letters and taking necessary exercise that even not enough the weather is so repulsive to me cold and windy i find i have no time for reading except times of fatigue when i wish merely to relax myself oand i read over again for this purpose flauberts tentation de st antoine it struck me a good deal at first but this second time it has fetched me immensely i am but just done with it so you will know the large proportion of salt to take with my present statement that its the finest thing i ever read of course it isnt that its full of longueurs and is not quite

his dictionary of music after the knox    articles no more contributions from r l s appeared in this    magazine partly i think because mr alexander macmillan    disapproved of his essay on burns

from grove about my john knox which is flattering in its way he is a very gushing and spontaneous person i am busy with another portfolio paper for which i can find no name i think i shall require to

today thank you it is a horrid day outside you talk of my setting to a book as if i could dont you know that things must come to me i can do but little i mostly wait and look out i am struggling with a portfolio paper just now which will not come straight somehow and will get too gushy but a little patience will get it out of the kink and sober it down i hope i have been thinking over my movements and am not sure but that i may get to london on my way to poland after all hurrah but we must not halloo till we are out of the wood this may be only a clearing  god help us all it is a funny world to see people skipping all round us with their eyes sealed up with indifference knowing nothing of the earth or man or woman going automatically to offices and saying they are happy or unhappy out of a sense of duty i suppose surely at least from no sense of happiness or unhappiness unless perhaps they have a tooth that twinges is it not like a bad dream why dont they stamp their foot upon the ground and awake there is the moon rising in the east and there is a person with their heart broken and still glad and conscious of the worlds glory up to the point of pain and behold they know nothing of all this i should like to kick them into consciousness for damp gingerbread puppets as they are s c is down on me for being bitter who can help it sometimes especially after they have slept ill  i am going to have a lot of lunch presently and then i shall feel all right again and the loneliness will pass away as often before it is the flesh that is weak already i have done myself all the good in the world by this scribble and feel alive again and pretty jolly  sundaywhat a day cold and dark as midwinter i shall send with this two new photographs of myself for your opinion my father

a walk the colouring of the world today is of course hideous we saw only one pleasant sight a couple of lovers under a thorntree by the wayside he with his arm about her waist they did not seem to

suit me if we could change this is the fast daythursday preceding biannual holy sacrament that isnobody does any work they go to church twice they read nothing secular except the newspapers that is the nuance between fast day and sunday they eat like fightingcocks behold how good a thing it is and becoming well to fast in scotland i am progressing with john knox and women no 2 i shall finish it i think in a fortnight hence and then i shall begin to enjoy myself j k and w no 2 is not uninteresting however it only bores me because i am so anxious to be at something else which i like better i shall perhaps go to church this afternoon from a sort of feeling that it is rather a wholesome thing to do of an afternoon it keeps one from work and it lets you out so late that you cannot weary yourself walking and so spoil your evenings work  fridayi got your letter this morning and whether owing to that or to the fact that i had spent the evening before in comparatively riotous living i managed to work five hours and a half well and without fatigue besides reading about an hour more at history this is a thing to be proud of  we have had lately some of the most beautiful sunsets our autumn sunsets here are always admirable in colour tonight there was just a little lake of tarnished green deepening into a bloodorange at the margins framed above by dark clouds and below by the long roofline of the egyptian buildings on what we call the mound the statues on the top of her britannic majesty and diverse nondescript sphinxes printing themselves off black against the lit space  saturdayit has been colder than ever and tonight there is a truculent wind about the house shaking the windows and making a hollow inarticulate grumbling in the chimney i cannot say how much i hate the cold it makes my scalp so tight across my head and gives me such a beastly rheumatism about my shoulders and wrinkles and stiffens my face o i have such a sehnsucht for mentone where the sun is shining and the air still and a friend writes to me people are complaining of the heat  sundayi was chased out by my lamp again last night it always goes out when i feel in the humour to write to you today i have been to church which has not improved my temper i must own the clergyman did his best to make me hate him and i took refuge in that admirable poem the song of deborah and barak i should like to make a long scroll of painting say to go all round a cornice illustrative of this poem with the people seen in the distance going stealthily on footpaths while the great highways go vacant with the archers besetting the drawwells with the princes in hiding on the hills among the bleating sheepflocks with the overthrow of sisera the stars fighting against him in their courses and that ancient river the river kishon sweeping him away in anger with his mother looking and looking down the long road in the red sunset and never a banner and never a spearclump coming into sight and her women with white faces round her ready with lying comfort to say nothing of the people on white asses  o i do hate this damned life that i lead workworkwork thats all right its amusing but i want women about me and i want pleasure john knox had a better time of it than i with his godly females all leaving their husbands to follow after him i would i were john knox i hate living like a hermit

visit to his russian friend in poland did not come off    and shortly after the preceding letter stevenson went for a few days    walking tour in the chiltern hills of buckinghamshire as recorded in    his essay an autumn effect he then came on for a visit to london       london november 1874  when i left you i found an organgrinder in russell square playing to a child and the simple fact that there was a child listening to him that he was giving this pleasure entitled him according to my theory as you know to some money so i put some coppers on the ledge of his organ without so much as looking at him and i was going on when a woman said to me yes sir he do look bad dont he scarcely fit like to be working and then i looked at the man and o he was so ill so yellow and heavyeyed and drooping i did not like to go back somehow and so i gave the woman a shilling and asked her to give it to him for me i saw her do so and walked on but the face followed me and so when i had got to the end of the division i turned and came back as hard as i could and filled his hand with moneyten to thirteen shillings i should think i was sure he was going to be ill you know and he was a young man and i dare say he was alone and had no one to love him  i had my reward for a few yards farther on here was another organgrinder playing a dance tune and perhaps a dozen children all dancing merrily to his music singly and by twos and threes and in pretty little figures together just what my organgrinder in my story wanted to have happen to him it was so gay and pleasant in the twilight under the street lamp  i am very well have eaten well and am so sleepy i can write no more this i write to let you know i am no worse all the betterever your faithful friend       r l s     to mrs sitwell        edinburgh november 1874 sunday  i was never more sorry to leave you but i never left you with a better heart than last night i had a long journey and a cold one but never was sick nor sorry the whole way it was a long one because when we got to berwick we had to go round through the hills by kelso as there was a block on the main line i knew nothing of this and you may imagine my bewilderment when i came to myself the train standing and whistling dismally in the black morning before a little vacant halflit station with a name up that i had never heard before my fellowtraveller woke up and wanted to know what was wrong o its nothing i said nothing at all its an evil dream however we had the thing explained to us at the end of ends and trailed on in the dark among the snowy hills stopping every now and again and whistling in an appealing kind of way as much as to say god knows where we are for gods sake dont run into us until at last we came to a dead standstill and remained so for perhaps an hour and a quarter this wakened us up for a little and we managed at last to attract the attention of one of the officials whom we could see picking their way about the snow with lanterns this man very wide awake and hale and lusty informed us we were waiting for another conductor as our own guard did not know the line where is the new guard coming from we ask o close by onlyhe hehe was married last night and immediately we heard much hoarse laughter in the dark about us and the moving lanterns were shaken to and fro as if in a wind this poor conductor however i recomposed myself for slumber and did not reawake much before edinburgh where i was discharged three hours too late and found my father waiting for me in the snow with a very long faceever your faithful friend       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin      i forget what the japanese prints were which i had been sending to    stevenson at his wish but they sound like specimens of

a far better lot than the last i have chosen four complete sets out of it for setting quite admirable the others are not quite ones taste i find the colour far from always being agreeable it is a great toss up they have sent me duplicates of first a mad little scene with a white horse a red monarch and a blue arm of the sea in it and second of a night scene with water flowers and a black and white umbrella and a wonderful grey distance and a wonderful general effectone of my best in fact do not now force yourself to make any more purchases for me but if ever you see a thing you would like

women now and theyre better than nothing three without heads who have been away getting framed and you know they are more to me after a fashion than they can be to you because after a fashion also they are women i have come now to think the sitting figure in spite of its beautiful drapery rather a blemish rather an interruption to the sentiment the two others are better than one has ever dreamed i think these two women are the only things in the world that have been better than in bible phrase it had entered into my heart to conceive who made them was it pheidias or do they not know it is wonderful what company they arenoble company and then i have now three japanese pictures that are after my own heart and i get up from time to time and turn a bit of favourite colour over and over roll it under my tongue savour it till it gets all through me and then back to my chair and to work  this afternoon about six there was a small orange moon lost in a great world of blue evening a few leafless boughs and a bit of garden railing crisscross its face and below it there was blueness and the spread lights of leith lost in blue haze to the east the town also subdued to the same blue piled itself up with here and there a lit window until it could print off its outline against a faint patch of green and russet that remained behind the sunset  i must tell you about my way of life which is regular to a degree breakfast 830 during breakfast and my smoke afterwards till ten when i begin work i read reformation from ten i work until about a quarter to one from one until two i lunch and read a book on schopenhauer or one on positivism two to three work three to six anything if i am in before six i read about japan six dinner and a pipe with my father and coffee until 730 730 to 930 work after that either supper and a pipe at home or out to simpsons or baxters bed between eleven and twelve  wednesdaytwo good things have arrived to me today your letter for one and the end of john knox for another i cannot write english because i have been speaking french all evening with some french people of my knowledge its a sad thing the state i get into when i cannot remember english and yet do not know french and it is worse when it is complicated as at present with a pen that will not write if you knew how i have to paint and how i have to manoeuvre to get the stuff legible at all  thursdayi have said the fates are only women after a fashion and that is one of the strangest things about them they are wonderfully womanlythey are more womanly than any womanand those girt draperies are drawn over a wonderful greatness of body instinct with sex i do not see a line in them that could be a line in a man and yet when all is said they are not women for us they are of another race immortal separate one has no wish to look at them with love only with a sort of lowly adoration physical but wanting what is the soul of all love whether admitted to oneself or not hope in a word the desire of the moth for the star o great white stars of eternal marble o shapely colossal women and yet not women it is not love that we seek from them we do not desire to see their great eyes troubled with our passions or the great impassive members contorted by any hope or pain or pleasure only now and again to be conscious that they exist to have knowledge of them far off in cloudland or feel their steady eyes shining like quiet watchful stars above the turmoil of the earth  i write so ill so cheap and miserable and pennyalinerish is this john knox that i have just sent that i am low only i keep my heart up by thinking of you and if all goes to the worst shall i not be able to lay my head on the great knees of the middle fateo these great kneesi know all baudelaire meant now with his gÃ©anteto lay my head on her great knees and go to sleep  fridayi have finished the story of king matthias hunting horn whereof i spoke to you and i think it should be good it excites me like wine or fire or death or love or something nothing of my own writing ever excited me so much it does seem to me so weird and fantastic  saturdayi know now that there is a more subtle and dangerous sort of selfishness in habit than there ever can be in disorder i never ceased to be generous when i was most dÃ©rÃ©glÃ© now when i am beginning to settle into habits i see the danger in front of meone might cease to be generous and grow hard and sordid in time and trouble however thank god it is life i want and nothing posthumous and for two good emotions i would sacrifice a thousand years of fame moreover i know so well that i shall never be much as a writer that i am not very sorely tempted  my only chance is in my stories and so you will forgive me if i postpone everything else to copy out king matthias i have learned by experience that a story should be copied out and finished fairly off at the first heat if ever i am even thinking of finishing up halfadozen perhaps and trying the publishers what do you say give me your advice  sundaygoodbye a long story to tell but no time to tell it well and happy adieuever your faithful friend       robert louis stevenson     to mrs sitwell        edinburgh sunday november 1874  here is my long story yesterday night after having supped i grew so restless that i was obliged to go out in search of some excitement there was a halfmoon lying over on its back and incredibly bright in the midst of a faint grey sky set with faint stars a very inartistic moon that would have damned a picture  at the most populous place of the city i found a little boy three years old perhaps half frantic with terror and crying to every one for his mammy this was about eleven mark you people stopped and spoke to him and then went on leaving him more frightened than before but i and a goodhumoured mechanic came up together and i instantly developed a latent faculty for setting the hearts of children at rest master tommy murphy such was his name soon stopped crying and allowed me to take him up and carry him and the mechanic and i trudged away along princes street to find his parents i was soon so tired that i had to ask the mechanic to carry the bairn and you should have seen the puzzled contempt with which he looked at me for knocking in so soon he was a good fellow however although very impracticable and sentimental and he soon bethought him that master murphy might catch cold after his excitement so we wrapped him up in my greatcoat tobauga tobago street was the address he gave us and we deposited him in a little grocers shop and went through all the houses in the street without being able to find any one of the name of murphy then i set off to the head police office leaving my greatcoat in pawn about master murphys person as i went down one of the lowest streets in the town i saw a little bit of life that struck me it was now halfpast twelve a little shop stood still halfopen and a boy of four or five years old was walking up and down before it imitating cockcrow he was the only living creature within sight  at the police offices no word of master murphys parents so i went back emptyhanded the good groceress who had kept her shop open all this time could keep the child no longer her father bad with bronchitis said he must forth so i got a large scone with currants in it wrapped my coat about tommy got him up on my arm and away to the police office with him not very easy in my mind for the poor child young as he washe could scarce speakwas full of terror for the office as he called it he was now very grave and quiet and communicative with me told me how his father thrashed him and divers household matters whenever he saw a woman on our way he looked after her over my shoulder and then gave his judgment thats no her adding sometimes she has a wean wi her meantime i was telling him how i was going to take him to a gentleman who would find out his mother for him quicker than ever i could and how he must not be afraid of him but be brave as he had been with me we had just arrived at our destinationwe were just under the lampwhen he looked me in the face and said appealingly hell no put me in the office and i had to assure him that he would not even as i pushed open the door and took him in  the serjeant was very nice and i got tommy comfortably seated on a bench and spirited him up with good words and the scone with the currants in it and then telling him i was just going out to look for mammy i got my greatcoat and slipped away  poor little boy he was not called for i learn until ten this morning this is very ill written and ive missed half that was picturesque in it but to say truth i am very tired and sleepy it was two before i got to bed however you see i had my excitement  mondayi have written nothing all morning i cannot settle to it yesi will though  1045and i did i want to say something more to you about the three women i wonder so much why they should have been women and halt between two opinions in the matter sometimes i think it is because they were made by a man for men sometimes again i think there is an abstract reason for it and there is something more substantive about a woman than ever there can be about a man i can conceive a great mythical woman living alone among inaccessible mountaintops or in some lost island in the pagan seas and ask no more whereas if i hear of a hercules i ask after iole or dejanira i cannot think him a man without women but i can think of these three deepbreasted women living out all their days on remote hilltops seeing the white dawn and the purple even and the world outspread before them for ever and no more to them for ever than a sight of the eyes a hearing of the ears a faraway interest of the inflexible heart not pausing not pitying but austere with a holy austerity rigid with a calm and passionless rigidity and i find them none the less women to the end  and think if one could love a woman like that once see her once grow pale with passion and once wring your lips out upon hers would it not be a small thing to die not that there is not a passion of a quite other sort much less epic far more dramatic and intimate that comes out of the very frailty of perishable women out of the lines of suffering that we see written about their eyes and that we may wipe out if it were but for a moment out of the thin hands wrought and tempered in agony to a fineness of perception that the indifferent or the merely happy cannot know out of the tragedy that lies about such a love and the pathetic incompleteness this is another thing and perhaps it is a higher i look over my shoulder at the three great headless madonnas and they look back at me and do not move see me and through and over me the foul life of the city dying to its embers already as the night draws on and over miles and miles of silent country set here and there with lit towns thundered through here and there with night expresses scattering fire and smoke and away to the ends of the earth and the furthest star and the blank regions of nothing and they are not moved my quiet greatkneed deepbreasted welldraped ladies of necessity i give my heart to you       r l s     to mrs sitwell        edinburgh december 23 1874  mondayi have come from a concert and the concert was rather a disappointment not so my afternoon skatingduddingston our big loch is bearing and i wish you could have seen it this afternoon covered with people in thin driving snow flurries the big hill grim and white and alpine overhead in the thick air and the road up the gorge as it were into the heart of it dotted black with traffic moreover i can skate a little bit and what one can do is always pleasant to do  tuesdayi got your letter today and was so glad thereof it was of good omen to me also i worked from ten to one my classes are suspended now for xmas holidays and wrote four or five portfolio pages of my buckinghamshire affair then i went to duddingston and skated all afternoon if you had seen the moon rising a perfect sphere of smoky gold in the dark air above the trees and the white loch thick with skaters and the great hill snowsprinkled overhead it was a sight for a king  wednesdayi stayed on duddingston today till after nightfall the little booths that hucksters set up round the edge were marked each one by its little lamp there were some fires too and the light and the shadows of the people who stood round them to warm themselves made a strange pattern all round on the snowcovered ice a few people with torches began to travel up and down the ice a lit circle travelling along with them over the snow a gigantic moon rose meanwhile over the trees and the kirk on the promontory among perturbed and vacillating clouds  the walk home was very solemn and strange once through a broken gorge we had a glimpse of a little space of mackerel sky moonlitten on the other side of the hill the broken ridges standing grey and spectral between and the hilltop over all snowwhite and strangely magnified in size  this must go to you tomorrow so that you may read it on christmas day for company i hope it may be good company to you  thursdayoutside it snows thick and steadily the gardens before our house are now a wonderful fairy forest and o this whiteness of things how i love it how it sends the blood about my body maurice de guÃ©rin hated snow what a fool he must have been somebody tried to put me out of conceit with it by saying that people were lost in it as if people dont get lost in love too and die of devotion to art as if everything worth were not an occasion to some peoples end  what a wintry letter this is only i think it is winter seen from the inside of a warm greatcoat and there is at least a warm heart about it somewhere do you know what they say in xmas stories is true i think one loves their friends more dearly at this seasonever your faithful friend       robert louis

no more i am rapt out of earth by it beethoven is certainly the greatest man the world has yet produced i wonder is there anything so superbi can find no word for it more specific than superball i know is that all my knowledge is transcended i finished today and sent off and a mighty mean detail it is to set down after beethovens grand passion my portfolio article about buckinghamshire in its own way i believe it to be a good thing and i hope you will find something in it to like it touches in a dry enough manner upon most things under heaven and if you like me i think you ought to like

pleasant in the past  wednesdayyesterday i wasnt well and tonight i have been ever so busy there came a note from the academy sent by john h ingram the editor of the edition of poes works i have been reviewing challenging me to find any more faults i have found nearly sixty so i may be happy but that makes me none the less sleepy so i must go to bed  fridayi am awfully out of the humour to write i am very inert although quite happy i am informed by those who are more expert that i am bilious bien let it be so i am still content and though i can do no original work i get forward making notes for my knox at a good trot  saturdayi am so happy i am no longer here in edinburgh i have been all yesterday evening and this forenoon in italy four hundred years ago with one sannazzaro a sculptor painter poet etc and one ippolita a beautiful duchess o i like it badly i wish you could hear it at once or rather i wish you could see it immediately in beautiful type on such a page as it ought to be in my first little volume of stories what a change this is from collecting dull notes for john knox as i have been all the early part of the weekthe difference between life and deathi am quite well again and in such happy spirits as who would not be having spent so much of his time at that convent on the hills with these sweet people vous verrez and if you dont like this storywell i give it up if you dont like it not but what theres a long way to travel yet i am no farther than the threshold i have only set the men and the game has still to be played and a lot of dim notions must become definite and shapely and a deal be clear to me that is anything but clear as yet the story shall be called i think when the devil was well in allusion to the old proverb  goodbye       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin        17 heriot row edinburgh january 1875  my dear colvini have worked too hard i have given myself one day of rest and that was not enough so i am giving myself another i shall go to bed again likewise so soon as this is done and slumber most potently  9 pmslept all afternoon like a lamb  about my coming south i think the still small unanswerable voice of coins will make it impossible until the session is over end of march but for all that i think i shall hold out jolly i do not want you to come and bother yourself indeed it is still not quite certain whether my father will be quite fit for you although i have now no fear of that really now dont take up this wrongly i wish you could come and i do not know anything that would make me happier but i see that it is wrong to expect it and so i resign myself some time after i offered appleton a series of papers on the modern french schoolthe parnassiens i think they call themde banville coppÃ©e soulary and sully prudhomme but he has not deigned to answer my letter  i shall have another portfolio paper so soon as i am done with this story that has played me out the story is to be called when the devil was well scene italy renaissance colour purely imaginary of course my own unregenerate idea of what italy then was o when shall i find the story of my dreams that shall never halt nor wander nor step aside but go ever before its face and ever swifter and louder until the pit receives it roaring the portfolio paper will be about scotland and englandever yours       r l stevenson     to mrs sitwell        edinburgh january 1875  i wish i could write better letters to you mine must be very dull i must try to give you news well i was at the annual dinner of my old academy schoolfellows last night we sat down ten out of seventytwo the others are scattered all over the places of the earth some in san francisco some in new zealand some in india one in the backwoodsit gave one a wide look over the world to hear them talk so i read them some verses it is great fun i always read verses and in the vinous enthusiasm of the moment they always propose to have them printed ce qui narrive jamais du reste in the morning they are more calm  sundayit occurs to me that one reason why there is no news in my letters is because there is so little in my life i always tell you of my concerts i was at another yesterday afternoon a recital of hallÃ© and norman neruda i went in the evening to the pantomime with the mackintoshescousins of mine their little boy aged four was there for the first time to see him with his eyes fixed and open like saucers and never varying his expression save in so far as he might sometimes open his mouth a little wider was worth the money he laughed only oncewhen the giants dwarf fed his master as though he were a child coming home he was much interested as to who made the fairies and wanted to know if they were like berries i should like to know how much this question was due to the idea of their coming up from under the stage and how much to a vague idea of rhyme when he was told that they were not like berries he then asked if they had not been flowers before they were fairies it was a good deal in the vein of herbert spencers primitive man all this  i am pretty well but have not got back to work much since tuesday i work far too hard at the story but i wish i had finished it before i stopped as i feel somewhat out of the swing nowever your faithful       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin      another of the literary projects

in such a state of business that i know not when to find the time to write look hereseeley does not seem to me to have put that paper of mine in this month so i remain unable to pay you which is a sad pity and must be forgiven me  what am i doing well i wrote my second john knox which is not a bad piece of work for me begun and finished ready for press in nine days then i have since written a story called king matthiass hunting horn and i am engaged in finishing another called the two falconers of cairnstane i find my stories affect me rather more perhaps than is wholesome i have only been two hours at work today and yet i have been crying and am shaking badly as you can see in my handwriting and my back is a bit bad they give me pleasure though quite worth all results however i shall work no more today  i am to get Â£1000 when i pass advocate it seems which is good  o i say will you kindly tell me all about the bust of clytie                                       then i had the wisdom to stop and look over japanese picture books until lunch time  well tell me all about clytie how old is it who did it whats it about etc send it on a sheet that i can forward without indiscretion to another as i desire the information for a friend whom i wish to please  now look here when i have twelve stories readythese twelve    a     i the devil on cramond sands   l           needs copying

when i have these twelve ready should i not do better to try to get a publisher for them call them a book of stories and put a good dedicatory letter at the fore end of them i should get less coin than by going into magazines perhaps but i should also get more notice should i not and so do better for myself in the long run now should i not besides a book with boards is a book with boards even if it baint a very fat one and has no references to ammianus marcellinus and german critics at the foot of the pages on all this i shall want your serious advice i am sure i shall stand or fall by the stories and youll think so too when you see those poor excrescences the two john knox and women games however judge for yourself and be prudent on my behalf like a good soul  yes ill come to cambridge

dance no trace remains       edinburgh tuesday february 1875  i got your nice long gossiping letter todayi mean by that that there was more news in it than usualand so of course i am pretty jolly i am in the house however with such a beastly cold in the head our east winds begin already to be very cold  o i have such a longing for children of my own and yet i do not think i could bear it if i had one i fancy i must feel more like a woman than like a man about that i sometimes hate the children i see on the streetyou know what i mean by hatewish they were somewhere else and not there to mock me and sometimes again i dont know how to go by them for the love of them especially the very wee ones  thursdayi have been still in the house since i wrote and i have worked i finished the italian story not well but as well as i can just now i must go all over it again some time soon when i feel in the humour to better and perfect it and now i have taken up an old story begun years ago and i have now rewritten all i had written of it then and mean to finish it what i have lost and gained is odd as far as regards simple writing of course i am in another world now but in some things though more clumsy i seem to have been freer and more plucky this is a lesson i have taken to heart i have got a jolly new name for my old story i am going to call it a country dance the two heroes keep changing places you know and the chapter where the most of this changing goes on is to be called up the middle down the middle it will be in six or perhaps seven chapters i have never worked harder in my life than these last four days if i can only keep it up  saturdayyesterday leslie stephen who was down here to lecture called on me and took me up to see a poor fellow a sort of poet who writes for him and who has been eighteen months in our infirmary and may be for all i know eighteen months more it was very sad to see him there in a little room with two beds and a couple of sick children in the other bed a girl came in to visit the children and played dominoes on the counterpane with them the gas flared and crackled the fire burned in a dull economical way stephen and i sat on a couple of chairs and the poor fellow sat up in his bed with his hair and beard all tangled and talked as cheerfully as if he had been in a kings palace or the great kings palace of the blue air he has taught himself two languages since he has been lying there i shall try to be of use to him  we have had two beautiful spring days mild as milk windy withal and the sun hot i dreamed last night i was walking by moonlight round the place where the scene of my story is laid it was all so quiet and sweet and the blackbirds were singing as if it was day it made my heart very cool and happyever yours       robert

and living there are one or two song birds and a cuckoo all the fruittrees are in flower and the beeches make sunshine in a shady place i begin to go all right you need not be vexed about my health i really was ill at first as bad as i have been for nearly a year but the forest begins to work and the air and the sun and the smell of the pines if i could stay a month here i should be as right as possible thanks for your letteryour faithful       r l s     to mrs sitwell        swanston tuesday april 1875  my dear friendi have been so busy away to bridge of allan with my father first and then with simpson and baxter out here from saturday till monday i had no time to write and as it is am strangely incapable thanks for your letter i have been reading such lots of law and it seems to take away the power of writing from me from morning to night so often as i have a spare moment i am in the embrace of a law bookbarren embraces i am in good spirits and my heart smites me as usual when i am in good spirits about my parents if i get a bit dull i am away to london without a scruple but so long as my heart keeps up i am all for my parents  what do you think of henleys hospital verses19 they were to have been dedicated to me but stephen wouldnt allow itsaid it would be pretentious  wednesdayi meant to have made this quite a decent letter this morning but listen i had pain all last night and did not sleep well and now am cold and sickish and strung up ever and again with another flash of pain will you remember me to everybody my principal characteristics are cold poverty and scots lawthree very bad things oo how the rain falls the mist is quite low on the hill the birds are twittering to each other about the indifferent season o heres a gem for you an old godly woman

from a quarter to seven and today from four with interval for dinner to eleven you see the sad strait i am in for inkÃ€ demain  sundaythis is the third inkbottle i have tried and still its nothing to boast of my journey went off all right and i have kept ever in good spirits last night indeed i did think my little bit of gaiety was going away down the wind like a whiff of tobacco smoke but today it has come back to me a little the influence of this place is assuredly all that can be worst against one mais il faut lutter i was haunted last night when i was in bed by the most cold desolate recollections of my past life here i was glad to try and think of the forest and warm my hands at the thought of it o the quiet grey thickets and the yellow butterflies and the woodpeckers and the outlook over the plain as it were over a sea o for the good fleshly stupidity of the woods the body conscious of itself all over and the mind forgotten the clean air nestling next your skin as though your clothes were gossamer the eye filled and content the whole man happy whereas here it takes a pull to hold yourself together it needs both hands and a book of stoical maxims and a sort of bitterness at the heart by way of armourever your faithful r l s  wednesdayi am so played out with a cold in my eye that i cannot see to write or read without difficulty it is swollen horrible so how i shall look as orsino god knows i have my fine clothes tho henleys sonnets have been taken for the cornhill he is out of hospital now and dressed but still not too much to brag of in health poor fellow i am afraid  sundayso i have still rather bad eyes and a nasty sore throat i play orsino every day in all the pomp of solomon splendid francis the first clothes heavy with gold and stage jewellery i play it ill enough i believe but me and the clothes and the wedding wherewith the clothes and me are reconciled produce every night a thrill of admiration our cook told my mother there is a servants night you know that she and the housemaid were just prood to be able to say it was oor young gentleman to sup afterwards with these clothes on and a wonderful lot of gaiety and

is very admirable sport any way then both my afternoons have been so pleasantly occupiedtaking henley drives i had a business to carry him down the long stair and more of a business to get him up again but while he was in the carriage it was splendid it is now just the top of spring with us the whole country is mad with green to see the cherryblossom bitten out upon the black firs and the black firs bitten out of the blue sky was a sight to set before a king you may imagine what it was to a man who has been eighteen months in an hospital ward the look of his face was a wine to me he plainly has been little in the country before imagine this i always stopped him on the bridges to let him enjoy the great cry of green that goes up to heaven out of the river beds and he asked more than once what noise is thatthe watero almost incredulously and then quite a long while after do you know the noise of the water astonished me very much i was much struck by his putting the question twice i have lost the sense of wonder of course but there must be something to wonder at for henley has eyes and ears and an immortal soul of his own  i shall send this off today to let you know of my

years slip away colvin and we walk little cycles and turn in little abortive spirals and come out again hot and weary to find the same view before us the same hill barring the road only bless god for it we have still the same eye to see with and if the scene be not altogether unsightly we can enjoy it whether or no i feel quite happy but curiously inert and passive something for the winds to blow over and the sun to glimpse on and go off again as it might be a tree or a gravestone all this willing and wishing and striving leads a man nowhere after all here i am back again in my old humour of a sunny equanimity to see the world fleet about me and the days chase each other like sun patches and the nights like cloudshadows on a windy day content to see them go and no wise reluctant for the cool evening with its dew and stars and fading strain of tragic red and i ask myself why i ever leave this humour what i have gained and the winds blow in the trees with a sustained pish and the birds

accepting the first contribution of r l s has     by an accident been preserved and is so interesting both for its     occasion and for the light it throws on the writers care and     kindness as an editor that by permission of his representatives i     here print it 93 stands of course for the novel quatrevingt     treize        15 waterloo place s w 15574      dear siri have read with great interest your article on victor     hugo and also that which appeared in the last number of macmillan i     shall be happy to accept hugo and if i have been rather long in     answering you it is only because i wished to give a second reading     to the article and have lately been very much interrupted      i will now venture to make a few remarks and by way of preface i     must say that i do not criticise you because i take a low view of     your powers but for the very contrary reason i think very highly     of the promise shown in your writings and therefore think it worth     while to write more fully than i can often to contributors nor do i     set myself up as a judgei am very sensible of my own failings in     the critical department and merely submit what has occurred to me     for your consideration      i fully agree with the greatest portion of your opinions and think     them very favourably expressed the following points struck me as     doubtful when i read and may perhaps be worth notice      first you seem to make the distinction between dramatic and     novelistic art coincide with the distinction between romantic and     18th century this strikes me as doubtful as at least to require     qualification to my mind hugo is far more dramatic in spirit than     fielding though his method involves as you show exceedingly well     a use of scenery and background which would hardly be admissible in     drama i am not ablei fairly confessto define the dramatic     element in hugo or to say why i think it absent from fielding and     richardson yet surely hugos own dramas are a sufficient proof that     a drama may be romantic as well as a novel though of course the     pressure of the great moral forces etc must be indicated by     different means the question is rather a curious one and too wide     to discuss in a letter i merely suggest what seems to me to be an     obvious criticism on your argument      secondly you speak very sensibly of the melodramatic and claptrap     element in hugo i confess that it seems to me to go deeper into his     work than you would apparently allow i think it for example very     palpable even in notre dame and i doubt the historical fidelity     though my ignorance of mediÃ¦val history prevents me from putting my     finger on many faults the consequence is that in my opinion you are     scarcely just to scott or fielding as compared with hugo granting     fully his amazing force and fire he seems to me to be deficient     often in that kind of healthy realism which is so admirable in     scotts best work for example though my scotch blood for i can     boast of some may prejudice me i am profoundly convinced that     balfour of burley would have knocked m lantenac into a cocked hat     and stormed la tourgue if it had been garrisoned by 19 x 19 french     spouters of platitude in half the time that gauvain and cimourdain     took about it in fact balfour seems to me to be flesh and blood     and gauvain  co to be too often mere personified bombast and     therefore i fancy that old mortality will outlast 93 though     notre dame is far better than quentin durward and les     misÃ©rables perhaps better than any this is of course fair     matter of opinion      thirdly i dont think that you quite bring out your meaning in     saying that 93 is a decisive symptom i confess that i dont quite     see in what sense it decides precisely what question a sentence or     so would clear this up      fourthly as a matter of form i think but i am very doubtful that     it might possibly have been better not to go into each novel in     succession but to group the substance of your remarks a little     differently of course i dont want you to alter the form i merely     notice the point as suggesting a point in regard to any future     article      many of your criticisms in detail strike me as very good i was much     pleased by your remarks on the storm in the travailleurs there     was another very odd storm as it struck me on a hasty reading in     93 where there is mention of a beautiful summer evening and yet     the wind is so high that you cant hear the tocsin you do justice     also and more than justice to hugos tenderness about children     that i think points to one great source of his power      it would be curious to compare hugo to a much smaller man chas     reade who is often a kind of provincial or daily telegraph hugo     however that would hardly do in the cornhill i shall send your     article to the press and hope to use it in july any alterations can     be made when the article is in type if any are desirable i cannot     promise definitely in advance but at any rate it shall appear as     soon as may be      excuse this long rigmarole and believe me to be yours very truly        leslie stephen      i shall hope to hear from you again if ever you come to town you     will find me at 8 southwell gardens close to the gloucester road     station of the underground i am generally at home except from 3     to 5    15 portfolio    16 richmond seeley    17 the essay notes on the movements of young children    18 i

on the 14th of july 1875 passed with credit his examination for the bar at edinburgh stevenson thenceforth enjoyed whatever status and consideration attaches to the title of advocate but he made no serious attempt to practise and by the 25th of the same month had started with sir walter simpson for france here he lived and tramped for several weeks among the artist haunts of fontainebleau and the neighbourhood occupying himself chiefly with studies of the french poets and poetry of the fifteenth century which afterwards bore fruit in his papers on charles of orleans and franÃ§ois villon thence he travelled to join his parents at wiesbaden and homburg returning in the autumn to scotland he made to please them an effort to live the ordinary life of an edinburgh advocateattending trials and spending his mornings in wig and gown at the parliament house but this attempt was before long abandoned as tending to waste of time and being incompatible with his real occupation of literature through the next winter and spring he remained in edinburgh except for a short winter walking tour in ayrshire and galloway and a month spent among his friends in london in the late summer of 1876 after a visit to the west highlands he made the canoe trip with sir walter simpson which furnished the subject of the inland voyage followed by a prolonged autumn stay at grez and barbizon the life atmosphere and scenery of these forest haunts had charmed and soothed him as we have seen since he was first introduced to them by his cousin mr r a m stevenson in the spring of 1875 an unfettered unconventional openair existence passed face to face with nature and in the company of congenial people engaged like himself in grappling with the problems and difficulties of an art had been what he had longed for most consistently through all the agitations of his youth and now he had found just such an existence and with it as he thought peace of mind health and the spirit of unimpeded work  but peace of mind was not to be his for long what indeed awaited him in the forest was something different and more momentous it was his fate the romance which decided his life and the companion whom he resolved to make his own at all hazards but of this hereafter to continue briefly the annals of the time the year 1877 was again spent between edinburgh london the fontainebleau region and several different temporary abodes in the artists and other quarters of paris with an excursion in the company of his parents to the lands end in august in 1878 a similar general mode of life was varied by a visit with his parents in march to burford bridge where he made warm friends with a senior to whom he had long looked up from a distance mr george meredith by a spell of secretarial work under professor fleeming jenkin who was serving as a juror on the paris exhibition and lastly by the autumn tramp through the cÃ©vennes afterwards recounted with so much charm in travels with a donkey the first half of 1879 was again spent between london scotland and france  during these four years it should be added stevensons health was very passable it often indeed threatened to give way after any prolonged residence in edinburgh but was generally soon restored by openair excursions during which he was capable of fairly vigorous and sustained daily exercise or by a spell of life among the woods of fontainebleau they were also the years in which he settled for good into his chosen profession of letters he worked rather desultorily for the first twelve months after his call to the bar but afterwards with evergrowing industry and success winning from the critical a full measure of recognition though relatively little so far from the general public in 1875 and 1876 he contributed as a journalist though not frequently to the academy and vanity fair and in 1877 more abundantly to london a weekly review founded by mr glasgow brown an acquaintance of edinburgh speculative days and carried on after the failure of that gentlemans health by mr henley but he had no great gift or liking for journalism or for any work not calling for the best literary form and finish he could give where he found special scope for such work was in the cornhill magazine under the editorship of mr leslie stephen here he continued his critical papers on men and books already begun in 1874 with victor hugo and began in 1876 the series of papers afterwards collected in virginibus puerisque they were continued in 1877 and in greater number throughout 1878 his first published stories appeared as followsa lodging for the night temple bar october 1877 the sire de malÃ©troits door temple bar january 1878 and will o the mill cornhill magazine january 1878 in may 1878 followed his first travel book the inland voyage containing the account of his canoe trip from antwerp to grez this was to stevenson a year of great and various productiveness besides six or eight characteristic essays of the virginibus puerisque series there appeared in london the set of fantastic modern tales called the new arabian nights conceived and written in an entirely different key from any of his previous work as well as the kindly sentimental comedy of french artist life providence and the guitar and in the portfolio the picturesque notes on edinburgh republished at the end of the year in book form during the autumn and winter of this year he wrote travels with a donkey in the cÃ©vennes and was much and eagerly engaged in the planning of plays in collaboration with mr henley of which one deacon brodie was finished in the spring of 1879 in the same spring he drafted in edinburgh but afterwards laid by four chapters on ethics a study of which he once spoke as being always his veiled mistress under the name of lay morals  but abounding in good work as this period was and momentous as it was in regard to stevensons future life it is a period which figures but meagrely in his correspondence and in this book must fill disproportionately little space without the least breach of friendship or even of intimate confidence on occasion stevenson had begun as was natural and necessary to wean himself from his entire dependence on his friend and counsellor of the last two years to take his life more into his own hands and to intermit the regularity of his correspondence with her a few new correspondents appear but to none of us in these days did he write more than scantily partly his growing absorption by the complications of his life and the interests of his work left him little time or inclination for letterwriting partly his greater freedom of movement made it unnecessary on his way backwards and forwards between scotland and france his friends in london had the chance of seeing him much more frequently than of yore he avoided formal and dresscoated society but in the company of congenial friends whether men or women and in places like the savile club his favourite haunt he was as brilliant and stimulating as ever and however acute his inward preoccupations his visits were always a delight     to sidney colvin        edinburgh end of july 1875  my dear colvinherewith you receive the rest of henleys hospital work he was much pleased by what you said of him and asked me to forward these to you for your opinion one poem the spring sorrow seems to me the most beautiful i thank god for this petit bout de consolation that by henleys own account this one more lovely thing in the world is not altogether without some trace of my influence let me say that i have been something sympathetic which the mother found and contemplated while she yet carried it in her womb this in my profound discouragement is a great thing for me if i cannot do good with myself at least it seems i can help others better inspired i am at least a skilful accoucheur my discouragement is from many causes among others the rereading of my italian story forgive me colvin but i cannot agree with you it seems green fruit to me if not really unwholesome it is profoundly feeble damn its weakness moreover i stick over my fontainebleau it presents difficulties to me that i surmount slowly  i am very busy with bÃ©ranger for the britannica shall be up in town on friday or saturdayever yours       r l s advocate     to mrs thomas stevenson        chez siron barbizon seine et marne august 1875  my dear motheri have been three days at a place called grez a pretty and very melancholy village on the plain a low bridge of many arches choked with sedge great fields of white and yellow waterlilies poplars and willows innumerable and about it all such an atmosphere of sadness and slackness one could do nothing but get into the boat and out of it again and yawn for bedtime  yesterday bob and i walked home it came on a very creditable thunderstorm we were soon wet through sometimes the rain was so heavy that one could only see by holding the hand over the eyes and to crown all we lost our way and wandered all over the place and into the artillery range among broken trees with big shot lying about among the rocks it was near dinnertime when we got to barbizon and it is supposed that we walked from twentythree to twentyfive miles which is not bad for the advocate who is not tired this morning i was very glad to be back again in this dear place and smell the wet forest in the morning  simpson and the rest drove back in a carriage and got about as wet as we did  why dont you write i have no more to sayever your affectionate son       robert louis stevenson     to mrs sitwell      at this time stevenson was much occupied as were several young    writers his contemporaries with imitating the artificial forms of    early french verse only one of his attempts i believe has been    preserved besides the two contained in this letter the second is a    variation on a theme of banvilles       chÃ¢teau renard loiret august 1875  i have been walking these last days from place to place and it does make it hot for walking with a sack in this weather i am burned in horrid patches of red my nose i fear is going to take the lead in colour simpson is all flushed as if he were seen by a sunset i send you here two rondeaux i dont suppose they will amuse anybody but me but this measure short and yet intricate is just what i desire and i have had some good times walking along the glaring roads or down the poplar alley of the great canal pitting my own humour to this old verse    far have you come my lady from the town   and far from all your sorrows if you please   to smell the good seawinds and hear the seas   and in green meadows lay your body down    to find your pale face grow from pale to brown   your sad eyes growing brighter by degrees   far have you come my lady from the town   and far from all your sorrows if you please    here in this seaboard land of old renown   in meadow grass go wading to the knees   bathe your whole soul a while in simple ease   there is no sorrow but the sea can drown   far have you come my lady from the town       nous nirons plus au bois    well walk the woods no more   but stay beside the fire   to weep for old desire   and things that are no more       the woods are spoiled and hoar   the ways are full of mire   well walk the woods no more   but stay beside the fire       we loved in days of yore   love laughter and the lyre   ah god but death is dire   and death is at the door   well walk the woods no more       robert louis stevenson     to mrs sitwell      the special mood or occasion of unaccustomed bitterness which    prompted this rhapsody has passed from memory beyond recall the date    must be after his return from his second excursion to fontainebleau       swanston late summer 1875 thursday  i have been staying in town and could not write a word it is a fine strong night full of wind the trees are all crying out in the darkness funny to think of the birds asleep outside on the tossing branches the little bright eyes closed the brave wings folded the little hearts that beat so hard and thick so much harder and thicker than ever human heart all stilled and quieted in deep slumber in the midst of this noise and turmoil why it will be as much as i can do to sleep in here in my walled room so loud and jolly the wind sounds through the open window the unknown places of the night invite the travelling fancy i like to think of the sleeping towns and sleeping farmhouses and cottages all the world over here by the white road poplarlined there by the clamorous surf isnt that a good dormitive  saturdayi cannot tell how i feel who can ever i feel like a person in a novel of george sands i feel i desire to go out of the house and begin life anew in the cool blue night never to come back here never never only to go on for ever by sunny day and grey day by bright night and foul by highway and byway town and hamlet until somewhere by a roadside or in some clean inn clean death opened his arms to me and took me to his quiet heart for ever if soon good if late well then latethere would be many a long bright mile behind me many a goodly many a serious sight i should die ripe and perfect and take my garnered experience with me into the cool sweet earth for i have died already and survived a death i have seen the grass grow rankly on my grave i have heard the train of mourners come weeping and go laughing away again and when i was alone there in the kirkyard and the birds began to grow familiar with the gravestone i have begun to laugh also and laughed and laughed until nightflowers came out above me i have survived myself and somehow live on a curious changeling a merry ghost and do not mind living on finding it not unpleasant only had rather a thousandfold died and been done with the whole damned show for ever it is a strange feeling at first to survive yourself but one gets used to that as to most things et puis is it not ones own fault why did not one lie still in the grave why rise again among mens troubles and toils where the wicked wag their shock beards and hound the weary out to labour when i was safe in prison and stone walls and iron bars were an hermitage about me who told me to burst the mild constraint and go forth where the sun dazzles and the wind pierces and the loud world sounds and jangles all through the weary day i mind an old print of a hermit coming out of a great wood towards evening and shading his bleared eyes to see all the kingdoms of the earth before his feet where towered cities and castled hills and stately rivers and good corn lands made one great chorus of temptation for his weak spirit and i think i am the hermit and would to god i had dwelt ever in the wood of penitence20       r l s     to sidney colvin      the burns herein mentioned is an article undertaken in the early    summer of the same year for the encyclopÃ¦dia britannica in the end    stevensons work was thought to convey a view of the poet too frankly    critical and too little in accordance with the accepted scotch    tradition and the publishers duly paying him for his labours    transferred the task to professor shairp the volume here announced    on the three scottish eighteenthcentury poets unfortunately never    came into being the charles of orleans essay appeared in the    cornhill magazine for december of the following year that on villon    with the story on the same theme a lodging for the night not    until the autumn of 1877 the essay on bÃ©ranger referred to at the    end of the letter was one commissioned and used by the editor of the    encyclopÃ¦dia spring was a prose poem of which the manuscript    sent to me at cambridge was unluckily lost in the confusion of a    change of rooms       edinburgh autumn 1875  my dear colvinthanks for your letter and news nomy burns is not done yet it has led me so far afield that i cannot finish it every time i think i see my way to an end some new game or perhaps wild goose starts up and away i go and then again to be plain i shirk the work of the critical part shirk it as a man shirks a long jump it is awful to have to express and differentiate burns in a column or two o golly i say you know it cant be done at the money all the more as im going to write a book about it ramsay fergusson and burns an essay or a critical essay but then im going to give lives of the three gentlemen only the gist of the book is the criticism by robert louis stevenson advocate hows that for cut and dry and i could write this book unless i deceive myself i could even write it pretty adequately i feel as if i was really in it and knew the game thoroughly you see what comes of trying to write an essay on burns in ten columns  meantime when i have done burns i shall finish charles of orleans who is in a good way about the fifth month i should think and promises to be a fine healthy child better than any of his elder brothers for a while and then perhaps a villon for villon is a very essential part of my ramsayfergussonburns i mean is a note in it and will recur again and again for comparison and illustration then perhaps i may try fontainebleau by the way but so soon as charles of orleans is polished off and immortalised for ever he and his pipings in a solid imperishable shrine of r l s my true aim and end will be this little book suppose i could jerk you out 100 cornhill pages that would easy make 200 pages of decent form and then thickish papereh would that do i dare say it could be made bigger but i know what 100 pages of copy bright consummate copy imply behind the scenes of weary manuscribing i think if i put another nothing to it i should not be outside the mark and 100 cornhill pages of 500 words means i fancy but i never was good at figures means 50000 words theres a prospect for an idle young gentleman who lives at home at ease the future is thick with inky fingers and then perhaps nobody would publish ah nom de dieu what do you think of all this will it paddle think you  i hope this pen will write it is the third i have tried  about coming up no thats impossible for i am worse than a bankrupt i have at the present six shillings and a penny i have a sounding lot of bills for christmas new dress suit for instance the old one having gone for parliament house and new white shirts to live up to my new profession im as gay and swell and gummy as can be only all my boots leak one pair water and the other two simple black mud so that my rig is more for the eye than a very solid comfort to myself that is my budget dismal enough and no prospect of any coin coming in at least for months so that here i am i almost fear for the winter certainly till after christmas and then it depends on how my bills turn out whether it shall not be till spring so meantime i must whistle in my cage my cage is better by one thing i am an advocate now if you ask me why that makes it better i would remind you that in the most distressing circumstances a little consequence goes a long way and even bereaved relatives stand on precedence round the coffin i idle finely i read boswells life of johnson martins history of france allan ramsay olivier basselin all sorts of rubbish Ã propos of burns commines juvÃ©nal des ursins etc i walk about the parliament house five forenoons a week in wig and gown i have either a five or six mile walk or an hour or two hard skating on the rink every afternoon without fail  i have not written much but like the seamans parrot in the tale i have thought a deal you have never by the way returned me either spring or bÃ©ranger which is certainly a dd shame i always comforted myself with that when my conscience pricked me about a letter to you thus conscienceo no thats not appropriate in this connectionever yours       robert louis stevenson  i say is there any chance of your coming north this year mind you that promise is now more respectable for age than is becoming       r l s     to charles baxter      the following epistle in verse with its mixed flavour of burns and    horace gives a lively picture of winter forenoons spent in the    parliament  house

two following letters refer to the essay on the spirit of spring    which i was careless enough to lose in the process of a change of    rooms at cambridge the petits poÃ¨mes en prose were attempts not    altogether successful in the form though not in the spirit of    baudelaire       swanston autumn 1875  my dear colvinthanks only why dont you tell me if i can get my spring printed i want to print it because its nice and genuine to boot and has got less side on than my other game besides i want coin badly  i am writing petits poÃ¨mes en prose their principal resemblance to baudelaires is that they are rather longer and not quite so good they are very clever words of two syllables o so awfully clever words of three o so damnably clever words of a devil of a number of syllables i have written fifteen in a fortnight i have also written some beautiful poetry i would like a cake and a cricketbat and a passkey to heaven if you please and as much money as my friend the baron rothschild can spare i used to look across to rothschild of a morning when we were brushing our hair and saythis is quite true only we were on the opposite side of the street and though i used to look over i cannot say i ever detected the beggar he feared to meet my eagle eyewell i used to say to him rothschild old man lend us five hundred francs and it is characteristic of rothys dry humour that he used never to reply when it was a question of money he was a very humorous dog indeed was rothy heighho those happy old days funny funny fellow the dear old baron  hows that for genuine american wit and humour take notice of this in your answer say for instance even although the letter had been unsigned i could have had no difficulty in guessing who was my dear lively witty correspondent yours letitia languish  omy mind has given way i have gone into a mild babbling sunny idiocy i shall buy a jews harp and sit by the roadside with a womans bonnet on my manly head begging my honest

days when they should be getting out of bed and into their horrid cold tubs by the light of a seven oclock candle with the dismal seven oclock frostflowers all over the window  show stephen what you please if you could show him how to give me money you would oblige sincerely yours r l s  i have a scroll of springtime somewhere but i know that it is not in very good order and do not feel myself up to very much grind over it i am damped about springtime thats the truth of it it might have been four or five quid  sir i shall shave my head if this goes on all men take a pleasure to gird at me the laws of nature are in open war with me the wheel of a dogcart took the toes off my new boots gout has set in with extreme rigour and cut me out of the cheap refreshment of beer i leant my back against

contented with myself but i cant get away that is absolutely prevented by the state of my purse and my debts which i may say are red like crimson i dont know how i am to clear my hands of them nor when not before christmas anyway yesterday i was twentyfive so please wish me many happy returnsdirectly this one was not unhappy anyway i have got back a good deal into my old random littlethought way of life and do not care whether i read write speak or walk so long as i do something i have a great delight in this wheelskating i have made great advance in it of late can do a good many amusing things i mean amusing in my senseamusing to do you know i lose all my forenoons at court so it is but the time passes it is a great pleasure to sit and hear cases argued or advised this is quite autobiographical but i feel as if it was some time since we met and i can tell you i am glad to meet you again in every way you see but that of work the world goes well with me my health is better than ever it was before i get on without any jar nay as if there never had been a jar with my parents if it werent about that work id be happy but the fact is i dont thinkthe fact is im going to trust in providence about work if i could get one or two pieces i hate out of my way all would be well i think but these obstacles disgust me and as i know i ought to do them first i dont do anything i must finish this off or ill just lose another day ill try to write again soonever your faithful friend       r l s     to mrs sitwell      the review of robert brownings inn album here mentioned appears in

snowstorm sleeping with my window open and smoking in my cold tub in the morning so as it would do your heart good to see moreover i am in pretty good form otherwise fontainebleau lags it has turned out more difficult than i expected in some places but there is a deal of it ready and i think straight  i was at a concert on saturday and heard hallÃ© and norman neruda play that sonata of beethovens you remember and i felt very funny but i went and took a long spanking walk in the dark and got quite an appetite for dinner i did thats not bragging  as you say a concert wants to be gone to with someone and i know who i have done rather an amusing paragraph or two for vanity fair on the inn album i have slated r b pretty handsomely i am in a desperate hurry so goodbyeever your faithful friend

however principally sick of the family evil despondency the sun is gone out utterly and the breath of the people of this city lies about as a sort of damp unwholesome fog in which we go walking with bowed hearts if i understand what is a contrite spirit i have one it is to feel that you are a small jar or rather as i feel myself a very large jar of pottery work rather mal rÃ©ussi and to make every allowance for the potter i beg pardon potter with a capital p on his illsuccess and rather wish he would reduce you as soon as possible to potsherds however there are many things to do yet before we go    grossir la pÃ¢te universelle   faite des formes que dieu fond  for instance i have never been in a revolution yet i pray god i may be in one at the end if i am to make a mucker the best way to make a mucker is to have your back set against a wall and a few lead pellets whiffed into you in a moment while yet you are all in a heat and a fury of combat with drums sounding on all sides and people crying and a general smash like the infernal orchestration at the end of the huguenots  please pardon me for having been so long of writing and show your pardon by writing soon to me it will be a kindness for i am sometimes very dull edinburgh is much changed for the worse by the absence of bob and this damned weather weighs on me like a curse yesterday or the day before there came so black a rain squall that i was frightenedwhat a child would call frightened you know for want of a better wordalthough in reality it has nothing to do with fright i lit the gas and sat cowering in my chair until it went away againever yours       r l s  o i am trying my hand at a novel just now it may interest you to know i am bound to say i do not think it will be a success however its an amusement for the moment and work work is your only ally against the bearded people that squat upon their hams in the dark places of life and embrace people horribly as they go by god save us

raining often there is not much pleasure in life certainly as it stands at present nous nirons plus au bois hÃ©las  i meant to write some more last night but my father was ill and it put it out of my way he is better this morning  if i had written last night i should have written a lot but this morning i am so dreadfully tired and stupid that i can say nothing i was down at leith in the afternoon god bless me what horrid women i saw i never knew what a plainlooking race it was before i was sick at heart with the looks of them and the children filthy and ragged and the smells and the fat black mud  my soul was full of disgust ere i got back and yet the ships were beautiful to see as they are always and on the pier there was a clean cold wind that smelt a little of the sea though it came down the firth and the sunset had a certain Ã©clat and warmth perhaps if i could get more work done i should be in a better trim to enjoy filthy streets and people and cold grim weather but i dont much feel as if it was what i would have chosen i am tempted every day of my life to go off on another walking tour i like that better than anything else that i knowever your faithful friend

fontainebleau long ago long ago and leslie stephen is worse than tepid about itliked some parts of it very well the son of belial moreover he proposes to shorten it and i who want money and money soon and not glory and the illustration of the english language i feel as if my poverty were going to consent  2nd im as fit as a fiddle after my walk i am four inches bigger about the waist than last july there thats your prophecy did that i am on charles of orleans now but i dont know where to send him stephen obviously spews me out of his mouth and i spew him out of mine so help me a man who doesnt like my fontainebleau his head must be turned  3rd if ever you do come across my spring i beg your pardon for referring to it again but i dont want you to forget send it off at once  4th i went to ayr

last it is a sunday blowing hard with a grey sky with the leaves flying and i have nothing to say i ought to have no doubt since its so long since last i wrote but there are times when peoples lives stand still if you were to ask a squirrel in a mechanical cage for his autobiography it would not be very gay every spin may be amusing in itself but is mighty like the last you see i compare myself to a lighthearted animal and indeed i have been in a very good humour for the weather has been passable i have taken a deal of exercise and done some work but i have the strangest repugnance for writing indeed i have nearly got myself persuaded into the notion that letters dont arrive in order to salve my conscience for never sending them off im reading a great deal of fifteenth century trial of joan of arc paston letters basin21 etc also boswell daily by way of a bible i mean to read boswell now until the day i die and now and again a bit of pilgrims progress is that all yes i think thats all i have a thing in proof for the cornhill called virginibus puerisque charles of orleans is again laid aside but in a good state of furtherance this time a paper called a defence of idlers which is really a defence of r l s is in a good way so you see i am busy in a tumultuous knotless sort of fashion and as i say i take lots of exercise and im as brown as a berry  this is the first letter ive written foro i dont know how long  july 30ththis is i suppose three weeks after i began do please forgive me  to the highlands first to the jenkins then to antwerp thence by canoe with simpson to paris and grez on the loing and an old acquaintance of mine on the skirts of fontainebleau to complete our cruise next spring if were all alive and jolly by loing and loire saone and rhone to the mediterranean it should make a jolly book of gossip i imagine  god bless you       robert louis stevenson  psvirginibus puerisque is in august cornhill charles of orleans is finished and sent to stephen idlers ditto and sent to grove but ive no word of either so ive not been idle       r l s     to w e henley      in a wellknown passage of the inland voyage the following incident    is related to the same purport but in another  style       chauny aisne september 1876  my dear henleyhere i am you see and if you will take to a map you will observe i am already more than two doors from antwerp whence i started i have fought it through under the worst weather i ever saw in france i have been wet through nearly every day of travel since the second inclusive besides this i have had to fight against pretty mouldy health so that on the whole the essayist and reviewer has shown i think some pluck four days ago i was not a hundred miles from being miserably drowned to the immense regret of a large circle of friends and the permanent impoverishment of british essayism and reviewery my boat culbutted me under a fallen tree in a very rapid current and i was a good while before i got on to the outside of that fallen tree rather a better while than i cared about when i got up i lay some time on my belly panting and exuded fluid all my symptoms jusqu ici are trifling but ive a damned sore throatyours ever       r l s     to mrs sitwell      part of the hair trunk still exists in ms it contains some    tolerable fooling but is chiefly interesting from the fact that the    seat of the proposed bohemian colony from cambridge is to be in the    navigator islands showing the direction which had been given to    stevensons thoughts by the conversation of the new zealand official    mr seed two years before       17 heriot row edinburgh may 1877   a perfect chorus of repudiation is sounding in my ears and although you say nothing i know you must be repudiating me all the same write i cannottheres no good mincing matters a letter frightens me worse than the devil and i am just as unfit for correspondence as if i had never learned the three rs  let me give my news quickly before i relapse into my usual idleness i have a terror lest i should relapse before i get this finished courage r l s on leslie stephens advice i gave up the idea of a book of essays he said he didnt imagine i was rich enough for such an amusement and moreover whatever was worth publication was worth republication so the best of those i had already an apology for idlers is in proof for the cornhill i have villon to do for the same magazine but god knows when ill get it done for drums trumpetsim engaged upontrumpets drumsa novel scthe hair trunk or the ideal commonwealthsc it is a most absurd story of a lot of young cambridge fellows who are going to found a new society with no ideas on the subject and nothing but bohemian tastes in the place of ideas and who arewell i cant explain about the trunkit would take too longbut the trunk is the fun of iteverybody steals it burglary marine fight life on desert island on west coast of scotland sloops etc the first scene where they make their grand schemes and get drunk is supposed to be very funny by henley i really saw him laugh over it until he cried  please write to me although i deserve it so little and show a christian spiritever your faithful friend       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin        edinburgh august 1877  my dear colvinim to be whipped away tomorrow to penzance where at the postoffice a letter will find me glad and grateful i am well but somewhat tired out with overwork i have only been home a fortnight this morning and i have already written to the tune of fortyfive cornhill pages and upwards the most of it was only very laborious recasting and remodelling it is true but it took it out of me famously all the same  temple bar appears to like my villon so i may count on another market there in the future i hope at least i am going to put it to the proof at once and send another story the sire de malÃ©troits mousetrap a true novel in the old sense all unities preserved moreover if thats anything and i believe with some little merits not so clever perhaps as the last but sounder and more natural  my villon is out this month i should so much like to know what you think of it stephen has written to me Ã  propos of idlers that something more in that vein would be agreeable to his views from stephen i count that a devil of a lot  i am honestly so tired this morning that i hope you will take this for what its worth and give me an answer in peaceever yours       louis stevenson     to mrs sitwell      neither the stepfathers story nor the st michaels mounts essay    here mentioned ever to my knowledge came into being       penzance august 1877   you will do well to stick to your burn that is a delightful life you sketch and a very fountain of health i wish i could live like that but alas it is just as well i got my idlers written and done with for i have quite lost all power of resting i have a goad in my flesh continually pushing me to work work work i have an essay pretty well through for stephen a story the sire de malÃ©troits mousetrap with which i shall try temple bar another story in the clouds the stepfathers story most pathetic work of a high morality or immorality according to point of view and lastly also in the clouds or perhaps a little farther away an essay on the two st michaels mounts historical and picturesque perhaps if it didnt come too long i might throw in the bass rock and call it three sea fortalices or something of that kind you see how work keeps bubbling in my mind then i shall do another fifteenth century paper this autumnla sale and petit jehan de saintrÃ© which is a kind of fifteenth century sandford and merton ending in horrid immoral cynicism as if the author had got tired of being didactic and just had a good wallow in the mire to wind up with and indemnify himself for so much restraint  cornwall is not much to my taste being as bleak as the bleakest parts of scotland and nothing like so pointed and characteristic it has a flavour of its own though which i may try and catch if i find the space in the proposed article will o the mill i sent red hot to stephen in a fit of haste and have not yet had an answer i am quite prepared for a refusal but i begin to have more hope in the story line and that should improve my income anyway i am glad you liked villon some of it was not as good as it ought to be but on the whole it seems pretty vivid and the features strongly marked vividness and not style is now my line style is all very well but vividness is the real line of country if a thing is meant to be read it seems just as well to try and make it readable i am such a dull person now i cannot keep off my own immortal works indeed they are scarcely ever out of my head and yet i value them less and less every day but occupation is the great thing so that a man should have his life in his own pocket and never be thrown out of work by anything i am glad to hear you are better i must stopgoing to lands endalways your faithful friend       robert louis stevenson     to a patchett martin      this correspondent living at the time in australia was i believe    the first to write and seek stevensons acquaintance from admiration    of his work meaning especially the cornhill essays of the    virginibus puerisque series so far as they had yet appeared the    present herein referred to is mr martins volume called a sweet    girl graduate and other poems melbourne 1876       1877  dear sirit would not be very easy for me to give you any idea of the pleasure i found in your present people who write for the magazines probably from a guilty conscience are apt to suppose their works practically unpublished it seems unlikely that any one would take the trouble to read a little paper buried among so many others and reading it read it with any attention or pleasure and so i can assure you your little book coming from so far gave me all the pleasure and encouragement in the world  i suppose you know and remember charles lambs essay on distant correspondents well i was somewhat of his way of thinking about my mild productions i did not indeed imagine they were read and i suppose i may say enjoyed right round upon the other side of the big football we have the honour to inhabit and as your present was the first sign to the contrary i feel i have been very ungrateful in not writing earlier to acknowledge the receipt i dare say however you hate writing letters as much as i can do myself for if you like my article i may presume other points of sympathy between us and on this hypothesis you will be ready to forgive me the delay  i may mention with regard to the piece of verses called such is life that i am not the only one on this side of the football aforesaid to think it a good and bright piece of work and recognised a link of sympathy with the poets who play in hostelries at euchrebelieve me dear sir yours truly       r l s     to a patchett martin        17 heriot row edinburgh december 1877  my dear siri am afraid you must already have condemned me for a very idle fellow truly here it is more than two months since i received your letter i had no fewer than three journals to acknowledge and never a sign upon my part if you have seen a cornhill paper of mine upon idling you will be inclined to set it all down to that but you will not be doing me justice indeed i have had a summer so troubled that i have had little leisure and still less inclination to write letters i was keeping the devil at bay with all my disposable activities and more than once i thought he had me by the throat the odd conditions of our acquaintance enable me to say more to you than i would to a person who lived at my elbow and besides i am too much pleased and flattered at our correspondence not to go as far as i can to set myself right in your eyes  in this damnable confusion i beg pardon i have lost all my possessions or near about and quite lost all my wits i wish i could lay my hands on the numbers of the review for i know i wished to say something on that head more particularly than i can from memory but where they have escaped to only time or chance can show however i can tell you so far that i was very much pleased with the article on bret harte it seemed to me just clear and to the point i agreed pretty well with all you said about george eliot a high but may we not adda rather dry lady did youi forgetdid you have a kick at the stern works of that melancholy puppy and humbug daniel deronda himselfthe prince of prigs the literary abomination of desolation in the way of manhood a type which is enough to make a man forswear the love of women if that is how it must be gained hats off all the same you understand a woman of genius  of your poems i have myself a kindness for noll and nell although i dont think you have made it as good as you ought verse five is surely not quite melodious i confess i like the sonnet in the last number of the reviewthe sonnet to england  please if you have not and i dont suppose you have already read it institute a search in all melbourne for one of the rarest and certainly one of the best of booksclarissa harlowe for any man who takes an interest in the problems of the two sexes that book is a perfect mine of documents and it is written sir with the pen of an angel miss howe and lovelace words cannot tell how good they are and the scene where clarissa beards her family with her fan going all the while and some of the quarrel scenes between her and lovelace and the scene where colonel marden goes to mr hall with lord m trying to compose matters and the colonel with his eternal finest woman in the world and the inimitable affirmation of mobraynothing nothing could be better you will bless me when you read it for this recommendation but indeed i can do nothing but recommend clarissa i am like that frenchman of the eighteenth century who discovered habakkuk and would give no one peace about that respectable hebrew for my part i never was able to get over his eminently respectable name isaiah is the boy if you must have a prophet no less about clarissa i meditate a choice work a dialogue on man woman and clarissa harlowe it is to be so clever that no array of terms can give you any idea and very likely that particular array in which i shall finally embody it less than any other  do you know my dear sir what i like best in your letter the egotism for which you thought necessary to apologise i am a rogue at egotism myself and to be plain i have rarely or never liked any man who was not the first step to discovering the beauties of gods universe is usually a perhaps partial apprehension of such of them as adorn our own characters when i see a man who does not think pretty well of himself i always suspect him of being in the right and besides if he does not like himself whom he has seen how is he ever to like one whom he never can see but in dim and artificial presentments  i cordially reciprocate your offer of a welcome it shall be at least a warm one are you not my first my only admirera dear tie besides you are a man of sense and you treat me as one by writing to me as you do and that gives me pleasure also please continue to let me see your work i have one or two things coming out in the cornhill a story called the sire de malÃ©troits door in temple bar and a series of articles on edinburgh in the portfolio but i dont know if these last fly all the way to melbourneyours very truly       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin      the inland voyage it must be remembered at this time just put    into the publishers hands was the authors first book the crane    sketch mentioned in the second of the following notes to me was the    wellknown frontispiece to that book on which mr walter crane was    then at work the essay pans pipes reprinted in virginibus    puerisque was written about this time       hÃ´tel des Ã‰trangers dieppe january 1 1878  my dear colvini am at the inland voyage again have finished another section and have only two more to execute but one at least of these will be very longthe longest in the bookbeing a great digression on french artistic tramps i only hope paul may take the thing i want coin so badly and besides it would be something donesomething put outside of me and off my conscience and i should not feel such a muff as i do if once i saw the thing in boards with a ticket on its back i think i shall frequent circulating libraries a good deal the preface shall stand over as you suggest until the last and then sir we shall see this to be read with a big voice  this is new years day let me my dear colvin wish you a very good year free of all misunderstanding and bereavement and full of good weather and good work you know best what you have done for me and so you will know best how heartily i mean thisever yours       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin      i had had business in edinburgh and had stayed with stevensons    parents in his absence       paris january or february 1878  my dear colvinmany thanks for your letter i was much interested by all the edinburgh gossip most likely i shall arrive in london next week i think you know all about the crane sketch but it should be a river not a canal you know and the look should be cruel lewd and kindly all at once there is more sense in that greek myth of pan than in any other that i recollect except the luminous hebrew one of the fall one of the biggest things done if people would remember that all religions are no more than representations of life they would find them as they are the best representations licking shakespeare  what an inconceivable cheese is alfred de

de la source bd st michel paris 15th feb 1878  my dear fathera thought has come into my head which i think would interest you christianity is among other things a very wise noble and strange doctrine of life nothing is so difficult to specify as the position it occupies with regard to asceticism it is not ascetic christ was of all doctors if you will let me use the word one of the least ascetic and yet there is a theory of living in the gospels which is curiously indefinable and leans towards asceticism on one side although it leans away from it on the other in fact asceticism is used therein as a means not as an end the wisdom of this world consists in making oneself very little in order to avoid many knocks in preferring others in order that even when we lose we shall find some pleasure in the event in putting our desires outside of ourselves in another ship so to speak so that when the worst happens there will be something left you see i speak of it as a doctrine of life and as a wisdom for this world people must be themselves i suppose i feel every day as if religion had a greater interest for me but that interest is still centred on the little roughandtumble world in which our fortunes are cast for the moment i cannot transfer my interests not even my religious interest to any different sphere i have had some sharp lessons and some very acute sufferings in these last sevenandtwenty yearsmore even than you would guess i begin to grow an old man a little sharp i fear and a little close and unfriendly but still i have a good heart and believe in myself and my fellowmen and the god who made us all there are not many sadder people in this world perhaps than i i have my eye on a sickbed22 i have written letters today that it hurt me to write and i fear it will hurt others to receive i am lonely and sick and out of heart well i still hope i still believe i still see the good in the inch and cling to it it is not much perhaps but it is always something  i find i have wandered a thousand miles from what i meant it was this of all passages bearing on christianity in that form of a worldly wisdom the most christian and so to speak the key of the whole position is the christian doctrine of revenge and it appears that this came into the world through paul there is a fact for you it was to speak of this that i began this letter but i have got into deep seas and must go on  there is a fine text in the bible i dont know where to the effect that all things work together for good to those who love the lord strange as it may seem to you everything has been in one way or the other bringing me a little nearer to what i think you would like me to be tis a strange world indeed but there is a manifest god for those who care to look for him  this is a very solemn letter for my surroundings in this busy cafÃ© but i had it on my heart to write it and indeed i was out of the humour for anything lighterever your affectionate son       robert louis stevenson  pswhile i am writing gravely let me say one word more i have taken a step towards more intimate relations with you but dont expect too much of me try to take me as i am this is a rare moment and i have profited by it but take it as a rare moment usually i hate to speak of what i really feel to that extent that when i find myself cornered i have a tendency to say the reverse       r

batten on him he is so nearly wearying you and yet he never does or rather he never does until he gets near the end when he begins to wean you from him so that youre as pleased to be done with him as you thought you would be sorry i wonder if its old age it is a little i am sure a young person would get sickened by the dead level of meanness and cowardliness you require to be a little spoiled and cynical before you can enjoy it i have just finished the way of the world there is only one person in itno there are threewho are nice the wild american woman and two of the dissipated young men dolly and lord nidderdale all the heroes and heroines are just ghastly but what a triumph is lady carbury that is real sound strong genuine work the man who could do that if he had had courage might have written a fine book he has preferred to write many readable ones i meant to write such a long nice letter but i cannot hold the pen       r l s     to mrs thomas stevenson      the following refers to the newspaper criticisms on the inland    vogage       hÃ´tel du val de grÃ¢ce rue st jacques paris sunday june 1878  my dear motherabout criticisms i was more surprised at the tone of the critics than i suppose any one else and the effect it has produced in me is one of shame if they liked that so much i ought to have given them something better thats all and i shall try to do so still it

and the book seemed to be quite a household word with them p g himself promised to help me in my bargains with publishers which said he and i doubt not very truthfully he could manage to much greater advantage than i he is also to read an inland voyage over again and send me his cuts and cuffs in private after having liberally administered his kisses coram publico i liked him very much of all the pleasant parts of my profession i think the spirit of other men of letters makes the pleasantest  do you know your sunset was very good the attack to speak learnedly was so plucky and odd i have

be a myth because i have seen him acting so often in the palais royal he plays the duke in tricoche et cacolet i knew his nose at once the part he plays here is very dull for him but conscientious as for the bedmaker shes a dream a kind of cheerful innocent nightmare i never saw so poor an imitation of humanity i cannot workcannot even the guitar is still undone i can only write ditchwater tis ghastly but i am quite cheerful and that is more important do you think you could prepare the printers for a possible breakdown this week i shall try all i know on monday but if i can get nothing better than i got this morning i prefer to drop a week telegraph to me if you think it necessary i shall not leave till wednesday at soonest shall write again       r l s     to edmund gosse      the matter of the loan and its repayment here touched on comes up    again in stevensons last letter of all that which closes the book    stevenson and mr gosse had planned a joint book of old murder    stories retold and had been to visit the scene of one famous murder    together       edinburgh april 16 1879 pool of siloam by el dorado          delectable mountains arcadia  my dear gosseherewith of the dibbsa homely fiver how and why do you continue to exist i do so ill but for a variety of reasons first i wait an angel to come down and trouble the waters second more angels thirdwell more angels the waters are sluggish the angelswell the angels wont come thats about all but i sit waiting and waiting and people bring me meals which help to pass time im sure its very kind of them and sometimes i whistle to myself and as theres a very pretty echo at my pool of siloam the things agreeable to hear the sun continues to rise every day to my growing wonder the moon by night thee shall not smite and the stars are all doing as well as can be expected the air of arcady is very brisk and pure and we command many enchanting prospects in space and time i do not yet know much about my situation for to tell the truth i only came here by the run since i began to write this letter i had to go back to date it and i am grateful to you for having been the occasion of this little outing what good travellers we are if we had only faith no man need stay in edinburgh but by unbelief my religious organ has been ailing for a while past and i have lain a great deal in edinburgh a sheer hulk in consequence but i got out my wings and have taken a change of air  i read your book with great interest and ought long ago to have told you so an ordinary man would say that he had been waiting till he could pay his debts the book is good reading your personal notes of those you saw struck me as perhaps most sharp and best held see as many people as you can and make a book of them before you die that will be a living book upon my word you have the touch required i ask you to put hands to it in private already think of what carlyles caricature of old coleridge is to us who never saw s t c with that and kubla khan we have the man in the fact carlyles picture of course is not of the author of kubla but of the author of that surprising friend which has knocked the breath out of two generations of hopeful youth your portraits would be milder sweeter more true perhaps and perhaps not so truthtellingif you will take my meaning  i have to thank you for an introduction to that beautifulno thats not the wordthat jolly with an arcadian jollitything of vogelweides also for your preface some day i want to read a whole book in the same picked dialect as that preface i think it must be one e w gosse who must write it he has got himself into a fix with me by writing the preface i look for a great deal and will not be easily pleased  i never thought of it but my new book which should soon be out contains a visit to a murder scene but not done as we should like to see them for of course i was running another hare  if you do not answer this in four pages i shall stop the enclosed fiver at the bank a step which will lead to your incarceration for life as my visits to arcady are somewhat uncertain you had better address 17 heriot row edinburgh as usual i shall walk over for the note if i am not yet homebelieve me very really yours       robert louis stevenson  i charge extra for a flourish when it is successful this isnt so you have it gratis is there any news in babylon the great my fellowcreatures are electing school boards here in the midst of the ages it is very composed of them i cant think why they do it nor why i have written a real letter if you write a real letter back damme ill try to correspond with you a thing unknown in this age it is a consequence of the decay of faith we cannot believe that the fellow will be at the pains to read us     to w e henley      this is in reply to some technical criticisms of his correspondent on    the poem our lady of the snows referring to the trappist    monastery in the cÃ©vennes so called and afterwards published in    underwoods       edinburgh april 1879  my dear henleyheavens have i done the like clarify and strain indeed make it like marvell no less ill tell you whatyou may go to the devil thats what i think be eloquent is another of your pregnant suggestions i cannot sufficiently thank you for that one portrait of a person about to be eloquent at the request of a literary friend you seem to forget sir that rhyme is rhyme sir andgo to the devil  ill try to improve it but i shant be able too go to the devil  seriously youre a cool hand and then you have the brass to ask me why my steps went one by one why powers of man to rhyme with sun to be sure why else could it be and you yourself have been a poet grrrrr ill never be a poet any more men are so dd ungrateful and captious i declare i could weep    o henley in my hours of ease   you may say anything you please   but when i join the muses revel   begad i wish you at the devil   in vain my verse i plane and bevel   like banvilles rhyming devotees   in vain by many an artful swivel   lug in my meaning by degrees   im sure to hear my henley cavil   and grovelling prostrate on my knees   devote his body to the seas

greatly also likes my what was on the slate which under a new title yet unfound and with a new and on the whole kindly dÃ©nouement is going to shoot up and become a star  i see i must write some more to you about my monastery i am a weak brother in verse you ask me to rewrite things that i have already managed just to write with the skin of my teeth if i dont rewrite them its because i dont see how to write them better not because i dont think they should be but curiously enough you condemn two of my favourite passages one of which is j w ferriers favourite of the whole here i shall think its you who are wrong you see i did not try to make good verse but to say what i wanted as well as verse would let me i dont like the rhyme ear and hear but the couplet my undissuaded heart i hear whisper courage in my ear is exactly what i want for the thought and to me seems very energetic as speech if not as verse would daring be better than courage je me le demande no it would be ambiguous as though i had used it licentiously for daringly and that would cloak the sense  in short your suggestions have broken the heart of the scald he doesnt agree with them all and those he does agree with the spirit indeed is willing but the dd flesh cannot cannot cannot see its way to profit by i think ill lay it by for nine years like horace i think the well of castalys run out no more the muses

on its publication       swanston june 1879  my dear auntieif you could only think a little less of me and others and a great deal more of your delightful self you would be as nearly perfect as there is any need to be i think i have travelled with donkeys all my life and the experience of this book could be nothing new to me but if ever i knew a real donkey i believe it is yourself you are so eager to think well of everybody else except when you are angry on account of some third person that i do not believe you have ever left yourself time to think properly of yourself you never understand when other people are unworthy nor when you yourself are worthy in the highest degree oblige us all by having a guid conceit o yoursel and despising in the future the whole crowd including your affectionate nephew       r l s     to edmund gosse      this letter is contemporary with the muchdebated cornhill essay on    some aspects of burns afterwards published in familiar studies of    men and books merediths story is probably the tragic    comedians       swanston july 24 1879  my dear gossei have greatly enjoyed your article which seems to me handsome in tone and written like a fine old english gentleman but is there not a hitch in the sentence at foot of page 153 i get lost in it  chapters viii and ix of merediths story are very good i think but who wrote the review of my book whoever he was he cannot write he is humane but a duffer i could weep when i think of him for surely to be virtuous and incompetent is a hard lot i should prefer to be a bold pirate the gay sailorboy of immorality and a publisher at once my mind is extinct my appetite is expiring i have fallen altogether into a holloweyed yawning way of life like the parties in burne joness pictures talking of burns is this not sad weg i use the term of reproach not because i am angry with you this time but because i am angry with myself and desire to give pain talking i say of robert burns the inspired poet is a very gay subject for study i made a kind of chronological table of his various loves and lusts and have been comparatively speechless ever since i am sorry to say it but there was something in him of the vulgar bagmanlike professional seduceroblige me by taking down and reading for the hundredth time i hope his twa dogs and his address to the unco guid i am only a scotchman after all you see and when i have beaten burns i am driven at once by my parental feelings to console him with a sugarplum but hang me if i know anything i like so well as the twa dogs even a common englishman may have a glimpse as it were from pisgah of its extraordinary merits  english thea dull people incapable of comprehending the scottish tongue their history is so intimately connected with that of scotland that we must refer our readers to that heading their literature is principally the work of venal scotsstevensons handy cyclopÃ¦dia glescow blaikie  bannock  remember me in suitable

evidences and supports burns is the aforesaid cornhill    essay not the rejected encyclopÃ¦dia article       17 heriot row edinburgh july 28 1879  my dear colvini am just in the middle of your rembrandt the taste for bummkopf and his works is agreeably dissembled so far as i have gone and the reins have never for an instant been thrown upon the neck of that wooden pegasus he only perks up a learned snout from a footnote in the cellarage of a paragraph just in short where he ought to be to inspire confidence in a wicked and adulterous generation but mind you bummkopf is not human he is dagon the fish god and down he will come sprawling on his belly or his behind with his hands broken from his helpless carcase and his head rolling oft into a corner up will rise on the other side sane pleasurable human knowledge a thing of beauty and a joy etc  im three parts through burns long dry unsympathetic but sound and i think in its dry way interesting next i shall finish the story and then perhaps thoreau meredith has been staying with morley has been cracking me up he writes to that literary robespierre and he the l r is about it is believed to write to me on a literary scheme is it keats hope you my heart leaps at the thoughtyours ever       r l s     to edmund gosse      with reference to the term of reproach it must be explained that    mr gosse who now signs with only one initial used in these days to    sign with two e w g the nickname weg was fastened on him by    stevenson partly under a false impression as to the order of these    initials partly in friendly derision of a passing fit of lameness    which called up the memory of silas wegg the immortal literary    gentleman with a wooden leg of our mutual friend       17 heriot row edinburgh july 29 1879  my dear gosseyours was delicious you are a young person of wit one of the last of them wit being quite out of date and humour confined to the scotch church and the spectator in unconscious survival you will probably be glad to hear that i am up again in the world i have breathed again and had a frolic on the strength of it the frolic was yesterday sawbath the scene the royal hotel bathgate i went there with a humorous friend to lunch the maid soon showed herself a lass of character she was looking out of window on being asked what she was after im lookin for my lad says she is that him weel ive been lookin for him a my life and ive never seen him yet was the response i wrote her some verses in the vernacular she read them theyre no bad for a beginner said she the landlords daughter miss stewart was present in oil colour so i wrote her a declaration in verse and sent it by the handmaid she miss s was present on the stair to witness our departure in a warm suffused condition damn it gosse you neednt suppose that youre the only poet in the world  your statement about your initials it will be seen i pass over in contempt and silence when once i have made up my mind let me tell you sir there lives no pockpudding who can change it your anger i defy your unmanly reference to a wellknown statesman i puff from me sir like so much vapour weg is your name weg w e g  my enthusiasm

 july 1879july 1880   in france as has been already indicated stevenson had met the american lady mrs osbourne who was afterwards to become his wife her domestic relations had not been fortunate to his chivalrous nature her circumstances appealed no less than her person and almost from their first meeting which befell at grez immediately after the canoe voyage of 1876 he conceived for her an attachment which was to transform and determine his life on her return to america with her children in the autumn of 1878 she determined to seek a divorce from her husband hearing of her intention together with very disquieting news of her health and hoping that after she had obtained the divorce he might make her his wife stevenson suddenly started for california at the beginning of august 1879  for what he knew must seem to his friends and especially to his father so wild an errand he would ask for no supplies from home but resolved risking his whole future on the issue to test during this adventure his power of supporting himself and eventually others by his own labours in literature in order from the outset to save as much as possible he made the journey in the steerage and the emigrant train with this prime motive of economy was combined a secondthat of learning for himself the pinch of life as it is felt by the unprivileged and the poor he had long ago disclaimed for himself the character of a consistent firstclass passenger in lifeand also it should be added a third that of turning his experiences to literary account on board ship he took daily notes with this intent and wrote moreover the story of a lie for an english magazine arrived at his destination he found his health as was natural badly shaken by the hardships of the journey tried his favourite openair cure for three weeks at an angora goatranche some twenty miles from monterey and then lived from september to december in that old californian coasttown itself under the conditions set forth in the earlier of the following letters and under a heavy combined strain of personal anxiety and literary effort from the notes taken on board ship and in the emigrant train he drafted an account of his journey intending to make a volume matching in form though in contents much unlike the earlier inland voyage and travels with a donkey he wrote also the essays on thoreau and the japanese reformer yoshida torajiro afterwards published in familiar studies of men and books one of the most vivid of his shorter tales the pavilion on the links hereinafter referred to as a blood and thunder as well as a great part of another and longer story drawn from his new experiences and called a vendetta in the west but this did not satisfy him and was never finished he planned at the same time in the spirit of romantic comedy that tale which took final shape four years later as prince otto towards the end of december 1879 stevenson moved to san francisco where he lived for three months in a workmans lodging leading a life of frugality amounting it will be seen to selfimposed penury and working always with the same intensity of application until his health utterly broke down one of the causes which contributed to his illness was the fatigue he underwent in helping to watch beside the sickbed of a child the son of his landlady during a part of march and april he lay at deaths doorhis first really dangerous sickness since childhoodand was slowly tended back to life by the joint ministrations of his future wife and the physician to whom his letter of thanks will be found below his marriage ensued in may 1880 immediately afterwards to try and consolidate his recovery he moved to a deserted miningcamp in the californian coast range and has recorded the aspects and humours of his life there with a masters touch in the silverado squatters  the news of his dangerous illness and approaching marriage had in the meantime unlocked the parental heart and purse supplies were sent ensuring his present comfort with the promise of their continuance for the future and of a cordial welcome for the new daughterinlaw in his fathers house the following letters chosen from among those written during the period in question depict his way of life and reflect at once the anxiety of his friends and the strain of the time upon himself     to sidney colvin      the story mentioned at the beginning of this letter is the story of a    lie       on board ss devonia an hour or two out of new york august         1879  my dear colvini have finished my story the handwriting is not good because of the ships misconduct thirtyone pages in ten days at sea is not bad  i shall write a general procuration about this story on another bit of paper i am not very well bad food bad air and hard work have brought me down but the spirits keep good the voyage has been most interesting and will make if not a series of pall mall articles at least the first part of a new book the last weight on me has been trying to keep notes for this purpose indeed i have worked like a horse and am now as tired as a donkey if i should have to push on far by rail i shall bring nothing but my fine bones to port

stevensonindeed says iyes sir says hescene closes  i am not beaten yet though disappointed if i am its for good this time you know what for good means in my vocabularysomething inside of 12 months perhaps but who knows at least if i fail in my great purpose i shall see some wild life in the west and visit both florida and labrador ere i return but i dont yet know if i have the courage to stick to life without it man i was sick sick sick of this last year     to sidney colvin        in the emigrant train from new york to san francisco august         1879  dear colvini am in the cars between pittsburgh and chicago just now bowling through ohio i am taking charge of a kid whose mother is asleep with one eye while i write you this with the other i reached n y sunday night and by five oclock monday was under way for the west it is now about ten on wednesday morning so i have already been about forty hours in the cars it is impossible to lie down in them which must end by being very wearying  i had no idea how easy it was to commit suicide there seems nothing left of me i died a while ago i do not know who it is that is travelling    of where or how i nothing know       and why i do not care       enough if even so   my travelling eyes my travelling mind can go   by flood and field and hill by wood and meadow fair   beside the susquehannah and along the delaware    i think i hope i dream no more       the dreams of otherwhere       the cherished thoughts of yore   i have been changed from what i was before   and drunk too deep perchance the lotus of the air   beside the susquehannah and along the delaware    unweary god me yet shall bring       to lands of brighter air       where i now half a king   shall with enfranchised spirit loudlier sing   and wear a bolder front than that which now i wear   beside the susquehannah and along the delaware  exit muse hurried by childs games  have at you again being now well through indiana in america you eat better than anywhere else fact the food is heavenly  no man is any use until he has dared everything i feel just now as if i had and so might become a man if ye have faith like a grain of mustard seed that is so true just now i have faith as big as a cigarcase i will not say die and do not fear man nor fortune       r l s     to w e henley        crossing nebraska saturday august 23 1879  my dear henleyi am sitting on the top of the cars with a mill party from missouri going west for his health desolate flat prairie upon all hands here and there a herd of cattle a yellow butterfly or two a patch of wild sunflowers a wooden house or two then a wooden church alone in miles of waste then a windmill to pump water when we stop which we do often for emigrants and freight travel together the kine first the men after the whole plain is heard singing with cicadae this is a pause as you may see from the writing what happened to the old pedestrian emigrants what was the tedium suffered by the indians and trappers of our youth the imagination trembles to conceive this is now saturday 23rd and i have been steadily travelling since i parted from you at st pancras it is a strange vicissitude from the savile club to this i sleep with a man from pennsylvania who has been in the states navy and mess with him and the missouri bird already alluded to we have a tin washbowl among four i wear nothing but a shirt and a pair of trousers and never button my shirt when i land for a meal i pass my coat and feel dressed this life is to last till friday saturday or sunday next it is a strange affair to be an emigrant as i hope you shall see in a future work i wonder if this will be legible my present station on the waggon roof though airy compared to the cars is both dirty and insecure i can see the track straight before and straight behind me to either horizon peace of mind i enjoy with extreme serenity i am doing right i know no one will think so and dont care my body however is all to whistles i dont eat but man i can sleep the car in front of mine is chock full of chinese  mondaywhat it is to be ill in an emigrant train let those declare who know i slept none till late in the morning overcome with laudanum of which i had luckily a little bottle all today i have eaten nothing and only drunk two cups of tea for each of which on the pretext that the one was breakfast and the other dinner i was charged fifty cents our journey is through ghostly deserts sage brush and alkali and rocks without form or colour a sad corner of the world i confess i am not jolly but mighty calm in my distresses my illness is a subject of great mirth to some of my fellowtravellers and i smile rather sickly at their jests  we are going along bitter creek just now a place infamous in the history of emigration a place i shall remember myself among the blackest i hope i may get this posted at ogden utah       r l s     to sidney colvin        coast line mountains california september 1879  here is another curious start in my life i am living at an angora goatranche in the coast line mountains eighteen miles from monterey i was camping out but got so sick that the two rancheros took me in and tended me one is an old bearhunter seventytwo years old and a captain from the mexican war the other a pilgrim and one who was out with the bear flag and under fremont when california was taken by the states they are both true frontiersmen and most kind and pleasant captain smith the bearhunter is my physician and i obey him like an oracle  the business of my life stands pretty nigh still i work at my notes of the voyage it will not be very like a book of mine but perhaps none the less successful for that i will not deny that i feel lonely today but i do not fear to go on for i am doing right i have not yet had a word from england partly i suppose because i have not yet written for my letters to new york do not blame me for this neglect if you knew all i have been through you would wonder i had done so much as i have i teach the ranche children reading in the morning for the mother is from home sickever your affectionate friend       r l s     to sidney colvin        monterey california october 1879  my dear colvini received your letter with delight it was the first word that reached me from the old country i am in good health now i have been pretty seedy for i was exhausted by the journey and anxiety below even my point of keeping up i am still a little weak but that is all i begin to ingrease23 it seems already my book is about half drafted the amateur emigrant that is can you find a better name i believe it will be more popular than any of my others the canvas is so much more popular and larger too fancy it is my fourth that voluminous writer i was vexed to hear about the last chapter of the lie and pleased to hear about the rest it would have been odd if it had no birthmark born where and how it was it should by rights have been called the devonia for that is the habit with all children born in a steerage  i write to you hoping for more give me news of all who concern me near or far or big or little here sir in california you have a willing hearer  monterey is a place where there is no summer or winter and pines and sand and distant hills and a bay all filled with real water from the pacific you will perceive that no expense has been spared i now live with a little french doctor i take one of my meals in a little french restaurant for the other two i sponge the population of monterey is about that of a dissenting chapel on a wet sunday in a strong church neighbourhood they are mostly mexican and indianmixedever yours       r l s     to edmund gosse        monterey 8th october 1879  my dear wegi know i am a rogue and the son of a dog yet let me tell you when i came here i had a weeks misery and a fortnights illness and since then i have been more or less busy in being content this is a kind of excuse for my laziness i hope you will not excuse yourself my plans are still very uncertain and it is not likely that anything will happen before christmas in the meanwhile i believe i shall live on here between the sandhills and the sea as i think mr swinburne hath it i was pretty nearly slain my spirit lay down and kicked for three days i was up at an angora goatranche in the santa lucia mountains nursed by an old frontiersman a mighty hunter of bears and i scarcely slept or ate or thought for four days two nights i lay out under a tree in a sort of stupor doing nothing but fetch water for myself and horse light a fire and make coffee and all night awake hearing the goatbells ringing and the treefrogs singing when each new noise was enough to set me mad then the bearhunter came round pronounced me real sick and ordered me up to the ranche  it was an odd miserable piece of my life and according to all rule it should have been my death but after a while my spirit got up again in a divine frenzy and has since kicked and spurred my vile body forward with great emphasis and success  my new book the amateur emigrant is about half drafted i dont know if it will be good but i think it ought to sell in spite of the deil and the publishers for it tells an odd enough experience and one i think never yet told before look for my burns in the cornhill and for my story of a lie in pauls withered babe the new quarterly you may have seen the latter ere this reaches you tell me if it has any interest like a good boy and remember that it was written at sea in great anxiety of mind what is your news send me your works like an angel au fur et Ã  mesure of their apparation for i am naturally short of literature and i do not wish to rust  i fear this can hardly be called a letter to say truth i feel already a difficulty of approach i do not know if i am the same man i was in europe perhaps i can hardly claim acquaintance with you my head went round and looks another way now for when i found myself over here in a new land and all the past uprooted in the one tug and i neither feeling glad nor sorry i got my last lesson about mankind i mean my latest lesson for of course i do not know what surprises there are yet in store for me but that i could have so felt astonished me beyond description there is a wonderful callousness in human nature which enables us to live i had no feeling one way or another from new york to california until at dutch flat a mining camp in the sierra i heard a cock crowing with a home voice and then i fell to hope and regret both in the same moment  is there a boy or a girl and how is your wife i thought of you more than once to put it mildly  i live here comfortably enough but i shall soon be left all alone perhaps till christmas then you may hope for correspondenceand may not iyour friend       r l s     to w e henley        monterey october 1879  my dear henleyherewith the pavilion on the links grand carpentry story in nine chapters and i should hesitate to say how many tableaux where is it to go god knows it is the dibbs that are wanted it is not bad though i say it carpentry of course but not bad at that and who else can carpenter in england now that wilkie collins is played out it might be broken for magazine purposes at the end of chapter iv i send it to you as i dare say payn may help if all else fails dibbs and speed are my mottoes  do acknowledge the pavilion by return i shall be so nervous till i hear as of course i have no copy except of one or two places where the vein would not run god prosper it poor pavilion may it bring me money for myself and my sick one who may read it i do not know how soon  love to your wife anthony and all i shall write to colvin today or tomorrowyours ever       r l s     to w e henley      the story spoken of in these letters as a vendetta in the west was    three parts written and then given up and destroyed        monterey october 1879  my dear henleymany thanks for your good letter which is the best way to forgive you for your previous silence i hope colvin or somebody has sent me the cornhill and the new quarterly though i am trying to get them in san francisco i think you might have sent me 1 some of your articles in the p m g24 2 a paper with the announcement of second edition and 3 the announcement of the essays in athenÃ¦um this to prick you in the future again choose in your head the best volume of labiche there is and post it to jules simoneau monterey monterey co california do this at once as he is my restaurant man a most pleasant old boy with whom i discuss the universe and play chess daily he has been out of france for thirtyfive years and never heard of labiche i have eightythree pages written of a story called a vendetta in the west and about sixty pages of the first draft of the amateur emigrant they should each cover from 130 to 150 pages when done that is all my literary news do keep me posted wont you your letter and bobs made the fifth and sixth i have had from europe in three months  at times i get terribly frightened about my work which seems to advance too slowly i hope soon to have a greater burden to support and must make money a great deal quicker than i used i may get nothing for the vendetta i may only get some forty quid for the emigrant i cannot hope to have them both done much before the end of november  o and look here why did you not send me the spectator which slanged me rogues and rascals is that all you are worth  yesterday i set fire to the forest for which had i been caught i should have been hung out of hand to the nearest tree judge lynch being an active person hereaway you should have seen my retreat which was entirely for strategical purposes i ran like hell it was a fine sight at night i went out again to see it it was a good fire though i say it that should not i had a near escape for my life with a revolver i fired six charges and the six bullets all remained in the barrel which was choked from end to end from muzzle to breach with solid lead it took a man three hours to drill them out another shot and id have gone to kingdom come  this is a lovely place which i am growing to love the pacific licks all other oceans out of hand there is no place but the pacific coast to hear eternal roaring surf when i get to the top of the woods behind monterey i can hear the seas breaking all round over ten or twelve miles of coast from near carmel on my left out to point pinas in front and away to the right along the sands of monterey to castroville and the mouth of the salinas i was wishing yesterday that the world could getno what i mean was that you should be kept in suspense like mahomets coffin until the world had made half a revolution then dropped here at the station as though you had stepped from the cars you would then comfortably enter walters waggon the sun has just gone down the moon beginning to throw shadows you hear the surf rolling and smell the sea and the pines that shall deposit you at sanchezs saloon where we take a drink you are introduced to bronson the local editor i have no brain music he says im a mechanic you see but hes a nice fellow to adolpho sanchez who is delightful meantime i go to the p o for my mail thence we walk up alvarado street together you now floundering in the sand now merrily stumping on the wooden sidewalks i call at hadsells for my paper at length behold us installed in simoneaus little whitewashed backroom round a dirty tablecloth with franÃ§ois the baker perhaps an italian fisherman perhaps augustin dutra and simoneau himself simoneau franÃ§ois and i are the three sure cards the others mere waifs then home to my great airy rooms with five windows opening on a balcony i sleep on the floor in my camp blankets you instal yourself abed in the morning coffee with the little doctor and his little wife we hire a waggon and make a day of it and by night i should let you up again into the air to be returned to mrs henley in the forenoon following by god you would enjoy yourself so should i i have tales enough to keep you going till five in the morning and then they would not be at an end i forget if you asked me any questions and i sent your letter up to the city to one who will like to read it i expect other letters now steadily if i have to wait another two months i shall begin to be happy will you remember me most affectionately to your wife shake hands with anthony from me and god bless your mother  god bless stephen does he not know that i am a man and cannot live by bread alone but must have guineas into the bargain burns i believe in my own mind is one of my highwater marks meiklejohn flames me a letter about it which is so complimentary that i must keep it or get it published in the monterey californian some of these days i shall send an exemplaire of that paper it is hugeever your affectionate friend       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin        monterey 21st october 1879  my dear colvinalthough you have absolutely disregarded my plaintive appeals for correspondence and written only once as against god knows how many notes and notikins of minehere goes again i am now all alone in monterey a real inhabitant with a box of my own at the p o i have splendid rooms at the doctors where i get coffee in the morning the doctor is french and i mess with another jolly old frenchman the stranded fiftyeightyearold wreck of a goodhearted dissipated and once wealthy nantais tradesman my health goes on better as for work the draft of my book was laid aside at p 68 or so and i have now by way of change more than seventy pages of a novel a onevolume novel alas to be called either a chapter in the experience of arizona breckonridge or a vendetta in the west or a combination of the two the scene from chapter iv to the end lies in monterey and the adjacent country of course with my usual luck the plot of the story is somewhat scandalous containing an illegitimate father

 monterey november 1879  my dear mr hamertonyour letter to my father was forwarded to me by mistake and by mistake i opened it the letter to myself has not yet reached me this must explain my own and my fathers silence i shall write by this or next post to the only friends i have who i think would have an influence as they are both professors i regret exceedingly that i am not in edinburgh as i could perhaps have done more and i need not tell you that what i might do for you in the matter of the election is neither from friendship nor gratitude but because you are the only man i beg your pardon worth a damn i shall write to a third friend now i think of it whose father will have great influence  i find here of all places in the world your essays on art which i have read with signal interest i believe i shall dig an essay of my own out of one of them for it set me thinking if mine could only produce yet another in reply we could have the marrow out between us  i hope my dear sir you will not think badly of me for my long silence my head has scarce been on my shoulders i had scarce recovered from a long fit of useless illhealth than i was whirled over here doublequick time and by cheapest conveyance  i have been since pretty ill but pick up though still somewhat of a mossy ruin if you would view my countenance aright comeview it by the pale moonlight but that is on the mend i believe i have now a distant claim to tan  a letter will be more than welcome in this distant clime where i have a box at the postofficegenerally i regret to say empty could your recommendation introduce me to an american publisher my next book i should really try to get hold of here as its interest is international and the more i am in this country the more i understand the weight of your influence it is pleasant to be thus most at home abroad above all when the prophet is still not without honour in his own land     to edmund gosse      the copy of the monterey paper here mentioned never came to hand nor    have the contributions of r l s to that journal ever been traced       monterey 15th november 1879  my dear gosseyour letter was to me such a bright spot that i answer it right away to the prejudice of other correspondents or dants dont know how to spell it who have prior claims it is the history of our kindnesses that alone makes this world tolerable if it were not for that for the effect of kind words kind looks kind letters multiplying spreading making one happy through another and bringing forth benefits some thirty some fifty some a thousandfold i should be tempted to think our life a practical jest in the worst possible spirit so your four pages have confirmed my philosophy as well as consoled my heart in these ill hours  yes you are right monterey is a pleasant place but i see i can write no more tonight i am tired and sad and being already in bed have no more to do but turn out the lightyour affectionate friend r l s   i try it again by daylight once more in bed however for today it is mucho frio as we spaniards say and i had no other means of keeping warm for my work i have done a good spell 912 foolscap pages at least 8 of cornhill ah if i thought that i could get eight guineas for it my trouble is that i am all too ambitious just now a book whereof 70 out of 120 are scrolled a novel whereof 85 out of say 140 are pretty well nigh done a short story of 50 pp which shall be finished tomorrow or ill know the reason why this may bring in a lot of money but i dread to think that it is all on three chances if the three were to fail i am in a bog the novel is called a vendetta in the west i see i am in a grasping dismal humour and should as we americans put it quit writing in truth i am so haunted by anxieties that one or other is sure to come up in all that i write  i will send you herewith a monterey paper where the works of r l s appear nor only that but all my life on studying the advertisements will become clear i lodge with dr heintz take my meals with simoneau have been only two days ago shaved by the tonsorial artist michaels drink daily at the bohemia saloon get my daily paper from hadsells was stood a drink today by albano rodriguez in short there is scarce a person advertised in that paper but i know him and i may add scarce a person in monterey but is there advertised the paper is the marrow of the place its bonespooh i am tired of writing so sillily       r l s     to sidney colvin        monterey december 1879  today my dear colvin i send you the first part of the amateur emigrant 71 pp by far the longest and the best of the whole it is not a monument of eloquence indeed i have sought to be prosaic in view of the nature of the subject but i almost think it is interesting  whatever is done about any book publication two things remember i must keep a royalty and second i must have all my books advertised in the french manner on the leaf opposite the title i know from my own experience how much good this does an author with book buyers  the entire a e will be a little longer than the two others but not very much here and there i fancy you will laugh as you read it but it seems to me rather a clever book than anything else the book of a man that is who has paid a great deal of attention to contemporary life and not through the newspapers  i have never seen my burns the darling of my heart i await your promised letter papers magazines articles by friends reviews of myself all would be very welcome i am reporter for the monterey californian at a salary of two dollars a week comment trouvezvous Ã§a i am also in a conspiracy with the american editor a french restaurantman and an italian fisherman against the padre the enclosed poster is my last literary appearance it was put up to the number of 200 exemplaires at the witching hour and they were almost all destroyed by eight in the morning but i think the nickname will stick dos reales deux rÃ©aux two bits twentyfive cents about a shilling but in practice it is worth from ninepence to threepence thus two glasses of beer would cost two bits the italian fisherman an old garibaldian is a splendid fellow       r l s     to edmund gosse      the following is in acknowledgment of mr gosses volume called new    poems       monterey dec 8 1879  my dear wegi received your book last night as i lay abed with a pleurisy the result i fear of overwork gradual decline of appetite etc you know what a woodenhearted curmudgeon i am about contemporary verse i like none of it except some of my own i look back on that sentence with pleasure it comes from an honest heart hence you will be kind enough to take this from me in a kindly spirit the piece to my daughter is delicious and yet even here i am going to pick holes i am a beastly curmudgeon it is the last verse newly budded is off the venue and havent you gone ahead to make a poetry daybreak instead of sticking to your muttons and comparing with the mysterious light of stars the plain friendly perspicuous human day but this is to be a beast the little poem is eminently pleasant human and original  i have read nearly the whole volume and shall read it nearly all over again you have no rivals  bancrofts history of the united states even in a centenary edition is essentially heavy fare a little goes a long way i respect bancroft but i do not love him he has moments when he feels himself inspired to open up his improvisations upon universal history and the designs of god but i flatter myself i am more nearly acquainted with the latter than mr bancroft a man in the words of my plymouth brother who knows the lord must needs from time to time write less emphatically it is a fetter dance to the music of minute gunsnot at sea but in a region not a thousand miles from the sahara still i am halfway through volume three and shall count myself unworthy of the name of an englishman if i do not see the back of volume six the countryman of livingstone burton speke drake cook etc  i have been sweated not only out of my pleuritic fever but out of all my eating cares and the better part of my brains strange coincidence by aconite i have that peculiar and delicious sense of being born again in an expurgated edition which belongs to convalescence it will not be for long i hear the breakers roar i shall be steering head first for another rapid before many days nitor aquis said a certain eton boy translating for his sins a part of the inland voyage into latin elegiacs and from the hour i saw it or rather a friend of mine the admirable jenkin saw and recognised its absurd appropriateness i took it for my device in life i am going for thirty now and unless i can snatch a little rest before long i have i may tell you in confidence no hope of seeing thirtyone my health began to break last winter and has given me but fitful times since then this pleurisy though but a slight affair in itself was a huge disappointment to me and marked an epoch to start a pleurisy about nothing while leading a dull regular life in a mild climate was not my habit in past days and it is six years all but a few months since i was obliged to spend twentyfour hours in bed i may be wrong but if the niting is to continue i believe i must go it is a pity in one sense for i believe the class of work i might yet give out is better and more real and solid than people fancy but death is no bad friend a few aches and gasps and we are done like the truant child i am beginning to grow weary and timid in this big jostling city and could run to my nurse even although she should have to whip me before putting me to bed  will you kiss your little daughter from me and tell her that her father has written a delightful poem about her remember me please to mrs gosse to middlemore to whom some of these days i will write to  to  yes to  and to  i know you will gnash your teeth at some of these wicked grim catlike old poet if i were god i would sort youas we say in scotlandyour sincere friend       r l s  too young to be our child blooming good     to sidney colvin        monterey december 1879  my dear colvini have been down with pleurisy but now convalesce it was a slight attack but i had a hot fever pulse 150 and the thing reminds me of my weakness these miseries tell on me cruelly but things are not so hopeless as they might be so i am far from despair besides i think i may say i have some courage for life  but now look here       fables and tales    story of a lie                 100 pp like the donkey   providence and the guitar       52   will o the mill                45   a lodging for the night         40 about   sieur de malÃ©troits door       42                                                                say 280 pp in all  here is my scheme henley already proposed that caldecott should illustrate will o the mill the guitar is still more suited to him he should make delicious things for that and though the lie is not much in the way for pictures i should like to see my dear admiral in the flesh i love the admiral i give my head that mans alive as for the other two they need not be illustrated at all unless he likes  is this a dream altogether i would if necessary ask nothing down for the stories and only a small royalty but to begin from the first copy sold  i hate myself for being always on business but i cannot help my fears and anxieties about money even if all came well it would be many a long day before we could afford to leave this coast is it true that the donkey is in a second edition that should bring some money too ere long though not much i dare say you will see the guitar is made for caldecott moreover its a little thing i like i am no lover of either of the things in temple bar but they will make up the volume and perhaps others may like them better than i do they say republished stories do not sell well that is why i am in a hurry to get this out the public must be educated to buy mine or i shall never make a cent i have heaps of short stories in view the next volume will probably be called stories or a storybook and contain quite a different lot the pavilion on the links professor rensselaer the dead mans letter the wild man of the woods the devil on cramond sands they would all be carpentry stories pretty grim for the most part but of course thats all in the air as yetyours ever       r l s     to w e henley       monterey december 11th 1879  my dear henleymany many thanks for your long letter and now to rectifications  1 you are wrong about the lie from choosing a wrong standard compare it with my former stories not with scott or fielding or balzac or charles reade or even wilkie collins and where will you find anything half or a tenth part as good as the admiral or even dick or even the squire or even esther if you had thought of that you would have complimented me for advance but you were not quite sincere with yourself you were seeking arguments to make me devote myself to plays unbeknown of course to yourself  2 plays dear boy are madness for me just now the best play is hopeless before six months and more likely eighteen for outsiders like you and me and understand me i have to get money soon or it has no further interest for me i am nearly through my capital with what pluck i can muster against great anxieties and in a very shattered state of health i am trying to do things that will bring in money soon and i could not if i were not mad step out of my way to work at what might perhaps bring me in more but months ahead journalism you know well is not my forte yet if i could only get a roving commission from a paper i should leap at it and send them goodish no more than that goodish stuff  as for my poor literature dear henley you must expect for a time to find it worse and worse perhaps if god favours me a little at last it will pick up again now i am fighting with both hands a hard battle and my work while it will be as good as i can make it will probably be worth twopence if you despised the donkey dear boy you should have told me so at the time not reserved it for a sudden revelation just now when i am down in health wealth and fortune but i am glad you have said so at last never please delay such confidences any more if they come quickly they are a help if they come after long silence they feel almost like a taunt  now to read all this any one would think you had written unkindly which is not so as god who made us knows but i wished to put myself right ere i went on to state myself nothing has come but the volume of labiche the burns i have now given up the po authorities plainly regard it as contraband make no further efforts in that direction but please if anything else of mine appears see that my people have a copy i hoped and supposed my own copy would go as usual to the old address and let me use scotch i was fair affrontit when i found this had not been done  you have not told me how you are and i heard you had not been well please remedy this  the end of life yes henley i can tell you what that is how old are all truths and yet how far from commonplace old strange and inexplicable like the sphinx so i learn day by day the value and high doctrinality of suffering let me suffer always not more than i am able to bear for that makes a man mad as hunger drives the wolf to sally from the forest but still to suffer some and never to sink up to my eyes in comfort and grow dead in virtues and respectability i am a bad man by nature i suppose but i cannot be good without suffering a little and the end of life you will ask the pleasurable death of self a thing not to be attained because it is a thing belonging to heaven all this apropos of that good weak feverish fine spirit   we have traits in common we have almost the same strength and weakness intermingled and if i had not come through a very hot crucible i should be just as feverish my sufferings have been healthier than his mine have been always a choice where a man could be manly his have been so too if he knew it but were not so upon the face hence a morbid strain which his wounded vanity has helped to embitter  i wonder why i scratch every one today and i believe it is because i am conscious of so much truth in your strictures on my damned stuff i dont care there is something in me worth saying though i cant find what it is just yet and ere i die if i do not die too fast i shall write something worth the boards which with scarce an exception i have not yet done at the same time dear boy in a matter of vastly more importance than opera omnia ludovici stevenson i mean my life i have not been a perfect cad god help me to be less and less so as the days go on  the emigrant is not good and will never do for pmg though it must have a kind of rude interest r l s  i am now quite an americanyellow envelopes     to sidney colvin        608 bush street san francisco december 26 1879  my dear colvini am now writing to you in a cafÃ© waiting for some music to begin for four days i have spoken to no one but to my landlady or landlord or to restaurant waiters this is not a gay way to pass christmas is it and i must own the guts are a little knocked out of me if i could work i could worry through better but i have no style at command for the moment with the second part of the emigrant the last of the novel the essay on thoreau and god knows all waiting for me but i trust something can be done with the first part or by god ill starve here25  o colvin you dont know how much good i have done myself i feared to think this out by myself i have made a base use of you and it comes out so much better than i had dreamed but i have to stick to work now and heres december gone pretty near useless but lord love you october and november saw a great harvest it might have affected the price of paper on the pacific coast as for ink they havent any not what i call ink only stuff to write cookerybooks with or the works of hayley or the pallid perambulations of thei can find nobody to beat hayley i like good knockmedown blackstrap to write with that makes a mark and done with itby the way i have tried to read the spectator26 which they all say i imitate andits very wrong of me i knowbut i cant its all very fine you know and all that but its vapid they have just played the overture to norma and i know its a good one for i bitterly wanted the opera to go on i had just got thoroughly interestedand then no curtain to rise  i have written myself into a kind of spirits bless your dear heart by your leave but this is wild work for me nearly nine and me not back what will mrs carson think of me quite a nighthawk i do declare you are the worst correspondent in the worldno not that henley is thatwell i dont know i leave the pair of you to him that made yousurely with small attention but heres my service and ill away home to my den o much the better for this crack professor colvin       r l s     to sidney colvin        608 bush street san francisco january 10 1880  my dear colvinthis is a circular letter to tell my estate fully you have no right to it being the worst of correspondents but i wish to efface the impression of my last so to you it goes  any time between eight and halfpast nine in the morning a slender gentleman in an ulster with a volume buttoned into the breast of it may be observed leaving no 608 bush and descending powell with an active step the gentleman is r l s the volume relates to benjamin franklin on whom he meditates one of his charming essays he descends powell crosses market and descends in sixth on a branch of the original pine street coffee house no less i believe he would be capable of going to the original itself if he could only find it in the branch he seats himself at a table covered with waxcloth and a pampered menial of highdutch extraction and indeed as yet only partially extracted lays before him a cup of coffee a roll and a pat of butter all to quote the deity very good a while ago and r l s used to find the supply of butter insufficient but he has now learned the art to exactitude and butter and roll expire at the same moment for this refection he pays ten cents or five pence sterling Â£0 0s 5d  half an hour later the inhabitants of bush street observe the same slender gentleman armed like george washington with his little hatchet splitting kindling and breaking coal for his fire he does this quasipublicly upon the windowsill but this is not to be attributed to any love of notoriety though he is indeed vain of his prowess with the hatchet which he persists in calling an axe and daily surprised at the perpetuation of his fingers the reason is this that the sill is a strong supporting beam and that blows of the same emphasis in other parts of his room might knock the entire shanty into hell thenceforth for from three to four hours he is engaged darkly with an ink bottle yet he is not blacking his boots for the only pair that he possesses are innocent of lustre and wear the natural hue of the material turned up with caked and venerable slush the youngest child of his landlady remarks several times a day as this strange occupant enters or quits the house deres de author can it be that this brighthaired innocent has found the true clue to the mystery the being in question is at least poor enough to belong to that honourable craft  his next appearance is at the restaurant of one donadieu in bush street between dupont and kearney where a copious meal half a bottle of wine coffee and brandy may be procured for the sum of four bits alias fifty cents Â£0 2s 2d sterling the wine is put down in a whole bottleful and it is strange and painful to observe the greed with which the gentleman in question seeks to secure the last drop of his allotted half and the scrupulousness with which he seeks to avoid taking the first drop of the other this is partly explained by the fact that if he were to go over the markbang would go a tenpence he is again armed with a book but his best friends will learn with pain that he seems at this hour to have deserted the more serious studies of the morning when last observed he was studying with apparent zest the exploits of one rocambole by the late viscomte ponson du terrail this work originally of prodigious dimensions he had cut into liths or thicknesses apparently for convenience of carriage  then the being walks where is not certain but by about halfpast four a light beams from the windows of 608 bush and he may be observed sometimes engaged in correspondence sometimes once again plunged in the mysterious rites of the forenoon about six he returns to the branch original where he once more imbrues himself to the worth of fivepence in coffee and roll the evening is devoted to writing and reading and by eleven or halfpast darkness closes over this weird and truculent existence  as for coin you see i dont spend much only you and henley both seem to think my work rather bosh nowadays and i do want to make as much as i was making that is Â£200 if i can do that i can swim last year with my ill health i touched only Â£109 that would not do i could not fight it through on that but on Â£200 as i say i am good for the world and can even in this quiet way save a little and that i must do the worst is my health it is suspected i had an ague chill yesterday i shall know by tomorrow and you know if i am to be laid down with ague the game is pretty well lost but i dont know i managed to write a good deal down in monterey when i was pretty sickly most of the time and by god ill try ague and all i have to ask you frankly when you write to give me any good news you can and chat a little but just in the meantime give me no bad if i could get thoreau emigrant and vendetta all finished and out of my hand i should feel like a man who had made half a years income in a half year but until the two last are finished you see they dont fairly count  i am afraid i bore you sadly with this perpetual talk about my affairs i will try and stow it but you see it touches me nearly im the miser in earnest now last night when i felt so ill the supposed ague chill it seemed strange not to be able to afford a drink i would have walked half a mile tired as i felt for a brandy and sodaever yours       r l s     to w e henley        608 bush street san francisco january 1880  my dear henleyyou have got a letter ahead of me owing to the alpine accumulation of ill news i had to stagger under i will stand no complaints of my correspondence from england i having written near half as many letters again as i have received  do not damp me about my work quelle soit bonne ou mauvaise it has to be done you know the wolf is at the door and i have been seriously ill i am now at thoreau i almost blame myself for persevering in anything so difficult under the circumstances but it may set me up again in style which is the great point i have now Â£80 in the world and two houses to keep up for an indefinite period it is odd to be on so strict a regimen it is a week for instance since i have bought myself a drink and unless times change i do not suppose i shall ever buy myself another the health improves the pied piper is an idea it shall have my thoughts and so shall you the character of the p p would be highly comic i seem to see had you looked at the pavilion i do not think you would have sent it to stephen tis a mere story and has no higher pretension dibbs is its name i wish it was its nature also the vendetta at which you ignorantly puff out your lips is a real novel though not a good one as soon as i have found strength to finish the emigrant i shall also finish the vend and draw a breathi wish i could say and draw a cheque my spirits have risen contra fortunam i will fight this out and conquer you are all anxious to have me home in a hurry there are two or three objections to that but i shall instruct you more at large when i have time for today i am hunted having a pile of letters before me yet it is already drawing into duskyours affectionately       r l s     to w e henley      the dook de karneel  cornhill and marky de stephen is of course    mr leslie stephen the blood and thunder is the pavilion on the    links hester noble and don juan were the titles of two plays    planned and begun with w e henley the previous winter they were    never finished the french novels mentioned are by joseph mÃ©ry the    dialogue on character and destiny still exists in a fragmentary    condition george the pieman is a character in deacon brodie       608 bush street san francisco january 23rd 1880  my dear henleythat was good news the dook de karneel kcb taken a blood and thunder well i thought it had points now i know it and im to see a proof once more o glory hallelujah how beautiful is proof and how distressed that author man who dwells too far aloof his favourite words he always finds his friends misunderstand with oaths he reads his articles moist brow and clenchÃ©d hand impromtoo the last line firstrate when may i hope to see the deacon i pine for the deacon for proofs of the paviliono and for a categorical confession from you that the second edition of the donkey was a false alarm which i conclude from hearing no more  i have twice written to the marky de stephen each time with one of my bright papers so i should hear from him soon how are baron payn sir robert de bob and other members of the aristocracy    heres breid an wine an kebbuck an canty cracks at een     to the folks that mind o me when im awa   but them that hae forgot me o neer to be forgien     they may a gae tapsalteerie in a raw  i have mighty little to say dear boy to seem worth 212d i have thought of the piper but he does not seem to come as yet i get him too metaphysical i shall make a shot for hester as soon as i have finished the emigrant and the vendetta and perhaps my dialogue on character and destiny hester and don juan are the two that smile on me but i will touch nothing in the shape of a play until i have made my years income sure you understand and you see that i am right  i have read m auguste and the crime inconnu being now abonnÃ© to a library and found them very readable highly ingenious and so french that i could not keep my gravity the damned ones of the indies now occupy my attention i have myself already damned them repeatedly i am as you know the original person the wheels of whose chariot tarried but though i am so slow i am rootedly tenacious do not despair hester and the don are sworn in my soul and they shall be  is there no news real news newsy news heavenly blue this is strange remember me to the lady of the cawstle my toolip and ever was       george the pieman     to sidney colvin      with reference to the following it must be explained that the first    draft of the first part of the amateur emigrant when it reached me    about christmas had seemed to me compared to his previous travel    papers a somewhat wordy and spiritless record of squalid    experiences little likely to advance his still only halfestablished    reputation and i had written to him to that effect inopportunely    enough with a fuller measure even than usual of the frankness which    always marked our intercourse       608 bush street san francisco california january 1880  my dear colvini received this morning your long letter from paris well gods will be done if its dull its dull it was a fair fight and its lost and theres an end but fortunately dulness is not a fault the public hates perhaps they may like this vein of dulness if they dont damn them well try them with another i sat down on the back of your letter and wrote twelve cornhill pages this day as ever was of that same despised emigrant so you see my moral courage has not gone down with my intellect only frankly colvin do you think it a good plan to be so eminently descriptive and even eloquent in dispraise you rolled such a lot of polysyllables over me that a better man than i might have been disheartenedhowever i was not as you see and am not the emigrant shall be finished and leave in the course of next week and then ill stick to stories i am not frightened i know my mind is changing i have been telling you so for long and i suppose i am fumbling for the new vein well ill find it  the vendetta you will not much like i dare say and that must be finished next but ill knock you with the forest state a romance  im vexed about my letters i know it is painful to get these unsatisfactory things but at least i have written often enough and not one soul ever gives me any news about people or things everybody writes me sermons its good for me but hardly the food necessary for a man who lives all alone on fortyfive cents a day and sometimes less with quantities of hard work and many heavy thoughts if one of you could write me a letter with a jest in it a letter like what is written to real people in this worldi am still flesh and bloodi should enjoy it simpson did the other day and it did me as much good as a bottle of wine a lonely man gets to feel like a pariah after awhileor no not that but like a saint and martyr or a kind of macerated clergyman with pebbles in his boots a pillared simeon im damned if i know what but man alive i want gossip  my health is better my spirits steadier i am not the least cast down if the emigrant was a failure the pavilion by your leave was not it was a story quite adequately and rightly done i contend and when i find stephen for whom certainly i did not mean it taking it in i am better pleased with it than before i know i shall do better work than ever i have done before but mind you it will not be like it my sympathies and interests are changed there shall be no more books of travel for me i care for nothing but the moral and the dramatic not a jot for the picturesque or the beautiful other than about people it bored me hellishly to write the emigrant well its going to bore others to read it thats only fair  i should also write to others but indeed i am jacktired and must go to bed to a french novel to compose myself for slumberever your affectionate friend       r l s     to edmund gosse        608 bush street san francisco california jan 23 1880  my dear and kind wegit was a lesson in philosophy that would have moved a bear to receive your letter in my present temper for i am now well and well at my ease both by comparison first my health has turned a corner it was not consumption this time though consumption it has to be some time as all my kind friends sing to me day in day out consumption how i hate that word yet it can sound innocent as eg consumption of military stores what was wrong with me apart from colds and little pleuritic fleabites was a lingering malaria and that is now greatly overcome i eat once more which is a great amusement and they say good for the health second many of the thunderclouds that were overhanging me when last i wrote have silently stolen away like longfellows arabs and i am now engaged to be married to the woman whom i have loved for three years and a half i do not yet know when the marriage can come off for there are many reasons for delay but as few people before marriage have known each other so long or made more trials of each others tenderness and constancy i permit myself to hope some quiet at the end of all at least i will boast myself so far i do not think many wives are better loved than mine will be third and last in the order of what has changed my feelings my people have cast me off and so that thundercloud as you may almost say has overblown you know more than most people whether or not i loved my father27 these things are sad nor can any man forgive himself for bringing them about yet they are easier to meet in fact than by anticipation i almost trembled whether i was doing right until i was fairly summoned then when i found that i was not shaken one jot that i could grieve that i could sharply blame myself for the past and yet never hesitate one second as to my conduct in the future i believed my cause was just and i leave it with the lord i certainly look for no reward nor any abiding city either here or hereafter but i please myself with hoping that my father will not always think so badly of my conduct nor so very slightingly of my affection as he does at present  you may now understand that the quiet economical citizen of san francisco who now addresses you a bonhomme given to cheap living early to bed though scarce early to rise in proportion que diable let us have style anyway busied with his little bits of books and essays and with a fair hope for the future is no longer the same desponding invalid son of a doubt and an apprehension who last wrote to you from monterey i am none the less warmly obliged to you and mrs gosse for your good words i suppose that i am the devil hearing it so often but i am not ungrateful only please weg do not talk of genius about me i do not think i want for a certain talent but i am heartily persuaded i have none of the other commodity so let that stick to the wall you only shame me by such friendly exaggerations  when shall i be married when shall i be able to return to england when shall i join the good and blessed in a forced march upon the new jerusalem that is what i know not in any degree some of them let us hope will come early some after a judicious interval i have three little strangers knocking at the door of leslie stephen the

i give you these hints knowing you to love the best literature that you may keep an eye at the masthead for these little titbits write again and soon and at greater length to your friendyour friend       signed r l s     to charles baxter        608 bush street san francisco jan 26 80  my dear charlesi have to drop from a 50 cent to a 25 cent dinner today begins my fall that brings down my outlay in food and drink to 45 cents or 1s 1012d per day how are the mighty fallen luckily this is such a cheap place for food i used to pay as much as that for my first breakfast in the savile in the grand old palmy days of yore i regret nothing and do not even dislike these straits though the flesh will rebel on occasion it is today bitter cold after weeks of lovely warm weather and i am all in a chitter i am about to issue for my little shilling and halfpenny meal taken in the middle of the day the poor mans hour and i shall eat and drink to your prosperityever yours       r l s     to professor meiklejohn      one day at the savile club stevenson hearing a certain laugh cried    out that he must know the laugher who turned out to be a    fellowcountryman the late john meiklejohn the wellknown    educational authority and professor at st andrews university    stevenson introduced himself and the two became firm friends    allusion was made a few pages back to a letter from professor    meiklejohn about the burns essay       608 bush street san francisco california feb 1st 1880  my dear meiklejohnyou must think me a thankless fellow by this time but if you knew how harassed and how sick i had been and how i have twice begun to write to you already you might condescend to forgive the puir gangrel body to tell you what i have been doing thinking and coming through these six or seven months would exhilarate nobody least of all me infandum jubes so i hope you wont i have done a great deal of work but perhaps my health of mind and body should not let me expect much from what i have done at least i have turned the corner my feet are on the rock again i believe and i shall continue to pour forth pure and wholesome literature for the masses as per invoice  i am glad you liked burns i think it is the best thing i ever did did not the national vanity exclaim do you know what shairp thought i think i let him down gently did i not  i have done a thoreau which i hope you may like though i have a feeling that perhaps it might be better please look out for a little paper called yoshida torajiro which i hope will appear in cornhill ere very long the subject at least will interest you i am to appear in the same magazine with a real blood and bones in the name of god story why stephen took it is to me a mystery anyhow it was fun to write and if you can interest a person for an hour and a half you have not been idle when i suffer in mind stories are my refuge i take them like opium and i consider one who writes them as a sort of doctor of the mind and frankly meiklejohn it is not shakespeare we take to when we are in a hot corner nor certainly george eliotno nor even balzac it is charles reade or old dumas or the arabian nights or the best of walter scott it is stories we want not the high poetic function which represents the world we are then like the asiatic with his improvisatore or the middleagee with his trouvÃ¨re we want incident interest action to the devil with your philosophy when we are well again and have an easy mind we shall peruse your important work but what we want now is a drug so i when i am ready to go beside myself stick my head into a storybook as the ostrich with her bush let fate and fortune meantime belabour my posteriors at their will  i have not seen the spectator article nobody sent it to me if you had an old copy lying by you you would be very good to despatch it to me a little abuse from my grandmamma would do me good in health if not in morals  this is merely to shake hands with you and give you the top of the morning in 1880 but i look to be answered and then i shall promise to answer in return for i am now so far as that can be in this world my own man again and when i have heard from you i shall be able to write more naturally and at length  at least my dear meiklejohn i hope you will believe in the sincerely warm and friendly regard in which i hold you and the pleasure with which i look forward not only to hearing from you shortly but to seeing you again in the flesh with another good luncheon and good talk tell me when you dont like my workyour friend       robert louis stevenson     to w e henley      the essays here mentioned on benjamin franklin and william penn were    projects long cherished but in the end abandoned the forest state    came to maturity three years later as prince otto       608 bush street san francisco cal february 1880  my dear henleybefore my work or anything i sit down to answer your long and kind letter  i am well cheerful busy hopeful i cannot be knocked down i do not mind about the emigrant i never thought it a masterpiece it was written to sell and i believe it will sell and if it does not the next will you need not be uneasy about my work i am only beginning to see my true method  1 as to studies there are two more already gone to stephen yoshida torajiro which i think temperate and adequate and thoreau which will want a really balzacian effort over the proofs but i want benjamin franklin and the art of virtue to follow and perhaps also william penn but this last may be perhaps delayed for another volumei think not though the studies will be an intelligent volume and in their latter numbers more like what i mean to be my style or i mean what my style means to be for i am passive 2 the essays good news indeed i think ordered south must be thrown in it always swells the volume and it will never find a more appropriate place it was may 1874 macmillan i believe 3 plays i did not understand you meant to try the draft i shall make you a full scenario as soon as the emigrant is done 4 emigrant he shall be sent off next week 5 stories you need not be alarmed that i am going to imitate meredith you know i was a storyteller ingrain did not that reassure you the vendetta which falls next to be finished is not entirely pleasant but it has points the forest state or the greenwood state a romance is another pair of shoes it is my old semiramis our halfseen duke and duchess which suddenly sprang into sunshine clearness as a story the other day the kind happy dÃ©nouement is unfortunately absolutely undramatic which will be our only trouble in quarrying out the play i mean we shall quarry from it charactersotto frederick john hereditary prince of grÃ¼nwald amelia seraphina princess conrad baron gondremarck prime minister cancellarius greisengesang killian gottesacker steward of the river farm ottilie his daughter the countess von rosen seven in all a brave story i swear and a brave play too if we can find the trick to make the end the play i fear will have to end darkly and that spoils the quality as i now see it of a kind of crockery eighteenth century highlifebelowstairs life breaking up like ice in spring before the nature and the certain modicum of manhood of my poor clever featherheaded prince whom i love already i see seraphina too gondremarck is not quite so clear the countess von rosen i have ill never tell you who she is its a secret but i have known the countess well i will tell you its my old russian friend madame zassetsky certain scenes are in conception the best i have ever made except for hester noble those at the end von rosen and the princess the prince and princess and the princess and gondremarck as i now see them from here should be nuts henley nuts it irks me not to go to them straight but the emigrant stops the way then a reassured scenario for hester then the vendetta then two or three essaysbenjamin franklin thoughts on literature as an art dialogue on character and destiny between two puppets the human compromise and then at lengthcome to me my prince o lord its going to be courtly and there is not an ugly person nor an ugly scene in it the slate both fanny and i have damned utterly it is too morbid ugly and unkind better starvation       r l s     to sidney colvin      i had written proposing that a collected volume of his short stories    should be published with illustrations by caldecott at the end of    this letter occurs his first allusion to his now famous requiem       608 bush street san francisco february 1880  my dear colvini received a very nice letter from you with two enclosures i am still unable to finish the emigrant although there are only some fifteen pages to do the vendetta is i am afraid scarce fortnightly form though after the pavilion being taken by stephen i am truly at sea about all such matters i dare say my prince of grÃ¼newaldthe name still uncertainwould be good enough for anything if i could but get it done i believe that to be a really good story the vendetta is somewhat cheap in motive very rum and unlike the present kind of novels both for good and evil in writing and on the whole only remarkable for the heroines character and that i believe to be in it  i am not well at all but hope to be better you know i have been hawked to death these last months and then i lived too low i fear and any way i have got pretty low and out at elbows in health i wish i could say betterbut i cannot with a constitution like mine you never knowtomorrow i may be carrying topgallant sails again but just at present i am scraping along with a jurymast and a kind of amateur rudder truly i have some misery as things go but these things are mere detail however i do not want to crever claquer and cave in just when i have a chance of some happiness nor do i mean to all the same i am more and more in a difficulty how to move every day what a day or an hour might bring forth god forbid that i should prophesy certainly do what you like about the stories will o the mill or not it will be caldecotts book or nobodys i am glad you liked the guitar i always did and i think c could make lovely pikters to it it almost seems as if i must have written it for him express  i have already been a visitor at the club for a fortnight but thats over and i dont much care to renew the period i want to be married not to belong to all the clubs in christendie i half think of writing up the sandlot agitation for morley it is a curious business were i stronger i should try to sugar in with some of the leaders a chield amang em takin notes one who kept a brothel i reckon before she started socialist particularly interests me if i am right as to her early industry you know she would be sure to adore me i have been all my days a dead hand at a harridan i never saw the one yet that could resist me when i die of consumption you can put that upon my tomb                                       sketch of my tomb follows    robert louis stevenson    born 1850 of a family of engineers   died                         nitor aquis   home is the sailor home from sea   and the hunter home from the hill  you who pass this grave put aside hatred love kindness be all services remembered in your heart and all offences pardoned and as you go down again among the living let this be your question can i make some one happier this day before i lie down to sleep thus the dead man speaks to you from the dust you will hear no more from him   who knows colvin but i may thus be of more use when i am buried than ever when i was alive the more i think of it the more earnestly do i desire this i may perhaps try to write it better some day but that is what i want in sense the verses are from a beayootiful poem by me       r l s     to sidney colvin        608 bush street san francisco march 1880  my dear colvinmy landlord and landladys little fouryearold child is dying in the house and o what he has suffered it has really affected my health o never never any family for me i am cured of that  i have taken a long holidayhave not worked for three days and will not for a week for i was really weary excuse this scratch for the child weighs on me dear colvin i did all i could to help but all seems little to the point of crime when one of these poor innocents lies in such miseryever yours       r l s     to j w ferrier      in the interval between this letter and the last the writer had been    down with an acute and dangerous illness forester here mentioned    was an autobiographical paper by j w f on his own boyhood       po san francisco april 8th 1880  my dear ferriermany thanks for your letter and the instalment of forester which accompanied it and which i read with amusement and pleasure i fear somersets letter must wait for my dear boy i have been very nearly on a longer voyage than usual i am fresh from giving charon a quid instead of an obolus but he having accepted the payment scorned me and i had to make the best of my way backward through the mallowwood with nothing to show for this displacement but the fatigue of the journey as soon as i feel fit you shall have the letter trust me but just now even a note such as i am now writing takes it out of me i have truly been very sick i fear i am a vain man for i thought it a pity i should die i could not help thinking that a good many would be disappointed but for myself although i still think life a business full of agreeable features i was not entirely unwilling to give it up it is so difficult to behave well and in that matter i get more dissatisfied with myself because more exigent every day i shall be pleased to hear again from you soon i shall be married early in may and then go to the mountains a very withered bridegroom i think your ms bible if that were a specimen would be a credit to humanity between whiles collect such thoughts both from yourself and others i somehow believe every man should leave a bible behind himif he is unable to leave a jest book i feel fit to leave nothing but my benediction it is a strange thing how do what you will nothing seems accomplished i feel as far from having paid humanity my board and lodging as i did six years ago when i was sick at mentone but i dare say the devil would keep telling me so if i had moved mountains and at least i have been very happy on many different occasions and that is always something i can read nothing write nothing but a little while ago and i could eat nothing either but now that is changed this is a long letter for me rub your hands boy for tis an honouryours from charons strand       r l s     to edmund gosse      a poetical counterpart to this letter will be found in the piece    beginning not yet my soul these friendly fields desert which was    composed at the same time and is printed in underwoods       san francisco april 16 1880  my dear gosseyou have not answered my last and i know you will repent when you hear how near i have been to another world for about six weeks i have been in utter doubt it was a tossup for life or death all that time but i won the toss sir and hades went off once more discomfited this is not the first time nor will it be the last that i have a friendly game with that gentleman i know he will end by cleaning me out but the rogue is insidious and the habit of that sort of gambling seems to be a part of my nature it was i suspect too much indulged in youth break your children of this tendency my dear gosse from the first it is when once formed a habit more fatal than opiumi speak as st paul says like a fool i have been very very sick on the verge of a galloping consumption cold sweats prostrating attacks of cough sinking fits in which i lost the power of speech fever and all the ugliest circumstances of the disease and i have cause to bless god my wife that is to be and one dr bamford a name the muse repels that i have come out of all this and got my feet once more upon a little hilltop with a fair prospect of life and some new desire of living yet i did not wish to die neither only i felt unable to go on farther with that rough horseplay of human life a man must be pretty well to take the business in good part yet i felt all the time that i had done nothing to entitle me to an honourable discharge that i had taken up many obligations and begun many friendships which i had no right to put away from me and that for me to die was to play the cur and slinking sybarite and desert the colours on the eve of the decisive fight of course i have done no work for i do not know how long and here you can triumph i have been reduced to writing verses for amusement a fact the whirligig of time brings in its revenges after all but ill have them buried with me i think for i have not the heart to burn them while i live do write i shall go to the mountains as soon as the weather clears on the way thither i marry myself then i set up my family altar among the pinewoods 3000 feet sir from the disputatious seai am dear weg most truly yours       r l s     to dr w bamford      with a copy of travels with a donkey       san francisco april 1880  my dear sirwill you let me offer you this little book if i had anything better it should be yours may you not dislike it for it will be your own handiwork if there are other fruits from the same tree but for your kindness and skill this would have been my last book and now i am in hopes that it will be neither my last nor my best  you doctors have a serious responsibility you recall a man from the gates of death you give him health and strength once more to use or to abuse i hope i shall feel your responsibility added to my own and seek in the future to make a better profit of the life you have renewed to mei am my dear sir gratefully yours       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin        san francisco april 1880  my dear colvinyou must be sick indeed of my demand for books for you have seemingly not yet sent me one still i live on promises waiting for penn for h jamess hawthorne for my burns etc and now to make matters worse pending your centuries etc i do earnestly desire the best book about mythology if it be german so much the worse send a bunctionary along with it and pray for me this is why if i recover i feel called on to write a volume of gods and demigods in exile pan jove cybele venus charon etc and though i should like to take them very free i should like to know a little about em to begin with for two days till last night i had no night sweats and my cough is almost gone and i digest well so all looks hopeful however i was near the other side of jordan i send the proof of thoreau to you so that you may correct and fill up the quotation from goethe it is a pity i was ill as for matter i think i prefer that to any of my essays except burns but the style though quite manly never attains any melody or lenity so much for consumption i begin to appreciate what the emigrant must be as soon as i have done the last few pages of the emigrant they shall go to you but when will that be i know not quite yeti have to be so carefulever yours       r l s     to sidney colvin       san francisco april 1880  my dear colvinmy dear people telegraphed me in these words count on 250 pounds annually you may imagine what a blessed business this was and so now recover the sheets of the emigrant and post them registered to me and now please give me all your venom against it say your worst and most incisively for now it will be a help and ill make it right or perish in the attempt now do you understand why i protested against your depressing eloquence on the subject when i had to go on any way for dear life i thought it a kind of pity and not much good to discourage me now alls changed god only knows how much courage and suffering is buried in that ms the second part was written in a circle of hell unknown to dantethat of the penniless and dying author for dying i was although now saved another week the doctor said and i should have been past salvation i think i shall always think of it as my best work there is one page in part ii about having got to shore and sich which must have cost me altogether six hours of work as miserable as ever i went through i feel sick even to think of itever your friend       r l s     to sidney colvin        san francisco may 1880  my dear colvini received your letter and proof today and was greatly delighted with the last  i am now out of danger in but a short while ie as soon as the weather is settled f and i marry and go up to the hills to look for a place i to the hills will lift mine eyes from whence doth come mine aid once the place found the furniture will follow there sir in i hope a ranche among the pinetrees and hard by a running brook we are to fish hunt sketch study spanish french latin euclid and history and if possible not quarrel far from man sir in the virgin forest thence as my strength returns you may expect works of genius i always feel as if i must write a work of genius some time or other and when is it more likely to come off than just after i have paid a visit to styx and go thence to the eternal mountains such a revolution in a mans affairs as i have somewhere written would set anybody singing when we get installed lloyd and i are going to print my poetical works so all those who have been poetically addressed shall receive copies of their addresses they are i believe pretty correct literary exercises or will be with a few filings but they are not remarkable for whitehot vehemence of inspiration tepid works respectable versifications of very proper and even original sentiments kind of hayleyistic i fearbut no this is morbid selfdepreciation the family is all very shaky in health but our motto is now al monte in the words of don lope in the play the sister and i are just beating through with two bad dictionaries and an insane grammar i to the hillsyours ever       r l s     to c w stoddard      this correspondent is the late mr charles warren stoddard author of    summer cruising in the south seas etc with whom stevenson had    made friends in the manner and amid the scenes faithfully described    in the wrecker in the chapter called faces on the city front       east oakland cal may 1880  my dear stoddardi am guilty in thy sight and the sight of god however i swore a great oath that you should see some of my manuscript at last and though i have long delayed to keep it yet it was to be you reread your story and were disgusted that is the cold fit following the hot i dont say you did wrong to be disgusted yet i am sure you did wrong to be disgusted altogether there was you may depend upon it some reason for your previous vanity as well as your present mortification i shall hear you years from now timidly begin to retrim your feathers for a little selflaudation and trot out this misdespised novelette as not the worst of your performances i read the album extracts with sincere interest but i regret that you spared to give the paper more development and i conceive that you might do a great deal worse than expand each of its paragraphs into an essay or sketch the excuse being in each case your personal intercourse the bulk when that would not be sufficient to be made up from their own works and stories three at leastmenken yelverton and keelercould not fail of a vivid human interest let me press upon you this plan should any document be wanted from europe let me offer my services to procure it i am persuaded that there is stuff in the idea  are you coming over again to see me some day soon i keep returning and now hand over fist from the realms of hades i saw that gentleman between the eyes and fear him less after each visit only charon and his rough boatmanship i somewhat fear  i have a desire to write some verses for your album so if you will give me the entry among your gods goddesses and godlets there will be nothing wanting but the muse i think of the verses like mark twain sometimes i wish fulsomely to belaud you sometimes to insult your city and fellowcitizens sometimes to sit down quietly with the slender reed and troll a few staves of panic ecstasybut fy fy as my ancestors observed the last is too easy for a man of my feet and inches  at least stoddard you now see that although so costive when i once begin i am a copious letterwriter i thank you and au revoir       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin        san francisco may 1880  my dear colvinit is a long while since i have heard from you nearly a month i believe and i begin to grow very uneasy at first i was tempted to suppose that i had been myself to blame in some way but now i have grown to fear lest some sickness or trouble among those whom you love may not be the impediment i believe i shall soon hear so i wait as best i can i am beyond a doubt greatly stronger and yet still useless for any work and i may say for any pleasure my affairs and the bad weather still keep me here unmarried but not i earnestly hope for long whenever i get into the mountain i trust i shall rapidly pick up until i get away from these sea fogs and my imprisonment in the house i do not hope to do much more than keep from active harm my doctor took a desponding fit about me and scared fanny into blue fits but i have talked her over again it is the change i want and the blessed sun and a gentle air in which i can sit out and see the trees and running water these mere defensive hygienics cannot advance one though they may prevent evil i do nothing now but try to possess my soul in peace and continue to possess my body on any terms  calistoga napa county californiaall which is a fortnight old and not much to the point nowadays here we are fanny and i and a certain hound in a lovely valley under mount saint helena looking around or rather wondering when we shall begin to look around for a house of our own i have received the first sheets of the amateur emigrant not yet the second bunch as announced it is a pretty heavy emphatic piece of pedantry but i dont care the public i verily believe will like it i have excised all you proposed and more on my own movement but i have not yet been able to rewrite the two special pieces which as you said so badly wanted it it is hard work to rewrite passages in proof and the easiest work is still hard to me but i am certainly recovering fast a married and convalescent being  received jamess hawthorne on which i meditate a blast miss bird dixons penn a wrong cornhill like my luck and coquelin for all which and especially the last i tender my best thanks i have opened only james it is very clever very well written and out of sight the most insideout thing in the world i have dug up the hatchet a scalp shall flutter at my belt ere long i think my new book should be good it will contain our adventures for the summer so far as these are worth narrating and i have already a few pages of diary which should make up bright i am going to repeat my old experiment after bucklingto a while to write more correctly lie down and have a wallow whether i shall get any of my novels done this summer i do not know i wish to finish the vendetta first for it really could not come after prince otto lewis campbell has made some noble work in that agamemnon it surprised me we hope to get a house at silverado a deserted miningcamp eight miles up the mountain now solely inhabited by a mighty hunter answering to the name of rufe hansome who slew last year a hundred and fifty deer this is the motto i propose for the new volume vixerunt nonnulli in agris delectati re sua familiari his idem propositum fuit quod regibus ut ne qua re egerent ne cui parerent libertate uterentur cujus proprium est sic vivere ut velis i always have a terror lest the wish should have been father to the translation when i come to quote but that seems too plain sailing i should put regibus in capitals for the pleasantrys sake we are in the coast range that being so much cheaper to reach the family i hope will soon follow love to allever yours       r l s   footnotes    23 engraisser grow fat    24 pall mall gazette    25 here follows a long calculation of ways and means    26 addisons    27 in reference to the fathers estrangement at this time sir james     dewar an old friend of the elder stevenson tells a story which     would have touched r l s infinitely had he heard it sir james     then professor dewar and mr thomas stevenson were engaged     together on some official scientific work near duns in berwickshire     spending the evening together writes sir james at an hotel in     berwickontweed the two after a long days work fell into close     fireside talk over their toddy and mr stevenson opened his heart     upon what was to him a very sore grievance he spoke with anger and     dismay of his sons journey and intentions his desertion of the old     firm and taking to the devious and barren paths of literature the     professor took up the cudgels in the sons defence and at last by     way of ending the argument half jocularly offered to wager that in     ten years from that moment r l s would be earning a bigger income     than the old firm had ever commanded to his surprise the father     became furious and repulsed all attempts at reconciliation but six     and a half years later mr stevenson broken in health came to     london to seek medical advice and although so feeble that he had to     be lifted out and into his cab called at the royal institute to see     the professor he said i am here to consult a doctor but i     couldna be in london without coming to shake your hand and confess     that you were richt after a about louis and i was wrang the     frail old frame shook with emotion and he muttered i ken this is     my last visit to the south a few weeks later he was dead     vi  alpine winters and highland summers  august 1880october 1882   after spending the months of june and july 1880 in the rough californian mountain quarters described in the silverado squatters stevenson took passage with his wife and young stepson from new york on the 7th of august and arrived on the 17th at liverpool where his parents and i were waiting to meet him of her new family the mrs robert louis stevenson brought thus strangely and from far into their midst made an immediate conquest to her husbands especial happiness there sprang up between her and his father the closest possible affection and confidence parents and friendsif it is permissible to one of the latter to say as muchrejoiced to recognise in stevensons wife a character as strong interesting and romantic almost as his own an inseparable sharer of all his thoughts and staunch companion of all his adventures the most openhearted of friends to all who loved him the most shrewd and stimulating critic of his work and in sickness despite her own precarious health the most devoted and most efficient of nurses  from liverpool the stevenson party went on to make a stay in scotland first at edinburgh and afterwards for a few weeks at strathpeffer resting at blair athol on the way it was now in his thirtieth year among the woods of tummelside and under the shoulder of ben wyvis that stevenson acknowledged for the first time the full power and beauty of the highland scenery which in youth with his longings fixed ever upon the south he had been accustomed to think too bleak and desolate in the history of the country and its clans on the other hand and especially of their political and social transformation during the eighteenth century he had been always keenly interested in conversations with principal tulloch at strathpeffer this interest was now revived and he resolved to attempt a book on the subject his father undertaking to keep him supplied with books and authorities for it had quickly become apparent that he could not winter in scotland the state of his health continued to be very threatening he suffered from acute chronic catarrh accompanied by disquieting lung symptoms and great weakness and was told accordingly that he must go for the winter and probably for several succeeding winters to the mountain valley of davos in switzerland which within the last few years had been coming into repute as a place of recovery or at least of arrested mischief for lung patients thither he and his wife and stepson travelled accordingly at the end of october nor must another member of the party be forgotten a black thoroughbred skye terrier the gift of sir walter simpson this creature was named after his giver waltera name subsequently corrupted into wattie woggie wogg woggin bogie bogue and a number of other affectionate diminutives which will be found occurring often enough in the following pages he was a remarkably pretty engaging excitable illbehaved little specimen of his race the occasion of infinite anxiety and laughing care to his devoted master and mistress until his death six years later  the davos of 1880 approached by an eighthours laborious drive up the valley of the prÃ¤ttigau was a very different place from the extended and embellished davos of today with its railway its modern shops its electric lighting and its crowd of winter visitors bent on outdoor and indoor entertainment the stevensons quarters for the first winter were at the hotel belvedere then a mere nucleus of the huge establishment it has since become besides the usual society of an invalid hotel with its mingled tragedies and comedies they had there the great advantage of the presence in a neighbouring house of an accomplished man of letters and one of the most charming of companions john addington symonds with his family mr symonds whose health had been desperate before he tried the place was a living testimony to its virtues and was at this time engaged in building the chalet which became his home until he died fourteen years later during stevensons first season at davos though his mind was full of literary enterprises he was too ill to do much actual work for the highland history he read much but composed little or nothing and eventually this history went to swell the long list of his unwritten books he saw through the press his first volume of collected essays virginibus puerisque which came out early in 1881 wrote the essays samuel pepys and the morality of the profession of letters for the cornhill and the fortnightly review respectively and sent to the pall mall gazette the papers on the life and climate of davos posthumously reprinted in essays of travel beyond this he only amused himself with verses some of them afterwards published in underwoods leaving the alps at the end of april 1881 he returned after a short stay in france at fontainebleau paris and st germain to his family in edinburgh thence the whole party again went to the highlands this time to pitlochry and braemar  during the summer stevenson heard of the intended retirement of professor Ã†neas mackay from the chair of history and constitutional law at edinburgh university he determined with the encouragement of the outgoing professor and of several of his literary friends to become a candidate for the post which had to be filled by the faculty of advocates from among their own number the duties were limited to the delivery of a short course of lectures in the summer term and stevenson thought that he might be equal to them and might prove though certainly a new yet perhaps a stimulating type of professor but knowing the nature of his public reputation especially in edinburgh where the recollection of his daft student days was as yet stronger than the impression made by his recent performances in literature he was well aware that his candidature must seem paradoxical and stood little chance of success the election took place in the late autumn of the same year and he was defeated receiving only three votes  at pitlochry stevenson was for a while able to enjoy his life and to work well writing two of the strongest of his short stories of scottish life and superstition thrawn janet and the merry men originally designed to form part of a volume to be written by himself and his wife in collaboration at braemar he made a beginning of the nursery verses which afterwards grew into the volume called the childs garden and conceived and half executed the fortunate project of treasure island the book which was destined first to make him famous but one of the most inclement of scottish summers had before long undone all the good gained in the previous winter at davos and in the autumn of the year 1881 he repaired thither again  this time his quarters were in a small chalet belonging to the proprietors of the buol hotel the chalet am stein or chalet buol in the near neighbourhood of the symondss house the beginning of his second stay was darkened by the serious illness of his wife nevertheless the winter was one of much greater literary activity than the last a life of hazlitt was projected and studies were made for it but for various reasons the project was never carried out treasure island was finished the greater part of the silverado squatters written so were the essays talk and talkers a gossip on romance and several other of his best papers for magazines by way of whim and pastime he occupied himself to his own and his stepsons delight with a little set of woodcuts and verses printed by the latter at his toy pressthe davos press as they called itas well as with mimic campaigns carried on between the man and boy with armies of lead soldiers in the spacious loft which filled the upper floor of the chalet for the first and almost the only time in his life there awoke in him during these winters in davos the spirit of lampoon and he poured forth sets of verses not without touches of a swiftean fire against commercial frauds in general and those of certain local tradesmen in particular as well as others in memory of a defunct publican of edinburgh who had been one of his butts in youth casparidea and brashiana both unpublished see pp 14 15 38 in vol 24 of the present edition finally much revived in health by the beneficent air of the alpine valley he left it again in midspring of 1882 to return once more to scotland and to be once more thrown back to or below the point whence he had started after a short excursion from edinburgh into the appin country where he made inquiries on the spot into the traditions concerning the murder of campbell of glenure his three restingplaces in scotland during this summer were stobo manse near peebles lochearnhead and kingussie at stobo the dampness of the season and the place quickly threw him again into a very low state of health from which three subsequent weeks of brilliant sunshine in speyside did but little to restore him in spite of this renewed breakdown when autumn came he would not face the idea of returning for a third season to davos he had himself felt deeply the austerity and monotony of the white alpine world in winter and though he had unquestionably gained in health there his wife on her part had suffered much so he made up his mind once again to try the mediterranean coast of france and davos knew him no more     to sidney colvin      i forget what were the two sets of verses apparently satirical here    mentioned the volume of

able to make a fine history of this  my essays are going through the press and should be out in january or februaryever affectionate son       r l s     to sidney colvin        hotel belvedere davos december 1880  my dear colvini feel better but variable i see from the doctors report that i have more actual disease than i supposed but there seems little doubt of my recovery i like the place and shall like it much better when you come at christmas that is written on my heart s c comes at christmas so if you play me false i shall have a lie upon my conscience i like symonds very well though he is much i think of an invalid in mind and character but his mind is interesting with many beautiful corners and his consumptive smile very winning to see we have had some good talks one went over zola balzac flaubert whitman christ handel milton sir thomas browne do you see the liaisonin another i the bohnist the ungrecian was the means of his conversion in the matter of the ajax it is truly not for nothing that i have read my buckley32  today the south wind blows and i am seedy in consequence  lateri want to know when you are coming so as to get you a room you will toboggan and skate your head off and i will talk it off and briefly if you dont come pretty soon i will cut you off with a shilling  it would be handsome of you to write the doctor says i may be as well as ever but in the meantime i go slow and am fit for littleever yours       r l s     to edmund gosse      the suggestions contained in the following two letters to mr gosse    refer to the collection of english odes which that gentleman was then    engaged in editing kegan paul 1881       hotel belvedere davos dec 6 1880  my dear wegi have many letters that i ought to write in preference to this but a duty to letters and to you prevails over any private consideration you are going to collect odes i could not wish a better man to do so but i tremble lest you should commit two sins of omission you will not i am sure be so far left to yourself as to give us no more of dryden than the hackneyed st cecilia i know you will give us some others of those surprising masterpieces where there is more sustained eloquence and harmony of english numbers than in all that has been written since there is a machine about a poetical young lady33 and another about either charles or james i know not which and they are both indescribably fine is marvells horatian ode good enough i half think so but my great point is a fear that you are one of those who are unjust to our old tennysons duke of wellington i have just been talking it over with symonds and we agreed that whether for its metrical effects for its brief plain stirring words of portraiture ashe that never lost an english gun orthe soldier salute or for the heroic apostrophe to nelson that ode has never been surpassed in any tongue or time grant me the duke o weg i suppose you must not put in yours about the warship you will have to admit worse ones howeverever yours       r l s     to edmund gosse        hotel belvedere davos dec 19 1880     this letter is a report of a long sederunt also steterunt in small      committee at davos platz dec 15 1880 its results are      unhesitatingly shot at your head  my dear wegwe both insist on the duke of wellington really it cannot be left out symonds said you would cover yourself with shame and i add your friends with confusion if you leave it out really you know it is the only thing you have since dryden where that irregular odic odal odous  verse is used with mastery and sense and its one of our few english bloodboilers  2 byron if anything prometheus  3 shelley 1 the worlds great age from hellas we are both dead on after that you have of course the west wind thing but we think 1 would maybe be enough no more than two any way  4 herrick meddowes and come my corinna after that mr wickes two any way  5 leave out stanza 3rd of congreves thing like a dear we cant stand the sigh nor the peruke  6 milton time and the solemn music we both agree we would rather go without lallegro and il penseroso than these for the reason that these are not so well known to the brutish herd  7 is the royal george an ode or only an elegy its so good  8 we leave campbell to you  9 if you take anything from clough but we dont either of us fancy you will let it be come back  10 quite right about dryden i had a hankering after threnodia augustalis but i find it long and with very prosaic holes though o what fine stuff between whiles  11 right with collins  12 right about popes ode but what can you give the dying christian or one of his inimitable courtesies these last are fairly odes by the horatian model just as my dear meddowes is an ode in the name and for the sake of bandusia  13 whatever you do youll give us the greek vase  14 do you like jonsons loathed stage verses 2 3 and 4 are so bad also the last line but there is a fine movement and feeling in the rest  we will have the duke of wellington by god pro symonds and stevenson       r l s     to charles warren stoddard      the prospect here alluded to of a cheap edition of the little    travelbooks did not get realised the volume of essays in the    printers hands was virginibus puerisque i do not know what were    the pages in broad scots copied by way of enclosure       hotel belvedere davos december 1880  dear charles warren stoddardmany thanks to you for the letter and the photograph will you think it mean if i ask you to wait till there appears a promised cheap edition possibly the canny scot does feel pleasure in the superior cheapness but the true reason is this that i think to put a few words by way of notes to each book in its new form because that will be the standard edition without which no gs l34 will be complete the edition briefly sine qua non before that i shall hope to send you my essays which are in the printers hands i look to get yours soon i am sorry to hear that the custom house has proved fallible like all other human houses and customs life consists of that sort of business and i fear that there is a class of man of which you offer no inapt type doomed to a kind of mild general disappointment through life i do not believe that a man is the more unhappy for that disappointment except with ones self is not a very capital affair and the sham beatitude blessed is he that expecteth little one of the truest and in a sense the most christlike things in literature  alongside of you i have been all my days a red cannon ball of dissipated effort here i am by the heels in this alpine valley with just so much of a prospect of future restoration as shall make my present caged estate easily tolerable to meshall or should i would not swear to the word before the trials done i miss all my objects in the meantime and thank god i have enough of my old and maybe somewhat base philosophy to keep me on a good understanding with myself and providence  the mere extent of a mans travels has in it something consolatory that he should have left friends and enemies in many different and distant quarters gives a sort of earthly dignity to his existence and i think the better of myself for the belief that i have left some in california interested in me and my successes let me assure you you who have made friends already among such various and distant races that there is a certain phthisical scot who will always be pleased to hear good news of you and would be better pleased by nothing than to learn that you had thrown off your present incubus largely consisting of letters i believe and had sailed into some square work by way of change  and by way of change in itself let me copy on the other pages some broad scotch i wrote for you when i was ill last spring in oakland it is no muckle worth but ye should na look a gien horse in the mooyours ever       r l stevenson     to mr and mrs thomas stevenson      the verses here mentioned to dr john brown the admired author of    rab and his friends were meant as a reply to a letter of    congratulation on the inland voyage received from him the year    before they are printed in underwoods       hotel belvedere davos december 21 1880  my dear peoplei do not understand these reproaches the letters come between seven and nine in the evening and every one about the books was answered that same night and the answer left davos by seven oclock next morning perhaps the snow delayed them if so tis a good hint to you not to be uneasy at apparent silences there is no hurry about my fathers notes i shall not be writing anything till i get home again i believe only i want to be able to keep reading ad hoc all winter as it seems about all i shall be fit for about john brown i have been breaking my heart to finish a scotch poem to him some of it is not really bad but the rest will not come and i mean to get it right before i do anything else  the bazaar is over Â£160 gained and everybodys health lost altogether i never had a more uncomfortable time apply to fanny for further details of the discomfort  we have our wogg in somewhat better trim now and vastly better spirits the weather has been badfor davos but indeed it is a wonderful climate it never feels cold yesterday with a little chill small northerly draught for the first time it was pinching usually it may freeze or snow or do what it pleases you feel it not or hardly any  thanks for your notes that fishery question will come in as you notice in the highland book as well as under the union it is very important i hear no word of hugh millers evictions i count on that what you say about the old and new statistical is odd it seems to me very much as if i were gingerly embarking on a history of modern scotland probably tulloch will never carry it out and you see once i have studied and written these two vols the transformation of the scottish highlands and scotland and the union i shall have a good ground to go upon the effect on my mind of what i have read has been to awaken a livelier sympathy for the irish although they never had the remarkable virtues i fear they have suffered many of the injustices of the scottish highlanders ruedi has seen me this morning he says the disease is at a standstill and i am to profit by it to take more exercise altogether he seemed quite hopeful and pleasedi am your ever affectionate son       r l s     to sidney colvin        hotel belvedere davos christmas 1880  my dear colvinthanks for yours i waited as i said i would i now expect no answer from you regarding you as a mere dumb cockshy or a target at which we fire our arrows diligently all day long with no anticipation it will bring them back to us we are both sadly mortified you are not coming but health comes first alas that man should be so crazy what fun we could have if we were all well what work we could do what a happy place we could make it for each other if i were able to do what i want but then i am not and may leave that vein  no i do not think i shall require to know the gaelic few things are written in that language or ever were if you come to that the number of those who could write or even read it through almost all my period must by all accounts have been incredibly small of course until the book is done i must live as much as possible in the highlands and that suits my book as to health it is a most interesting and sad story and from the 45 it is all to be written for the first time this of course will cause me a far greater difficulty about authorities but i have already learned much and where to look for more one pleasant feature is the vast number of delightful writers i shall have to deal with burt johnson boswell mrs grant of laggan scott there will be interesting sections on the ossianic controversy and the growth of the taste for highland scenery i have to touch upon rob roy flora macdonald the strange story of lady grange the beautiful story of the tenants on the forfeited estates and the odd inhuman problem of the great evictions the religious conditions are wild unknown very surprising and three out of my five parts remain hitherto entirely unwritten smackyours ever       r l s     to mrs thomas stevenson       hotel belvedere davos december 26 1880 christmas sermon  my dear motheri was very tired yesterday and could not write tobogganed so furiously all morning we had a delightful day crowned by an incredible dinnermore courses than i have fingers on my hands your letter arrived duly at night and i thank you for it as i should you need not suppose i am at all insensible to my fathers extraordinary kindness about this book he is a brick i vote for him freely   the assurance you speak of is what we all ought to have and might have and should not consent to live without that people do not have it more than they do is i believe because persons speak so much in largedrawn theological similitudes and wont say out what they mean about life and man and god in fair and square human language i wonder if you or my father ever thought of the obscurities that lie upon human duty from the negative form in which the ten commandments are stated or of how christ was so continually substituting affirmations thou shalt not is but an example thou shalt is the law of god it was this that seems meant in the phrase that not one jot nor tittle of the law should pass but what led me to the remark is this a kind of black angry look goes with that statement of the law of negatives to love ones neighbour as oneself is certainly much harder but states life so much more actively gladly and kindly that you can begin to see some pleasure in it and till you can see pleasure in these hard choices and bitter necessities where is there any good news to men it is much more important to do right than not to do wrong further the one is possible the other has always been and will ever be impossible and the faithful design to do right is accepted by god that seems to me to be the gospel and that was how christ delivered us from the law after people are told that surely they might hear more encouraging sermons to blow the trumpet for good would seem the parsons business and since it is not in our own strength but by faith and perseverance no account made of slips that we are to run the race i do not see where they get the material for their gloomy discourses faith is not to believe the bible but to believe in god if you believe in god or for its the same thing have that assurance you speak about where is there any more room for terror there are only three possible attitudesoptimism which has gone to smash pessimism which is on the rising hand and very popular with many clergymen who seem to think they are christians and this faith which is the gospel once you hold the last it is your business 1 to find out what is right in any given case and 2 to try to do it if you fail in the last that is by commission christ tells you to hope if you fail in the first that is by omission his picture of the last day gives you but a black lookout the whole necessary morality is kindness and it should spring of itself from the one fundamental doctrine faith if you are sure that god in the long run means kindness by you you should be happy and if happy surely you should be kind  i beg your pardon for this long discourse it is not all right of course but i am sure there is something in it one thing i have not got clearly that about the omission and the commission but there is truth somewhere about it and i have no time to clear it just now do you know you have had about a cornhill page of sermon it is however true  lloyd heard with dismay fanny was not going to give me a present so f and i had to go and buy things for ourselves and go through a representation of surprise when they were presented next morning it gave us both quite a santa claus feeling on xmas eve to see him so excited and hopeful i enjoyed it hugelyyour affectionate son       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin      i did go out to davos after all in january and found stevenson    apparently little improved in health and depressed by a sad turn of    destiny which had brought out his old friend mrs sitwell to the same    place at the same time to watch beside the deathbed of her sonthe    youth commemorated in the verses headed f a s in memoriam    afterwards published in underwoods the following letter refers to    a copy of carlyles reminiscences which i had sent him some time    after i came back to england       hotel belvedere davos spring 1881  my dear colvinmy health is not just what it should be i have lost weight pulse respiration etc and gained nothing in the way of my old bellows but these last few days with tonic codliver oil better wine there is some better now and perpetual beeftea i think i have progressed to say truth i have been here a little over long i was reckoning up and since i have known you already quite a while i have not i believe remained so long in any one place as here in davos that tells on my old gipsy nature like a violin hung up i begin to lose what music there was in me and with the music i do not know what besides or do not know what to call it but something radically part of life a rhythm perhaps in ones old and so brutally overridden nerves or perhaps a kind of variety of blood that the heart has come to look for  i purposely knocked myself off first as to f a s i believe i am no sound authority i alternate between a stiff disregard and a kind of horror in neither mood can a man judge at all i know the thing to be terribly perilous i fear it to be now altogether hopeless luck has failed the weather has not been favourable and in her true heart the mother hopes no more butwell i feel a great deal that i either cannot or will not say as you well know it has helped to make me more conscious of the wolverine on my own shoulders and that also makes me a poor judge and poor adviser perhaps if we were all marched out in a row and a piece of platoon firing to the drums performed it would be well for us although i supposeand yet i wonderso ill for the poor mother and for the dear wife but you can see this makes me morbid sufficit explicit  you are right about the carlyle book f and i are in a world not ours but pardon me as far as sending on goes we take another view the first volume Ã  la bonne heure but notneverthe second two hours of hysterics can be no good matter for a sick nurse and the strange hard old being in so lamentable and yet human a desolationcrying out like a burnt child and yet always wisely and beautifullyhow can that end as a piece of reading even to the strongbut on the brink of the most cruel kind of weeping i observe the old mans style is stronger on me than ever it was and by rights too since i have just laid down his most attaching book god rest the baith o them i but even if they do not meet again how we should all be strengthened to be kind and not only in act in speech also that so much more important part see what this apostle of silence most regrets not speaking out his heart  i was struck as you were by the admirable sudden clear sunshine upon southeyeven on his works symonds to whom i repeated it remarked at once a man who was thus respected by both carlyle and landor must have had more in him than we can trace so i feel with true humility  it was to save my brain that symonds proposed reviewing he and it appears leslie stephen fear a little some eclipse i am not quite without sharing the fear i know my own languor as no one else does it is a dead downdraught a heavy fardel yet if i could shake off the wolverine aforesaid and his fangs are lighter though perhaps i feel them more i believe i could be myself again a while i have not written any letter for a great time none saying what i feel since you were here i fancy be duly obliged for it and take my most earnest thanks not only for the books but for your letteryour affectionate       r l s  the effect of reading this on fanny shows me i must tell you i am very happy peaceful and jolly except for questions of work

etc he took    warmly as did every one to stevenson the following two notes are    from a copy of penns fruits of solitude printed at philadelphia    which stevenson sent him as a gift this winter after his return to    venice       hotel belvedere davos february 1881  my dear brownhere it is with the mark of a san francisco bouquiniste and if ever in all my human conduct i have done a better thing to any fellowcreature than handing on to you this sweet dignified and wholesome book i know i shall hear of it on the last day to write a book like this were impossible at least one can hand it onwith a wrenchone to another my wife cries out and my own heart misgives me but still here it is i could scarcely better prove myselfyours affectionately       r l stevenson     to horatio f brown        hotel belvedere davos february 1881  my dear browni hope if you get thus far you will know what an invaluable present i have made you even the copy was dear to me printed in the colony that penn established and carried in my pocket all about the san francisco streets read in street cars and ferryboats when i was sick unto death and found in all times and places a peaceful and sweet companion but i hope when you shall have reached this note my gift will not have been in vain for while just now we are so busy and intelligent there is not the man living no nor recently dead that could put with so lovely a spirit so much honest kind wisdom into words       r l s     to horatio f brown      the following experiment in english alcaics was suggested by    conversations with mr brown and j a symonds on metrical forms    followed by the despatch of some translations from old venetian    boatsongs by the former after his return to venice       hotel belvedere davos april 1881  my dear brownnine years i have conded them    brave lads in olden musical centuries   sang night by night adorable choruses     sat late by alehouse doors in april     chaunting in joy as the moon was rising    moonseen and merry under the trellises   flushfaced they played with old polysyllables     spring scents inspired35 old wine diluted     love and apollo were there to chorus    now these the songs remain to eternity   those only those the bountiful choristers     gonethose are gone those unremembered     sleep and are silent in earth for ever    so man himself appears and evanishes   so smiles

robert louis stevenson  monte generoso in may here i think till the end of april write again to prove you are forgiving     to mr and mrs thomas stevenson      monte generoso was given up and on the way home to scotland    stevenson had stopped for a while at fontainebleau and then in    paris whence finding himself unpleasantly affected by the climate    he presently took refuge at st germain       hotel du pavillon henry iv st germainenlaye sunday may 1st         1881  my dear peoplea week in paris reduced me to the limpness and lack of appetite peculiar to a kid glove and gave fanny a jumping sore throat its my belief there is death in the kettle there a pestilence or the like we came out here pitched on the star and garter they call it somebodys pavilion found the place a bed of lilacs and nightingales first time i ever heard one and also of a bird called the piasseur cheerfulest of sylvan creatures an ideal comic opera in itself come along what fun heres pan in the next glade at picnic and thisyers arcadia and its awful fun and ive had a glass i will not deny but not to see it on me that is his meaning as near as i can gather well the place forest of beeches all newfledged grass like velvet fleets of hyacinth pleased us and did us good we tried all ways to find a cheaper place but could find nothing safe cold damp brickfloored rooms and sich we could not leave paris till your seven days sight on draft expired we dared not go back to be miasmatised in these homes of putridity so here we are till tuesday in the star and garter my throat is quite cured appetite and strength on the mend fanny seems also picking up  if we are to come to scotland i will have firtrees and i want a burn the firs for my physical the water for my moral healthever affectionate son       r l s     to edmund gosse      at pitlochry stevenson was for some weeks in good health and working    order the inquiries about the later life of jean cavalier the    protestant leader in the cÃ©vennes refer to a literary scheme    whether of romance or history i forget which had been in his mind    ever since the travels with a donkey       kinnaird cottage pitlochry june 6 1881  my dear weghere i am in my native land being gently blown and hailed upon and sitting nearer and nearer to the fire a cottage near a moor is soon to receive our human forms it is also near a burn to which professor blackie no less has written some verses in his hot old age and near a farm from whence we shall draw cream and fatness should i be moved to join blackie i shall go upon my knees and pray hard against temptation although since the new version i do not know the proper form of words the swollen childish and pedantic vanity that moved the said revisers to put bring for lead is a sort of literary fault that calls for an eternal hell it may be quite a small place a star of the least magnitude and shabbily furnished there shall   the revisers of the bible and other absolutely loathsome literary lepers dwell among broken pens bad groundy ink and ruled blottingpaper made in franceall eagerly burning to write and all inflicted with incurable aphasia i should not have thought upon that torture had i not suffered it in moderation myself but it is too horrid even for a hell lets let em off with an eternal toothache  all this talk is partly to persuade you that i write to you out of good feeling only which is not the case i am a beggar ask dobson saintsbury yourself and any other of these cheeses who know something of the eighteenth century what became of jean cavalier between his coming to england and his death in 1740 is anything interesting known about him whom did he marry the happy french smilingly following one another in a long procession headed by the loud and empty napoleon peyrat say olympe dunoyer voltaires old flame vacquerie even thinks that they were rivals and is very french and very literary and very silly in his comments now i may almost say it consists with my knowledge that all this has not a shadow to rest upon it is very odd and very annoying i have splendid materials for cavalier till he comes to my own country and there though he continues to advance in the service he becomes entirely invisible to me any information about him will be greatly welcome i may mention that i know as much as i desire about the other prophets marion fage cavalier de sonne my cavaliers cousin the unhappy lions and the idiotic mr lacy so if any erudite starts upon that track you may choke him off if you can find aught for me or if you will but try count on my undying gratitude langs library is very pleasant reading my book will reach you soon for i write about it todayyours ever       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin

take it i know it was so good i could not help sending it my health improves we have a lovely spot here a little green glen with a burn a wonderful burn gold and green and snowwhite singing loud and low in different steps of its career now pouring over miniature crags now fretting itself to death in a maze of rocky stairs and pots never was so sweet a little river behind great purple moorlands reaching to ben vrackie hunger lives here alone with larks and sheep sweet spot sweet spot  write me a word about bobs professoriate and landor and what you think of the black man the tales are all ghastly thrawn janet frightened me to death there will maybe be anotherthe dead mans letter i believe i shall recover and i am in this blessed hope yours exuberantly       r l s     to professor Ã†neas mackay      this and the next four or five letters refer to the candidature of r    l s for the edinburgh chair       kinnaird cottage pitlochry wednesday june 21 1881  my dear mackaywhat is this i hearthat you are retiring from your chair it is not i hope from illhealth  but if you are retiring may i ask if you have promised your support to any successor i have a great mind to try the summer session would suit me the chair would suit meif only i would suit it i certainly should work it hard that i can promise i only wish it were a few years from now when i hope to have something more substantial to show for myself up to the present time all that i have published even bordering on history has been in an occasional form and i fear this is much against me  please let me hear a word in answer and believe me yours very sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to professor Ã†neas mackay        kinnaird cottage pitlochry june 1881  my dear mackaythank you very much for your kind letter and still more for your good opinion you are not the only one who has regretted my absence from your lectures but you were to me then only a part of a mangle through which i was being slowly and unwillingly draggedpart of a course which i had not chosenpart in a word of an organised boredom  i am glad to have your reasons for giving up the chair they are partly pleasant and partly honourable to you and i think one may say that every man who publicly declines a plurality of offices makes it perceptibly more difficult for the next man to accept them  every one tells me that i come too late upon the field every one being pledged which seeing it is yet too early for any one to come upon the field i must regard as a polite evasion yet all advise me to stand as it might serve me against the next vacancy so stand i shall unless things are changed as it is with my health this summer class is a great attraction it is perhaps the only hope i may have of a permanent income i had supposed the needs of the chair might be met by choosing every year some period of history in which questions of constitutional law were involved but this is to look too far forward  i understand 1st that no overt steps can be taken till your resignation is accepted and 2nd that in the meantime i may without offence mention my design to stand  if i am mistaken about these please correct me as i do not wish to appear where i should not  again thanking you very heartily for your coals of fire i remain yours very sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin        kinnaird cottage pitlochry june 1881  my dear s cgreat and glorious news your friend the bold unfearing chap aims at a professorial cap and now besieges do and dare the edinburgh history chair three months in summer only it will bind him to that windy bit the other nine to arrange abroad untrammeld in the eye of god mark in particular one thing he means to work that cursed thing and to the golden youth explain scotland and england france and spain  in short sir i mean to try for this chair i do believe i can make something out of it it will be a pulpit in a sense for i am nothing if not moral as you know my works are unfortunately so light and trifling they may interfere but if you think as i think i am fit to fight it send me the best kind of testimonial stating all you can in favour of me and with your best art turning the difficulty of my never having done anything in history strictly speaking second is there anybody else think you from whom i could wring onei mean you could wring one for me any party in london or cambridge who thinks well enough of my little books to back me up with a few heartfelt words jenkin approves highly but says pile in english testimonials now i only know stephen symonds lang gosse and you and meredith to be sure the chair is in the gift of the faculty of advocates where i believe i am more wondered at than loved i do not know the foundation one or two hundred i suppose but it would be a good thing for me out and out good help me to live help me to work for i am the better of pressure and help me to say what i want about god man and life       r l s  heartbroken trying to write rightly to people  history and constitutional law is the full style     to edmund gosse        kinnaird cottage pitlochry june 241881  my dear gossei wonder if i misdirected my last to you i begin to fear it i hope however this will go right i am in act to do a mad thingto stand for the edinburgh chair of history it is elected for by the advocates quorum pars i am told that i am too late this year but advised on all hands to go on as it is likely soon to be once more vacant and i shall have done myself good for the next time now if i got the thing which i cannot it appears i believe in spite of all my imperfections i could be decently effectual if you can think so also do put it in a testimonial  heavens je me sauve i have something else to say to you but after that which is not a joke i shall keep it for another shootyours testimonially       robert louis stevenson  i surely need not add dear lad that if you dont feel like it you will only have to pacify me by a long letter on general subjects when i shall hasten to respond in recompense for my assault upon the postal highway     to charles j guthrie      the next two letters are addressed to an old friend and fellowmember    of the speculative society who had passed advocate six years before    on the same day as r l s himself and is now lord guthrie a    senator of the scottish courts of justice and has swanston cottage    sacred to the memory of r l s for his summer home       kinnaird cottage pitlochry june 30 1881  my dear guthriei propose to myself to stand for mackays chair i can promise that i will not spare to work if you can see your way to help me i shall be glad and you may at least not mind making my candidature knownbelieve me yours sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to charles j guthrie        kinnaird cottage pitlochry july 2nd 1881  my dear guthriemany thanks for your support and many more for the kindness and thoughtfulness of your letter i shall take your advice in both directions presuming that by electors you mean the curators i must see to this soon and i feel it would also do no harm to look in at the ph36 as soon then as i get through with a piece of work that both sits upon me like a stone and attracts me like a piece of travel i shall come to town and go avisiting testimonialhunting is a queer form of sportbut has its pleasures  if i got that chair the spec would have a warm defender near at hand the sight of your fist made me speculative on the pastyours most sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to edmund gosse        kinnaird cottage pitlochry july 1881  my dear wegmany thanks for the testimonial many thanks for your blind wondering letter many wishes lastly for your swift recovery insomnia is the opposite pole from my complaint which brings with it a nervous lethargy an unkind unwholesome and ungentle somnolence fruitful in heavy heads and heavy eyes at morning you cannot sleep well i can best explain my state thus i cannot wake sleep like the lees of a posset lingers all day leadheavy in my knees and ankles weight on the shoulders torpor on the brain and there is more than too much of that from an ungrateful hound who is now enjoying his first decently competent and peaceful weeks for close upon two years happy in a big brown moor behind him and an incomparable burn by his side happy above all in some workfor at last i am at work with that appetite and confidence that alone makes work supportable  i told you i had something else to say i am very tediousit is another request in august and a good part of september we shall be in braemar in a house with some accommodation now braemar is a place patronised by the royalty of the sister kingdomsvictoria and the cairngorms sir honouring that countryside by their conjunct presence this seems to me the spot for a bard now can you come to see us for a little while i can promise you you must like my father because you are a human being you ought to like braemar because of your avocation and you ought to like me because i like you and again you must like my wife because she likes cats and as for my motherwell come and see what do you think that is best mrs gosse my wife tells me will have other fish to fry and to be plain i should not like to ask her till i had seen the house but a lone man i know we shall be equal to quen dis tu viensyours       r l s     to p g hamerton        kinnaird cottage pitlochry july 1881  my dear mr hammertonthere goes the second m it is a certainty thank you for your prompt and kind answer little as i deserved it though i hope to show you i was less undeserving than i seemed but just might i delete two words in your testimonial the two words and legal were unfortunately winged by chance against my weakest spot and would go far to damn me  it was not my bliss that i was interested in when i was married it was a sort of marriage in extremis and if i am where i am it is thanks to the care of that lady who married me when i was a mere complication of cough and bones much fitter for an emblem of mortality than a bridegroom  i had a fair experience of that kind of illness when all the women god bless them turn round upon the streets and look after you with a look that is only too kind not to be cruel i have had nearly two years of more or less prostration i have done no work whatever since the february before last until quite of late to be precise until the beginning of last month exactly two essays all last winter i was at davos and indeed i am home here just now against the doctors orders and must soon be back again to that unkindly haunt upon the mountains visitantthere goes no angel there but the angel of death37 the deaths of last winter are still sore spots to me so you see i am not very likely to go on a wild expedition cisstygian at least the truth is i am scarce justified in standing for the chair though i hope you will not mention this and yet my health is one of my reasons for the class is in summer  i hope this statement of my case will make my long neglect appear less unkind it was certainly not because i ever forgot you or your unwonted kindness and it was not because i was in any sense rioting in pleasures  i am glad to hear the catamaran is on her legs again you have my warmest wishes for a good cruise down the saÃ´ne and yet there comes some envy to that wish for when shall i go cruising here a sheer hulk alas lies r l s but i will continue to hope for a better time canoes that will sail better to the wind and a river grander than the saÃ´ne  i heard by the way in a letter of counsel from a wellwisher one reason of my towns absurdity about the chair of art38 i fear it is characteristic of her manners it was because you did not call upon the electors  will you remember me to mrs hamerton and your sonand believe me etc etc       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin        kinnaird cottage pitlochry july 1881  my dear colvini do believe i am better mind and body i am tired just now for i have just been up the burn with wogg daily growing better and boofler so do not judge my state by my style in this i am working steady four cornhill pages scrolled every day besides the correspondence about this chair which is heavy in itself my first story thrawn janet all in scotch is accepted by stephen my second the body snatchers is laid aside in a justifiable disgust the tale being horrid my third the merry men i am more than half through and think real well of it is a fantastic sonata about the sea and wrecks and i like it much above all my other attempts at storytelling i think it is strange if ever i shall make a hit i have the line now as i believe  fanny has finished one of hers the shadow on the bed and is now hammering at a second for which we have no name as yetnot by wilkie collins  tales for winter nights yes that i think we will call the lot of them when republished  why have you not sent me a testimonial everybody else but you has responded and symonds but im afraid hes ill do think too if anybody else would write me a testimonial i am told quantity goes far i have good ones from rev professor campbell professor meiklejohn leslie stephen lang gosse and a very shaky one from hamerton  grant is an elector so cant but has written me kindly from tulloch i have not yet heard do help me with suggestions this old chair with its Â£250 and its light work would make me  it looks as if we should take caters chalet39 after all but o to go back to that place it seems cruel i have not yet received the landor but it may be at home detained by my mother who returns tomorrow  believe me dear colvin ever yours       r l s  yours came the class is in summer many thanks for the testimonial it is bully arrived along with it another from symonds also bully he is ill but not lungs thank godfever got in italy we have taken caters chalet so we are now the aristos of the valley there is no

i shall not i should be independent at once sweet thought i liked your byron well your berlioz better no one would remark these cuts even i who was looking for it knew it not at all to be a torso the

ernest henley or of social and artistic history as the thing might grow to you sir you might be in the athenÃ¦um yet with that and believe me you might and would be far better the author of a readable

came a return of catarrhal troubles and hemorrhage this    letter answers some criticisms made by his correspondent on the    merry men as drafted in ms       pitlochry if you please august 1881  dear henleyto answer a point or two first the spanish ship was slooprigged and clumsy because she was fitted out by some private adventurers not over wealthy and glad to take what they could get is that not right tell me if you think not that at least was how i meant it as for the boatcloaks i am afraid they are as you say false imagination but i love the name nature and being of them so dearly that i feel as if i would almost rather ruin a story than omit the reference the proudest moments of my life have been passed in the sternsheets of a boat with that romantic garment over my shoulders this without prejudice to one glorious day when standing upon some water stairs at lerwick i signalled with my pockethandkerchief for a boat to come ashore for me i was then aged fifteen or sixteen conceive my glory  several of the phrases you object to are proper nautical or longshore phrases and therefore i think not out of place in this longshore story as for the two members which you thought at first so illunited i confess they seem perfectly so to me i have chosen to sacrifice a longprojected story of adventure because the sentiment of that is identical with the sentiment of my uncle my uncle himself is not the story as i see it only the leading episode of that story its really a story of wrecks as they appear to the dweller on the coast its a view of the sea goodness knows when i shall be able to rewrite i must first get over this copperheaded cold       r l s     to sidney colvin      the reference to landor in the following is to a volume of mine in    macmillans series english men of letters this and the next two or    three years were those of the fenian dynamite outrages at the tower    of london the house of lords etc       kinnaird cottage pitlochry august 1881  my dear colvinthis is the first letter i have written this good while i have had a brutal cold not perhaps very wisely treated lots of bloodfor me i mean i was so well however before that i seem to be sailing through with it splendidly my appetite never failed indeed as i got worse it sharpeneda sort of reparatory instinct now i feel in a fair way to get round soon  monday august 2nd is itwe set out for the spital of glenshee and reach braemar on tuesday the braemar address we cannot learn it looks as if braemar were all that was necessary if particular you can address 17 heriot row we shall be delighted to see you whenever and as soon as ever you can make it possible   i hope heartily you will survive me and do not doubt it there are seven or eight people it is no part of my scheme in life to surviveyet if i could but heal me of my bellowses i could have a jolly lifehave it even now when i can work and stroll a little as i have been doing till this cold i have so many things to make life sweet to me it seems a pity i cannot have that other one thinghealth but though you will be angry to hear it i believe for myself at least what is is best i believed it all through my worst days and i am not ashamed to profess it now  landor has just turned up but i had read him already i like him extremely i wonder if the cuts were perhaps not advantageous it seems quite full enough but then you know i am a compressionist  if i am to criticise it is a little staid but the classical is apt to look so it is in curious contrast to that inexpressive unplanned wilderness of forsters clear readable precise and sufficiently human i see nothing lost in it though i could have wished in my scotch capacity a trifle clearer and fuller exposition of his moral attitude which is not quite clear from here  he and his tyrannicide i am in a mad fury about these explosions if that is the new world damn odonovan rossa damn him behind and before above below and roundabout damn deracinate and destroy him root and branch self and company world without end amen i write that for sport if you like but i will pray in earnest o lord if you cannot convert kindly delete him  stories naturally at halt henley has seen one and approves i believe it to be good myself even real good he has also seen and approved one of fannys it will make a good volume we have now    thrawn janet with stephen

r l s     to dr alexander japp      dr japp known in literature at this date and for some time    afterwards under his pseudonym h a page later under his own name    the biographer of de quincey had written to r l s criticising    statements of fact and opinion in his essay on thoreau and    expressing the hope that they might meet and discuss their    differences in the interval between the last letter and this    stevenson with all his family had moved to braemar       the cottage castleton of braemar sunday august 1881  my dear siri should long ago have written to thank you for your kind and frank letter but in my state of health papers are apt to get mislaid and your letter has been vainly hunted for until this sunday morning  i regret i shall not be able to see you in edinburgh one visit to edinburgh has already cost me too dear in that invaluable particular health but if it should be at all possible for you to push on as far as braemar i believe you would find an attentive listener and i can offer you a bed a drive and necessary food etc  if however you should not be able to come thus far i can promise you two things first i shall religiously revise what i have written and bring out more clearly the point of view from which i regarded thoreau second i shall in the preface record your objection  the point of view and i must ask you not to forget that any such short paper is essentially only a section through a man was this i desired to look at the man through his books thus for instance when i mentioned his return to the pencilmaking i did it only in passing perhaps i was wrong because it seemed to me not an illustration of his principles but a brave departure from them thousands of such there were i do not doubt still they might be hardly to my purpose though as you say so some of them would be  our difference as to pity i suspect was a logomachy of my making no pitiful acts on his part would surprise me i know he would be more pitiful in practice than most of the whiners but the spirit of that practice would still seem to be unjustly described by the word pity  when i try to be measured i find myself usually suspected of a sneaking unkindness for my subject but you may be sure sir i would give up most other things to be so good a man as thoreau even my knowledge of him leads me thus far  should you find yourself able to push on to braemarit may even be on your waybelieve me your visit will be most welcome the weather is cruel but the place is as i dare say you know the very wale of scotlandbar tummelsideyours very sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to mrs sitwell        the cottage castleton of braemar august 1881   well i have been pretty mean but i have not yet got over my cold so completely as to have recovered much energy it is really extraordinary that i should have recovered as well as i have in this blighting weather the wind pipes the rain comes in squalls great black clouds are continually overhead and it is as cold as march the country is delightful more cannot be said it is very beautiful a perfect joy when we get a blink of sun to see it in the queen knows a thing or two i perceive she has picked out the finest habitable spot in britain  i have done no work and scarce written a letter for three weeks but i think i should soon begin again my cough is now very trifling i eat well and seem to have lost but little flesh in the meanwhile i was wonderfully well before i caught this horrid cold i never thought i should have been as well again i really enjoyed life and work and of course i now have a good hope that this may return  i suppose you heard of our ghost stories they are somewhat delayed by my cold and a bad attack of laziness embroidery etc under which fanny had been some time prostrate it is horrid that we can get no better weather i did not get such good accounts of you as might have been you must imitate me i am now one of the most conscientious people at trying to get better you ever saw i have a white hat it is much admired also a plaid and a heavy stoop so i take my walks abroad witching the world  last night i was beaten at chess and am still grinding under the

everybody else wants to come later and it will be a godsend for siryours sincerely  you can stay as long as you behave decently and are not sick of siryour obedient humble servant  we have family worship in the home of siryours respectfully  braemar is a fine country but nothing to what you will also see the maps of siryours in the lord  a carriage and two spanking hacks draw up daily at the hour of two before the house of siryours truly  the rain rains and the winds do beat upon the cottage of the late miss macgregor and of siryours affectionately  it is to be trusted that the weather may improve ere you know the halls of siryours emphatically  all will be glad to welcome you not excepting siryours ever  you will now have gathered the lamentable intellectual collapse of siryours indeed  and nothing remains for me but to sign myself siryours       robert louis stevenson  nbeach of these clauses has to be read with extreme glibness coming down whack upon the sir this is very important the fine stylistic inspiration will else be lost  i commit the man who made the man who sold and the woman who supplied me with my present excruciating gilt nib to that place where the worm never dies  the reference to a deceased highland lady tending as it does to foster unavailing sorrow may be with advantage omitted from the address which would therefore runthe cottage castleton of braemar     to edmund gosse        the cottage castleton of braemar august 19 1881  if you had an uncle who was a sea captain and went to the north pole you had better bring his outfit verbum sapientibus i look towards you       r l stevenson     to edmund gosse        braemar august 19 1881  my dear wegi have by an extraordinary drollery of fortune sent off to you by this days post a pc inviting you to appear in sealskin but this had reference to the weather and not at all as you may have been led to fancy to our rustic raiment of an evening  as to that question i would deal in so far as in me lies fairly with all men we are not dressy people by nature but it sometimes occurs to us to entertain angels in the country i believe even angels may be decently welcomed in tweed i have faced many great personages for my own part in a tasteful suit of seacloth with an end of carpet pending from my gullet still we do maybe twice a summer burst out in the direction of blacksand yet we do it seldom in short let your own heart decide and the capacity of your portmanteau if you came in camels hair you would still although conspicuous be welcome  the sooner the better after tuesdayyours ever       robert louis stevenson     to w e henley      the following records the beginning of work upon treasure island    the name originally proposed for which was the sea cook       braemar august 25 1881  my dear henleyof course i am a rogue why lord its known man but you should remember i have had a horrid cold now im better i think and see herenobody not you nor lang nor the devil will hurry me with our crawlers they are coming four of them are as good as done and the rest will come when ripe but i am now on another lay for the moment purely owing to lloyd this one but i believe theres more coin in it than in any amount of crawlers now see here the sea cook or treasure island a story for boys  if this dont fetch the kids why they have gone rotten since my day will you be surprised to learn that it is about buccaneers that it begins in the admiral benbow publichouse on devon coast that its all about a map and a treasure and a mutiny and a derelict ship and a current and a fine old squire trelawney the real tre purged of literature and sin to suit the infant mind and a doctor and another doctor and a sea cook with one leg and a seasong with the chorus yohoho and a bottle of rum at the third ho you heave at the capstan bars which is a real buccaneers song only known to the crew of the late captain flint died of rum at key west much regretted friends will please accept this intimation and lastly would you be surprised to hear in this connection the name of routledge thats the kind of man i am blast your eyes two chapters are written and have been tried on lloyd with great success the trouble is to work it off without oaths buccaneers without oathsbricks without straw but youth and the fond parent have to be consulted  and now look herethis is next dayand three chapters are written and read chapter i the old seadog at the admiral benbow chapter ii black dog appears and disappears chapter iii the black spot all now heard by lloyd f and my father and mother with high approval its quite silly and horrid fun and what i want is the best book about the buccaneers that can be hadthe latter bs above all blackbeard and sich and get nutt or bain to send it skimming by the fastest post and now i know youll write to me for the sea cooks sake  your admiral guinea is curiously near my line but of course im fooling and your admiral sounds like a shublime gent stick to him like waxhell do my trelawney is as i indicate several thousand seamiles off the lie of the original or your admiral guinea and besides i have no more about him yet but one mention of his name and i think it likely he may turn yet farther from the model in the course of handling a chapter a day i mean to do they are short and perhaps in a month the sea cook may to routledge go yohoho and a bottle of rum my trelawney has a strong dash of landor as i see him from here no women in the story lloyds orders and who so blithe to obey its awful fun boys stories you just indulge the pleasure of your heart thats all no trouble no strain the only stiff thing is to get it endedthat i dont see but i look to a volcano o sweet o generous o human toils you would like my blind beggar in chapter iii i believe no writing just drive along as the words come and the pen will scratch       r l s   author of boys stories     to dr alexander japp      this correspondent had paid his visit as proposed discussed the    thoreau differences listened delightedly to the first chapters of    treasure island and proposed to offer the story for publication    to his friend mr henderson proprietor and editor of young folks       braemar september 1881  my dear dr jappmy father has gone but i think i may take it upon me to ask you to keep the book of all things you could do to endear yourself to me you have done the best for my father and you have taken a fancy to each other  i do not know how to thank you for all your kind trouble in the matter of the sea cook but i am not unmindful my health is still poorly and i have added intercostal rheumatisma new attractionwhich sewed me up nearly double for two days and still gives me a list to starboardlet us be ever nautical  i do not think with the start i have there will be any difficulty in letting mr henderson go ahead whenever he likes i will write my story up to its legitimate conclusion and then we shall be in a position to judge whether a sequel would be desirable and i would then myself know better about its practicability from the storytellers point of viewyours ever very sincerely       r l stevenson     to w e henley      this tells of the farther progress of treasure island of the price    paid for it and of the modest hopes with which it was launched the    poet is mr gosse the project of a highway story jerry abershaw    remained a favourite one with stevenson until it was superseded three    or four years later by another that of the great north road which    in its turn had to be abandoned from lack of health and leisure    after some six or eight chapters had been written       braemar september 1881  my dear henleythanks for your last the Â£100 fell through or dwindled at least into somewhere about Â£30 however that ive taken as a mouthful so you may look out for the sea cook or treasure island a tale of the buccaneers in young folks the terms are Â£2 10s a page of 4500 words thats not noble is it but i have my copyright safe i dont get illustrateda blessing thats the price i have to pay for my copyright  ill make this boys book business pay but i have to make a beginning when im done with young folks ill try routledge or some one i feel pretty sure the sea cook will do to reprint and bring something decent at that  japp is a good soul the poet was very gay and pleasant he told me much he is simply the most active young man in england and one of the most intelligent he shall oer europe shall oer earth extend41 he is now extending over adjacent parts of scotland  i propose to follow up the sea cook at proper intervals by jerry abershaw a tale of putney heath which or its site i must visit the leading light a tale of the coast the squaw men or the wild west and other instructive and entertaining work jerry abershaw should be good eh i love writing boys books this first is only an experiment wait till you see what i can make em with my hand in ill be the harrison ainsworth of the future and a chalk better by st christopher or at least as good youll see that even by the sea cook  jerry abershawo what a title jerry abershaw dn it sir its a poem the two most lovely words in english and what a sentiment hark you how the hoofs ring is this a blacksmiths no its a wayside inn jerry abershaw it was a clear frosty evening not 100 miles from putney etc jerry abershaw jerry abershaw jerry abershaw the sea cook is now in its sixteenth chapter and bids for well up in the thirties each three chapters is worth Â£2 10s so weve Â£12 10s

hardest things i ever tried to write perhapsbut noi have no theory to offerit went against the spirit but as i say i girt my loins up and nearly died of it  in five weeks six at the latest i should have a complete proof of treasure island it will be from 75 to 80000 words and with anything like half good pictures it should sell i suppose i may at least hope for eight pics i aspire after ten or twelve you had better  two days later  bunyan skips today pretty bad always with an official letter yours came last night i had already spotted your dickens very pleasant and true  my wife is far from

friend for asking you to give me a testimonial in the circumstances he thought it was indelicate lest by some calamity you should ever have felt the same way i must say in two words how the matter appeared to me that silly story of the election altered in no tittle the value of your testimony so much for that on the other hand it led me to take quite a particular pleasure in asking you to give it and so much for the other i trust even if you cannot share it you will understand my view  i am in treaty with bentley for a life of hazlitt i hope it will not fall through as i love the subject and appear to have found a publisher who loves it also that i think makes things more pleasant you know i am a fervent hazlittite i mean regarding him as the english writer who has had the scantiest

distresses that it looks like a kind of lamplit fairyland behind me o for ten edinburgh minutessixpence between us and the everglorious lothian road or dear mysterious leith walk but here a sheer hulk

journey by a drive in an open sleighnone others were to be hadseven hours on end through whole forests of christmas trees the cold was beyond belief i have often suffered less at a dentists it was a clear sunny day but the sun even at noon falls at this season only here and there into the prÃ¤ttigau i kept up as long as i could in an imitation of a street singer    away ye gay landscapes ye gardens of roses etc  at last lloyd remarked a blue mouth speaking from a corpsecoloured face you seem to be the only one with any courage left and do you know with that word my courage disappeared and i made the rest of the stage in the same dumb wretchedness as the others my only terror was lest fanny should ask for brandy or laudanum or something so awful was the idea of putting my hands out that i half thought i would refuse  well none of us are a penny the worse lloyds cold better i with a twinge of the rheumatiz and fanny better than her ordinary  general conclusion between lloyd and

wont use the word torture but go to your dentists and in nine cases out of ten you will not suffer more pain than we suffered  this is merely in acknowledgment of your editorial to say that i shall give my mind at once to the murder but i bethink me you can say so much and convey my sense of the liberality of our cousins without exhibiting this scrawl so i may go on to tell you that i have at last found a publisher as eager to publish as i am to write a hazlitt bentley is the boy and very liberal at least as per last advices certainly very friendly and eager which makes work light like whistling i wish i was with the rest ofwell of usin the red books but i am glad to get a whack at hazlitt howsoeer  how goes your gray i would not change with you brother gray would never be suited to my temperament while hazlitt fits me like a glove  i hope in your studies in young folks you did not miss the delicious reticences the artistic concealments and general fineshade graduation through which the fact of the xmas nr being 3d was instilledtoo stronginspired into the mind of the readers it was superb  i may add as a postscript i wish to god i or anybody knew what was the matter with my wifeyours ever       robert louis stevenson     to sidney colvin        chalet am stein davosplatz march 1882  my dear colvinherewith moral emblems the elephant by fannythe rest by me  i would have sent it long ago but i must explain i brought home with me from my bad times in america two strains of unsoundness of mind the first a perpetual fear that i can do no more workthe second a perpetual fear that my friends have quarrelled with me43 this last long silence of yours drove me into really believing it and i dared not write to you  well its ancient history now and here are the emblems a second series is in the press  silverado is still unfinished but i think i have done well on the whole as you say i shall be home i hope sometime in may perhaps before it depends on fannys health which is still far from good and often alarms me i shall then see your collectanea i shall not put pen to paper till i settle somewhere else hazlitt had better simmer awhile i have to see ireland too who has most kindly written to me and invited me to see his collections  symonds grows much on me in many ways what you would least expect a very sound man and very wise in a wise way it is curious

the decency to write at all we have got rid of our young pretty and incompetent maid and now we have a fine canny twinkling shrewd auldfarrant peasant body who gives us good food and keeps us in good spirits if we could only understand what she says but she speaks davos language which is to german what aberdeenawa is to english so it comes heavy god bless you my dear cummy and so says fanny

sleeps at night because of morphine and we do not know what ails him only fear it to be canker of the ear he makes a bad black spot in our life poor selfish silly little tangle and my wife is wretched otherwise she is better steadily and slowly moving up through all her relapses my knee never gets the least better it hurts tonight which it has not done for long i do not suppose my doctor knows any least thing about it he says it is a nerve that i struck but i assure you he does not know  i have just finished a paper a gossip on romance in which i have tried to do very popularly about onehalf of the matter you wanted me to try in a way i have found an answer to the question but the subject was hardly fit for so chatty a paper and it is all loose ends if ever i do my book on the art of literature i shall gather them together and be clear  tomorrow having once finished off the touches still due on this i shall tackle san francisco for you then the tide of work will fairly bury me lost to view and hope you have no idea what it costs me to wring out my work now i have certainly been a fortnight over this romance sometimes five hours a day and yet it is about my usual lengtheight pages or so and would be a dd sight the better for another curry but i do not think i can honestly rewrite it all so i call it done and shall only straighten words in a revision currently  i had meant to go on for a great while and say all manner of entertaining things but alls gone i am now an idiotyours ever       r l s     to w e henley      the following flight of fancy refers to supposed errors of judgment    on the part of an eminent firm of publishers with whom stevenson had    at this time no connection very soon afterwards he entered into    relations with them which proved equally pleasant and profitable to    both parties and were continued on the most cordial terms until his    death       chalet am stein davos march 1882  my dear henleylast night we had a dinnerparty consisting of the john addington curry onions lovely onions and beefsteak so unusual is any excitement that f and i feel this morning as if we had been to a coronation however i must i suppose write  i was sorry about your female contributor squabble tis very comic but really unpleasant but what care i now that i illustrate my own books i can always offer you a situation in our houses l osbourne and co as an author gets a halfpenny a copy of verses and an artist a penny a cut perhaps a proofreader might get several pounds a year  o that coronation what a shouting crowd there was i obviously got a firework in each eye the king looked very magnificent to be sure and that great hall where we feasted on seven hundred delicate foods and drank fifty royal winesquel coup doeil but was it not overdone even for a coronationalmost a vulgar luxury and eleven is certainly too late to begin dinner it was really 630 instead of 530  your list of books that cassells have refused in these weeks is

published browns handbook to cricket joness first french reader and robinsons picturesque cheshire uniform with the same authors stately homes of salop  o if that list could come true how we would tear at solomon crabb o what a bully bully bully business which would you read firstshakespeares autobiography or his journals what sport the monody on napoleon would bewhat wooden verse what stucco ornament i should read both the autobiography and the journals before i looked at one of the plays beyond the names of them which shows that saintsbury was right and i do care more for life than for poetry noi take it back do you know one of the tragediesa bible tragedy toodavidwas written in his third periodmuch about the same time as lear the comedy april rain is also a late work beckett is a fine ranting piece like richard ii but very fine for the stage irving is to play it this autumn when im in town the part rather suits himbut who is to play henrya tremendous creation sir betterton in his private journal seems to have seen this piece and he says distinctly that henry is the best part in any play though he adds how it be with the ancient plays i know not but in this i have ever feared to do ill and indeed will not be persuaded to that undertaking so says betterton rufus is not so good i am not pleased with rufus plainly a rifaccimento of some inferior work but there are some damned fine lines as for the purely satiric illminded abelard and heloise another troilus quoi it is not pleasant truly but what strength what verve what knowledge of life and the canon what a finished humorous rich picture is the canon ah there was nobody like shakespeare but what i like is the david and absalom business absalom is so well feltyou love him as david did davids speech is one roll of royal music from the first act to the fifth  i am enjoying solomon crabb extremely solomons capital adventure with the two highwaymen and squire trecothick and parson vance it is as good i think as anything in joseph andrews i have just come to the part where the highwayman with the black patch over his eye has tricked poor solomon into his place and the squire and the parson are hearing the evidence parson vance is splendid how good too is old mrs crabb and the coastguardsman in the third chapter or her delightful quarrel with the sexton of seaham lord conybeare is surely a little overdone but i dont know either hes such damned fine sport do you like sally barnes im in love with her constable muddon is as good as dogberry and verges put together when he takes solomon to the cage and the highwayman gives him solomons own guinea for his pains and kisses mrs muddon and just then up drives lord conybeare and instead of helping solomon calls him all the rascals in christendomo henry fielding henry fielding yet perhaps the scenes at seaham are the best but im bewildered among all these excellences    stay cried a voice that made the welkin crackthis   heres a dream return and study black  ever yours       r l s     to alexander ireland      the following is in reply to a letter stevenson had received on some    questions connected with his proposed life of hazlitt from the    veteran critic and bibliographer since deceased mr alexander    ireland at the foot is to be found the first reference to his new    amusement of wood engraving for the davos  press       chalet am stein davos march 1882  my dear sirthis formidable paper need not alarm you it argues nothing beyond penury of other sorts and is not at all likely to lead me into a long letter if i were at all grateful it would for yours has just passed for me a considerable part of a stormy evening and speaking of gratitude let me at once and with becoming eagerness accept your kind invitation to bowdon i shall hope if we can agree as to dates when i am nearer hand to come to you sometime in the month of may i was pleased to hear you were a scot i feel more at home with my compatriots always perhaps the more we are away the stronger we feel that bond  you ask about davos i have discoursed about it already rather sillily i think in the pall mall and i mean to say no more but the ways of the muse are dubious and obscure and who knows i may be wiled again as a place of residence beyond a splendid climate it has to my eyes but one advantagethe neighbourhood of j a symondsi dare say you know his work but the man is far more interesting it has done me in my two winters alpine exile much good so much that i hope to leave it now for ever but would not be understood to boast in my present unpardonably crazy state any cold might send me skipping either back to davos or further off let us hope not it is dear a little dreary very far from many things that both my taste and my needs prompt me to seek and altogether not the place that i should choose of my free will  i am chilled by your description of the man in question though i had almost argued so much from his cold and undigested volume if the republication does not interfere with my publisher it will not interfere with me but there of course comes the hitch i do not know mr bentley and i fear all publishers like the devil from legend and experience both however when i come to town we shall i hope meet and understand each other as well as author and publisher ever do i liked his letters they seemed hearty kind and personal stilli am notedly suspicious of the tradeyour news of this republication alarms me  the best of the present french novelists seems to me incomparably daudet les rois en exil comes very near being a masterpiece for zola i have no toleration though the curious eminently bourgeois and eminently french creature has power of a kind but i would he were deleted i would not give a chapter of old dumas meaning himself not his collaborators for the whole boiling of the zolas romance with the smallpoxas the great one diseased anyway and blackhearted and fundamentally at enmity with joy  i trust that mrs ireland does not object to smoking and if you are a teetotaller i beg you to mention it before i comei have all the vices some of the virtues also let us hopethat at least of being a scotchman and yours very sincerely       robert louis stevenson  psmy father was in the old high school the last year and walked in the procession to the new i blush to own i am an

my later attempts i have been nine days at the artobserve my progress       r l s     to mrs gosse      mrs gosse had sent r l s a miniature bible illustrated with rude    cuts picked up at an outdoor stall lloyds new work is black    canyon       chalet am stein davos march 16 1882  dear mrs gossethank you heartily for the bible which is exquisite i thoroughly appreciate the whole but have you done justice to the third lion in daniel like the third murderer in macbetha singular animalstudy him well the soldier in the fiery furnace beats me  i enclose a programme of lloyds new work the work i shall send tomorrow for the publisher is out and i dare not touch his plant il men cuirait the work in question i think a huge lark but still droller is the authors attitude not one incident holds with another from beginning to end and whenever i discover a new inconsistency sam is the first to laughwith a kind of humorous pride at the thing being so silly  i saw the note and i was so sorry my article had not come in time for the old lady we should all hurry up and praise the living i must praise tupper a propos did you ever read himor know any one who had that is very droll but the truth is we all live in a clique buy each others books and like each others books and the great gaunt grey gaping public snaps its big fingers and reads talmage and tupperand black canyon  my wife is better

splendidly illustrated in the story the characters are bold and striking it reflects the highest honour on its writermorning call  a very remarkable work every page produces an effect the end is as singular as the beginning i never saw such a work beforer l stevenson     to sidney colvin      i had written to him of the proposal that i should do the volume on    keats for macmillans english men of letters series from his    essay talk and talkers i was eventually left out       chalet am stein davosplatz spring 1882  dear colvinabout keatswell yes i wonder i see all your difficulties and yet i have the strongest kind of feeling that critical biography is your real vein the landor was one nail another i think would be good for you and the public indeed i would do the keats he is worth doing it is a brave and a sad little story and the critical part lies deep in the very vitals of art all summed i would do him remember it is but a small order alongside of landor and Â£100 and kudos and a good word for the poor great lad who will otherwise fall among the molluscs up heart give me a john keats houghton though he has done it with grace has scarce done it with grip  i have put you into talk and talkers sure enough god knows i hope i shall offend nobody i do begin to quake mightily over that paper i have a gossip on romance about done it puts some real criticism in a light way i think it is destined for longman who dead secret is bringing out a new mag 6d in the autumn dead secret all his letters are three deep with masks and passwords and i swear on a skull daily f has

written the best note to mrs gosse that was in my power most blameable  i now send for mrs gosse   black canyon  also an advertisement of my new appearance as poet bard rather and hartis on wood the cut represents the hero and the eagle and is emblematic of cortez first viewing the pacific ocean which according to the bard keats it took place in darien the cut is much admired for the sentiment of discovery the manly proportions of the voyager and the fine impression of tropical scenes and the untrodden waste so aptly rendered by the hartis  i would send you the book but i declare im ruined i got a penny a cut and a halfpenny a set of verses from the flinthearted publisher and only one specimen copy as im a sinner  was apostolic alongside of osbourne  i hope you will be able to decipher this written at steam speed with a breaking pen the hotfast postman at my heels no excuse says you none sir says i and touches my at most civil extraordinary evolution of pen now quite doomedto resume i have not put pen to the bloody murder yet but it is early on my list and when once i get to it three weeks should see the last bloodstainmaybe a fortnight for i am beginning to combine an extraordinary laborious slowness while at work with the most surprisingly quick results in the way of finished manuscripts how goes gray colvin is to do keats my wife is still not wellyours ever

have but now told my publisher to send you a copy of the familiar studies however i own i have delayed this letter till i could send you the enclosed remembering the nights at braemar when we visited the picture gallery i hoped they might amuse you you see we do some publishing hereaway i shall hope to see you in town in mayalways yours faithfully       robert louis stevenson     to dr alexander japp      the references in the first paragraph are to the volume familiar    studies of men and books       chalet am stein davos april 1 1882  my dear dr jappa good day to date this letter which is in fact a confession of incapacity during my wifes illness i somewhat lost my head and entirely lost a great quire of corrected proofs this is one of the results i hope there are none more serious i was never so sick of any volume as i was of that i was continually receiving fresh proofs with fresh infinitesimal difficulties i was illi did really fear my wife was worse than ill well its out now and though i have observed several carelessnesses myself and now heres another of your findingof which indeed i ought to be ashamedit will only justify the sweeping humility of the preface  symonds was actually dining with us when your letter came and i communicated your remarks he is a far better and more interesting thing than any of his books  the elephant was my wifes so she is proportionately elate you should have picked it out for praisefrom a collection let me add so replete with the highest qualities of art  my wicked carcase as john knox calls it holds together wonderfully in addition to many other things and a volume of travel i find i have written since december 90 cornhill pages of magazine workessays and stories 40000 words and i am none the worsei am the better i begin to hope i may if not outlive this wolverine upon my shoulders at least carry him bravely like symonds and alexander pope i begin to take a pride in that hope  i shall be much interested to see your criticisms you might perhaps send them to me i believe you know that is not dangerous one folly i have noti am not touchy under criticism  lloyd and my wife both beg to be remembered and lloyd sends as a present a work of his own i hope you feel flattered for this is simply the first time he has ever given one away i have to buy my own works i can tell youyours very sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to w e henley      from about this time until 1885 mr henley acted in an informal way    as agent for r l s in most of his dealings with publishers in

superseded by long talksand it comes not i remember i have never formally thanked you for that hundred quid nor in general for the introduction to chatto and windus and continue to bury you in copy as if you were my private secretary well i am not unconscious of it all but i think least said is often best generally best gratitude is a tedious sentiment its not ductile not dramatic  if chatto should take both cui dedicare i am running out of dedikees if i do the whole fun of writing is stranded treasure island if it comes out and i mean it shall of course goes to lloyd lemme see i have now

not hang together and ladies busshe and culmer sont des monstruositÃ©s vernons conduct makes a wonderful odd contrast with daniel derondas i see more and more that meredith is built for immortality  talking of which heywood as a small immortal an immortalet claims some attention the woman killed with kindness is one of the most striking novelsnot plays though its more of a play than anything else of hisi ever read he had such a sweet sound soul the old boy the death of the two pirates in fortune by sea and land is a document he had obviously been present and heard purser and clinton take death

i sufficed for myself indeed and i believe i can  i am still far from satisfied about fanny she is certainly better but it is by fits a good deal and the symptoms continue which should not be i had her persuaded to leave without me this very day saturday 8th but the disclosure of my mismanagement broke up that plan she would not leave me lest i should mismanage more i think this an unfair revenge but i have been so bothered that i cannot struggle all davos has been drinking our wine during the month of march three litres a day were drunko it is too sickeningand that is only a specimen

royale w p bannatyne     to trevor haddon      the few remaining letters of this period are dated from edinburgh and    from stobo manse near peebles this in the matter of weather and    health was the most disappointing of all stevensons attempts at    summer residence in scotland before going to stobo he made a short    excursion with his father to lochearnhead and later spent some three    weeks with me at kingussie but from neither place wrote any letters    worth preserving the following was addressed to a young artstudent    who had read the works of walt whitman after reading stevensons    essay on him and being staggered by some things he found there had    written asking for further comment and counsel       17 heriot row edinburgh june 1882  dear sirif i have in any way disquieted you i believe you are justified in bidding me stand and deliver a remedy if there be one which is the point  1st i am of your way of thinking that a good deal of whitman is as well taken once but 2nd i quite believe that it is better to have everything brought before one in books in that way the problems reach us when we are cool and not warped by the sophistries of an instant passion life itself presents its problems with a terrible directness and at the very hour when we are least able to judge calmly hence this pisgah sight of all things off the top of a book is only a rational preparation for the ugly grips that must follow  but 3rd no man can settle anothers life for him it is the test of the nature and courage of each that he shall decide it for himself each in turn must meet and beard the sphynx some things however i must sayand you will treat them as things read in a book for you to accept or refuse as you shall see most fit  go not out of your way to make difficulties hang back from life while you are young shoulder no responsibilities you do not yet know how far you can trust yourselfit will not be very far or you are more fortunate than i am if you can keep your sexual desires in order be glad be very glad some day when you meet your fate you will be free and the better man dont make a boy and girl friendship that which it is not look at burns that is where amourettes conduct an average good man and a tepid marriage is only a more selfish amourettein the long run whatever you do see that you dont sacrifice a woman thats where all imperfect loves conduct us at the same time if you can make it convenient to be chaste for gods sake avoid the primness of your virtue hardness to a poor harlot is a sin lower than the ugliest unchastity  never be in a hurry anyhow  there is my sermon  certainly you cannot too earnestly go in for the greek and about any art think last of what pays first of what pleases it is in that spirit only that an art can be made progress in art is made by learning to enjoy it that which seems a little dull at first is found to contain the elements of pleasure more largely though more quietly commingled  i return to my sermon for one more word natural desire gives you no right to any particular woman that comes with love only and dont be too ready to believe in love there are many shams the true love will not allow you to reason about it  it is your fault if i appear so pulpiteering  wishing you well in life and art and that you may long be youngbelieve me yours truly       robert louis stevenson     to

make it out you will be a good soul to pay a visit i shall write again about the opuscule and about stobo which i have not seen since i was thirteen though my memory speaks delightfully of it  i have been very tired and seedy or i should have written before inter alia to tell you that i had visited my murder place and found living traditions not yet in any printed book most startling i also got photographs taken but the negatives have not yet turned up i lie on the sofa to write this whence the pencil having slept yesterday1  4  712  1212 hours and being 9 am very anxious to sleep again the arms of porpus quoi a poppy gules etc  from stobo you can conquer peebles and selkirk or to give them their old decent names tweeddale and ettrick think of having been called tweeddale and being called peebles did i ever tell you my skit on my own travel books we understand that mr stevenson has in the press another volume of unconventional travels personal adventures in peeblesshire je la

see nothing cheekie in anything you have done your letters have naturally given me much pleasure for it seems to me you are a pretty good young fellow as young fellows go and if i add that you remind me of myself you need not accuse me of retrospective vanity  you now know an address which will always find me you might let me have your address in london i do not promise anythingfor i am always overworked in londonbut i shall if i can arrange it try to see you  i am afraid i am not so rigid on chastity you are probably right in your view but this seems to me a dilemma with two horns the real curse of a mans life in our state of societyand a womans too although for many reasons it appears somewhat differently with the enslaved sex by your fate i believe i meant your marriage or that love at least which may befall any one of us at the shortest notice and overthrow the most settled habits and opinions i call that your fate because then if not before you can no longer hang back but must stride out into life and actbelieve me yours sincerely       robert louis stevenson     to edmund gosse      mr gosse had mistaken the name of the peeblesshire manse and is    reproached accordingly

should all be overjoyedthough stobo it could not be as it is but a kirk and manse but possibly somewhere within reach let us know  second i have read your gray with care a more difficult subject i can scarce fancy it is crushing yet i think you have managed to shadow forth a man and a good man too and honestly i doubt if i could have done the same this may seem egoistic but you are not such a fool as to think so it is the natural expression of real praise the book as a whole is readable your subject peeps every here and there out of the crannies like a shy violethe could do no moreand his aroma hangs there  i write to catch a minion of the post hence brevity answer about the houseyours affectionately       r l s     to w e henley      in the heat of conversation stevenson was accustomed to invent any    number of fictitious personages generally scottish and to give them    names and to set them playing their imaginary parts in life    reputable or otherwise many of these inventions including mr    pirbright smith and mr pegfurth bannatyne were a kind of    incarnations of himself or of special aspects of himself they    assumed for him and his friends a kind of substantial existence and    constantly in talk and occasionally in writing he would keep up the    play of reporting their sayings and doings quite gravely as in the    following       stobo manse july 1882  dear henley i am not worth an old damn i am also crushed by bad news of symonds his good lung going i cannot help reading it as a personal hint god help us all really i am not very fit for work but i try try and nothing comes of it  i believe we shall have to leave this place it is low damp and mauchy the rain it raineth every day and the glass goes tolderolderiddle  yet its a bonny bit i wish i could live in it but doubt i wish i was well away somewhere else i feel like flight some days honour bright  pirbright smith is well old mr pegfurth bannatyne is here staying at a country inn his whole baggage is a pair of socks and a book in a fishingbasket and he borrows even a rod from the landlord he walked here over the hills from sanquhar singin he says like a mavis i naturally asked him about hazlitt he wouldnae take his drink he said a queer queer fellow but did not seem further communicative he says he has become releegious but still swears like a trooper i asked him if he had no headquarters no likely said he he says he is writing his memoirs which will be interesting he once met borrow they boxed and geordie says the old man chuckling gave me the damnedest hiding of wordsworth he remarked he wasnae sound in the faith sir and a milkblooded bluespectacled bitch forbye but his pomes are grandtheres no denying that i asked him what his book was i havenae mind said hethat was his only book on turning it out i found it was one of my own and on showing it to him he remembered it at once o aye he said i mind now its pretty bad yell have to do better than that chieldy and chuckled chuckled he is a strange old figure to be sure he cannot endure pirbright smitha mere Ã¦sthatic he said pooh fishin and releegionthese are my aysthatics he wound up  i thought this would interest you so scribbled it down i still hope to get more out of him about hazlitt though he utterly poohpoohed the idea of writing hs life ma life now he said theres been queer things in
