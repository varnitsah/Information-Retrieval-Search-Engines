22485337	the trespasser  by d h lawrence    1912    chapter 1   take off that mute do cried louisa snatching her fingers from the piano keys and turning abruptly to the violinist  helena looked slowly from her music  my dear louisa she replied it would be simply unendurable she stood tapping her white skirt with her bow in a kind of a pathetic forbearance  but i cant understand it cried louisa bouncing on her chair with the exaggeration of one who is indignant with a beloved it is only lately you would even submit to muting your violin at one time you would have refused flatly and no doubt about it  i have only lately submitted to many things replied helena who seemed weary and stupefied but still sententious louisa drooped from her bristling defiance  at any rate she said scolding in tones too naked with love i dont like it  go on from allegro said helena pointing with her bow to the place on louisas score of the mozart sonata louisa obediently took the chords and the music continued  a young man reclining in one of the wicker armchairs by the fire turned luxuriously from the girls to watch the flames poise and dance with the music he was evidently at his ease yet he seemed a stranger in the room  it was the sittingroom of a mean house standing in line with hundreds of others of the same kind along a wide road in south london now and again the trams hummed by but the room was foreign to the trams and to the sound of the london traffic it was helenas room for which she was responsible the walls were of the deadgreen colour of august foliage the green carpet with its border of polished floor lay like a square of grass in a setting of black loam ceiling and frieze and fireplace were smooth white there was no other colouring  the furniture excepting the piano had a transitory look two light wicker armchairs by the fire the two frail stands of dark polished wood the couple of flimsy chairs and the case of books in the recessall seemed uneasy as if they might be tossed out to leave the room clear with its green floor and walls and its white rim of skirtingboard serene  on the mantlepiece were white lustres and a small soapstone buddha from china grey impassive locked in his renunciation besides these two tablets of translucent stone beautifully clouded with rose and blood and carved with chinese symbols then a litter of mementoes rockcrystals and shells and scraps of seaweed  a stranger entering felt at a loss he looked at the bare wallspaces of dark green at the scanty furniture and was assured of his unwelcome the only objects of sympathy in the room were the white lamp that glowed on a stand near the wall and the large beautiful fern with narrow fronds which ruffled its cloud of green within the gloom of the windowbay these only with the fire seemed friendly  the three candles on the dark piano burned softly the music fluttered on but like numbed butterflies stupidly helena played mechanically she broke the music beneath her bow so that it came lifeless very hurting to hear the young man frowned and pondered uneasily he turned again to the players  the violinist was a girl of twentyeight her white dress highwaisted swung as she forced the rhythm determinedly swaying to the time as if her body were the white stroke of a metronome it made the young man frown as he watched yet he continued to watch she had a very strong vigorous body her neck pure white arched in strength from the fine hollow between her shoulders as she held the violin the long white lace of her sleeve swung floated after the bow  byrne could not see her face more than the full curve of her cheek he watched her hair which at the back was almost of the colour of the soapstone idol take the candlelight into its vigorous freedom in front and glisten over her forehead  suddenly helena broke off the music and dropped her arm in irritable resignation louisa looked round from the piano surprised  why she cried wasnt it all right  helena laughed wearily  it was all wrong she answered as she put her violin tenderly to rest  oh im sorry i did so badly said louisa in a huff she loved helena passionately  you didnt do badly at all replied her friend in the same tired apathetic tone it was i  when she had closed the black lid of her violincase helena stood a moment as if at a loss louisa looked up with eyes full of affection like a dog that did not dare to move to her beloved getting no response she drooped over the piano at length helena looked at her friend then slowly closed her eyes the burden of this excessive affection was too much for her smiling faintly she said as if she were coaxing a child  play some chopin louisa  i shall only do that all wrong like everything else said the elder plaintively louisa was thirtyfive she had been helenas friend for years  play the mazurkas repeated helena calmly  louisa rummaged among the music helena blew out her violincandle and came to sit down on the side of the fire opposite to byrne the music began helena pressed her arms with her hands musing  they are inflamed still said the young man  she glanced up suddenly her blue eyes usually so heavy and tired lighting up with a small smile  yes she answered and she pushed back her sleeve revealing a fine strong arm which was scarlet on the outer side from shoulder to wrist like some long redburned fruit the girl laid her cheek on the smarting soft flesh caressively  it is quite hot she smiled again caressing her sunscalded arm with peculiar joy  funny to see a sunburn like that in midwinter he replied frowning i cant think why it should last all these months dont you ever put anything on to heal it  she smiled at him again almost pitying then put her mouth lovingly on the burn  it comes out every evening like this she said softly with curious joy  and that was august and now its february he exclaimed it must be psychological you know you make it comethe smart you invoke it  she looked up at him suddenly cold  i i never think of it she answered briefly with a kind of sneer  the young mans blood ran back from her at her acid tone but the mortification was physical only smiling quickly gently  never he reechoed  there was silence between them for some moments whilst louisa continued to play the piano for their benefit at last  drat it she exclaimed flouncing round on the pianostool  the two looked up at her  ye did run wellwhat hath hindered you laughed byrne  you cried louisa oh i cant play any more she added dropping her arms along her skirt pathetically helena laughed quickly  oh i cant helen pleaded louisa  my dear said helena laughing briefly you are really under no obligation whatever  with the little groan of one who yields to a desire contrary to her selfrespect louisa dropped at the feet of helena laid her arm and her head languishingly on the knee of her friend the latter gave no sign but continued to gaze in the fire byrne on the other side of the hearth sprawled in his chair smoking a reflective cigarette  the room was very quiet silent even of the tick of a clock outside the traffic swept by and feet pattered along the pavement but this vulgar storm of life seemed shut out of helenas room that remained indifferent like a church two candles burned dimly as on an altar glistening yellow on the dark piano the lamp was blown out and the flameless fire a red rubble dwindled in the grate so that the yellow glow of the candles seemed to shine even on the embers still no one spoke  at last helena shivered slightly in her chair though did not change her position she sat motionless  will you make coffee louisa she asked louisa lifted herself looked at her friend and stretched slightly  oh she groaned voluptuously this is so comfortable  dont trouble then ill go no dont get up said helena trying to disengage herself louisa reached and put her hands on helenas wrists  i will go she drawled almost groaning with voluptuousness and appealing love  then as helena still made movements to rise the elder woman got up slowly leaning as she did so all her weight on her friend  where is the coffee she asked affecting the dullness of lethargy she was full of small affectations being consumed with uneasy love  i think my dear replied helena it is in its usual place  ohoooh yawned louisa and she dragged herself out  the two had been intimate friends for years had slept together and played together and lived together now the friendship was coming to an end  after all said byrne when the door was closed if youre alive youve got to live  helena burst into a titter of amusement at this sudden remark  wherefore she asked indulgently  because theres no such thing as passive existence he replied grinning  she curled her lip in amused indulgence of this very young man  i dont see it at all she said  you cant he protested any more than a tree can help budding in aprilit cant help itself if its alive same with you  well thenand again there was the touch of a sneerif i cant help myself why trouble my friend  becausebecause i suppose i cant help myselfif it bothers me it does you see ihe smiled brilliantlyam april  she paid very little attention to him but began in a peculiar reedy metallic tone that set his nerves quivering  but i am not a bare tree all my dead leaves they hang to meandand go through a kind of danse macabre  but you bud underneathlike beech he said quickly  really my friend she said coldly i am too tired to bud  no he pleaded no with his thick brows knitted he surveyed her anxiously she had received a great blow in august and she still was stunned her face white and heavy was like a mask almost sullen she looked in the fire forgetting him  you want march he saidhe worried endlessly over herto rip off your old leaves i sll have to be march he laughed  she ignored him again because of his presumption he waited awhile then broke out once more  you must start againyou must always you rustle your red leaves of a blasted summer you are not dead even if you want to be youre not even if its a bitter thing to say you have to say it you are not dead  smiling a peculiar painful smile as if he hurt her she turned to gaze at a photograph that hung over the piano it was the profile of a handsome man in the prime of life he was leaning slightly forward as if yielding beneath a burden of life or to the pull of fate he looked out musingly and there was no hint of rebellion in the contours of the regular features the hair was brushed back soft and thick straight from his fine brow his nose was small and shapely his chin rounded cleft rather beautifully moulded byrne gazed also at the photo his look became distressed and helpless  you cannot say you are dead with siegmund he cried brutally she shuddered clasped her burning arms on her breast and looked into the fire you are not dead with siegmund he persisted so you cant say you live with him you may live with his memory but siegmund is dead and his memory is not hehimself he made a fierce gesture of impatience siegmund nowhe is not a memoryhe is not your dead red leaveshe is siegmund dead and you do not know him because you are alive like me so siegmund dead is a stranger to you  with her head bowed down cowering like a sulky animal she looked at him under her brows he stared fiercely back at her but beneath her steady glowering gaze he shrank then turned aside  you stretch your hands blindly to the dead you look backwards no you never touch the thing he cried  i have the arms of louisa always round my neck came her voice like the cry of a cat she put her hands on her throat as if she must relieve an ache he saw her lip raised in a kind of disgust a revulsion from life she was very sick after the tragedy  he frowned and his eyes dilated  folk are good they are good for one you never have looked at them you would linger hours over a blue weed and let all the people down the road go by folks are better than a garden in full blossom  she watched him again a certain beauty in his speech and his passionate way roused her when she did not want to be roused when moving from her torpor was painful at last  you are merciless you know cecil she said  and i will be protested byrne flinging his hand at her she laughed softly wearily  for some time they were silent she gazed once more at the photograph over the piano and forgot all the present byrne spent for the time being was busy hunting for some lifeinterest to give her he ignored the simplestthat of lovebecause he was even more faithful than she to the memory of siegmund and blinder than most to his own heart  i do wish i had siegmunds violin she said quietly but with great intensity byrne glanced at her then away his heart beat sulkily his sanguine passionate spirit dropped and slouched under her contempt he also felt the jar heard the discord she made him sometimes pant with her own horror he waited full of hate and tasting of ashes for the arrival of louisa with the coffee    chapter 2   siegmunds violin desired of helena lay in its case beside siegmunds lean portmanteau in the white dust of the lumberroom in highgate it was worth twenty pounds but beatrice had not yet roused herself to sell it she kept the black case out of sight  siegmunds violin lay in the dark folded up as he had placed it for the last time with hasty familiar hands in its red silk shroud after two dead months the first string had snapped sharply striking the sensitive body of the instrument the second string had broken near christmas but no one had heard the faint moan of its going the violin lay mute in the dark a faint odour of must creeping over the smooth soft wood its twisted withered strings lay crisped from the anguish of breaking smothered under the silk folds the fragrance of siegmund himself with which the violin was steeped slowly changed into an odour of must  siegmund died out even from his violin he had infused it with his life till its fibres had been as the tissue of his own flesh grasping his violin he seemed to have his fingers on the strings of his heart and of the heart of helena it was his little beloved that drank his being and turned it into music and now siegmund was dead only an odour of must remained of him in his violin  it lay folded in silk in the dark waiting six months before it had longed for rest during the last nights of the season when siegmunds fingers had pressed too hard when siegmunds passion and joy and fear had hurt too the soft body of his little beloved the violin had sickened for rest on that last night of opera without pity siegmund had struck the closing phrases from the fiddle harsh in his impatience wild in anticipation  the curtain came down the great singers bowed and siegmund felt the spattering roar of applause quicken his pulse it was hoarse and savage and startling on his inflamed soul making him shiver with anticipation as if something had brushed his hot nakedness quickly with hands of habitual tenderness he put his violin away  the theatregoers were tired and life drained rapidly out of the operahouse the members of the orchestra rose laughing mingling their weariness with good wishes for the holiday with sly warning and suggestive advice pressing hands warmly ere they disbanded other years siegmund had lingered unwilling to take the long farewell of his associates of the orchestra other years he had left the operahouse with a little pain of regret now he laughed and took his comrades hands and bade farewells all distractedly and with impatience the theatre awesome now in its emptiness he left gladly hastening like a flame stretched level on the wind  with his black violincase he hurried down the street then halted to pity the flowers massed pallid under the gaslight of the markethall for himself the sea and the sunlight opened great spaces tomorrow the moon was full above the river he looked at it as a man in abstraction watches some clear thing then he came to a standstill it was useless to hurry to his train the traffic swung past the lamplight shone warm on all the golden faces but siegmund had already left the city his face was silver and shadows to the moon the river in its soft grey shaking golden sequins among the folds of its shadows fell open like a garment before him to reveal the white moonglitter brilliant as living flesh mechanically overcast with the reality of the moonlight he took his seat in the train and watched the moving of things he was in a kind of trance his consciousness seeming suspended the train slid out amongst lights and dark places siegmund watched the endless movement fascinated  this was one of the crises of his life for years he had suppressed his soul in a kind of mechanical despair doing his duty and enduring the rest then his soul had been softly enticed from its bondage now he was going to break free altogether to have at least a few days purely for his own joy this to a man of his integrity meant a breaking of bonds a severing of bloodties a sort of new birth in the excitement of this last night his life passed out of his control and he sat at the carriagewindow motionless watching things move  he felt busy within him a strong activity which he could not help slowly the body of his past the womb which had nourished him in one fashion for so many years was casting him forth he was trembling in all his being though he knew not with what all he could do now was to watch the lights go by and to let the translation of himself continue  when at last the train ran out into the full luminous night and siegmund saw the meadows deep in moonlight he quivered with a low anticipation the elms great grey shadows seemed to loiter in their cloaks across the pale fields he had not seen them so before the world was changing  the train stopped and with a little effort he rose to go home the night air was cool and sweet he drank it thirstily in the road again he lifted his face to the moon it seemed to help him in its brilliance amid the blonde heavens it seemed to transcend fretfulness it would front the waves with silver as they slid to the shore and helena looking along the coast waiting would lift her white hands with sudden joy he laughed and the moon hurried laughing alongside through the black masses of the trees  he had forgotten he was going home for this night the chill wetness of his little white gardengate reminded him and a frown came on his face as he closed the door and found himself in the darkness of the hall the sense of his fatigue came fully upon him it was an effort to go to bed nevertheless he went very quietly into the drawingroom there the moonlight entered and he thought the whiteness was helena he held his breath and stiffened then breathed again tomorrow he thought as he laid his violincase across the arms of a wicker chair but he had a physical feeling of the presence of helena in his shoulders he seemed to be aware of her quickly half lifting his arms he turned to the moonshine tomorrow he exclaimed quietly and he left the room stealthily for fear of disturbing the children  in the darkness of the kitchen burned a blue bud of light he quickly turned up the gas to a broad yellow flame and sat down at table he was tired excited and vexed with misgiving as he lay in his armchair he looked round with disgust  the table was spread with a dirty cloth that had great brown stains betokening children in front of him was a cup and saucer and a small plate with a knife laid across it the cheese on another plate was wrapped in a redbordered fringed cloth to keep off the flies which even then were crawling round on the sugar on the loaf on the cocoatin siegmund looked at his cup it was chipped and a stain had gone under the glaze so that it looked like the mark of a dirty mouth he fetched a glass of water  the room was drab and dreary the oilcloth was worn into a hole near the door boots and shoes of various sizes were scattered over the floor while the sofa was littered with childrens clothing in the black stove the ash lay dead on the range were chips of wood and newspapers and rubbish of papers and crusts of bread and crusts of breadandjam as siegmund walked across the floor he crushed two sweets underfoot he had to grope under sofa and dresser to find his slippers and he was in evening dress  it would be the same while ever beatrice was beatrice and siegmund her husband he ate his bread and cheese mechanically wondering why he was miserable why he was not looking forward with joy to the morrow as he ate he closed his eyes half wishing he had not promised helena half wishing he had no tomorrow  leaning back in his chair he felt something in the way it was a small teddybear and half of a strong white comb he grinned to himself this was the summary of his domestic lifea broken coarse comb a child crying because her hair was lugged a wife who had let the hair go till now when she had got into a temper to see the job through and then the teddybear pathetically cocking a black worsted nose and lifting absurd arms to him  he wondered why gwen had gone to bed without her pet she would want the silly thing the strong feeling of affection for his children came over him battling with something else he sank in his chair and gradually his baffled mind went dark he sat overcome with weariness and trouble staring blankly into the space his own stifling roused him straightening his shoulders he took a deep breath then relaxed again after a while he rose took the teddybear and went slowly to bed  gwen and marjory aged nine and twelve slept together in a small room it was fairly light he saw his favourite daughter lying quite uncovered her wilful head thrown back her mouth half open her black hair was tossed across the pillow he could see the action marjory snuggled under the sheet he placed the teddybear between the two girls  as he watched them he hated the children for being so dear to him either he himself must go under and drag on an existence he hated or they must suffer but he had agreed to spend this holiday with helena and meant to do so as he turned he saw himself like a ghost cross the mirror he looked back he peered at himself his hair still grew thick and dark from his brow he could not see the grey at the temples his eyes were dark and tender and his mouth under the black moustache was full of youth  he rose looked at the children frowned and went to his own small room he was glad to be shut alone in the little cubicle of darkness  outside the world lay in a glamorous pallor casting shadows that made the farm the trees the bulks of villas look like live creatures the same pallor went through all the night glistening on helena as she lay curled up asleep at the core of the glamour like the moon on the sea rocking backwards and forwards till it rocked her island as she slept she was so calm and full of her own assurance it was a great rest to be with her with her nothing mattered but love and the beauty of things he felt parched and starving she had rest and love like water and manna for him she was so strong in her selfpossession in her love of beautiful things and of dreams  the clock downstairs struck two  i must get to sleep he said  he dragged his portmanteau from beneath the bed and began to pack it when at last it was finished he shut it with a snap the click sounded final he stood up stretched himself and sighed  i am fearfully tired he said  but that was persuasive when he was undressed he sat in his pyjamas for some time rapidly beating his fingers on his knee  thirtyeight years old he said to himself and disconsolate as a child he began to muse of the morrow  when he seemed to be going to sleep he woke up to find thoughts labouring over his brain like bees on a hive recollections swift thoughts flew in and alighted upon him as wild geese swing down and take possession of a pond phrases from the opera tyrannized over him he played the rhythm with all his blood as he turned over in this torture he sighed and recognized a movement of the de beriot concerto which helena had played for her last lesson he found himself watching her as he had watched then felt again the wild impatience when she was wrong started again as amid the dipping and sliding of her bow he realized where his thoughts were going she was wrong he was hasty and he felt her blue eyes looking intently at him  both started as his daughter vera entered suddenly she was a handsome girl of nineteen crossing the room brushing helena as if she were a piece of furniture in the way vera had asked her father a question in a hard insulting tone then had gone out again just as if helena had not been in the room  helena stood fingering the score of pelléas when vera had gone she asked in the peculiar tone that made siegmund shiver  why do you consider the music of pelléas cold  siegmund had struggled to answer so they passed everything off without mention after helenas fashion ignoring all that might be humiliating and to her much was humiliating  for years she had come as pupil to siegmund first as a friend of the household then she and louisa went occasionally to whatever hall or theatre had siegmund in the orchestra so that shortly the three formed the habit of coming home together then helena had invited siegmund to her home then the three friends went walks together then the two went walks together whilst louisa sheltered them  helena had come to read his loneliness and the humiliation of his lot he had felt her blue eyes heavily steadily gazing into his soul and he had lost himself to her  that day three weeks before the end of the season when vera had so insulted helena the latter had said as she put on her coat looking at him all the while with heavy blue eyes i think siegmund i cannot come here any more your home is not open to me any longer he had writhed in confusion and humiliation as she pressed his hand closely and for a long time she said i will write to you then she left him  siegmund had hated his life that day soon she wrote a week later when he lay resting his head on her lap in richmond park she said  you are so tired siegmund she stroked his face and kissed him softly siegmund lay in the molten daze of love but helena was if it is not to debase the word virtuous an inconsistent virtue cruel and ugly for siegmund  you are so tired dear you must come away with me and rest the first week in august  his blood had leapt and whatever objections he raised such as having no money he allowed to be overridden he was going to helena to the isle of wight tomorrow  helena with her blue eyes so full of storm like the sea but also like the sea so eternally selfsufficient solitary with her thick white throat the strongest and most wonderful thing on earth and her small hands silken and light as windflowers would be his tomorrow along with the sea and the downs he clung to the exquisite flame which flooded him  but it died out and he thought of the return to london to beatrice and the children how would it be beatrice with her furious dark eyes and her black hair loosely knotted back came to his mind as she had been the previous day flaring with temper when he said to her  i shall be going away tomorrow for a few days holiday  she asked for detail some of which he gave then dissatisfied and inflamed she broke forth in her suspicion and her abuse and her contempt while two largeeyed children stood listening by siegmund hated his wife for drawing on him the grave cold looks of condemnation from his children  something he had said touched beatrice she came of good family had been brought up like a lady educated in a convent school in france he evoked her old pride she drew herself up with dignity and called the children away he wondered if he could bear a repetition of that degradation it bled him of his courage and selfrespect  in the morning beatrice was disturbed by the sharp sneck of the hall door immediately awake she heard his quick firm step hastening down the gravel path in her impotence discarded like a worn out object she lay for the moment stiff with bitterness  i am nothing i am nothing she said to herself she lay quite rigid for a time  there was no sound anywhere the morning sunlight pierced vividly through the slits of the blind beatrice lay rocking herself breathing hard her fingernails pressing into her palm then came the sound of a train slowing down in the station and directly the quick chuffchuffchuff of its drawing out beatrice imagined the sunlight on the puffs of steam and the two lovers her husband and helena rushing through the miles of morning sunshine  god strike her dead mother of god strike her down she said aloud in a low tone she hated helena  irene who lay with her mother woke up and began to question her    chapter 3   in the miles of morning sunshine siegmunds shadows his children beatrice his sorrow dissipated like mist and he was elated as a young man setting forth to travel when he had passed portsmouth town everything had vanished but the old gay world of romance he laughed as he looked out of the carriage window  below in the street a military band passed glittering a brave sound floated up and again he laughed loving the tune the clash and glitter of the band the movement of scarlet blithe soldiers beyond the park people were drifting brightly from church how could it be sunday it was no time it was romance going back to tristan  women like crocus flowers in white and blue and lavender moved gaily everywhere fluttered the small flags of holiday every form danced lightly in the sunshine  and beyond it all were the silent hillsides of the island with helena it was so wonderful he could bear to be patient she would be all in white with her cool thick throat left bare to the breeze her face shining smiling as she dipped her head because of the sun which glistened on her uncovered hair  he breathed deeply stirring at the thought but he would not grow impatient the train had halted over the town where scarlet soldiers and ludicrous blue sailors and all the brilliant women from church shook like a kaleidoscope down the street the train crawled on drawing near to the sea for which siegmund waited breathless it was so like helena blue beautiful strong in its reserve  another moment they were in the dirty station then the day flashed out and siegmund mated with joy he felt the sea heaving below him he looked round and the sea was blue as a periwinkle flower while gold and white and bloodred sails lit here and there upon the blueness standing on the deck he gave himself to the breeze and to the sea feeling like one of the ruddy sailsas if he were part of it all all his body radiated amid the large magnificent seamoon like a piece of colour  the little ship began to pulse to tremble white with the softness of a bosom the water rose up frothing and swaying gently ships drew near the inquisitive birds the old victory shook her myriad pointed flags of yellow and scarlet the straight old houses of the quay passed by  outside the harbour like fierce creatures of the sea come wildly up to look the battleships laid their black snouts on the water siegmund laughed at them he felt the foam on his face like a sparkling felt the blue sea gathering round  on the left stood the round fortress quaintly chequered and solidly alone in the walk of water amid the silent flight of the goldenand crimsonwinged boats  siegmund watched the bluish bulk of the island like the beautiful women in the myths his love hid in its blue haze it seemed impossible behind him the white wake trailed myriads of daisies on either hand the grim and wicked battleships watched along their sharp noses beneath him the clear green water swung and puckered as if it were laughing in front sieglindes island drew near and nearer creeping towards him bringing him helena  meadows and woods appeared houses crowded down to the shore to meet him he was in the quay and the ride was over siegmund regretted it but helena was on the island which rode like an anchored ship under the fleets of cloud that had launched whilst siegmund was on water as he watched the end of the pier loom higher large ponderous trains of cloud cast over him the shadows of their bulk and he shivered in the chill wind  his travelling was very slow the skys dark shipping pressed closer and closer as if all the clouds had come to harbour over the flat lands near newport the wind moaned like the calling of many violoncellos all the sky was grey siegmund waited drearily on newport station where the wind swept coldly it was sunday and the station and the island were desolate having lost their purposes  siegmund put on his overcoat and sat down all his mornings blaze of elation was gone though there still glowed a great hope he had slept only two hours of the night an empty man he had drunk joy and now the intoxication was dying out  at three oclock of the afternoon he sat alone in the secondclass carriage looking out a few raindrops struck the pane then the blurred dazzle of a shower came in a burst of wind and hid the downs and the reeds that shivered in the marshy places siegmund sat in a chilly torpor he counted the stations beneath his stupor his heart was thudding heavily with excitement surprising him for his brain felt dead  the train slowed down yarmouth one more station then siegmund watched the platform shiny with rain slide past on the dry grey under the shelter one white passenger was waiting suddenly siegmunds heart leaped up wrenching wildly he burst open the door and caught hold of helena she dilated gave a palpitating cry as he dragged her into the carriage  you here he exclaimed in a strange tone she was shivering with cold her almost naked arms were blue she could not answer siegmunds question but lay clasped against him shivering away her last chill as his warmth invaded her he laughed in his heart as she nestled in to him  is it a dream now dear he whispered helena clasped him tightly shuddering because of the delicious suffusing of his warmth through her  almost immediately they heard the grinding of the brakes  here we are then exclaimed helena dropping into her conventional cheerful manner at once she put straight her hat while he gathered his luggage  until teatime there was a pause in their progress siegmund was tingling with an exquisite vividness as if he had taken some rare stimulant he wondered at himself it seemed that every fibre in his body was surprised with joy as each tree in a forest at dawn utters astonished cries of delight  when helena came back she sat opposite to him to see him his naïve look of joy was very sweet to her his eyes were dark blue showing the fibrils like a purpleveined flower at twilight and somehow mysteriously joy seemed to quiver in the iris helena appreciated him feature by feature she liked his clear forehead with its thick black hair and his full mouth and his chin she loved his hands that were small but strong and nervous and very white she liked his breast that breathed so strong and quietly and his arms and his thighs and his knees  for him helena was a presence she was ambushed fused in an aura of his love he only saw she was white and strong and full fruited he only knew her blue eyes were rather awful to him  outside the seamist was travelling thicker and thicker inland their lodging was not far from the bay as they sat together at tea siegmunds eyes dilated and he looked frowning at helena  what is it he asked listening uneasily  helena looked up at him from pouring out the tea his little anxious look of distress amused her  the noise you mean merely the foghorn dearnot wotans wrath nor siegfrieds dragon  the fog was white at the window they sat waiting after a few seconds the sound came low swelling like the mooing of some great sea animal alone the last of the monsters the whole fog gave off the sound for a second or two then it died down into an intense silence siegmund and helena looked at each other his eyes were full of trouble to see a big strong man anxiouseyed as a child because of a strange sound amused her but he was tired  i assure you it is only a foghorn she laughed  of course but it is a depressing sort of sound  is it she said curiously why wellyesi think i can understand its being so to some people its something like the call of the horn across the sea to tristan  she hummed softly then three times she sang the horncall siegmund with his face expressionless as a mask sat staring out at the mist the boom of the siren broke in upon them to him the sound was full of fatality helena waited till the noise died down then she repeated her horncall  yet it is very much like the foghorn she said curiously interested  this time next week helena he said  she suddenly went heavy and stretched across to clasp his hand as it lay upon the table  i shall be calling to you from cornwall she said  he did not reply so often she did not take his meaning but left him alone with his sense of tragedy she had no idea how his life was wrenched from its roots and when he tried to tell her she balked him leaving him inwardly quite lonely  there is no next week she declared with great cheerfulness there is only the present  at the same moment she rose and slipped across to him putting her arms round his neck she stood holding his head to her bosom pressing it close with her hand among his hair his nostrils and mouth were crushed against her breast he smelled the silk of her dress and the faint intoxicating odour of her person with shut eyes he owned heavily to himself again that she was blind to him but some other self urged with gladness no matter how blind she was so that she pressed his face upon her  she stroked and caressed his hair tremblingly clasped his head against her breast as if she would never release him then she bent to kiss his forehead he took her in his arms and they were still for awhile  now he wanted to blind himself with her to blaze up all his past and future in a passion worth years of living  after tea they rested by the fire while she told him all the delightful things she had found she had a womans curious passion for details a womans peculiar attachment to certain dear trifles he listened smiling revived by her delight and forgetful of himself she soothed him like sunshine and filled him with pleasure but he hardly attended to her words  shall we go out or are you too tired no you are tiredyou are very tired said helena  she stood by his chair looking down on him tenderly  no he replied smiling brilliantly at her and stretching his handsome limbs in reliefno not at all tired now  helena continued to look down on him in quiet covering tenderness but she quailed before the brilliant questioning gaze of his eyes  you must go to bed early tonight she said turning aside her face ruffling his soft black hair he stretched slightly stiffening his arms and smiled without answering it was a very keen pleasure to be thus alone with her and in her charge he rose bidding her wrap herself up against the fog  you are sure youre not too tired she reiterated  he laughed  outside the seamist was white and woolly they went hand in hand it was cold so she thrust her hand with his into the pocket of his overcoat while they walked together  i like the mist he said pressing her hand in his pocket  i dont dislike it she replied shrinking nearer to him  it puts us together by ourselves he said she plodded alongside bowing her head not replying he did not mind her silence  it couldnt have happened better for us than this mist he said  she laughed curiously almost with a sound of tears  why she asked half tenderly half bitterly  there is nothing else but you and for you there is nothing else but melook  he stood still they were on the downs so that helena found herself quite alone with the man in a world of mist suddenly she flung herself sobbing against his breast he held her closely tenderly not knowing what it was all about but happy and unafraid  in one hollow place the siren from the needles seemed to bellow full in their ears both siegmund and helena felt their emotion too intense they turned from it  what is the pitch asked helena  where it is horizontal it slides up a chromatic scale said siegmund  yes but the settled pitchis it about e  e exclaimed siegmund more like f  nay listen said helena  they stood still and waited till there came the long booing of the foghorn  there exclaimed siegmund imitating the sound that is not e he repeated the sound it is f  surely it is e persisted helena  even f sharp he rejoined humming the note  she laughed and told him to climb the chromatic scale  but you agree he said  i do not she replied  the fog was cold it seemed to rob them of their courage to talk  what is the note in tristan helena made an effort to ask  that is not the same he replied  no dear that is not the same she said in low comforting tones he quivered at the caress she put her arms round him reached up her face yearningly for a kiss he forgot they were standing in the public footpath in daylight till she drew hastily away she heard footsteps down the fog  as they climbed the path the mist grew thinner till it was only a grey haze at the top there they were on the turfy lip of the land the sky was fairly clear overhead below them the sea was singing hoarsely to itself  helena drew him to the edge of the cliff he crushed her hand drawing slightly back but it pleased her to feel the grip on her hand becoming unbearable they stood right on the edge to see the smooth cliff slope into the mist under which the sea stirred noisily  shall we walk over then said siegmund glancing downwards helenas heart stood still a moment at the idea then beat heavily how could he play with the idea of death and the five great days in front she was afraid of him just then  come away dear she pleaded  he would then forgo the few consummate days it was bitterness to her to think so  come away dear she repeated drawing him slowly to the path  you are not afraid he asked  not afraid no her voice had that peculiar reedy harsh quality that made him shiver  it is too easy a way he said satirically  she did not take in his meaning  and five days of our own before us siegmund she scolded the mist is lethe it is enough for us if its spell lasts five days  he laughed and took her in his arms kissing her very closely  they walked on joyfully locking behind them the doors of forgetfulness  as the sun set the fog dispersed a little breaking masses of mist went flying from cliff to cliff and far away beyond the cliffs the western sky stood dimmed with gold the lovers wandered aimlessly over the golflinks to where green mounds and turfed banks suggested to helena that she was tired and would sit down they faced the lighted chamber of the west whence behind the torn dullgold curtains of fog the sun was departing with pomp  siegmund sat very still watching the sunset it was a splendid flaming bridal chamber where he had come to helena he wondered how to express it how other men had borne this same glory  what is the music of it he asked  she glanced at him his eyelids were half lowered his mouth slightly open as if in ironic rhapsody  of what dear  what music do you think holds the best interpretation of sunset  his skin was gold his real mood was intense she revered him for a moment  i do not know she said quietly and she rested her head against his shoulder looking out west  there was a space of silence while siegmund dreamed on  a beethoven symphonythe one and he explained to her  she was not satisfied but leaned against him making her choice the sunset hung steady she could scarcely perceive a change  the grail music in lohengrin she decided  yes said siegmund he found it quite otherwise but did not trouble to dispute he dreamed by himself this displeased her she wanted him for herself how could he leave her alone while he watched the sky she almost put her two hands over his eyes    chapter 4   the gold march of sunset passed quickly the ragged curtains of mist closed to soon siegmund and helena were shut alone within the dense wide fog she shivered with the cold and the damp startled he took her in his arms where she lay and clung to him holding her closely he bent forward straight to her lips his moustache was drenched cold with fog so that she shuddered slightly after his kiss and shuddered again he did not know why the strong tremor passed through her thinking it was with fear and with cold he undid his overcoat put her close on his breast and covered her as best he could that she feared him at that moment was half pleasure half shame to him pleadingly he hid his face on her shoulder held her very tightly till his face grew hot buried against her soft strong throat  you are so big i cant hold you she whispered plaintively catching her breath with fear her small hands grasped at the breadth of his shoulders ineffectually  you will be cold put your hands under my coat he whispered  he put her inside his overcoat and his coat she came to his warm breast with a sharp intaking of delight and fear she tried to make her hands meet in the warmth of his shoulders tried to clasp him  see i cant she whispered  he laughed short and pressed her closer  then tucking her head in his breast hiding her face she timidly slid her hands along his sides pressing softly to find the contours of his figure softly her hands crept over the silky back of his waistcoat under his coats and as they stirred his blood flushed up and up again with fire till all siegmund was hot blood and his breast was one great ache  he crushed her to himcrushed her in upon the ache of his chest his muscles set hard and unyielding at that moment he was a tense vivid body of flesh without a mind his blood alive and conscious running towards her he remained perfectly still locked about helena conscious of nothing  she was hurt and crushed but it was pain delicious to her it was marvellous to her how strong he was to keep up that grip of her like steel she swooned in a kind of intense bliss at length she found herself released taking a great breath while siegmund was moving his mouth over her throat something like a dog snuffing her but with his lips her heart leaped away in revulsion his moustache thrilled her strangely his lips brushing and pressing her throat beneath the ear and his warm breath flying rhythmically upon her made her vibrate through all her body like a violin under the bow she thrilled beneath his mouth and shuddered from his moustache her heart was like fire in her breast  suddenly she strained madly to him and drawing back her head placed her lips on his close till at the mouth they seemed to melt and fuse together it was the long supreme kiss in which man and woman have one being twoinone the only hermaphrodite  when helena drew away her lips she was exhausted she belonged to that class of dreaming women with whom passion exhausts itself at the mouth her desire was accomplished in a real kiss the fire in heavy flames had poured through her to siegmund from siegmund to her it sank and she felt herself flagging she had not the mans brightness and vividness of blood she lay upon his breast dreaming how beautiful it would be to go to sleep to swoon unconscious there on that rare bed she lay still on siegmunds breast listening to his heavily beating heart  with her the dream was always more than the actuality her dream of siegmund was more to her than siegmund himself he might be less than her dream which is as it may be however to the real man she was very cruel  he held her close his dream was melted in his blood and his blood ran bright for her his dreams were the flowers of his blood hers were more detached and inhuman for centuries a certain type of woman has been rejecting the animal in humanity till now her dreams are abstract and full of fantasy and her blood runs in bondage and her kindness is full of cruelty  helena lay flagging upon the breast of siegmund he folded her closely and his mouth and his breath were warm on her neck she sank away from his caresses passively subtly drew back from him he was far too sensitive not to be aware of this and far too much of a man not to yield to the woman his heart sank his blood grew sullen at her withdrawal still he held her the two were motionless and silent for some time  she became distressedly conscious that her feet which lay on the wet grass were aching with cold she said softly gently as if he was her child whom she must correct and lead  i think we ought to go home siegmund he made a small sound that might mean anything but did not stir or release her his mouth however remained motionless on her throat and the caress went out of it  it is cold and wet dear we ought to go she coaxed determinedly  soon he said thickly  she sighed waited a moment then said very gently as if she were loath to take him from his pleasure  siegmund i am cold  there was a reproach in this which angered him  cold he exclaimed but you are warm with me  but my feet are out on the grass dear and they are like wet pebbles  oh dear he said why didnt you give them me to warm he leaned forward and put his hand on her shoes  they are very cold he said we must hurry and make them warm  when they rose her feet were so numbed she could hardly stand she clung to siegmund laughing  i wish you had told me before he said i ought to have known  vexed with himself he put his arm round her and they set off home    chapter 5   they found the fire burning brightly in their room the only other person in the pretty stifflyfurnished cottage was their landlady a charming old lady who let this sittingroom more for the change for the sake of having visitors than for gain  helena introduced siegmund as my friend the old lady smiled upon him he was big and goodlooking and embarrassed she had had a son years back and the two were lovers she hoped they would come to her house for their honeymoon  siegmund sat in his great horsehair chair by the fire while helena attended to the lamp glancing at him over the glowing globe she found him watching her with a small peculiar smile of irony and anger and bewilderment he was not quite himself her hand trembled so she could scarcely adjust the wicks  helena left the room to change her dress  i shall be back before mrs curtiss brings in the tray there is the nietzsche i brought  he did not answer as he watched her go left alone he sat with his arms along his knees perfectly still his heart beat heavily and all his being felt sullen watchful aloof like a balked animal thoughts came up in his brain like bubblesrandom hissing out aimlessly once in the startling inflammability of his blood his veins ran hot and he smiled  when helena entered the room his eyes sought hers swiftly as sparks lighting on the tinder but her eyes were only moist with tenderness his look instantly changed she wondered at his being so silent so strange  coming to him in her unhesitating womanly wayshe was only twentysix to his thirtyeightshe stood before him holding both his hands and looking down on him with almost gloomy tenderness she wore a white dress that showed her throat gathering like a fountainjet of solid foam to balance her head he could see the full white arms passing clear through the dripping spume of lace towards the rise of her breasts but her eyes bent down upon him with such gloom of tenderness that he dared not reveal the passion burning in him he could not look at her he strove almost pitifully to be with her sad tender but he could not put out his fire she held both his hands firm pressing them in appeal for her dream love he glanced at her wistfully then turned away she waited for him she wanted his caresses and tenderness he would not look at her  you would like supper now dear she asked looking where the dark hair ended and his neck ran smooth under his collar to the strong setting of his shoulders  just as you will he replied  still she waited and still he would not look at her something troubled him she thought he was foreign to her  i will spread the cloth then she said in deep tones of resignation she pressed his hands closely and let them drop he took no notice but still with his arms on his knees he stared into the fire  in the golden glow of lamplight she set small bowls of white and lavender sweetpeas and mignonette upon the round table he watched her moving saw the stir of her white sloping shoulders under the lace and the hollow of her shoulders firm as marble and the slight rise and fall of her loins as she walked he felt as if his breast were scalded it was a physical pain to him  supper was very quiet helena was sad and gentle he had a peculiar enigmatic look in his eyes between suffering and mockery and love he was quite intractable he would not soften to her but remained there aloof he was tired and the look of weariness and suffering was evident to her through his strangeness in her heart she wept  at last she tinkled the bell for supper to be cleared meanwhile restlessly she played fragments of wagner on the piano  will you want anything else asked the smiling old landlady  nothing at all thanks said helena with decision  oh then i think i will go to bed when ive washed the dishes you will put the lamp out dear  i am well used to a lamp smiled helena we use them always at home  she had had a day before siegmunds coming in which to win mrs curtiss heart and she had been successful the old lady took the tray  goodnight deargoodnight sir i will leave you you will not be long dear  no we shall not be long mr macnair is very evidently tired out  yesyes it is very tiring london  when the door was closed helena stood a moment undecided looking at siegmund he was lying in his armchair in a dispirited way and looking in the fire as she gazed at him with troubled eyes he happened to glance to her with the same dark curiously searching disappointed eyes  shall i read to you she asked bitterly  if you will he replied  he sounded so indifferent she could scarcely refrain from crying she went and stood in front of him looking down on him heavily  what is it dear she said  you he replied smiling with a little grimace  why me  he smiled at her ironically then closed his eyes she slid into his arms with a little moan he took her on his knee where she curled up like a heavy white cat she let him caress her with his mouth and did not move but lay there curled up and quiet and luxuriously warm  he kissed her hair which was beautifully fragrant of itself and time after time drew between his lips one long keen thread as if he would ravel out with his mouth her vigorous confusion of hair his tenderness of love was like a soft flame lapping her voluptuously  after a while they heard the old lady go upstairs helena went very still and seemed to contract siegmund himself hesitated in his lovemaking all was very quiet they could hear the faint breathing of the sea presently the cat which had been sleeping in a chair rose and went to the door  shall i let her out said siegmund  do said helena slipping from his knee she goes out when the nights are fine  siegmund rose to set free the tabby hearing the front door open mrs curtiss called from upstairs is that you dear  i have just let kitty out said siegmund  ah thank you good night they heard the old lady lock her bedroom door  helena was kneeling on the hearth siegmund softly closed the door then waited a moment his heart was beating fast  shall we sit by firelight he asked tentatively  yesif you wish she replied very slowly as if against her will he carefully turned down the lamp then blew out the light his whole body was burning and surging with desire  the room was black and red with firelight helena shone ruddily as she knelt a bright bowed figure full in the glow now and then red stripes of firelight leapt across the walls siegmund his face ruddy advanced out of the shadows  he sat in the chair beside her leaning forward his hands hanging like two scarlet flowers listless in the fire glow near to her as she knelt on the hearth with head bowed down one of the flowers awoke and spread towards her it asked for her mutely she was fascinated scarcely able to move  come he pleaded softly  she turned lifted her hands to him the lace fell back and her arms bare to the shoulder shone rosily he saw her breasts raised towards him her face was bent between her arms as she looked up at him afraid lit by the firelight in her white clinging dress cowering between her uplifted arms she seemed to be offering him herself to sacrifice  in an instant he was kneeling and she was lying on his shoulder abandoned to him there was a good deal of sorrow in his joy                                       it was eleven oclock when helena at last loosened siegmunds arms and rose from the armchair where she lay beside him she was very hot feverish and restless for the last halfhour he had lain absolutely still with his heavy arms about her making her hot if she had not seen his eyes blue and dark she would have thought him asleep she tossed in restlessness on his breast  am i not uneasy she had said to make him speak he had smiled gently  it is wonderful to be as still as this he said she had lain tranquil with him then for a few moments to her there was something sacred in his stillness and peace she wondered at him he was so different from an hour ago how could he be the same now he was like the sea blue and hazy in the morning musing by itself before he was burning volcanic as if he would destroy her  she had given him this new soft beauty she was the earth in which his strange flowers grew but she herself wondered at the flowers produced of her he was so strange to her so different from herself what next would he ask of her what new blossom would she rear in him then he seemed to grow and flower involuntarily she merely helped to produce him  helena could not keep still her body was full of strange sensations of involuntary recoil from shock she was tired but restless all the time siegmund lay with his hot arms over her himself so incomprehensible in his base of blue openeyed slumber she grew more breathless and unbearable to herself  at last she lifted his arm and drew herself out of the chair siegmund looked at her from his tranquillity she put the damp hair from her forehead breathed deep almost panting then she glanced hauntingly at her flushed face in the mirror with the same restlessness she turned to look at the night the cool dark watery sea called to her she pushed back the curtain  the moon was wading deliciously through shallows of white cloud beyond the trees and the few houses was the great concave of darkness the sea and the moonlight the moon was there to put a cool hand of absolution on her brow  shall we go out a moment siegmund she asked fretfully  ay if you wish to he answered altogether willing he was filled with an easiness that would comply with her every wish  they went out softly walked in silence to the bay there they stood at the head of the white living moonpath where the water whispered at the casement of the land seductively  its the finest night i have seen said siegmund helenas eyes suddenly filled with tears at his simplicity of happiness  i like the moon on the water she said  i can hardly tell the one from the other he replied simply the sea seems to be poured out of the moon and rocking in the hands of the coast they are all one just as your eyes and hands and what you say are all you  yes she answered thrilled this was the siegmund of her dream and she had created him yet there was a quiver of pain he was beyond her now and did not need her  i feel at home here he said as if i had come home where i was bred  she pressed his hand hard clinging to him  we go an awful long way round helena he said just to find were all right he laughed pleasantly i have thought myself such an outcast how can one be outcast in ones own night and the moon always naked to us and the sky half her time in rags what do we want  helena did not know nor did she know what he meant but she felt something of the harmony  whatever i have or havent from now he continued the darkness is a sort of mother and the moon a sister and the stars children and sometimes the sea is a brother and theres a family in one house you see  and i siegmund she said softly taking him in all seriousness she looked up at him piteously he saw the silver of tears among the moonlit ivory of her face his heart tightened with tenderness and he laughed then bent to kiss her  the key of the castle he said he put his face against hers and felt on his cheek the smart of her tears  its all very grandiose he said comfortably but it does for tonight all this that i say  it is true for ever she declared  in so far as tonight is eternal he said  he remained with the wetness of her cheek smarting on his looking from under his brows at the white transport of the water beneath the moon they stood folded together gazing into the white heart of the night    chapter 6   siegmund woke with wonder in the morning it is like the magic tales he thought as he realized where he was and i am transported to a new life to realize my dream fairytales are true after all  he had slept very deeply so that he felt strangely new he issued with delight from the dark of sleep into the sunshine reaching out his hand he felt for his watch it was seven oclock the dew of a sleepdrenched night glittered before his eyes then he laughed and forgot the night  the creeper was tapping at the window as a little wind blew up the sunshine siegmund put out his hands for the unfolding happiness of the morning helena was in the next room which she kept inviolate sparrows in the creeper were shaking shadows of leaves among the sunshine milkwhite shallop of cloud stemmed bravely across the bright sky the sea would be blossoming with a dewy shimmer of sunshine  siegmund rose to look and it was so also the houses like white and red and black cattle were wandering down the bay with a mist of sunshine between him and them he leaned with his hands on the windowledge looking out of the casement the breeze ruffled his hair blew down the neck of his sleepingjacket upon his chest he laughed hastily threw on his clothes and went out  there was no sign of helena he strode along singing to himself and spinning his towel rhythmically a small path led him across a field and down a zigzag in front of the cliffs some nooks sheltered from the wind were warm with sunshine scented of honeysuckle and of thyme he took a sprig of woodbine that was coloured of cream and butter the grass wetted his brown shoes and his flannel trousers again a fresh breeze put the scent of the sea in his uncovered hair the cliff was a tangle of flowers above and below with poppies at the lip being blown out like red flame and scabious leaning inquisitively to look down and pink and white restharrow everywhere very pretty  siegmund stood at a bend where heath blossomed in shaggy lilac where the sunshine but no wind came he saw the blue bay curl away to the faroff headland a few birds white and small circled dipped by the thin foamedge of the water a few ships dimmed the sea with silent travelling a few small people dark or nakedwhite moved below the swinging birds  he chose his bathingplace where the incoming tide had half covered a stretch of fair bright sand that was studded with rocks resembling square altars hollowed on top he threw his clothes on a high rock it delighted him to feel the fresh soft fingers of the wind touching him and wandering timidly over his nakedness he ran laughing over the sand to the sea where he waded in thrusting his legs noisily through the heavy green water  it was cold and he shrank for a moment he found himself thighdeep watching the horizontal stealing of a ship through the intolerable glitter afraid to plunge laughing he went under the clear green water  he was a poor swimmer sometimes a choppy wave swamped him and he rose gasping wringing the water from his eyes and nostrils while he heaved and sank with the rocking of the waves that clasped his breast then he stooped again to resume his game with the sea it is splendid to play even at middle age and the sea is a fine partner  with his eyes at the shining level of the water he liked to peer across taking a seals view of the cliffs as they confronted the morning he liked to see the ships standing up on a bright floor he liked to see the birds come down  but in his playing he drifted towards the spur of rock where as he swam he caught his thigh on a sharp submerged point he frowned at the pain at the sudden cruelty of the sea then he thought no more of it but ruffled his way back to the clear water busily continuing his play  when he ran out on to the fair sand his heart and brain and body were in a turmoil he panted filling his breast with the air that was sparkled and tasted of the sea as he shuddered a little the wilful palpitations of his flesh pleased him as if birds had fluttered against him he offered his body to the morning glowing with the seas passion the wind nestled in to him the sunshine came on his shoulders like warm breath he delighted in himself  the rock before him was white and wet like himself it had a pool of clear water with shells and one rose anemone  she would make so much of this little pool he thought and as he smiled he saw very faintly his own shadow in the water it made him conscious of himself seeming to look at him he glanced at himself at his handsome white maturity as he looked he felt the insidious creeping of blood down his thigh which was marked with a long red slash siegmund watched the blood travel over the bright skin it wound itself redly round the rise of his knee  that is i that creeping red and this whiteness i pride myself on is i and my black hair and my blue eyes are i it is a weird thing to be a person what makes me myself among all these  feeling chill he wiped himself quickly  i am at my best at my strongest he said proudly to himself she ought to be rejoiced at me but she is not she rejects me as if i were a baboon under my clothing  he glanced at his whole handsome maturity the firm plating of his breasts the full thighs creatures proud in themselves only he was marred by the long raw scratch which he regretted deeply  if i was giving her myself i wouldnt want that blemish on me he thought  he wiped the blood from the wound it was nothing  she thinks ten thousand times more of that little pool with a bit of pink anemone and some yellow weed than of me but by jove id rather see her shoulders and breast than all heaven and earth put together could show why doesnt she like me he thought as he dressed it was his physical self thinking  after dabbling his feet in a warm pool he returned home helena was in the diningroom arranging a bowl of purple pansies she looked up at him rather heavily as he stood radiant on the threshold he put her at her ease it was a gay handsome boy she had to meet not a man strange and insistent she smiled on him with tender dignity  you have bathed she said smiling and looking at his damp ruffled black hair she shrank from his eyes but he was quite unconscious  you have not bathed he said then bent to kiss her she smelt the brine in his hair  no i bathe later she replied but what  hesitating she touched the towel then looked up at him anxiously  it is blood she said  i grazed my thighnothing at all he replied  are you sure  he laughed  the towel looks bad enough she said  its an alarmist he laughed  she looked in concern at him then turned aside  breakfast is quite ready she said  and i for breakfastbut shall i do  she glanced at him he was without a collar so his throat was bare above the neckband of his flannel shirt altogether she disapproved of his slovenly appearance he was usually so smart in his dress  i would not trouble she said almost sarcastically  whistling he threw the towel on a chair  how did you sleep she asked gravely as she watched him beginning to eat  like the deadsolid he replied and you  oh pretty well thanks she said rather piqued that he had slept so deeply whilst she had tossed and had called his name in a torture of sleeplessness  i havent slept like that for years he said enthusiastically helena smiled gently on him the charm of his handsome healthy zest came over her she liked his naked throat and his shirtbreast which suggested the breast of the man beneath it she was extraordinarily happy with him so bright the darkfaced pansies in a little crowd seemed gaily winking a golden eye at her  after breakfast while siegmund dressed she went down to the sea she dwelled as she passed on all tiny pretty thingson the barbaric yellow ragwort and pink convolvuli on all the twinkling of flowers and dew and snailtracks drying in the sun her walk was one long lingering more than the spaces she loved the nooks and fancy more than imagination  she wanted to see just as she pleased without any of humanitys previous vision for spectacles so she knew hardly any flowers name nor perceived any of the relationships nor cared a jot about an adaptation or a modification it pleased her that the lowest browny florets of the clover hung down she cared no more she clothed everything in fancy  that yellow flower hadnt time to be brushed and combed by the fairies before dawn came it is tousled  so she thought to herself the pink convolvuli were fairy horns or telephones from the day fairies to the night fairies the rippling sunlight on the sea was the rhine maidens spreading their bright hair to the sun that was her favourite form of thinking the value of all things was in the fancy they evoked she did not care for people they were vulgar ugly and stupid as a rule  her sense of satisfaction was complete as she leaned on the low seawall spreading her fingers to warm on the stones concocting magic out of the simple morning she watched the indolent chasing of wavelets round the small rocks the curling of the deep blue water round the watershadowed reefs  this is very good she said to herself this is eternally cool and clean and fresh it could never be spoiled by satiety  she tried to wash herself with the white and blue morning to clear away the soiling of the last nights passion  the sea played by itself intent on its own game its aloofness its selfsufficiency are its great charm the sea does not give and take like the land and the sky it has no traffic with the world it spends its passion upon itself helena was something like the sea selfsufficient and careless of the rest  siegmund came bareheaded his black hair ruffling to the wind his eyes shining warmer than the sealike cornflowers rather his limbs swinging backward and forward like the water together they leaned on the wall warming the four white hands upon the grey bleached stone as they watched the water playing  when siegmund had helena near he lost the ache the yearning towards something which he always felt otherwise she seemed to connect him with the beauty of things as if she were the nerve through which he received intelligence of the sun and wind and sea and of the moon and the darkness beauty she never felt herself came to him through her it is that makes love he could always sympathize with the wistful little flowers and trees lonely in their crowds and wild sad seabirds in these things he recognized the great yearning the ache outwards towards something with which he was ordinarily burdened but with helena in this large seamorning he was whole and perfect as the day  will it be fine all day he asked when a cloud came over  i dont know she replied in her gentle inattentive manner as if she did not care at all i think it will be a mixed daycloud and sunmore sun than cloud  she looked up gravely to see if he agreed he turned from frowning at the cloud to smile at her he seemed so bright teeming with life  i like a bare blue sky he said sunshine that you seem to stir about as you walk  it is warm enough here even for you she smiled  ah here he answered putting his face down to receive the radiation from the stone letting his fingers creep towards helenas she laughed and captured his fingers pressing them into her hand for nearly an hour they remained thus in the still sunshine by the seawall till helena began to sigh and to lift her face to the little breeze that wandered down from the west she fled as soon from warmth as from cold physically she was always so she shrank from anything extreme but psychically she was an extremist and a dangerous one  they climbed the hill to the freshbreathing west on the highest point of land stood a tall cross railed in by a red iron fence they read the inscription  thats all rightbut a vilely ugly railing exclaimed siegmund  oh theyd have to fence in lord tennysons white marble said helena rather indefinitely  he interpreted her according to his own idea  yes he did belittle great things didnt he said siegmund  tennyson she exclaimed  not peacocks and princesses but the bigger things  i shouldnt say so she declared  he sounded indeterminate but was not really so  they wandered over the downs westward among the wind as they followed the headland to the needles they felt the breeze from the wings of the sea brushing them and heard restless poignant voices screaming below the cliffs now and again a gull like a piece of spume flung up rose over the cliffs edge and sank again now and again as the path dipped in a hollow they could see the low suspended intertwining of the birds passing in and out of the cliff shelter  these savage birds appealed to all the poetry and yearning in helena they fascinated her they almost voiced her she crept nearer and nearer the edge feeling she must watch the gulls thread out in flakes of white above the weedblack rocks siegmund stood away back anxiously he would not dare to tempt fate now having too strong a sense of death to risk it  come back dear dont go so near he pleaded following as close as he might she heard the pain and appeal in his voice it thrilled her and she went a little nearer what was death to her but one of her symbols the death of which the sagas talksomething grand and sweeping and dark  leaning forward she could see the line of grey sand and the line of foam broken by black rocks and over all the gulls stirring round like froth on a pot screaming in chorus  she watched the beautiful birds heard the pleading of siegmund and she thrilled with pleasure toying with his keen anguish  helena came smiling to siegmund saying  they look so fine down there  he fastened his hands upon her as a relief from his pain he was filled with a keen strong anguish of dread like a presentiment she laughed as he gripped her  they went searching for a way of descent at last siegmund inquired of the coastguard the nearest way down the cliff he was pointed to the path of the hundred steps  when is a hundred not a hundred he said sceptically as they descended the dazzling white chalk there were sixtyeight steps helena laughed at his exactitude  it must be a love of round numbers he said  no doubt she laughed he took the thing so seriously  or of exaggeration he added  there was a shelving beach of warm white sand bleached soft as velvet a sounding of gulls filled the dark recesses of the headland a low chatter of shingle came from where the easy water was breaking the confused shelllike murmur of the sea between the folded cliffs siegmund and helena lay side by side upon the dry sand small as two resting birds while thousands of gulls whirled in a whiteflaked storm above them and the great cliffs towered beyond and high up over the cliffs the multitudinous clouds were travelling a vast caravan en route amidst the journeying of oceans and clouds and the circling flight of heavy spheres lost to sight in the sky siegmund and helena two grains of life in the vast movement were travelling a moment side by side  they lay on the beach like a grey and a white seabird together the lazy ships that were idling down the solent observed the cliffs and the boulders but siegmund and helena were too little they lay ignored and insignificant watching through halfclosed fingers the diverse caravan of day go past they lay with their latticed fingers over their eyes looking out at the sailing of ships across their vision of blue water  now that one with the greyish sails siegmund was saying  like a housewife of forty going placidly round with the dusteryes interrupted helena  that is a schooner you see her four sails and  he continued to classify the shipping until he was interrupted by the wicked laughter of helena  that is right i am sure he protested  i wont contradict you she laughed in a tone which showed him he knew even less of the classifying of ships than she did  so you have lain there amusing yourself at my expense all the time he said not knowing in the least why she laughed they turned and looked at one another blue eyes smiling and wavering as the beach wavers in the heat then they closed their eyes with sunshine  drowsed by the sun and the white sand and the foam their thoughts slept like butterflies on the flowers of delight but cold shadows startled them up  the clouds are coming he said regretfully  yes but the wind is quite strong enough for them she answered  look at the shadowslike blots floating away dont they devour the sunshine  it is quite warm enough here she said nestling in to him  yes but the sting is missing i like to feel the warmth biting in  no i do not to be cosy is enough  i like the sunshine on me real and manifest and tangible i feel like a seed that has been frozen for ages i want to be bitten by the sunshine  she leaned over and kissed him the sun came brightfooted over the water leaving a shining print on siegmunds face he lay with halfclosed eyes sprawled loosely on the sand looking at his limbs she imagined he must be heavy like the bounders she sat over him with her fingers stroking his eyebrows that were broad and rather arched he lay perfectly still in a halfdream  presently she laid her head on his breast and remained so watching the sea and listening to his heartbeats the throb was strong and deep it seemed to go through the whole island and the whole afternoon and it fascinated her so deep unheard with its great expulsions of life had the world a heart was there also deep in the world a great god thudding out waves of life like a great heart unconscious it frightened her this was the god she knew not as she knew not this siegmund it was so different from the halfshut eyes with black lashes and the winsome shapely nose and the heart of the world as she heard it could not be the same as the curling splash of retreat of the little sleepy waves she listened for siegmunds soul but his heart overbeat all other sound thudding powerfully    chapter 7   siegmund woke to the muffled firing of guns on the sea he looked across at the shaggy grey water in wonder then he turned to helena  i suppose he said they are saluting the czar poor beggar  i was afraid they would wake you she smiled  they listened again to the hollow dull sound of salutes from across the water and the downs  the day had gone grey they decided to walk down below to the next bay  the tide is coming in said helena  but this broad strip of sand hasnt been wet for months its as soft as pepper he replied  they laboured along the shore beside the black sinuous line of shrivelled fucus the base of the cliff was piled with chalk debris on the other side was the level plain of the sea hand in hand alone and overshadowed by huge cliffs they toiled on the waves staggered in and fell overcome at the end of the race  siegmund and helena neared a headland sheer as the side of a house its base weighted with a tremendous white mass of boulders that the green sea broke amongst with a hollow sound followed by a sharp hiss of withdrawal the lovers had to cross this desert of white boulders that glistened in smooth skins uncannily but siegmund saw the waves were almost at the wall of the headland glancing back he saw the other headland whitedashed at the base with foam he and helena must hurry or they would be prisoned on the thin crescent of strand still remaining between the great wall and the water  the cliffs overhead oppressed himmade him feel trapped and helpless he was caught by them in a net of great boulders while the sea fumbled for him but he and helena she laboured strenuously beside him blinded by the skinlike glisten of the white rock  i think i will rest awhile she said  no come along he begged  my dear she laughed there is tons of this shingle to buttress us from the sea  he looked at the waves curving and driving maliciously at the boulders it would be ridiculous to be trapped  look at this black wood she said does the sea really char it  let us get round the corner he begged  really siegmund the sea is not so anxious to take us she said ironically  when they rounded the first point they found themselves in a small bay jutted out to sea the front of the headland was as usual grooved this bay was pure white at the base from its great heaped mass of shingle with the huge concave of the cliff behind the foothold of massed white boulders and the immense arc of the sea in front helena was delighted  this is fine siegmund she said halting and facing west  smiling ironically he sat down on a boulder they were quite alone in this great white niche thrust out to sea here he could see the tide would beat the base of the wall it came plunging not far from their feet  would you really like to travel beyond the end he asked  she looked round quickly thrilled then answered as if in rebuke  this is a fine place i should like to stay here an hour  and then where  then oh then i suppose it would be teatime  tea on brine and pink anemones with daddy neptune  she looked sharply at the outjutting capes the sea did foam perilously near their bases  i suppose it is rather risky she said and she turned began silently to clamber forwards  he followed she should set the pace  i have no doubt theres plenty of room really he said the sea only looks near  but she toiled on intently now it was a question of danger not of inconvenience siegmund felt elated the waves foamed up as it seemed against the exposed headland from which the massive shingle had been swept back supposing they could not get by he began to smile curiously he became aware of the tremendous noise of waters of the slight shudder of the shingle when a wave struck it and he always laughed to himself helena laboured on in silence he kept just behind her the point seemed near but it took longer than they thought they had against them the tremendous cliff the enormous weight of shingle and the swinging sea the waves struck louder booming fearfully wind sweeping round the corner wet their faces siegmund hoped they were cut off and hoped anxiously the way was clear the smile became set on his face  then he saw there was a ledge or platform at the base of the cliff and it was against this the waves broke they climbed the side of this ridge hurried round to the front there the wind caught them wet and furious the water raged below between the two helena shrank wilted she took hold of siegmund the great brutal wave flung itself at the rock then drew back for another heavy spring fume and spray were spun on the wind like smoke the roaring thud of the waves reminded helena of a beating heart she clung closer to him as her hair was blown out damp and her white dress flapped in the wet wind always against the rock came the slow thud of the waves like a great heart beating under the breast there was something brutal about it that she could not bear she had no weapon against brute force  she glanced up at siegmund tiny drops of mist greyed his eyebrows he was looking out to sea screwing up his eyes and smiling brutally her face became heavy and sullen he was like the heart and the brute sea just here he was not her siegmund she hated the brute in him  turning suddenly she plunged over the shingle towards the wide populous bay he remained alone grinning at the smashing turmoil careless of her departure he would easily catch her  when at last he turned from the wrestling water he had spent his savagery and was sad he could never take part in the great battle of action it was beyond him many things he had let slip by his life was whittled down to only a few interests only a few necessities even here he had but helena and through her the rest after this weekwell that was vague he left it in the dark dreading it  and helena was toiling over the rough beach alone he saw her small figure bowed as she plunged forward it smote his heart with the keenest tenderness she was so winsome a playmate with beauty and fancy why was he cruel to her because she had not his own bitter wisdom of experience she was young and naïve and should he be angry with her for that his heart was tight at the thought of her she would have to suffer also because of him  he hurried after her not till they had nearly come to a little green mound where the downs sloped and the cliffs were gone did he catch her up then he took her hand as they walked  they halted on the green hillock beyond the sand and without a word he folded her in his arms both were put of breath he clasped her close seeming to rock her with his strong panting she felt his body lifting into her and sinking away it seemed to force a rhythm a new pulse in her gradually with a fine keen thrilling she melted down on him like metal sinking on a mould he was sea and sunlight mixed heaving warm deliciously strong  siegmund exulted at last she was moulded to him in pure passion  they stood folded thus for some time then helena raised her burning face and relaxed she was throbbing with strange elation and satisfaction  it might as well have been the sea as any other way dear she said startling both of them the speech went across their thoughtfulness like a star flying into the night from nowhere she had no idea why she said it he pressed his mouth on hers not for you he thought by reflex you cant go that way yet but he said nothing strained her very tightly and kept her lips  they were roused by the sound of voices unclasping they went to walk at the fringe of the water the tide was creeping back siegmund stooped and from among the waters combings picked up an electriclight bulb it lay in some weed at the base of a rock he held it in his hand to helena her face lighted with a curious pleasure she took the thing delicately from his hand fingered it with her exquisite softness  isnt it remarkable she exclaimed joyously the sea must be very very gentleand very kind  sometimes smiled siegmund  but i did not think it could be so finefingered she said she breathed on the glass bulb till it looked like a dim magnolia bud she inhaled its fine savour  it would not have treated you so well he said she looked at him with heavy eyes then she returned to her bulb her fingers were very small and very pink she had the most delicate touch in the world like a faint feel of silk as he watched her lifting her fingers from off the glass then gently stroking it his blood ran hot he watched her waited upon her words and movements attentively  it is a graceful act on the seas part she said wotan is so clumsyhe knocks over the bowl and flapflapflap go the gasping fishes pizzicatobut the sea  helenas speech was often difficult to render into plain terms she was not lucid  but lifes so full of anticlimax she concluded siegmund smiled softly at her she had him too much in love to disagree or to examine her words  theres no reckoning with life and no reckoning with the sea the only way to get on with both is to be as near a vacuum as possible and float he jested it hurt her that he was flippant she proceeded to forget he had spoken  there were three children on the beach helena had handed him back the senseless bauble not able to throw it away being a father  i will give it to the children he said  she looked up at him loved him for the thought  wandering hand in hand for it pleased them both to own each other publicly after years of conventional distance they came to a little girl who was bending over a pool her black hair hung in long snakes to the water she stood up flung back her locks to see them as they approached in one hand she clasped some pebbles  would you like this i found it down there said siegmund offering her the bulb  she looked at him with grave blue eyes and accepted his gift evidently she was not going to say anything  the sea brought it all the way from the mainland without breaking it said helena with the interesting intonation some folk use to children  the girl looked at her  the waves put it out of their lap on to some seaweed with such careful fingers  the childs eyes brightened  the tideline is full of treasures said helena smiling  the child answered her smile a little  siegmund had walked away  what beautiful eyes she had said helena  yes he replied  she looked up at him he felt her searching him tenderly with her eyes but he could not look back at her she took his hand and kissed it knowing he was thinking of his own youngest child    chapter 8   the way home lay across country through deep little lanes where the late foxgloves sat seriously like sad hounds over open downlands rough with gorse and ling and through pocketed hollows of bracken and trees  they came to a small roman catholic church in the fields there the carved christ looked down on the dead whose sleeping forms made mounds under the coverlet helenas heart was swelling with emotion all the yearning and pathos of christianity filled her again  the path skirted the churchyard wall so that she had on the one hand the sleeping dead and on the other siegmund strong and vigorous but walking in the old dejected fashion she felt a rare tenderness and admiration for him it was unusual for her to be so humbleminded but this evening she felt she must minister to him and be submissive  she made him stop to look at the graves suddenly as they stood she kissed him clasped him fervently roused him till his passion burned away his heaviness and he seemed tipped with life his face glowing as if soon he would burst alight then she was satisfied and could laugh  as they went through the fir copse listening to the birds like a family assembled and chattering at home in the evening listening to the light swish of the wind she let siegmund predominate he set the swing of their motion she rested on him like a bird on a swaying bough  they argued concerning the way siegmund as usual submitted to her they went quite wrong as they retraced their steps stealthily through a poultry farm whose fowls were standing in forlorn groups once more dismayed by evening helenas pride battled with her new subjugation to siegmund she walked head down saying nothing he also was silent but his heart was strong in him somewhere in the distance a band was playing the watch on the rhine  as they passed the beeches and were near home helena said to try him and to strike a last blow for her pride  i wonder what next monday will bring us  quick curtain he answered joyously he was looking down and smiling at her with such careless happiness that she loved him he was wonderful to her she loved him was jealous of every particle of him that evaded her she wanted to sacrifice to him make herself a burning altar to him and she wanted to possess him  the hours that would be purely their own came too slowly for her  that night she met his passion with love it was not his passion she wanted actually but she desired that he should want her madly and that he should have alleverything it was a wonderful night to him it restored in him the full will to live but she felt it destroyed her her soul seemed blasted  at seven oclock in the morning helena lay in the deliciously cool water while small waves ran up the beach full and clear and foamless continuing perfectly in their flicker the rhythm of the nights passion nothing she felt had ever been so delightful as this cool water running over her she lay and looked out on the shining sea all things it seemed were made of sunshine more or less soiled the cliffs rose out of the shining waves like clouds of strong fine texture and rocks along the shore were the dapplings of a bright dawn the coarseness was fused out of the world so that sunlight showed in the veins of the morning cliffs and the rocks yea everything ran with sunshine as we are full of blood and plants are tissued from greengold glistening sap substance and solidity were shadows that the morning cast round itself to make itself tangible as she herself was a shadow cast by that fragment of sunshine her soul over its inefficiency  she remembered to have seen the bats flying low over a burnished pool at sunset and the web of their wings had burned in scarlet flickers as they stretched across the light winged momentarily on bits of tissued flame threaded with blood the bats had flickered a secret to her  now the cliffs were like wings uplifted and the morning was coming dimly through them she felt the wings of all the world upraised against the morning in a flashing multitudinous flight the world itself was flying sunlight poured on the large round world till she fancied it a heavy bee humming on its iridescent atmosphere across a vast air of sunshine  she lay and rode the fine journey sunlight liquid in the water made the waves heavy golden and rich with a velvety coolness like cowslips her feet fluttered in the shadowy underwater her breast came out bright as the breast of a white bird  where was siegmund she wondered he also was somewhere among the sea and the sunshine white and playing like a bird shining like a vivid restless speck of sunlight she struck the water smiling feeling along with him they two were the owners of this morning as a pair of wild large birds inhabiting an empty sea  siegmund had found a white cave welling with green water brilliant and full of life as mounting sap the white rock glimmered through the water and soon siegmund shimmered also in the living green of the sea like pale flowers trembling upward  the water said siegmund is as full of life as i am and he pressed forward his breast against it he swam very well that morning he had more wilful life than the sea so he mastered it laughingly with his arms feeling a delight in his triumph over the waves venturing recklessly in his new pride he swam round the corner of the rock through an archway lofty and spacious into a passage where the water ran like a flood of green light over the skinwhite bottom suddenly he emerged in the brilliant daylight of the next tiny scoop of a bay  there he arrived like a pioneer for the bay was inaccessible from the land he waded out of the green cold water on to sand that was pure as the shoulders of helena out of the shadow of the archway into the sunlight on to the glistening petal of this blossom of a seabay  he did not know till he felt the sunlight how the sea had drunk with its cold lips deeply of his warmth throwing himself down on the sand that was soft and warm as white fur he lay glistening wet panting swelling with glad pride at having conquered also this small inaccessible seacave creeping into it like a white bee into a white virgin blossom that had waited how long for its bee  the sand was warm to his breast and his belly and his arms it was like a great body he cleaved to almost he fancied he felt it heaving under him in its breathing then he turned his face to the sun and laughed all the while he hugged the warm body of the seabay beneath him he spread his hands upon the sand he took it in handfuls and let it run smooth warm delightful through his fingers  surely he said to himself it is like helena and he laid his hands again on the warm body of the shore let them wander discovering gathering all the warmth the softness the strange wonder of smooth warm pebbles then shrinking from the deep weight of cold his hand encountered as he burrowed under the surface wristdeep in the end he found the cold mystery of the deep sand also thrilling he pushed in his hands again and deeper enjoying the almost hurt of the dark heavy coldness for the sun and the white flower of the bay were breathing and kissing him dry were holding him in their warm concave like a bee in a flower like himself on the bosom of helena and flowing like the warmth of her breath in his hair came the sunshine breathing near and lovingly yet under all was this deep mass of cold that the softness and warmth merely floated upon  siegmund lay and clasped the sand and tossed it in handfuls till over him he was all hot and cloyed then he rose and looked at himself and laughed the water was swaying reproachfully against the steep pebbles below murmuring like a child that it was not fairit was not fair he should abandon his playmate siegmund laughed and began to rub himself free of the clogging sand he found himself strangely dry and smooth he tossed more dry sand and more over himself busy and intent like a child playing some absorbing game with itself soon his body was dry and warm and smooth as a camomile flower he was however greyed and smeared with sanddust siegmund looked at himself with disapproval though his body was full of delight and his hands glad with the touch of himself he wanted himself clean he felt the sand thick in his hair even in his moustache he went painfully over the pebbles till he found himself on the smooth rock bottom then he soused himself and shook his head in the water and washed and splashed and rubbed himself with his hands assiduously he must feel perfectly clean and freefresh as if he had washed away all the years of soilure in this mornings sea and sun and sand it was the purification siegmund became again a happy priest of the sun he felt as if all the dirt of misery were soaked out of him as he might soak clean a soiled garment in the sea and bleach it white on the sunny shore so white and sweet and tissueclean he feltfull of lightness and grace  the garden in front of their house where helena was waiting for him was long and crooked with a sunken flagstone pavement running up to the door by the side of the lawn on either hand the high fence of the garden was heavy with wild clematis and honeysuckle helena sat sideways with a map spread out on her bench under the bushy little laburnum tree tracing the course of their wanderings it was very still there was just a murmur of bees going in and out the brilliant little porches of nasturtium flowers the nasturtium leafcoins stood cool and grey in their delicate shade underneath in the green twilight a few flowers shone their submerged gold and scarlet there was a faint scent of mignonette helena like a white butterfly in the shade her two white arms for antennae stretching firmly to the bench leaned over her map she was busy very busy out of sheer happiness she traced word after word and evoked scene after scene as she discovered a name she conjured up the place as she moved to the next mark she imagined the long path lifting and falling happily  she was waiting for siegmund yet his hand upon the latch startled her she rose suddenly in agitation siegmund was standing in the sunshine at the gate they greeted each other across the tall roses  when siegmund was holding her hand he said softly laughing  you have come out of the water very beautiful this morning  she laughed she was not beautiful but she felt so at that moment she glanced up at him full of love and gratefulness  and you she murmured in a still tone as if it were almost sacrilegiously unnecessary to say it  siegmund was glad he rejoiced to be told he was beautiful after a few moments of listening to the bees and breathing the mignonette he said  i found a little white bay just like youa virgin bay i had to swim there  oh she said very interested in him not in the fact  it seemed just like you many things seem like you he said  she laughed again in her joyous fashion and the reedlike vibration came into her voice  i saw the sun through the cliffs and the sea and you she said  he did not understand he looked at her searchingly she was white and still and inscrutable then she looked up at him her earnest eyes that would not flinch gazed straight into him he trembled and things all swept into a blur after she had taken away her eyes he found himself saying  you know i felt as if i were the first man to discover things like adam when he opened the first eyes in the world  i saw the sunshine in you repeated helena quietly looking at him with her eyes heavy with meaning  he laughed again not understanding but feeling she meant love  no but you have altered everything he said  the note of wonder of joy in his voice touched her almost beyond selfcontrol she caught his hand and pressed it then quickly kissed it he became suddenly grave  i feel as if it were rightyou and me helenaso even righteous it is so isnt it and the sea and everything they all seem with us do you think so  looking at her he found her eyes full of tears he bent and kissed her and she pressed his head to her bosom he was very glad    chapter 9   the day waxed hot a few little silver tortoises of cloud had crawled across the desert of sky and hidden themselves the chalk roads were white quivering with heat helena and siegmund walked eastward bareheaded under the sunshine they felt like two insects in the niche of a hot hearth as they toiled along the deep road a few poppies here and there among the wild rye floated scarlet in sunshine like blooddrops on green water helena recalled francis thompsons poems which siegmund had never read she repeated what she knew and laughed thinking what an ineffectual pale shadow of a person thompson must have been she looked at siegmund walking in large easiness beside her  artists are supremely unfortunate persons she announced  think of wagner said siegmund lifting his face to the hot bright heaven and drinking the heat with his blinded face all states seemed meagre save his own he recalled people who had loved and he pitied themdimly drowsily without pain  they came to a place where they might gain access to the shore by a path down a landslip as they descended through the rockery yellow with ragwort they felt themselves dip into the inert hot air of the bay the living atmosphere of the uplands was left overhead among the rocks of the sand white as if smelted the heat glowed and quivered helena sat down and took off her shoes she walked on the hot glistening sand till her feet were delightfully almost intoxicatingly scorched then she ran into the water to cool them siegmund and she paddled in the light water pensively watching the haste of the ripples like crystal beetles running over the white outline of their feet looking out on the sea that rose so near to them dwarfing them by its far reach  for a short time they flitted silently in the waters edge then there settled down on them a twilight of sleep the little hush that closes the doors and draws the blinds of the house after a festival they wandered out across the beach above highwater mark where they sat down together on the sand leaning back against a flat brown stone siegmund with the sunshine on his forehead helena drooping close to him in his shadow then the hours ride by unnoticed making no sound as they go the sea creeps nearer nearer like a snake which watches two birds asleep it may not disturb them but sinks back ceasing to look at them with its bright eyes  meanwhile the flowers of their passion were softly shed as poppies fall at noon and the seed of beauty ripened rapidly within them dreams came like a wind through their souls drifting off with the seeddust of beautiful experience which they had ripened to fertilize the souls of others withal in them the sea and the sky and ships had mingled and bred new blossoms of the torrid heat of their love and the seed of such blossoms was shaken as they slept into the hand of god who held it in his palm preciously then scattered it again to produce new splendid blooms of beauty  a little breeze came down the cliffs sleep lightened the lovers of their experience new buds were urged in their souls as they lay in a shadowed twilight at the porch of death the breeze fanned the face of helena a coolness wafted on her throat as the afternoon wore on she revived quick to flag she was easy to revive like a white pansy flung into water she shivered lightly and rose  strange it seemed to her to rise from the brown stone into life again she felt beautifully refreshed all around was quick as a garden wet in the early morning of june she took her hair and loosened it shook it free from sand spread and laughed like a fringed poppy that opens itself to the sun she let the wind comb through its soft fingers the tangles of her hair helena loved the wind she turned to it and took its kisses on her face and throat  siegmund lay still looking up at her the changes in him were deeper like alteration in his tissue his new buds came slowly and were of a fresh type he lay smiling at her at last he said  you look now as if you belonged to the sea  i do and some day i shall go back to it she replied  for to her at that moment the sea was a great lover like siegmund but more impersonal who would receive her when siegmund could not she rejoiced momentarily in the fact siegmund looked at her and continued smiling his happiness was budded firm and secure  come said helena holding out her hand  he rose somewhat reluctantly from his large fruitful inertia    chapter 10   siegmund carried the boots and the shoes while they wandered over the sand to the rocks there was a delightful sense of risk in scrambling with bare feet over the smooth irregular jumble of rocks helena laughed suddenly from fear as she felt herself slipping siegmunds heart was leaping like a childs with excitement as he stretched forward himself very insecure to succour her thus they travelled slowly often she called to him to come and look in the lovely little rockpools dusky with blossoms of red anemones and brown anemones that seemed nothing but shadows and curtained with green of finest seasilk siegmund loved to poke the white pebbles and startle the little ghosts of crabs in a shadowy scuttle through the weed he would tease the expectant anemones causing them to close suddenly over his finger but helena liked to watch without touching things meanwhile the sun was slanting behind the cross far away to the west and the light was swimming in silver and gold upon the lacquered water at last siegmund looked doubtfully at two miles more of glistening gilded boulders helena was seated on a stone dabbling her feet in a warm pool delicately feeling the wet seavelvet of the weeds  dont you think we had better be mounting the cliffs he said  she glanced up at him smiling with irresponsible eyes then she lapped the water with her feet and surveyed her pink toes she was absurdly childishly happy  why should we she asked lightly  he watched her her childlike indifference to consequences touched him with a sense of the distance between them he himself might play with the delicious warm surface of life but always he reeked of the relentless mass of cold beneaththe mass of life which has no sympathy with the individual no cognizance of him  she loved the trifles and the toys the mystery and the magic of things she would not own life to be relentless it was either beautiful fantastic or weird or inscrutable or else mean and vulgar below consideration he had to get a sense of the anemone and a sympathetic knowledge of its experience into his blood before he was satisfied to helena an anemone was one more fantastic pretty figure in her kaleidoscope  so she sat dabbling her pink feet in the water quite unconscious of his gravity he waited on her since he never could capture her  come he said very gently you are only six years old today  she laughed as she let him take her then she nestled up to him smiling in a brilliant childlike fashion he kissed her with all the father in him sadly alive  now put your stockings on he said  but my feet are wet she laughed  he kneeled down and dried her feet on his handkerchief while she sat tossing his hair with her fingertips the sunlight grew more and more golden  i envy the savages their free feet she said  there is no broken glass in the wildernessor there used not to be he replied  as they were crossing the sands a whole family entered by the cliff track they descended in single file unequally like the theatre two boys then a little girl the father another girl then the mother last of all trotted the dog warily suspicious of the descent the boys emerged into the bay with a shout the dog rushed barking after them the little one waited for her father calling shrilly  tiss cant fall now can she dadda shall i put her down  ay let her have a run said the father  very carefully she lowered the kitten which she had carried clasped to her bosom the mite was bewildered and scared it turned round pathetically  go on tissie youre all right said the child go on have a run on the sand  the kitten stood dubious and unhappy then perceiving the dog some distance ahead it scampered after him a fluffy scurrying mite but the dog had already raced into the water the kitten walked a few steps turning its small face this way and that and mewing piteously it looked extraordinarily tiny as it stood a fluffy handful staring away from the noisy water its thin cry floating over the plash of waves  helena glanced at siegmund and her eyes were shining with pity he was watching the kitten and smiling  crying because things are too big and it cant take them in he said  but look how frightened it is she said  so am i he laughed and if there are any gods looking on and laughing at me at least they wont be kind enough to put me in their pinafores  she laughed very quickly  but why she exclaimed why should you want putting in a pinafore  i dont he laughed  on the top of the cliff they were between two bays with darkening blue water on the left and on the right gold water smoothing to the sun siegmund seemed to stand waistdeep in shadow with his face bright and glowing he was watching earnestly  i want to absorb it all he said  when at last they turned away  yes said helena slowly one can recall the details but never the atmosphere  he pondered a moment  how strange he said i can recall the atmosphere but not the detail it is a moment to me not a piece of scenery i should say the picture was in me not out there  without troubling to understandshe was inclined to think it verbiageshe made a small sound of assent  that is why you want to go again to a place and i dont care so much because i have it with me he concluded    chapter 11   they decided to find their way through the lanes to alum bay and then keeping the cross in sight to return over the downs with the moonpath broad on the water before them for the moon was rising late twilight however rose more rapidly than they had anticipated the lane twisted among meadows and wild lands and copsesa wilful little lane quite incomprehensible so they lost their distant landmark the white cross  darkness filtered through the daylight when at last they came to a signpost it was almost too dark to read it the fingers seemed to withdraw into the dusk the more they looked  we must go to the left said helena  to the left rose the downs smooth and grey near at hand but higher black with gorse like a giant lying asleep with a bearskin over his shoulders  several pale chalktracks ran side by side through the turf climbing they came to a disused chalkpit which they circumvented having passed a lonely farmhouse they mounted the side of the open down where was a sense of space and freedom  we can steer by the night said siegmund as they trod upwards pathlessly helena did not mind whither they steered all places in that large fair night were home and welcome to her they drew nearer to the shaggy cloak of furze  there will be a path through it said siegmund  but when they arrived there was no path they were confronted by a tall impenetrable growth of gorse taller than siegmund  stay here said he while i look for a way through i am afraid you will be tired  she stood alone by the walls of gorse the lights that had flickered into being during the dusk grew stronger so that a little farmhouse down the hill glowed with great importance on the night while the faroff in visible sea became like a roadway large and mysterious its specks of light moving slowly and its bigger lamps stationed out amid the darkness helena wanted the daywanness to be quite wiped off the west she asked for the full black night that would obliterate everything save siegmund siegmund it was that the whole world meant the darkness the gorse the downs the specks of light seemed only to bespeak him she waited for him to come back she could hardly endure the condition of intense waiting  he came in his grey clothes almost invisible but she felt him coming  no good he said no vestige of a path not a rabbitrun  then we will sit down awhile said she calmly  here on this molehill he quoted mockingly  they sat down in a small gap in the gorse where the turf was very soft and where the darkness seemed deeper the night was all fragrance cool odour of darkness keen savoury scent of the downs touched with honeysuckle and gorse and bracken scent  helena turned to him leaning her hand on his thigh  what day is it siegmund she asked in a joyous wondering tone he laughed understanding and kissed her  but really she insisted i would not have believed the labels could have fallen off everything like this  he laughed again she still leaned towards him her weight on her hand stopping the flow in the artery down his thigh  the days used to walk in procession like seven marionettes each in order and costume going endlessly round she laughed amused at the idea  it is very strange she continued to have the days and nights smeared into one piece as if the clockhand only went round once in a lifetime  that is how it is he admitted touched by her eloquence you have torn the labels off things and they all are so different this morning it does seem absurd to talk about this morning why should i be parcelled up into mornings and evenings and nights i am not made up of sections of time now nights and days go racing over us like cloudshadows and sunshine over the sea and all the time we take no notice  she put her arms round his neck he was reminded by a sudden pain in his leg how much her hand had been pressing on him he held his breath from pain she was kissing him softly over the eyes they lay cheek to cheek looking at the stars he felt a peculiar tingling sense of joy a keenness of perception a fine delicate tingling as of music  you know he said repeating himself it is true you seem to have knit all things in a piece for me things are not separate they are all in a symphony they go moving on and on you are the motive in everything  helena lay beside him half upon him sad with bliss  you must write a symphony of thisof us she said prompted by a disciples vanity  some time he answered later when i have time  later she murmuredlater than what  i dont know he replied this is so bright we cant see beyond he turned his face to hers and through the darkness smiled into her eyes that were so close to his then he kissed her long and lovingly he lay with her head on his shoulder looking through her hair at the stars  i wonder how it is you have such a fine natural perfume he said always in the same abstract inquiring tone of happiness  havent all women she replied and the peculiar penetrating twang of a brass reed was again in her voice  i dont know he said quite untouched but you are scented like nuts new kernels of hazelnuts and a touch of opium he remained abstractedly breathing her with his open mouth quite absorbed in her  you are so strange she murmured tenderly hardly able to control her voice to speak  i believe he said slowly i can see the stars moving through your hair no keep still you cant see them helena lay obediently very still i thought i could watch them travelling crawling like gold flies on the ceiling he continued in a slow singsong but now you make your hair tremble and the stars rush about then as a new thought struck him have you noticed that you cant recognize the constellations lying back like this i cant see one where is the north even  she laughed at the idea of his questioning her concerning these things she refused to learn the names of the stars or of the constellations as of the wayside plants why should i want to label them she would say i prefer to look at them not to hide them under a name so she laughed when he asked her to find vega or arcturus  how full the sky is siegmund dreamed onlike a crowded street down here it is vastly lonely in comparison weve found a place far quieter and more private than the stars helena isnt it fine to be up here with the sky for nearest neighbour  i did well to ask you to come she inquired wistfully he turned to her  as wise as god for the minute he replied softly i think a few furtive angels brought us heresmuggled us in  and you are glad she asked he laughed  carpe diem he said we have plucked a beauty my dear with this rose in my coat i dare go to hell or anywhere  why hell siegmund she asked in displeasure  i suppose it is the postero in everything else im a failure helena but he laughed this day of ours is a rose not many men have plucked  she kissed him passionately beginning to cry in a quick noiseless fashion  what does it matter helena he murmured what does it matter we are here yet  the quiet tone of siegmund moved her with a vivid passion of grief she felt she should lose him clasping him very closely she burst into uncontrollable sobbing he did not understand but he did not interrupt her he merely held her very close while he looked through her shaking hair at the motionless stars he bent his head to hers he sought her face with his lips heavy with pity she grew a little quieter he felt his cheek all wet with her tears and between his cheek and hers the ravelled roughness of her wet hair that chafed and made his face burn  what is it helena he asked at last why should you cry  she pressed her face in his breast and said in a muffled unrecognizable voice  you wont leave me will you siegmund  how could i how should i he murmured soothingly she lifted her face suddenly and pressed on him a fierce kiss  how could i leave you he repeated and she heard his voice waking the grip coming into his arms and she was glad  an intense silence came over everything helena almost expected to hear the stars moving everything below was so still she had no idea what siegmund was thinking he lay with his arms strong around her then she heard the beating of his heart like the muffled sound of salutes she thought it gave her the same thrill of dread and excitement mingled with a sense of triumph siegmund had changed again his mood was gone so that he was no longer wandering in a night of thoughts but had become different incomprehensible to her she had no idea what she thought or felt all she knew was that he was strong and was knocking urgently with his heart on her breast like a man who wanted something and who dreaded to be sent away how he came to be so concentratedly urgent she could not understand it seemed an unreasonable an incomprehensible obsession to her yet she was glad and she smiled in her heart feeling triumphant and restored yet again dimly she wondered where was the siegmund of ten minutes ago and her heart lifted slightly with yearning to sink with a dismay this siegmund was so incomprehensible then again when he raised his head and found her mouth his lips filled her with a hot flush like wine a sweet flaming flush of her whole body most exquisite as if she were nothing but a soft rosy flame of fire against him for a moment or two that she decided was supreme transcendental  the lights of the little farmhouse below had vanished the yellow specks of ships were gone only the pierlight far away shone in the black sea like the broken piece of a star overhead was a silvergreyness of stars below was the velvet blackness of the night and the sea helena found herself glimmering with fragments of poetry as she saw the sea when she looked very closely glimmered dustily with a reflection of stars      tiefe stille herrscht im wasser     ohne regung ruht das meer   she was fond of what scraps of german verse she knew with french verse she had no sympathy but goethe and heine and uhland seemed to speak her language      die luft ist kühl und es dunkelt     und ruhig fliesst der rhein  she liked heine best of all      wie träume der kindheit seh ich es flimmern     auf deinem wogenden wellengebiet     und alte erinnerung erzählt mir aufs neue     von all dem lieben herrlichen spielzeug     von all den blinkenden weihnachtsgaben  as she lay in siegmunds arms again and he was very still dreaming she knew not what fragments such as these flickered and were gone like the gleam of a falling star over water the night moved on imperceptibly across the sky unlike the day it made no sound and gave no sign but passed unseen unfelt over them till the moon was ready to step forth then the eastern sky blenched and there was a small gathering of clouds round the opening gates      aus alten märchen winket es     hervor mit weisser hand     da singt es und da klingt es     von einem zauberland   helena sang this to herself as the moon lifted herself slowly among the clouds she found herself repeating them aloud in in a forgetful singsong as children do  what is it said siegmund they were both of them sunk in their own stillness therefore it was a moment or two before she repeated her singsong in a little louder tone he did not listen to her having forgotten that he had asked her a question  turn your head she told him when she had finished the verse and look at the moon  he pressed back his head so that there was a gleaming pallor on his chin and his forehead and deep black shadow over his eyes and his nostrils this thrilled helena with a sense of mystery and magic  die grossen blumen schmachten she said to herself curiously awake and joyous the big flowers open with black petals and silvery ones siegmund you are the big flowers siegmund yours is the bridegroom face siegmund like a black and glistening fleshpetalled flower siegmund and it blooms in the zauberland siegmundthis is the magic land  between the phrases of this whispered ecstasy she kissed him swiftly on the throat in the shadow and on his faintly gleaming cheeks he lay still his heart beating heavily he was almost afraid of the strange ecstasy she concentrated on him meanwhile she whispered over him sharp breathless phrases in german and english touching him with her mouth and her cheeks and her forehead  und liebesweisen tönennot tonight siegmund they are all stillgorse and the stars and the sea and the trees are all kissing siegmund the sea has its mouth on the earth and the gorse and the trees press together and they all look up at the moon they put up their faces in a kiss my darling but they havent youand it all centres in you my dear all the wonderlove is in you more than in them all siegmundsiegmund  he felt the tears falling on him as he lay with heart beating in slow heavy drops under the ecstasy of her love then she sank down and lay prone on him spent clinging to him lifted up and down by the beautiful strong motion of his breathing rocked thus on his strength she swooned lightly into unconsciousness  when she came to herself she sighed deeply she woke to the exquisite heaving of his life beneath her  i have been beyond life i have been a little way into death she said to her soul with wideeyed delight she lay dazed wondering upon it that she should come back into a marvellous peaceful happiness astonished her  suddenly she became aware that she must be slowly weighing down the life of siegmund there was a long space between the lift of one breath and the next her heart melted with sorrowful pity resting herself on her hands she kissed hima long anguished kiss as if she would fuse her soul into his for ever then she rose sighing sighing again deeply she put up her hands to her head and looked at the moon no more said her heart almost as if it sighed toono more  she looked down at siegmund he was drawing in great heavy breaths he lay still on his back gazing up at her and she stood motionless at his side looking down at him he felt stunned halfconscious yet as he lay helplessly looking up at her some other consciousness inside him murmured hawwaevemother she stood compassionate over him without touching him she seemed to be yearning over him like a mother her compassion her benignity seemed so different from his little helena this woman tall and pale drooping with the strength of her compassion seemed stable immortal not a fragile human being but a personification of the great motherhood of women  i am her child too he dreamed as a child murmurs unconscious in sleep he had never felt her eyes so much as now in the darkness when he looked only into deep shadow she had never before so entered and gathered his plaintive masculine soul to the bosom of her nurture  come she said gently when she knew he was restored shall we go  he rose with difficulty gathering his strength    chapter 12   siegmund made a great effort to keep the control of his body the hillside the gorse when he stood up seemed to have fallen back into shadowed vagueness about him they were meaningless dark heaps at some distance very great it seemed  i cant get hold of them he said distractedly to himself he felt detached from the earth from all the near concrete beloved things as if these had melted away from him and left him sick and unsupported somewhere alone on the edge of an enormous space he wanted to lie down again to relieve himself of the sickening effort of supporting and controlling his body if he could lie down again perfectly still he need not struggle to animate the cumbersome matter of his body and then he would not feel thus sick and outside himself  but helena was speaking to him telling him they would see the moonpath they must set off downhill he felt her arm clasped firmly joyously round his waist therein was his stability and warm support siegmund felt a keen flush of pitiful tenderness for her as she walked with buoyant feet beside him clasping him so happily all unconscious this pity for her drew him nearer to life  he shuddered lightly now and again as they stepped lurching down the hill he set his jaws hard to suppress this shuddering it was not in his limbs or even on the surface of his body for helena did not notice it yet he shuddered almost in anguish internally  what is it he asked himself in wonder  his thought consisted of these detached phrases which he spoke verbally to himself betweenwhiles he was conscious only of an almost insupportable feeling of sickness as a man feels who is being brought from under an anaesthetic also he was vaguely aware of a teeming stir of activity such as one may hear from a closed hive within him  they swung rapidly downhill siegmund still shuddered but not so uncontrollably they came to a stile which they must climb as he stepped over it needed a concentrated effort of will to place his foot securely on the step the effort was so great that he became conscious of it  good lord he said to himself i wonder what it is  he tried to examine himself he thought of all the organs of his bodyhis brain his heart his liver there was no pain and nothing wrong with any of them he was sure his dim searching resolved itself into another detached phrase there is nothing the matter with me he said  then he continued vaguely wondering recalling the sensation of wretched sickness which sometimes follows drunkenness thinking of the times when he had fallen ill  but i am not like that he said because i dont feel tremulous i am sure my hand is steady  helena stood still to consider the road he held out his hand before him it was motionless as a dead flower on this silent night  yes i think this is the right way said helena and they set off again as if gaily  it certainly feels rather deathly said siegmund to himself he remembered distinctly when he was a child and had diphtheria he had stretched himself in the horrible sickness which he felt wasand here he chose the french wordlagonie but his mother had seen and had cried aloud which suddenly caused him to struggle with all his soul to spare her her suffering  certainly it is like that he said certainly it is rather deathly i wonder how it is  then he reviewed the last hour  i believe we are lost helena interrupted him  lost what matter he answered indifferently and helena pressed him tighter hearer to her in a kind of triumph but did we not come this way he added  no seeher voice was reeded with restrained emotionwe have certainly not been along this bare path which dips up and down  well then we must merely keep due eastward towards the moon pretty well as much as we can said siegmund looking forward over the down where the moon was wrestling heroically to win free of the pack of clouds which hung on her like wolves on a white deer as he looked at the moon he felt a sense of companionship helena not understanding left him so much alone the moon was nearer  siegmund continued to review the last hours he had been so wondrously happy the world had been filled with a new magic a wonderful stately beauty which he had perceived for the first time for long hours he had been wandering in anothera glamorous primordial world  i suppose he said to himself i have lived too intensely i seem to have had the stars and moon and everything else for guests and now theyve gone my house is weak  so he struggled to diagnose his case of splendour and sickness he reviewed his hour of passion with helena  surely he told himself i have drunk life too hot and it has hurt my cup my soul seems to leak outi am half here half gone away thats why i understand the trees and the night so painfully  then he came to the hour of helenas strange ecstasy over him that somehow had filled him with passionate grief it was happiness concentrated one drop too keen so that what should have been vivid wine was like a pure poison scathing him but his consciousness which had been unnaturally active now was dulling he felt the blood flowing vigorously along the limbs again and stilling has brain sweeping away his sickness soothing him  i suppose he said to himself for the last time i suppose living too intensely kills you more or less  then siegmund forgot he opened his eyes and saw the night about him the moon had escaped from the cloudpack and was radiant behind a fine veil which glistened to her rays and which was broidered with a lustrous halo very large indeed the largest halo siegmund had ever seen when the little lane turned full towards the moon it seemed as if siegmund and helena would walk through a large moorish arch of horseshoe shape the enormous white halo opening in front of them they walked on keeping their faces to the moon smiling with wonder and a little rapture until once mote the little lane curved wilfully and they were walking north helena observed three cottages crouching under the hill and under trees to cover themselves from the magic of the moonlight  we certainly did not come this way before she said triumphantly the idea of being lost delighted her  siegmund looked round at the grey hills smeared over with a low dim glisten of moonmist he could not yet fully realize that he was walking along a lane in the isle of wight his surroundings seemed to belong to some state beyond ordinary experiencesome place in romance perhaps or among the hills where brünhild lay sleeping in her large bright halo of fire how could it be that he and helena were two children of london wandering to find their lodging in freshwater he sighed and looked again over the hills where the moonlight was condensing in mist ethereal frail and yet substantial reminding him of the way the manna must have condensed out of the white moonlit mists of arabian deserts  we may be on the road to newport said helena presently and the distance is ten miles  she laughed not caring in the least whither they wandered exulting in this wonderful excursion she and siegmund alone in a glistening wilderness of night at the back of habited days and nights siegmund looked at her he by no means shared her exultation though he sympathized with it he walked on alone in his deep seriousness of which she was not aware yet when he noticed her abandon he drew her nearer and his heart softened with protecting tenderness towards her and grew heavy with responsibility  the fields breathed off a scent as if they were come to life with the night and were talking with fragrant eagerness the farms huddled together in sleep and pulled the dark shadow over them to hide from the supernatural white night the cottages were locked and darkened helena walked on in triumph through this wondrous hinterland of night actively searching for the spirits watching the cottages they approached listening looking for the dreams of those sleeping inside in the darkened rooms she imagined she could see the frail dreamfaces at the windows she fancied they stole out timidly into the gardens and went running away among the rabbits on the gleamy hillside helena laughed to herself pleased with her fancy of wayward little dreams playing with weak hands and feet among the large solemnsleeping cattle this was the first time she told herself that she had ever been out among the greyfrocked dreams and whitearmed fairies she imagined herself lying asleep in her room while her own dreams slid out down the moonbeams she imagined siegmund sleeping in his room while his dreams darkeyed their blue eyes very dark and yearning at nighttime came wandering over the grey grass seeking her dreams  so she wove her fancies as she walked until for very weariness she was fain to remember that it was a long waya long way siegmunds arm was about her to support her she rested herself upon it they crossed a stile and recognized on the right of the path the graveyard of the catholic chapel the moon which the days were paring smaller with envious keen knife shone upon the white stones in the burialground the carved christ upon his cross hung against a silvergrey sky helena looked up wearily bowing to the tragedy siegmund also looked and bowed his head  thirty years of earnest love three years life like a passionate ecstasyand it was finished he was very great and very wonderful i am very insignificant and shall go out ignobly but we are the same love the brief ecstasy and the end but mine is one rose and his all the white beauty in the world  siegmund felt his heart very heavy sad and at fault in presence of the christ yet he derived comfort from the knowledge that life was treating him in the same manner as it had treated the master though his compared small and despicable with the christtragedy siegmund stepped softly into the shadow of the pine copse  let me get under cover he thought let me hide in it it is good the sudden intense darkness i am small and futile my small futile tragedy  helena shrank in the darkness it was almost terrible to her and the silence was like a deep pit she shrank to siegmund he drew her closer leaning over her as they walked trying to assure her his heart was heavy and heavy with a tenderness approaching grief for his small brave helena  are you sure this is the right way he whispered to her  quite quite sure she whispered confidently in reply and presently they came out into the hazy moonlight and began stumbling down the steep hill they were both very tired both found it difficult to go with ease or surety this sudden way down soon they were creeping cautiously across the pasture and the poultry farm helenas heart was beating as she imagined what a merry noise there would be should they wake all the fowls she dreaded any commotion any questioning this night so she stole carefully along till they issued on the highroad not far from home    chapter 13   in the morning after bathing siegmund leaned upon the seawall in a kind of reverie it was late towards nine oclock yet he lounged dreamily looking out on the turquoise blue water and the white haze of morning and the small fair shadows of ships slowly realizing before him in the bay were two battleships uncouth monsters lying as naïve and curious as sealions strayed afar  siegmund was gazing oversea in a halfstupid way when he heard a voice beside him say  where have they come from do you know sir  he turned saw a fair slender man of some thirtyfive years standing beside him and smiling faintly at the battleships  the menofwar there are a good many at spithead said siegmund  the other glanced negligently into his face  they look rather incongruous dont you think we left the sea empty and shining and when we come again behold these objects keeping their eye on us  siegmund laughed  you are not an anarchist i hope he said jestingly  a nihilist perhaps laughed the other but i am quite fond of the czar if pity is akin to love no but you cant turn round without finding some policeman or other at your elbowlook at them abominable ironmongeryready to put his hand on your shoulder  the speakers greyblue eyes always laughing with mockery glanced from the battleships and lit on the dark blue eyes of siegmund the latter felt his heart lift in a convulsive movement this stranger ran so quickly to a perturbing intimacy  i suppose we are in the hands ofgod something moved siegmund to say the stranger contracted his eyes slightly as he gazed deep at the speaker  ah he drawled curiously then his eyes wandered over the wet hair the white brow and the bare throat of siegmund after which they returned again to the eyes of his interlocutor does the czar sail this way he asked at last  i do not know replied siegmund who troubled by the others penetrating gaze had not expected so trivial a question  i suppose the newspaper will tell us said the man  sure to said siegmund  you havent seen it this morning  not since saturday  the swift blue eyes of the man dilated he looked curiously at siegmund  you are not alone on your holiday  no siegmund did not like thishe gazed over the sea in displeasure  i live hereat least for the presentname hampson  why werent you one of the first violins at the savoy fifteen years back asked siegmund  they chatted awhile about music they had known each other had been fairly intimate and had since become strangers hampson excused himself for having addressed siegmund  i saw you with your nose flattened against the window he said and as i had mine in the same position too i thought we were fit to be reacquainted  siegmund looked at the man in astonishment  i only mean you were staring rather hard at nothing its a pity to try and stare out of a beautiful blue day like this dont you think  stare beyond it you mean asked siegmund  exactly replied the other with a laugh of intelligence i call a day like this the blue room its the least draughty apartment in all the confoundedly draughty house of life  siegmund looked at him very intently this hampson seemed to express something in his own soul  i mean the man explained that after all the great mass of life that washes unidentified and that we call death creeps through the blue envelope of the day and through our white tissue and we cant stop it once weve begun to leak  what do you mean by leak asked siegmund  goodness knowsi talk through my hat but once youve got a bit tired of the house you glue your nose to the windowpane and stare for the darkas you were doing  but to use your metaphor im not tired of the houseif you mean life said siegmund  praise god ive met a poet whos not afraid of having his pocket pickedor his soul or his brain said the stranger throwing his head back in a brilliant smile his eyes dilated  i dont know what you mean sir said siegmund very quietly with a strong fear and a fascination opposing each other in his heart  youre not tired of the house but of your own particular roomsay suite of rooms  tomorrow i am turned out of this blue room said siegmund with a wry smile the other looked at him seriously  dear lord exclaimed hampson then do you remember flauberts saint who laid naked against a leper i could not do it  nor i shuddered siegmund  but youve got toor something near it  siegmund looked at the other with frightened horrified eyes  what of yourself he said resentfully  ive funkedran away from my leper and now am eating my heart out and staring from the window at the dark  but cant you do something said siegmund  the other man laughed with amusement throwing his head back and showing his teeth  i wont ask you what your intentions are he said with delicate irony in his tone you know i am a tremendously busy man i earn five hundred a year by hard work but its no good if you have acquired a liking for intensity in life you cant do without it i mean vivid soul experience it takes the place with us of the old adventure and physical excitement  siegmund looked at the other man with baffled anxious eyes  well and what then he said  what then a craving for intense life is nearly as deadly as any other craving you become a concentré you feed your normal flame with oxygen and it devours your tissue the soulful ladies of romance are always semitransparent  siegmund laughed  at least i am quite opaque he said  the other glanced over his easy mature figure and strong throat  not altogether said hampson and you i should think are one whose flame goes nearly out when the stimulant is lacking  siegmund glanced again at him startled  you havent much reserve youre like a tree thatll flower till it kills itself the man continued youll run till you drop and then you wont get up again youve no dispassionate intellect to control you and economize  youre telling me very plainly what i am and am not said siegmund laughing rather sarcastically he did not like it  oh its only what i think replied hampson were a good deal alike you see and have gone the same way you married and i didnt but women have always done as they liked with me  thats hardly so in my case said siegmund  hampson eyed him critically  say one woman its enough he replied  siegmund gazed musing over the sea  the best sort of womenthe most interestingare the worst for us hampson resumed by instinct they aim at suppressing the gross and animal in us then they are supersensitiverefined a bit beyond humanity we who are as little gross as need be become their instruments life is grounded in them like electricity in the earth and we take from them their unrealized life turn it into light or warmth or power for them the ordinary woman is alone a great potential force an accumulator if you like charged from the source of life in us her force becomes evident  she cant live without us but she destroys us these deep interesting women dont want us they want the flowers of the spirit they can gather of us we as natural men are more or less degrading to them and to their love of us therefore they destroy the natural man in usthat is us altogether  youre a bit downright are you not asked siegmund deprecatingly he did not disagree with what his friend said nor tell him such statements were arbitrary  thats according to my intensity laughed hampson i can open the blue heaven with looking and push back the doors of day a little and seegod knows what one of these days i shall slip through oh i am perfectly sane i only strive beyond myself  dont you think its wrong to get like it asked siegmund  well i do and so does everybody but the crowd profits by us in the end when they understand my music it will be an education to them and the whole aim of mankind is to render life intelligible  siegmund pondered a little  you make me feelas if i were loose and a long way off from myself he said slowly  the young man smiled then looked down at the wall where his own hands lay white and fragile showing the blue veins  i can scarcely believe they are me he said if they rose up and refused me i should not be surprised but arent they beautiful  he looked with a faint smile at siegmund  siegmund glanced from the strangers to his own hands which lay curved on the seawall as if asleep they were small for a man of his stature but lying warm in the sun they looked particularly secure in life instinctively with a wave of selflove he closed his fists over his thumbs  i wonder said hampson softly with strange bitterness that she cant see it i wonder she doesnt cherish you you are full and beautiful enough in the fleshwhy will she help to destroy you when she loved you to such extremity  siegmund looked at him with awestricken eyes the frail swift man with his intensely living eyes laughed suddenly  foolsthe fools these women he said either they smash their own crystal or it revolts turns opaque and leaps out of their hands look at me i am whittled down to the quick but your neck is thick with compressed life it is a stem so tense with life that it will hold up by itself i am very sorry  all at once he stopped the bitter despair in his tone was the voice of a heavy feeling of which siegmund had been vaguely aware for some weeks siegmund felt a sense of doom he laughed trying to shake it off  i wish i didnt go on like this said hampson piteously i wish i could be normal how hot it is already you should wear a hat it is really hot he pulled open his flannel shirt  i like the heat said siegmund  so do i  directly the young man dashed the long hair on his forehead into some sort of order bowed and smiling in his gay fashion walked leisurely to the village  siegmund stood awhile as if stunned it seemed to him only a painful dream sighing deeply to relieve himself of the pain he set off to find helena    chapter 14   in the garden of tall rose trees and nasturtiums helena was again waiting it was past nine oclock so she was growing impatient to herself however she professed a great interest in a little book of verses she had bought in st martins lane for twopence      a late harsh blackbird smote him with her wings     as through the glade dim in the dark she flew  so she read she made a curious pleased sound and remarked to herself that she thought these verses very fine but she watched the road for siegmund      and now she takes the scissors on her thumb      oh then no more unto my lattice come  hm she said i really dont know whether i like that or not  therefore she read the piece again before she looked down the road  he really is very late it is absurd to think he may have got drowned but if he were washing about at the bottom of the sea his hair loose on the water  her heart stood still as she imagined this  but what nonsense i like these verses very much i will read them as i walk along the side path where i shall hear the bees and catch the flutter of a butterfly among the words that will be a very fitting way to read this poet  so she strolled to the gate glancing up now and again there sure enough was siegmund coming the towel hanging over his shoulder his throat bare and his face bright she stood in the mottled shade  i have kept you waiting said siegmund  well i was reading you see  she would not admit her impatience  i have been talking he said  talking she exclaimed in slight displeasure have you found an acquaintance even here  a fellow who was quite close friends in savoy days he made me feel queersort of doppelgänger he was  helena glanced up swiftly and curiously  in what way she said  he talked all the skeletons in the cupboardsuch piffle it seems now the sea is like a harebell and there are two battleships lying in the bay you can hear the voices of the men on deck distinctly well have you made the plans for today  they went into the house to breakfast she watched him helping himself to the scarlet and green salad  mrs curtiss she said in rather reedy tone has been very motherly to me this morning oh very motherly  siegmund who was in a warm gay mood shrank up  what has she been saying something about last night he asked  she was very much concerned for mewas afraid something dreadful had happened continued helena in the same keen sarcastic tone which showed she was trying to rid herself of her own mortification  because we werent in till about eleven said siegmund also with sarcasm  i mustnt do it again oh no i mustnt do it again really  for fear of alarming the old lady he asked  you know dear it troubles me a good deal  but if i were your mother i dont know how i should feel she quoted  when one engages rooms one doesnt usually stipulate for a stepmother to nourish ones conscience said siegmund they laughed making jest of the affair but they were both too thinskinned siegmund writhed within himself with mortification while helena talked as if her teeth were on edge  i dont mind in the least she said the poor old woman has her opinions and i mine  siegmund brooded a little  i know im a moral coward he said bitterly  nonsense she replied then with a little heat but you do continue to try so hard to justify yourself as if you felt you needed justification  he laughed bitterly  i tell youa little thing like thisit remains tied tight round something inside me reminding me for hourswell what everybody elses opinion of me is  helena laughed rather plaintively  i thought you were so sure we were right she said  he winced again  in myself i am but in the eyes of the world  if you feel so in yourself is not that enough she said brutally  he hung his head and slowly turned his serviettering  what is myself he asked  nothing very definite she said with a bitter laugh  they were silent after a while she rose went lovingly over to him and put her arms round his neck  this is our last clear day dear she said  a wave of love came over him sweeping away all the rest he took her in his arms  it will be hot today said helena as they prepared to go out  i felt the sun steaming in my hair as i came up he replied  i shall wear a hatyou had better do so too  no he said i told you i wanted a sunsoaking now i think i shall get one  she did not urge or compel him in these matters he was old enough to choose for himself  this morning they were rather silent each felt the tarnish on their remaining day  i think dear she said we ought to find the little path that escaped us last night  we were lucky to miss it he answered you dont get a walk like that twice in a lifetime in spite of the old ladies  she glanced up at him with a winsome smile glad to hear his words  they set off siegmund bareheaded he was dressed in flannels and a loose canvas shirt but he looked what he wasa londoner on holiday he had the appearance the diffident bearing and the wellcut clothes of a gentleman he had a slight stoop a strongshouldered stoop and as he walked he looked unseeing in front of him  helena belonged to the unclassed she was not ladylike nor smart nor assertive one could not tell whether she were of independent means or a worker one thing was obvious about her she was evidently educated  rather short of strong figure she was much more noticeably a concentrée than was siegmund unless definitely looking at something she always seemed coiled within herself  she wore a white voile dress made with the waist just below her breasts and the skirt dropping straight and clinging on her head was a large simple hat of burnt straw  through the openworked sleeves of her dress she could feel the sun bite vigorously  i wish you had put on a hat siegmund she said  why he laughed my hair is like a hood he ruffled it back with his hand the sunlight glistened on his forehead  on the higher paths a fresh breeze was energetically chasing the butterflies and driving the few small clouds disconsolate out of the sky the lovers stood for some time watching the people of the farm in the down below dip their sheep on this sunny morning there was a ragged noise of bleating from the flock penned in a corner of the yard two redarmed men seized a sheep hauled it to a large bath that stood in the middle of the yard and there held it more or less in the bath whilst a third man baled a dirty yellow liquid over its body the white legs of the sheep twinkled as it butted this way and that to escape the yellow douche the blueshirted men ducked and struggled there was a faint splashing and shouting to be heard even from a distance the farmers wife and children stood by ready to rush in with assistance if necessary  helena laughed with pleasure  that is really a very quaint and primitive proceeding she said it is cruder than theocritus  in an instant it makes me wish i were a farmer he laughed i think every man has a passion for farming at the bottom of his blood it would be fine to be plainminded to see no farther than the end of ones nose and to own cattle and land  would it asked helena sceptically  if i had a red face and went to sleep as soon as i sat comfortable i should love ithe said  it amuses me to hear you long to be stupid she replied  to have a simple slowmoving mind and an active life is the desideratum  is it she asked ironically  i would give anything to be like that he said  that is not to be yourself she said pointedly  he laughed without much heartiness  dont they seem a long way off he said staring at the bucolic scene they are farther than theocritusdown there is farther than sicily and more than twenty centuries from us i wish it werent  why do you she cried with curious impatience  he laughed  crossing the down scattered with dark bushes they came directly opposite the path through the furze  there it is she cried how could we miss it  ascribe it to the fairies he replied whistling the bird music out of siegfried then pieces of tristan they talked very little  she was tired when they arrived at a green naked hollow near the cliffs edge she said  this shall be our house today  welcome home said siegmund  he flung himself down on the high breezy slope of the dip looking out to sea helena sat beside him it was absolutely still and the wind was slackening more and more though they listened attentively they could hear only an indistinct breathing sound quite small from the water below no clapping nor hoarse conversation of waves siegmund lay with his hands beneath his head looking over the sparkling sea to put her page in the shadow helena propped her book against him and began to read  presently the breeze and siegmund dropped asleep the sun was pouring with dreadful persistence it beat and beat on helena gradually drawing her from her book in a confusion of thought she closed her eyes wearily longing for shade vaguely she felt a sympathy with adam in adam cast forth her mind traced again the tumultuous obscure strugglings of the two forth from eden through the primitive wildernesses and she felt sorrowful thinking of adam blackened with struggle she looked down at siegmund the sun was beating him upon the face and upon his glistening brow his two hands which lay out on the grass were full of blood the veins of his wrists purple and swollen with heat yet he slept on breathing with a slight panting motion helena felt deeply moved she wanted to kiss him as he lay helpless abandoned to the charge of the earth and the sky she wanted to kiss him and shed a few tears she did neither but instead moved her position so that she shaded his head cautiously putting her hand on his hair she found it warm quite hot as when you put your hand under a sitting hen and feel the hotfeathered bosom  it will make him ill she whispered to herself and she bent over to smell the hot hair she noticed where the sun was scalding his forehead she felt very pitiful and helpless when she saw his brow becoming inflamed with the sunscalding  turning weariedly away she sought relief in the landscape but the sea was glittering unbearably like a scaled dragon wreathing the houses of freshwater slept as cattle sleep motionless in the hollow valley green farringford on the slope was drawn over with a shadow of heat and sleep in the bay below the hill the sea was hot and restless helena was sick with sunshine and the restless glitter of water  and there shall be no more sea she quoted to herself she knew not wherefrom  no more sea no more anything she thought dazedly as she sat in the midst of this fierce welter of sunshine it seemed to her as if all the lightness of her fancy and her hope were being burned away in this tremendous furnace leaving her helena like a heavy piece of slag seamed with metal she tried to imagine herself resuming the old activities the old manner of living  it is impossible she said it is impossible what shall i be when i come out of this i shall not come out except as metal to be cast in another shape no more the same siegmund no more the same life what will become of uswhat will happen  she was roused from these semidelirious speculations in the sun furnace by siegmunds waking he opened his eyes took a deep breath and looked smiling at helena  it is worth while to sleep said he for the sake of waking like this i was dreaming of huge icecrystals  she smiled at him he seemed unconscious of fate happy and strong she smiled upon him almost in condescension  i should like to realize your dream she said this is terrible  they went to the cliffs edge to receive the cool upflow of air from the water she drank the travelling freshness eagerly with her face and put forward her sunburnt arms to be refreshed  it is really a very fine sun said siegmund lightly i feel as if i were almost satisfied with heat  helena felt the chagrin of one whose wretchedness must go unperceived while she affects a light interest in anothers pleasure this time when siegmund failed to follow her as she put it she felt she must follow him  you are having your satisfaction complete this journey she said smiling even a sufficiency of me  ay said siegmund drowsily i think i am i think this is about perfect dont you  she laughed  i want nothing more and nothing different he continued and thats the extreme of a decent time i should think  the extreme of a decent time she repeated  but he drawled on lazily  ive only rubbed my bread on the cheeseboard until now now ive got all the cheesewhich is you my dear  i certainly feel eaten up she laughed rather bitterly she saw him lying in a royal ease his eyes naïve as a boys his whole being careless although very glad to see him thus happy for herself she felt very lonely being listless with sunweariness and heavy with a sense of impending fate she felt a great yearning for his sympathy his fellowsuffering instead of receiving this she had to play to his buoyant happiness so as not to shrivel one petal of his flower or spoil one minute of his consummate hour  from the high point of the cliff where they stood they could see the path winding down to the beach and broadening upwards towards them slowly approaching up the slight incline came a black invalids chair wheeling silently over the short dry grass the invalid a young man was so much deformed that already his soul seemed to be wilting in his pale sharp face as if there were not enough lifeflow in the distorted body to develop the fair bud of the spirit he turned his painsunken eyes towards the sea whose meaning like that of all things was half obscure to him siegmund glanced and glanced quickly away before he should see helena looked intently for two seconds she thought of the torn shrivelled seaweed flung above the reach of the tidethe life tide she said to herself the pain of the invalid overshadowed her own distress she was fretted to her soul  come she said quietly to siegmund no longer resenting the completeness of his happiness which left her unnecessary to him  we will leave the poor invalid in possession of our green hollowso quiet she said to herself  they sauntered downwards towards the bay helena was brooding on her own state after her own fashion  the mist spirit she said to herself the mist spirit draws a curtain round usit is very kind a heavy gold curtain sometimes a thin torn curtain sometimes i want the mist spirit to close the curtain again i do not want to think of the outside i am afraid of the outside and i am afraid when the curtain tears open in rags i want to be in our own fine world inside the heavy gold mistcurtain  as if in answer or in protest to her thoughts siegmund said  do you want anything better than this dear shall we come here next year and stay for a whole month  if there be any next year said she  siegmund did not reply  she wondered if he had really spoken in sincerity or if he too were mocking fate they walked slowly through the broiling sun towards their lodging  there will be an end to this said helena communing with herself and when we come out of the mistcurtain what will it be no matterlet come what will all along fate has been resolving from the very beginning resolving obvious discords gradually by unfamiliar progression and out of original combinations weaving wondrous harmonies with our lives really the working out has been wondrous is wondrous now the masterfate is too great an artist to suffer an anticlimax i am sure the mastermusician is too great an artist to allow a bathetic anticlimax    chapter 15   the afternoon of the blazing day passed drowsily lying close together on the beach siegmund and helena let the day exhale its hours like perfume unperceived siegmund slept a light evanescent sleep irised with dreams and with suffering nothing definite the colour of dreams without shape helena as usual retained her consciousness much more clearly she watched the faroff floating of ships and the near wading of children through the surf endless trains of thoughts like little waves rippled forward and broke on the shore of her drowsiness but each thoughtripple though it ran lightly was tinged with coppercoloured gleams as from a lurid sunset helena felt that the sun was setting on her and siegmund the hour was too composed spellbound for grief or anxiety or even for close perception she was merely aware that the sun was wheeling down tangling siegmund and her in the traces like overthrown charioteers so the hours passed  after tea they went eastwards on the downs siegmund was animated so that helena caught his mood it was very rare that they spoke of the time preceding their acquaintance helena knew little or nothing of siegmunds life up to the age of thirty whilst he had never learned anything concerning her childhood somehow she did not encourage him to selfdiscovery today however the painful need of lovers for selfrevelation took hold on him  it is awfully funny he said i was so gone on beatrice when i married her she had only just come back from egypt her father was an army officer a very handsome man and i believe a bit of a rake beatrice is really well connected you know but old fitzherbert ran through all his money and through everything else he was too hot for the rest of the family so they dropped him altogether  he came to live at peckham when i was sixteen i had just left school and was to go into fathers business mrs fitzherbert left cards and very soon we were acquainted beatrice had been a good time in a french convent school she had only knocked about with the army a little while but it had brought her out i remember i thought she was miles above mewhich she was she wasnt badlooking either and you know men all like her i bet shed marry again in spite of the children  at first i fluttered round her i remember id got a little silky moustache they all said i looked older than sixteen at that time i was mad on the violin and she played rather well then fitzherbert went off abroad somewhere so beatrice and her mother half lived at our house the mother was an invalid  i remember i nearly stood on my head one day the conservatory opened off the smokingroom so when i came in the room i heard my two sisters and beatrice talking about goodlooking men  i consider bertram will make a handsome man said my younger sister  hes got beautiful eyes said my other sister  and a real darling nose and chin cried beatrice if only he was more solide he is like a windmill all limbs  he will fill out remember hes not quite seventeen said my elder sister  ah he is douxhe is câlin said beatrice  i think he is rather too spoony for his age said my elder sister  but hes a fine boy for all that see how thick his knees are my younger sister chimed in  ah si si cried beatrice  i made a row against the door then walked across  hello is somebody in here i said as i pushed into the little conservatory  i looked straight at beatrice and she at me we seemed to have formed an alliance in that look she was the other half of my consciousness i of hers ha ha there were a lot of white narcissus and little white hyacinths roman hyacinths in the conservatory i can see them now great white stars and tangles of little ones among a bank of green and i can recall the keen fresh scent on the warm air and the look of beatrice  her great dark eyes  its funny but beatrice is as deaday far more deadthan dantes and i am not that young fool not a bit  i was very romantic fearfully emotional and the soul of honour beatrice said nobody cared a thing about her fitzherbert was always jaunting off the mother was a fretful invalid so i was seventeen earning half a guinea a week and she was eighteen with no money when we ran away to brighton and got married poor old pater he took it awfully well i have been a frightful drag on him you know  theres the romance i wonder how it will all end  helena laughed and he did not detect her extreme bitterness of spirit  they walked on in silence for some time he was thinking back before helenas day this left her very much alone and forced on her the idea that after all love which she chose to consider as single and wonderful a thing in a mans life as birth or adolescence or death was temporary and formed only an episode it was her hour of disillusion  come to think of it siegmund continued i have always shirked whenever ive been in a tight corner ive gone to pater  i think she said marriage has been a tight corner you couldnt get out of to go to anybody  yet im here he answered simply  the blood suffused her face and neck  and some men would have made a better job of it when its come to sticking out against beatrice and sailing the domestic ship in spite of her ive always funked i tell you im something of a moral coward  he had her so much on edge she was inclined to answer so be it instead she ran back over her own history it consisted of petty discords in contemptible surroundings then of her dreams and fancies finallysiegmund  in my life she said with the fine grating discord in her tones i might say always the real life has seemed just outsidebrownies running and fairies peepingjust beyond the common ugly place where i am i seem to have been hedged in by vulgar circumstances able to glimpse outside now and then and see the reality  you are so hard to get at said siegmund and so scornful of familiar things  she smiled knowing he did not understand the heat had jaded her so that physically she was full of discord of dreariness that set her teeth on edge body and soul she was out of tune  a warm noiseless twilight was gathering over the downs and rising darkly from the sea fate with wide wings was hovering just over her fate ashen grey and black like a carrion crow had her in its shadow yet siegmund took no notice he did not understand he walked beside her whistling to himself which only distressed her the more  they were alone on the smooth hills to the east helena looked at the day melting out of the sky leaving the permanent structure of the night it was her turn to suffer the sickening detachment which comes after moments of intense living  the rosiness died out of the sunset as embers fade into thick ash in herself too the ruddy glow sank and went out the earth was a cold dead heap coloured drearily the sky was dark with flocculent grey ash and she herself an upright mass of soft ash  she shuddered slightly with horror the whole face of things was to her livid and ghastly being a moralist rather than an artist coming of fervent wesleyan stock she began to scourge herself she had done wrong again looking back no one had she touched without hurting she had a destructive force anyone she embraced she injured faint voices echoed back from her conscience the shadows were full of complaint against her it was all true she was a harmful force dragging fate to petty mean conclusions  life and hope were ash in her mouth she shuddered with discord despair grated between her teeth this dreariness was worse than any her dreary lonely life had known she felt she could bear it no longer  siegmund was there surely he could help he would rekindle her but he was straying ahead carelessly whistling the spring song from die walküre she looked at him and again shuddered with horror was that really siegmund that stooping thickshouldered indifferent man was that the siegmund who had seemed to radiate joy into his surroundings the siegmund whose coming had always changed the whole weather of her soul was that the siegmund whose touch was keen with bliss for her whose face was a panorama of passing god she looked at him again his radiance was gone his aura had ceased she saw him a stooping man past the buoyancy of youth walking and whistling rather stupidlyin short something of the clothed animal on end like the rest of men  she suffered an agony of disillusion was this the real siegmund and her own only a projection of her soul she took her breath sharply was he the real clay and that other her beloved only the breathing of her soul upon this there was an awful blank before her  siegmund she said in despair  he turned sharply at the sound of her voice seeing her face pale and distorted in the twilight he was filled with dismay she mutely lifted her arms to him watching him in despair swiftly he took her in his arms and asked in a troubled voice  what is it dear is something wrong  his voice was nothing to herit was stupid she felt his arms round her felt her face pressed against the cloth of his coat against the beating of his heart what was all this this was not comfort or love he was not understanding or helping only chaining her hurting she did not want his brute embraceshe was most utterly alone gripped so in his arms if he could not save her from herself he must leave her free to pant her heart out in free air the secret thud thud of his heart the very self of that animal in him she feared and hated repulsed her she struggled to escape  what is it wont you tell me what is the matter he pleaded  she began to sob dry wild sobs feeling as if she would go mad he tried to look at her face for which she hated him and all the time he held her fast all the time she was imprisoned in the embrace of this brute blind creature whose heart confessed itself in thud thud thud  have you heard anything against us have i done anything have i said anything tell meat any rate tell me helena  her sobbing was like the chattering of dry leaves she grew frantic to be free stifled in that prison any longer she would choke and go mad his coat chafed her face as she struggled she could see the strong working of his throat she fought against him she struggled in panic to be free  let me go she cried let me go let me go he held her in bewilderment and terror she thrust her hands in his chest and pushed him apart her face blind to him was very much distorted by her suffering she thrust him furiously away with great strength  his heart stood still with wonder she broke from him and dropped down sobbing wildly in the shelter of the tumuli she was bunched in a small shaken heap siegmund could not bear it he went on one knee beside her trying to take her hand in his and pleading  only tell me helena what it is tell me what it is at least tell me helena tell me what it is oh but this is dreadful  she had turned convulsively from him she shook herself as if beside herself and at last covered her ears with her hands to shut out this unreasoning pleading of his voice  seeing her like this siegmund at last gave in quite still he knelt on one knee beside her staring at the late twilight the intense silence was crackling with the sound of helenas dry hissing sobs he remained silenced stunned by the unnatural conflict after waiting a while he put his hand on her she winced convulsively away  then he rose saying in his heart it is enough he went behind the small hill and looked at the night it was all exposed he wanted to hide to cover himself from the openness and there was not even a bush under which he could find cover  he lay down flat on the ground pressing his face into the wiry turf trying to hide quite stunned with a death taking place in his soul he lay still pressed against the earth he held his breath for a long time before letting it go then again he held it he could scarcely bear even by breathing to betray himself his consciousness was dark  helena had sobbed and struggled the life animation back into herself at length weary but comfortable she lay still to rest almost she could have gone to sleep but she grew chilly and a ground insect tickled her face was somebody coming  it was dark when she rose siegmund was not in sight she tidied herself and rather frightened went to look for him she saw him like a thick shadow on the earth now she was heavy with tears good to shed she stood in silent sorrow looking at him  suddenly she became aware of someone passing and looking curiously at them  dear she said softly stooping and touching his hair he began to struggle with himself to respond at that minute he would rather have died than face anyone his soul was too much uncovered  dear someone is looking she pleaded  he drew himself up from cover but he kept his face averted they walked on  forgive me dear she said softly  nay its not you he answered and she was silenced they walked on till the night seemed private she turned to him and siegmund she said in a voice of great sorrow and pleading  he took her in his arms but did not kiss her though she lifted her face he put his mouth against her throat below the ear as she offered it and stood looking out through the ravel of her hair dazed dreamy  the sea was smoking with darkness under halfluminous heavens the stars one after another were catching alight siegmund perceived first one and then another dimmer one flicker out in the darkness over the sea he stood perfectly still watching them gradually he remembered how in the cathedral the tapers of the choirstalls would tremble and set steadily to burn opening the darkness point after point with yellow drops of flame as the acolyte touched them one by one delicately with his rod the night was religious then with its proper order of worship day and night had their ritual and passed in uncouth worship  siegmund found himself in an abbey he looked up the nave of the night where the sky came down on the sealike arches and he watched the stars catch fire at least it was all sacred whatever the god might be helena herself the bitter bread was stuff of the ceremony which he touched with his lips as part of the service  he had helena in his arms which was sweet company but in spirit he was quite alone she would have drawn him back to her and on her womans breast have hidden him from fate and saved him from searching the unknown but this night he did not want comfort if he were an infant crying in the night it was crying that a woman could not still he was abroad seeking courage and faith for his own soul he in loneliness must search the night for faith  my fate is finely wrought out he thought to himself even damnation may be finely imagined for me in the night i have come so far now i must get clarity and courage to follow out the theme i dont want to botch and bungle even damnation  but he needed to know what was right what was the proper sequence of his acts staring at the darkness he seemed to feel his course though he could not see it he bowed in obedience the stars seemed to swing softly in token of submission    chapter 16   feeling him abstract withdrawn from her helena experienced the dread of losing him she was in his arms but his spirit ignored her that was insufferable to her pride yet she dared not disturb himshe was afraid bitterly she repented her of the giving way to her revulsion a little space before why had she not smothered it and pretended why had she a woman betrayed herself so flagrantly now perhaps she had lost him for good she was consumed with uneasiness  at last she drew back from him held him her mouth to kiss as he gently sadly kissed her she pressed him to her bosom she must get him back whatever else she lost she put her hand tenderly on his brow  what are you thinking of she asked  i he replied i really dont know i suppose i was hardly thinking anything  she waited a while clinging to him then finding some difficulty in speech she asked  was i very cruel dear  it was so unusual to hear her grieved and filled with humility that he drew her close into him  it was pretty bad i suppose he replied but i should think neither of us could help it  she gave a little sob pressed her face into his chest wishing she had helped it then with madonna love she clasped his head upon her shoulder covering her hands over his hair twice she kissed him softly in the nape of the neck with fond reassuring kisses all the while delicately she fondled and soothed him till he was child to her madonna  they remained standing with his head on her shoulder for some time till at last he raised himself to lay his lips on hers in a long kiss of healing and renewallong pale kisses of aftersuffering  someone was coming along the path helena let him go shook herself free turned sharply aside and said  shall we go down to the water  if you like he replied putting out his hand to her they went thus with clasped hands down the cliff path to the beach  there they sat in the shadow of the uprising island facing the restless water around them the sand and shingle were grey there stretched a long pale line of surf beyond which the sea was black and smeared with starreflections the deep velvety sky shone with lustrous stars  as yet the moon was not risen helena proposed that they should lie on a tuft of sand in a black cleft of the cliff to await its coming they lay close together without speaking each was looking at a low large star which hung straight in front of them dripping its brilliance in a thin streamlet of light along the sea almost to their feet it was a starpath fine and clear trembling in its brilliance but certain upon the water helena watched it with delight as siegmund looked at the star it seemed to him a lantern hung at the gate to light someone home he imagined himself following the thread of the startrack what was behind the gate  they heard the wash of a steamer crossing the bay the water seemed populous in the nighttime with dark uncanny comings and goings  siegmund was considering  what was the matter with you he asked  she leaned over him took his head in her lap holding his face between her two hands as she answered in a low grave voice very wise and old in experience  why you see dear you wont understand but there was such a greyish darkness and through itthe crying of lives i have touched  his heart suddenly shrank and sank down she acknowledged then that she also had helped to injure beatrice and his children he coiled with shame  a crying of lives against me and i couldnt silence them nor escape out of the darkness i wanted youi saw you in front whistling the spring song but i couldnt find youit was not youi couldnt find you  she kissed his eyes and his brows  no i dont see it he said you would always be you i could think of hating you but youd still be yourself  she made a moaning loving sound full of passionate pity she moved her mouth on his face as a woman does on her child that has hurt itself  sometimes she murmured in a low grieved confession you lose me  he gave a brief laugh  i lose you he repeated you mean i lose my attraction for you or my hold over you and then you  he did not finish she made the same grievous murmuring noise over him  it shall not be any more she said  all right he replied since you decide it  she clasped him round the chest and fondled him distracted with pity  you mustnt be bitter she murmured  four days is enough he said in a fortnight i should be intolerable to you i am not masterful  it is not so siegmund she said sharply  i give way always he repeated and thentonight  tonight tonight she cried in wrath tonight i have been a fool  and i he asked  youwhat of you she cried then she became sad i have little perverse feelings she lamented  and i cant bear to compel anything for fear of hurting it so im always pushed this way and that like a fool  you dont know how you hurt me talking so she said  he kissed her after a moment he said  you are not like other folk ihr lascheks seid ein anderes geschlecht i thought of you when we read it  would you rather have me more like the rest or more unlike siegmund which is it  neither he said you are you  they were quiet for a space the only movement in the night was the faint gambolling of starlight on the water the last person had passed in black silhouette between them and the sea  he was thinking bitterly she seemed to goad him deeper and deeper into life he had a sense of despair a preference of death the german she read with himshe loved its loose and violent romancecame back to his mind der tod geht einem zur seite fast sichtbarlich und jagt einem immer tiefer ins leben  well the next place he would be hunted to like a hare run down was home it seemed impossible the morrow would take him back to beatrice  this time tomorrow night he said  siegmund she implored  why not he laughed  dont dear she pleaded  all right i wont  some large steamer crossing the mouth of the bay made the water dash a little as it broke in accentuated waves a warm puff of air wandered in on them now and again  you wont be tired when you go back helena asked  tired he echoed  you know how you were when you came she reminded him in tones full of pity he laughed  oh that is gone he said  with a slow mechanical rhythm she stroked his cheek  and will you be sad she said hesitating  sad he repeated  but will you be able to fake the old life up happier when you go back  the old life will take me up i suppose he said  there was a pause  i think dear she said i have done wrong  good lordyou have not he replied sharply pressing back his head to look at her for the first time  i shall have to send you back to beatrice and the babiestomorrowas you are now  take no thought for the morrow be quiet helena he exclaimed as the reality bit him he sat up suddenly  why she asked afraid  why he repeated he remained sitting leaning forward on the sand staring intently at helena she looked back in fear at him the moment terrified her and she lost courage  with a fluttered motion she put her hand on his which was pressed hard on the sand as he leaned forward at once he relaxed his intensity laughed then became tender  helena yielded herself like a forlorn child to his arms and there lay half crying while he smoothed her brow with his fingers and grains of sand fell from his palm on her cheek she shook with dry withered sobs as a child does when it snatches itself away from the lancet of the doctor and hides in the mothers bosom refusing to be touched  but she knew the morrow was coming whether or not and she cowered down on his breast she was wild with fear of the parting and the subsequent days they must drink after tomorrow separate cups she was filled with vague terror of what it would be the sense of the oneness and unity of their fates was gone  siegmund also was cowed by the threat of separation he had more definite knowledge of the next move than had helena his heart was certain of calamity which would overtake him directly he shrank away wildly he beat about to find a means of escape from the next day and its consequences he did not want to go anything rather than go back  in the midst of their passion of fear the moon rose siegmund started to see the rim appear ruddily beyond the sea his struggling suddenly ceased and he watched spellbound the oval horn of fiery gold come up resolve itself some golden liquor dripped and spilled upon the far waves where it shook in ruddy splashes the goldred cup rose higher looming before him very large yet still not all discovered by degrees the horn of gold detached itself from the darkness at back of the waves it was immense and terrible when would the tip be placed upon the table of the sea  it stood at last whole and calm before him then the night took up this drinkingcup of fiery gold lifting it with majestic movement overhead letting stream forth the wonderful unwasted liquor of gold over the seaa libation  siegmund looked at the shaking flood of gold and paling gold spread wider as the night upraised the blanching crystal poured out farther and farther the immense libation from the whitening cup till at last the moon looked frail and empty  and there exhaustless in the night the white light shook on the floor of the sea he wondered how it would be gathered up i gather it up into myself he said and the stars and the cliffs and a few trees were watching too if i have spilled my life he thought the unfamiliar eyes of the land and sky will gather it up again  turning to helena he found her face white and shining as the empty moon    chapter 17   towards morning siegmund went to sleep for four hours until seven oclock the womb of sleep received him and nourished him again  but it is finest of all to wake he said as the bright sunshine of the window and the lumining green sunshine coming through the lifted hands of the leaves challenged him into the open  the morning was exceedingly fair and it looked at him so gently that his blue eyes trembled with selfpity a fragment of scarlet geranium glanced up at him as he passed so that amid the vermilion tyranny of the uniform it wore he could see the eyes of the flower wistful offering him love as one sometimes see the eyes of a man beneath the brass helmet of a soldier and is startled everything looked at him with the same eyes of tenderness offering him timidly a little love  they are all extraordinarily sweet said siegmund to the fullmouthed scabious and the awkward downcast ragwort three or four butterflies fluttered up and down in agitated little leaps around him instinctively siegmund put his hand forward to touch them  the careless little beggars he said  when he came to the cliff tops there was the morning very bravely dressed rustling forward with a silken sound and much silken shining to meet him the battleships had gone the sea was blue with a panier of diamonds the sky was full with a misty tenderness like love siegmund had never recognized before the affection that existed between him and everything we do not realize how tremendously dear and indispensable to us are the hosts of common things till we must leave them and we break our hearts  we have been very happy together everything seemed to say  siegmund looked up into the eyes of the morning with a laugh  it is very lovely he said whatever happens  so he went down to the beach his dark blue eyes darker from last nights experience smiled always with the pride of love he undressed by his usual altarstone  how closely familiar everything is he thought it seems almost as if the curves of this stone were rounded to fit in my soul  he touched the smooth white slope of the stone gently with discovering fingers in the same way as he touched the cheek of helena or of his own babies he found great pleasure in this feeling of intimacy with things a very soft wind shy as a girl put his arms round him and seemed to lay its cheek against his chest he placed his hands beneath his arms where the wind was caressing him and his eyes opened with wondering pleasure  they find no fault with me he said i suppose they are as fallible as i and so dont judge he added as he waded thighdeep into the water thrusting it to hear the mockangry remonstrance  once more he said and he took the sea in his arms he swam very quietly the water buoyed him up holding him closely clasped he swam towards the white rocks of the headlands they rose before him like beautiful buttressed gates so glistening that he half expected to see fantail pigeons puffing like white irises in the niches and white peacocks with dark green feet stepping down the terraces trailing a sheen of silver  helena is right he said to himself as he swam scarcely swimming but moving upon the bosom of the tide she is right it is all enchanted i have got into her magic at last let us see what it is like  he determined to visit again his little bay he swam carefully round the terraces whose pale shadows through the swiftspinning emerald facets of the water seemed merest fancy siegmund touched them with his foot they were hard cold dangerous he swam carefully as he made for the archway the shadows of the headland chilled the water there under water clamouring in a throng at the base of the submerged walls were seawomen with dark locks and young seagirls with soft hair vividly green striving to climb up out of the darkness into the morning their hair swirling in abandon siegmund was half afraid of their frantic efforts  but the tide carried him swiftly through the high gate into the porch there was exultance in this sweeping entry the skinwhite fullfleshed walls of the archway were dappled with green lights that danced in and out among themselves siegmund was carried along in an invisible chariot beneath the jewelstained walls the tide swerved threw him as he swam against the inwardcurving white rock his elbow met the rock and he was sick with pain he held his breath trying to get back the joy and magic he could not believe that the lovely smooth side of the rock fair as his own side with its ripple of muscles could have hurt him thus he let the water carry him till he might climb out on to the shingle there he sat upon a warm boulder and twisted to look at his arm the skin was grazed not very badly merely a ragged scarlet patch no bigger than a carnation petal the bruise however was painful especially when a minute or two later he bent his arm  no said he pitiably to himself it is impossible it should have hurt me i suppose i was careless  nevertheless the aspect of the morning changed he sat on the boulder looking out on the sea the azure sky and the sea laughed on holding a bright conversation one with another the two headlands of the tiny bay gossiped across the street of water all the boulders and pebbles of the seashore played together  surely said siegmund they take no notice of me they do not care a jot or a tittle for me i am a fool to think myself one with them  he contrasted this with the kindness of the morning as he had stood on the cliffs  i was mistaken he said it was an illusion  he looked wistfully out again like neighbours leaning from opposite windows of an overhanging street the headlands were occupied one with another white rocks strayed out to sea followed closely by other white rocks everything was busy interested occupied with its own pursuit and with its own comrades siegmund alone was without pursuit or comrade  they will all go on the same they will be just as gay even helena after a while will laugh and take interest in others what do i matter  siegmund thought of the futility of death      we are not long for music and laughter       love and desire and hate     i think we have no portion in them after       we pass the gate  why should i be turned out of the game he asked himself rebelling he frowned and answered oh lordthe old argument  but the thought of his own expunging from the picture was very bitter  like the puff from the steamers funnel i should be gone  he looked at himself at his limbs and his body in the pride of his maturity he was very beautiful to himself  nothing in the place where i am he said gone like a puff of steam that melts on the sunshine  again siegmund looked at the sea it was glittering with laughter as at a joke  and i he said lying down in the warm sand i am nothing i do not count i am inconsiderable  he set his teeth with pain there were no tears there was no relief a convulsive gasping shook him as he lay on the sands all the while he was arguing with himself  well he said if i am nothing dead i am nothing alive  but the vulgar proverb arosebetter a live dog than a dead lion to answer him it seemed an ignominy to be dead it meant to be overlooked even by the smallest creature of gods earth surely that was a great ignominy  helena meanwhile was bathing for the last time by the same seashore with him she was no swimmer her endless delight was to explore to discover small treasures for her the world was still a great wonderbox which hid innumerable sweet toys for surprises in all its crevices she had bathed in many rockpools tepid baths trying first one then another she had lain on the sand where the cold arms of the ocean lifted her and smothered her impetuously like an awful lover  the sea is a great deal like siegmund she said as she rose panting trying to dash her nostrils free from water it was true the sea as it flung over her filled her with the same uncontrollable terror as did siegmund when he sometimes grew silent and strange in a tide of passion  she wandered back to her rockpools they were bright and docile they did not fling her about in a game of terror she bent over watching the anemones fleshy petals shrink from the touch of her shadow and she laughed to think they should be so needlessly fearful the flowing tide trickled noiselessly among the rocks widening and deepening insidiously her little pools helena retreated towards a large cave round the bend there the water gurgled under the bladderwrack of the large stones the air was cool and clammy she pursued her way into the gloom bending though there was no need shivering at the coarse feel of the seaweed beneath her naked feet the water came rustling up beneath the fucus as she crept along on the big stones it returned with a quiet gurgle which made her shudder though even that was not disagreeable it needed for all that more courage than was easy to summon before she could step off her stone into the black pool that confronted her it was festooned thick with weeds that slid under her feet like snakes she scrambled hastily upwards towards the outlet  turning the ragged arch was before heir brighter than the brightest window it was easy to believe the lightfairies stood outside in a throng excited with fine fear throwing handfuls of light into the dragons hole  how surprised they will be to see me said helena scrambling forward laughing  she stood still in the archway astounded the sea was blazing with white fire and glowing with azure as coals glow red with heat below the flames the sea was transfused with white burning while over it hung the blue sky in a glory like the blue smoke of the fire of god helena stood still and worshipped it was a moment of astonishment when she stood breathless and blinded involuntarily offering herself for a thankoffering she felt herself confronting god at home in his white incandescence his fire settling on her like the holy spirit her lips were parted in a womans joy of adoration  the moment passed and her thoughts hurried forward in confusion  it is good said helena it is very good she looked again and saw the waves like a line of children racing hand in hand the sunlight pursuing catching hold of them from behind as they ran wildly till they fell caught with the sunshine dancing upon them like a white dog  it is really wonderful here said she but the moment had gone she could not see again the grand burning of god among the waves after a while she turned away  as she stood dabbling her bathingdress in a pool siegmund came over the beach to her  you are not gone then he said  siegmund she exclaimed looking up at him with radiant eyes as if it could not be possible that he had joined her in this rare place his face was glowing with the suns inflaming but helena did not notice that his eyes were full of misery  i actually he said smiling  i did not expect you she said still looking at him in radiant wonder i could easier have expectedshe hesitated struggled and continuederos walking by the sea but you are like him she said looking radiantly up into siegmunds face isnt it beautiful this morning she added  siegmund endured her wide glad look for a moment then he stooped and kissed her he remained moving his hand in the pool ashamed and full of contradiction he was at the bitter point of farewell could see beyond the glamour around him the ugly building of his real life  isnt the sea wonderful this morning asked helena as she wrung the water from her costume  it is very fine he answered he refrained from saying what his heart said it is my last morning it is not yours it is my last morning and the sea is enjoying the joke and you are full of delight  yes said siegmund the morning is perfect  it is assented helena warmly have you noticed the waves they are like a line of children chased by a white dog  ay said siegmund  didnt you have a good time she asked touching with her fingertips the nape of his neck as he stooped beside her  i swam to my little bay again he replied  did you she exclaimed pleased  she sat down by the pool in which she washed her feet free from sand holding them to siegmund to dry  i am very hungry she said  and i he agreed  i feel quite established here she said gaily something in his position having reminded her of their departure  he laughed  it seems another eternity before the threefortyfive train doesnt it she insisted  i wish we might never go back he said  helena sighed  it would be too much for life to give we have had something siegmund she said  he bowed his head and did not answer  it has been something dear she repeated  he rose and took her in his arms  everything he said his face muffled in the shoulder of her dress he could smell her fresh and fine from the sea everything he said  she pressed her two hands on his head  i did well didnt i siegmund she asked helena felt the responsibility of this holiday she had proposed it when he had withdrawn she had insisted refusing to allow him to take back his word declaring that she should pay the cost he permitted her at last  wonderfully well helena he replied  she kissed his forehead  you are everything he said  she pressed his head on her bosom    chapter 18   siegmund had shaved and dressed and come down to breakfast mrs curtiss brought in the coffee she was a fragile little woman of delicate gentle manner  the water would be warm this morning she said addressing no one in particular  siegmund stood on the hearthrug with his hands behind him swaying from one leg to the other he was embarrassed always by the presence of the amiable little woman he could not feel at ease before strangers in his capacity of accepted swain of helena  it was assented helena it was as warm as new milk  ay it would be said the old lady looking in admiration upon the experience of siegmund and his beloved and did ye see the ships of war she asked  no they had gone replied helena  siegmund swayed from foot to foot rhythmically  youll be coming in to dinner today asked the old lady  helena arranged the matter  i think ye both look better mrs curtiss said she glanced at siegmund  he smiled constrainedly  i thought ye looked so worn when you came she said sympathetically  he had been working hard said helena also glancing at him  he bent his head and was whistling without making any sound  ay sympathized the little woman and its a very short time for you what a pity ye cant stop for the fireworks at cowes on monday they are grand so they say  helena raised her eyebrows in polite interest have you never seen them she asked  no replied mrs curtiss ive never been able to get but i hope to go yet  i hope you may said siegmund  the little woman beamed on him having won a word from him she was quite satisfied  well she said brightly the eggs must be done by now  she tripped out to return directly  ive brought you she said some of the island cream and some white currants if yell have them you must think well of the island and come back  how could we help laughed helena  we will smiled siegmund  when finally the door was closed on her siegmund sat down in relief helena looked in amusement at him she was perfectly selfpossessed in presence of the delightful little lady  this is one of the few places that has ever felt like home to me she said she lifted a tangled bunch of fine white currants  ah exclaimed siegmund smiling at her  one of the few places where everything is friendly she said and everybody  you have made so many enemies he asked with gentle irony  strangers she replied i seem to make strangers of all the people i meet  she laughed in amusement at this mot siegmund looked at her intently he was thinking of her left alone amongst strangers  need we goneed we leave this place of friends he said as if ironically he was very much afraid of tempting her  she looked at the clock on the mantelpiece and counted one two three four five hours thirtyfive minutes it is an age yet she laughed  siegmund laughed too as he accepted the particularly fine bunch of currants she had extricated for him    chapter 19   the air was warm and sweet in the little lane remote from the sea which led them along their last walk on either side the white path was a grassy margin thickly woven with pink convolvuli some of the reckless little flowers so gay and evanescent had climbed the trunks of an old yew tree and were looking up pertly at their rough host  helena walked along watching the flowers and making fancies out of them  who called them fairies telephones she said to herself they are tiny children in pinafores how gay they are they are children dawdling along the pavement of a morning how fortunate they are see how they take a windthrill see how wide they are set to the sunshine and when they are tired they will curl daintily to sleep and some fairies in the dark will gather them away they wont be here in the morning shrivelled and dowdy  if only we could curl up and be gone after our day  she looked at siegmund he was walking moodily beside her  it is good when life holds no anticlimax she said  ay he answered of course he could not understand her meaning  she strayed into the thick grass a sturdy white figure that walked with bent head abstract but happy  what is she thinking he asked himself she is sufficient to herselfshe doesnt want me she has her own private way of communing with things and is friends with them  the dew has been very heavy she said turning and looking up at him from under her brows like a smiling witch  i see it has he answered then to himself he said she cant translate herself into language she is incommunicable she cant render herself to the intelligence so she is alone and a law unto herself she only wants me to explore me like a rockpool and to bathe in me after a while when i am gone she will see i was not indispensable  the lane led up to the eastern down as they were emerging they saw on the left hand an extraordinarily spick and span red bungalow the low roof of dusky red sloped down towards the coolest green lawn that was edged and ornamented with scarlet and yellow and white flowers brilliant with dew  a stout man in an alpaca jacket and panama hat was seated on the bare lawn his back to the sun reading a newspaper he tried in vain to avoid the glare of the sun on his reading at last he closed the paper and looked angrily at the housenot at anything in particular  he irritably read a few more lines then jerked up his head in sudden decision glared at the open door of the house and called  amy amy  no answer was forthcoming he flung down the paper and strode off indoors his mien one of wrathful resolution his voice was heard calling curtly from the diningroom there was a jingle of crockery as he bumped the table leg in sitting down  he is in a bad temper laughed siegmund  breakfast is late said helena with contempt  look said siegmund  an elderly lady in black and white striped linen a young lady in holland both carrying some wild flowers hastened towards the garden gate their faces were turned anxiously to the house they were hot with hurrying and had no breath for words the girl pressed forward opened the gate for the lady in striped linen who hastened over the lawn then the daughter followed and vanished also under the shady veranda  there was a quick sound of womens low apologetic voices overridden by the resentful abuse of the man  the lovers moved out of hearing  imagine that breakfasttable said siegmund  i feel said helena with a keen twang of contempt in her voice as if a fussy cock and hens had just scuffled across my path  there are many such roosts said siegmund pertinently  helenas cold scorn was very disagreeable to him she talked to him winsomely and very kindly as they crossed the open down to meet the next incurving of the coast and siegmund was happy but the sense of humiliation which he had got from her the day before and which had fixed itself bled him secretly like a wound this haemorrhage of selfesteem tortured him to the end  helena had rejected him she gave herself to her fancies only for some time she had confused siegmund with her god yesterday she had cried to her ideal lover and found only siegmund it was the spear in the side of his tortured selfrespect  at least he said in mortification of himselfat least someone must recognize a strain of god in meand who does i dont believe in it myself  and moreover in the intense joy and suffering of his realized passion the island with its sea and sky had fused till like a brilliant bead all their beauty ran together out of the common ore and siegmund saw it naked saw the beauty of everything naked in the shifting magic of this bead the island would be gone tomorrow he would look for the beauty and find the dirt what was he to do  you know domine said helenait was his old nickname she usedyou look quite stern today  i feel anything but stern he laughed weaker than usual in fact  yes perhaps so when you talk then you are really surprisingly gentle but when you are silent i am even afraid of youyou seem so grave  he laughed  and shall i not be brave he said cant you smell fumum et opes strepitumque romae he turned quickly to helena i wonder if thats right he said its years since i did a line of latin and i thought it had all gone  in the first place what does it mean said helena calmly for i can only half translate i have thrown overboard all my scrapbooks of such stuff  why said siegmund rather abashed only the row and the smoke of rome but it is remarkable helenahere the peculiar look of interest came on his face againit is really remarkable that i should have said that  yes you look surprised smiled she  but it must be twentyhe countedtwentytwo or three years since i learned that and i forgot itgoodness knows how long ago like a drowning man i have these memories before he broke off smiling mockingly to tease her  before you go back to london said she in a matteroffact almost ironical tone she was inscrutable this morning she could not bear to let any deep emotion come uppermost she wanted rest no she said with calm distinctness a few moments after when they were climbing the rise to the cliffs edge i cant say that i smell the smoke of london the mistcurtain is thick yet there it isshe pointed to the heavy purplegrey haze that hung like arras on a wall between the sloping sky and the sea she thought of yesterday mornings mistcurtain thick and blazing gold so heavy that no wind could sway its fringe  they lay down in the dry grass upon the gold bits of birdsfoot trefoil of the cliffs edge and looked out to sea a warm drowsy calm drooped over everything  six hours thought helena and we shall have passed the mistcurtain already it is thinning i could break it open with waving my hand i will not wave my hand  she was exhausted by the suffering of the last night so she refused to allow any emotion to move her this morning till she was strong siegmund was also exhausted but his thoughts laboured like ants in spite of himself striving towards a conclusion  helena had rejected him in his heart he felt that in this love affair also he had been a failure no matter how he contradicted himself and said it was absurd to imagine he was a failure as helenas lover yet he felt a physical sensation of defeat a kind of knot in his breast which neither reason nor dialectics nor circumstance not even helena could untie he had failed as lover to helena  it was not surprising his marriage with beatrice should prove disastrous rushing into wedlock as he had done at the ripe age of seventeen he had known nothing of his woman nor she of him when his mind and soul set to develop as beatrice could not sympathize with his interests he naturally inclined away from her so that now after twenty years he was almost a stranger to her that was not very surprising  but why should he have failed with helena  the bees droned fitfully over the scented grass aimlessly swinging in the heat siegmund watched one gold and amber fellow lazily let go a white cloverhead and boom in a careless curve out to sea humming softer and softer as he reeled along in the giddy space  the little fool said siegmund watching the black dot swallowed into the light  no ship sailed the curving sea the light danced in a whirl upon the ripples everything else watched with heavy eyes of heat enhancement the wild spinning of the lights  even if i were free he continued to think we should only grow apart helena and i she would leave me this time i should be the laggard she is young and vigorous i am beginning to set  is that why i have failed i ought to have had her in love sufficiently to keep her these few days i am not quick i do not follow her or understand her swiftly enough and i am always timid of compulsion i cannot compel anybody to follow me  so we are here i am out of my depth like the bee i was mad with the sight of so much joy such a blue space and now i shall find no footing to alight on i have flown out into life beyond my strength to get back when can i set my feet on when this is gone  the sun grew stronger slower and more slowly went the hawks of siegmunds mind after the quarry of conclusion he lay bareheaded looking out to sea the sun was burning deeper into his face and head  i feel as if it were burning into me thought siegmund abstractedly it is certainly consuming some part of me perhaps it is making me ill meanwhile perversely he gave his face and his hot black hair to the sun  helena lay in what shadow he afforded the heat put out all her thoughtactivity presently she said  this heat is terrible siegmund shall we go down to the water  they climbed giddily down the cliff path already they were somewhat sunintoxicated siegmund chose the hot sand where no shade was on which to lie  shall we not go under the rocks said helena  look he said the sun is beating on the cliffs it is hotter more suffocating there  so they lay down in the glare helena watching the foam retreat slowly with a cool splash siegmund thinking the naked body of heat was dreadful  my arms siegmund said she they feel as if they were dipped in fire  siegmund took them without a word and hid them under his coat  are you sure it is not bad for youyour head siegmund are you sure  he laughed stupidly  that is all right he said he knew that the sun was burning through him and doing him harm but he wanted the intoxication  as he looked wistfully far away over the sea at helenas mistcurtain he said  i think we should be able to keep together ifhe falteredif only i could have you a little longer i have never had you   some sound of failure some tone telling her it was too late some ring of despair in his quietness made helena cling to him wildly with a savage little cry as if she were wounded she clung to him almost beside herself she could not lose him she could not spare him she would not let him go helena was for the moment frantic  he held her safely saying nothing until she was calmer when with his lips on her cheek he murmured  i should be able shouldnt i helena  you are always able she cried it is i who play with you at hiding  i have really had you so little he said  cant you forget it siegmund she cried cant you forget it it was only a shadow siegmund it was a lie it was nothing real cant you forget it dear  you cant do without me he asked  if i lose you i am lost answered she with swift decision she had no knowledge of weeping yet her tears were wet on his face he held her safely her arms were hidden under his coat  i will have no mercy on those shadows the next time they come between us said helena to herself they may go back to hell  she still clung to him craving so to have him that he could not be reft away  siegmund felt very peaceful he lay with his arms about her listening to the backwardcreeping tide all his thoughts like bees were flown out to sea and lost  if i had her more i should understand her through and through if we were side by side we should grow together if we could stay here i should get stronger and more upright  this was the poor heron of quarry the hawks of his mind had struck  another hour fell like a foxglove bell from the stalk there were only two red blossoms left then the stem would have set to seed helena leaned her head upon the breast of siegmund her arms clasping under his coat his body which swelled and sank gently with the quiet of great power  if thought she the whole clock of the world could stand still now and leave us thus me with the lift and fall of the strong body of siegmund in my arms  but the clock ticked on in the heat the seconds marked off by the falling of the waves repeated so lightly and in such fragile rhythm that it made silence sweet  if now prayed siegmund death would wipe the sweat from me and it were dark  but the waves softly marked the minutes retreating farther leaving the bare rocks to bleach and the weed to shrivel  gradually like the shadow on a dial the knowledge that it was time to rise and go crept upon them although they remained silent each knew that the other felt the same weight of responsibility the shadowfinger of the sundial travelling over them the alternative was not to return to let the finger travel and be gone but then  helena knew she must not let the time cross her she must rise before it was too late and travel before the coming finger siegmund hoped she would not get up he lay in suspense waiting  at last she sat up abruptly  it is time siegmund she said  he did not answer he did not look at her but lay as she had left him she wiped her face with her handkerchief waiting then she bent over him he did not look at her she saw his forehead was swollen and inflamed with the sun very gently she wiped from it the glistening sweat he closed his eyes and she wiped his cheeks and his mouth still he did not look at her she bent very close to him feeling her heart crushed with grief for him  we must go siegmund she whispered  all right he said but still he did not move  she stood up beside him shook herself and tried to get a breath of air she was dazzled blind by the sunshine  siegmund lay in the bright light with his eyes closed never moving his face was inflamed but fixed like a mask  helena waited until the terror of the passing of the hour was too strong for her she lifted his hand which lay swollen with heat on the sand and she tried gently to draw him  we shall be too late she said in distress  he sighed and sat up looking out over the water  helena could not bear to see him look so vacant and expressionless she put her arm round his neck and pressed his head against her skirt  siegmund knew he was making it unbearable for her pulling himself together he bent his head from the sea and said  why what time is it  he took out his watch holding it in his hand helena still held his left hand and had one arm round his neck  i cant see the figures he said everything is dimmed as if it were coming dark  yes replied helena in that reedy painful tone of hers my eyes were the same it is the strong sunlight  i cant he repeated and he was rather surprisedi cant see the time can you  she stooped down and looked  it is half past one she said  siegmund hated her voice as she spoke there was still sufficient time to catch the train he stood up moved inside his clothing saying i feel almost stunned by the heat i can hardly see and all my feeling in my body is dulled  yes answered helena i am afraid it will do you harm  at any rate he smiled as if sleepily i have had enough if its too muchwhat is too much  they went unevenly over the sand their eyes sundimmed  we are going backwe are going back the heart of helena seemed to run hot beating these words  they climbed the cliff path toilsomely standing at the top on the edge of the grass they looked down the cliffs at the beach and over the sea the strand was wide forsaken by the sea forlorn with rocks bleaching in the sun and sand and seaweed breathing off their painful scent upon the heat the sea crept smaller farther away the sky stood still siegmund and helena looked hopelessly out on their beautiful incandescent world they looked hopelessly at each other siegmunds mood was gentle and forbearing he smiled faintly at helena then turned and lifting his hand to his mouth in a kiss for the beauty he had enjoyed addio he said  he turned away and looking from helena landwards he said smiling peculiarly  it reminds me of traviataan addio at every verseend  she smiled with her mouth in acknowledgement of his facetious irony it jarred on her he was pricked again by her supercilious reserve addiiiio addiiio he whistled between his teeth hissing out the italians passionnotes in a way that made helena clench her fists  i suppose she said swallowing and recovering her voice to check this discordi suppose we shall have a fairly easy journeythursday  i dont know said siegmund  there will not be very many people she insisted  i think he said in a very quiet voice youd better let me go by the southwestern from portsmouth while you go on by the brighton  but why she exclaimed in astonishment  i dont want to sit looking at you all the way he said  but why should you she exclaimed  he laughed  indeed no she said we shall go together  very well he answered  they walked on in silence towards the village as they drew near the little post office he said  i suppose i may as well wire them that i shall be home tonight  you havent sent them any word she asked  he laughed they came to the open door of the little shop he stood still not entering helena wondered what he was thinking  shall i he asked meaning should he wire to beatrice his manner was rather peculiar  well i should think so faltered helena turning away to look at the postcards in the window siegmund entered the shop it was dark and cumbered with views cheap china ornaments and toys he asked for a telegraph form  my god he said to himself bitterly as he took the pencil he could not sign the abbreviated name his wife used towards him he scribbled his surname as he would have done to a stranger as he watched the amiable stout woman counting up his words carefully pointing with her finger he felt sick with irony  thats right she said picking up the sixpence and taking the form to the instrument what beautiful weather she continued it will be making you sorry to leave us  there goes my warrant thought siegmund watching the flimsy bit of paper under the postmistresss heavy hand  yesit is too bad isnt it he replied bowing and laughing to the woman  it is sir she answered pleasantly good morning  he came out of the shop still smiling and when helena turned from the postcards to look at him the lines of laughter remained over his face like a mask she glanced at his eyes for a sign his facial expression told her nothing his eyes were just as inscrutable which made her falter with dismay  what is he thinking of she asked herself her thoughts flashed back and why did he ask me so peculiarly whether he should wire them at home  well said siegmund are there any postcards  none that i care to take she replied perhaps you would like one of these  she pointed to some fadedlooking cards which proved to be imaginary views of alum bay done in variegated sand siegmund smiled  i wonder if they dribbled the sand on with a fine glass tube he said  or a brush said helena  she does not understand said siegmund to himself and whatever i do i must not tell her i should have thought she would understand  as he walked home beside her there mingled with his other feelings resentment against her almost he hated her    chapter 20   at first they had a carriage to themselves they sat opposite each other with averted faces looking out of the windows and watching the houses the downs dead asleep in the sun the embankments of the railway with exhausted hot flowers go slowly past out of their reach they felt as if they were being dragged away like criminals unable to speak or think they stared out of the windows helena struggling in vain to keep back her tears siegmund labouring to breathe normally  at yarmouth the door was snatched open and there was a confusion of shouting and running a swarm of humanity clamouring attached itself at the carriage doorway which was immediately blocked by a stout man who heaved a leather bag in front of him as he cried in german that here was room for all faces innumerablehot blueeyed facesstrained to look over his shoulders at the shocked girl and the amazed siegmund  there entered eight germans into the secondclass compartment five men and three ladies when at last the luggage was stowed away they sank into the seats the last man on either side to be seated lowered himself carefully like a wedge between his two neighbours siegmund watched the stout man the one who had led the charge settling himself between his large lady and the small helena the latter crushed herself against the side of the carriage the germans hips came down tight against her she strove to lessen herself against the window to escape the pressure of his flesh whose heat was transmitted to her the man squeezed in the opposite direction  i am afraid i press you he said smiling in his gentle chivalric german fashion helena glanced swiftly at him she liked his grey eyes she liked the agreeable intonation and the pleasant sound of his words  oh no she answered you do not crush me  almost before she had finished the words she turned away to the window the man seemed to hesitate a moment as if recovering himself from a slight rebuff before he could address his lady with the goodhumoured remark in german well and have we not managed it very nicely eh  the whole party began to talk in german with great animation they told each other of the quaint ways of this or the other they joked loudly over billythis being a nickname discovered for the german emperorand what he would be saying of the czars trip they questioned each other and answered each other concerning the places they were going to see with great interest displaying admirable knowledge they were pleased with everything they extolled things english  helenas stout neighbour who it seemed was from dresden began to tell anecdotes he was a raconteur of the naïve type he talked with face hands with his whole body now and again he would give little spurts in his seat after one of these he must have become aware of helenawho felt as if she were enveloped by a soft stovestruggling to escape his compression he stopped short lifted his hat and smiling beseechingly said in his persuasive way  i am sorry i am sorry i compress you he glanced round in perplexity seeking some escape or remedy finding none he turned to her again after having squeezed hard against his lady to free helena and said  forgive me i am sorry  you are forgiven replied helena suddenly smiling into his face with her rare winsomeness the whole party attentive relaxed into a smile at this the good humour was complete  thank you said the german gratefully  helena turned away the talk began again like the popping of corn the raconteur resumed his anecdote everybody was waiting to laugh helena rapidly wearied of trying to follow the tale siegmund had made no attempt he had watched with the others the germans apologies and the sight of his lovers face had moved him more than he could tell  she had a peculiar childish wistfulness at times and with this an intangible aloofness that pierced his heart it seemed to him he should never know her there was a remoteness about her an estrangement between her and all natural daily things as if she were of an unknown race that never can tell its own story this feeling always moved siegmunds pity to its deepest leaving him poignantly helpless this same foreignness revealed in other ways sometimes made him hate her it was as if she would sacrifice him rather than renounce her foreign birth there was something in her he could never understand so that never never could he say he was master of her as she was of him the mistress  as she smiled and turned away from the german mute uncomplaining like a child wise in sorrow beyond its years siegmunds resentment against her suddenly took fire and blazed him with sheer pain of pity she was very small her quiet ways and sometimes her impetuous clinging made her seem small for she was very strong but siegmund saw her now small quiet uncomplaining living for him who sat and looked at her but what would become of her when he had left her when she was alone little foreigner as she was in this world which apologizes when it has done the hurt too blind to see beforehand helena would be left behind death was no way for her she could not escape thus with him from this house of strangers which she called life she had to go on alone like a foreigner who cannot learn the strange language  what will she do siegmund asked himself when her loneliness comes upon her like a horror and she has no one to go to she will come to the memory of me for a while and that will take her over till her strength is established but what then  siegmund could find no answer he tried to imagine her life it would go on after his death just in the same way for a while and then he had not the faintest knowledge of how she would develop what would she do when she was thirtyeight and as old as himself he could not conceive yet she would not die of that he was certain  siegmund suddenly realized that he knew nothing of her life her real inner life she was a book written in characters unintelligible to him and to everybody he was tortured with the problem of her till it became acute and he felt as if his heart would burst inside him as a boy he had experienced the same sort of feeling after wrestling for an hour with a problem in euclid for he was capable of great concentration  he felt helena looking at him turning he found her steady unswerving eyes fixed on him so that he shrank confused from them she smiled by an instinctive movement she made him know that she wanted him to hold her hand he leaned forward and put his hand over hers she had peculiar hands small with a strange delightful silkiness often they were cool or cold generally they lay unmoved within his clasp but then they were instinct with life not inert sometimes he would feel a peculiar jerking in his pulse very much like electricity when he held her hand occasionally it was almost painful and felt as if a little virtue were passing out of his blood but that he dismissed as nonsense  the germans were still rattling away perspiring freely wiping their faces with their handkerchiefs as they laughed moving inside their clothing which was sticking to their sides siegmund had not noticed them for some time he was so much absorbed but helena though she sympathized with her fellowpassengers was tormented almost beyond endurance by the noise the heat of her neighbours body the atmosphere of the crowded carriage and her own emotion the only thing that could relieve her was the hand of siegmund soothing her in its hold  she looked at him with the same steadiness which made her eyes feel heavy upon him and made him shrink she wanted his strength of nerve to support her and he submitted at once his one aim being to give her out of himself whatever she wanted    chapter 21   the tall white yachts in a throng were lounging off the roads of ryde it was near the regatta time so these proud creatures had flown loftily together and now flitted hither and thither among themselves like a concourse of tall women footing the waves with superb touch to siegmund they were very beautiful but removed from him as dancers crossing the windowlights are removed from the man who looks up from the street he saw the solent and the world of glamour flying gay as snow outside where inside was only siegmund tired dispirited without any joy  he and helena had climbed among coils of rope on to the prow of their steamer so they could catch a little spray of speed on their faces to stimulate them the sea was very bright and crowded white sails leaned slightly and filed along the roads two yachts with sails of amber floated it seemed without motion amid the eclipsed blue of the day small boats with red and yellow flags fluttered quickly trailing the sea with colour a pleasure steamer coming from cowes swung her soft stout way among the fleeting ships high in the background were menofwar a long line each one threading tiny triangles of flags through a sky dim with distance  it is all very glad said siegmund to himself but it seems to be fanciful  he was out of it already he felt detached from life he belonged to his destination it is always so we have no share in the beauty that lies between us and our goal  helena watched with poignant sorrow all the agitation of colour on the blue afternoon  we must leave it we must pass out of it she lamented over and over again each new charm she caught eagerly  i like the steady purpose of that brownsailed tramp she said to herself watching a laden coaster making for portsmouth  they were still among the small shipping of ryde siegmund and helena as they looked out became aware of a small motorlaunch heading across their course towards a yacht whose tall masts were drawn clean on the sky the eager launch its nose up as if to breathe was racing over the swell like a coursing dog a lady in white and a lad with dark head and white jersey were leaning in the bows a gentleman was bending over some machinery in the middle of the boat while the sailor in the low stern was also stooping forward attending to something the steamer was sweeping onwards huge above the water the dog of a boat was coursing straight across her track the lady saw the danger first stretching forward she seized the arm of the lad and held him firm making no sound but watching the forward menace of the looming steamer  look cried helena catching hold of siegmund he was already watching suddenly the steamer bell clanged the gentleman looked up with startled sunburned face then he leaped to the stern the launch veered it and the steamer closed together like a pair of scissors the lady still holding the boy looked up with an expressionless face at the high sweeping chisel of the steamers bows the husband stood rigid staring ahead no sound was to be heard save the rustling of water under the bows the scissors closed the launch skelped forward like a dog from in front of the traffic it escaped by a yard or two then like a dog it seemed to look round the gentleman in the stern glanced back quickly he was a handsome darkhaired man with dark eyes his face was as if carven out of oak set and greybrown then he looked to the steering of his boat no one had uttered a sound from the tiny boat coursing low on the water not a sound only tense waiting the launch raced out of danger towards the yacht the gentleman with a brief gesture put his man in charge again whilst he himself went forward to the lady he was a handsome man very proud in his movements and she in her bearing was prouder still she received him almost with indifference  helena turned to siegmund he took both her hands and pressed them whilst she looked at him with eyes blind with emotion she was white to the lips and heaving like the buoy in the wake of the steamer the noise of life had suddenly been hushed and each heart had heard for a moment the noiselessness of death how everyone was white and gasping they strove on every hand to fill the day with noise and the colour of life again  by jove that was a near thing  ah that has made me feel bad said a woman  a french yacht said somebody  helena was waiting for the voice of siegmund but he did not know what to say confused he repeated  that was a close shave  helena clung to him searching his face she felt his difference from herself there was something in his experience that made him different quiet with a peculiar expression as if he were pained  ah dear lord he was saying to himself how bright and whole the day is for them if god had suddenly put his hand over the sun and swallowed us up in a shadow they could not have been more startled that man with his fine whiteflannelled limbs and his dark head has no suspicion of the shadow that supports it all between the blueness of the sea and the sky he passes easy as a gull close to the fine white seamew of his mate amid red flowers of flags and soft birds of ships and slowmoving monsters of steamboats  for me the day is transparent and shrivelling i can see the darkness through its petals but for him it is a fresh bellflower in which he fumbles with delights like a bee  for me quivering in the interspaces of the atmosphere is the darkness the same that fills in my soul i can see death urging itself into life the shadow supporting the substance for my life is burning an invisible flame the glare of the light of myself as i burn on the fuel of death is not enough to hide from me the source and the issue for what is a life but a flame that bursts off the surface of darkness and tapers into the darkness again but the death that issues differs from the death that was the source at least i shall enrich death with a potent shadow if i do not enrich life  wasnt that woman fine said helena  so perfectly still he answered  the child realized nothing she said  siegmund laughed then leaned forward impulsively to her  i am always so sorry he said that the human race is urged inevitably into a deeper and deeper realization of life  she looked at him wondering what provoked such a remark  i guess she said slowly after a while that the man the sailor will have a bad time he was abominably careless  he was careful of something else just then said siegmund who hated to hear her speak in cold condemnation he was attending to the machinery or something  that was scarcely his first business said she rather sarcastic  siegmund looked at her she seemed very hard in judgementvery blind sometimes his soul surged against her in hatred  do you think the man wanted to drown the boat he asked  he nearly succeeded she replied  there was antagonism between them siegmund recognized in helena the world sitting in judgement and he hated it but after all he thought i suppose it is the only way to get along to judge the event and not the person i have a disease of sympathy a vice of exoneration  nevertheless he did not love helena as a judge he thought rather of the woman in the boat she was evidently one who watched the sources of life saw it great and impersonal  would the woman cry or hug and kiss the boy when she got on board he asked  i rather think not why she replied  i hope she didnt he said  helena sat watching the water spurt back from the bows she was very much in love with siegmund he was suggestive he stimulated her but to her mind he had not her own dark eyes of hesitation he was swift and proud as the wind she never realized his helplessness  siegmund was gathering strength from the thought of that other womans courage if she had so much restraint as not to cry out or alarm the boy if she had so much grace not to complain to her husband surely he himself might refrain from revealing his own fear of helena and from lamenting his hard fate  they sailed on past the chequered round towers the sea opened and they looked out to eastward into the seaspace siegmund wanted to flee he yearned to escape down the open ways before him yet he knew he would be carried on to london he watched the seaways closing up the shore came round the high old houses stood flat on the right hand the shore swept round in a sickle reaping them into the harbour there the old victory gay with myriad pointed pennons was harvested saved for a trophy  it is a dreadful thing thought siegmund to remain as a trophy when there is nothing more to do he watched the landingstages swooping nearer there were the trains drawn up in readiness at the other end of the train was london  he could scarcely bear to have helena before him for another two hours the suspense of that protracted farewell while he sat opposite her in the beating train would cost too much he longed to be released from her  they had got their luggage and were standing at the foot of the ladder in the heat of the engines and the smell of hot oil waiting for the crowd to pass on so that they might ascend and step off the ship on to the mainland  wont you let me go by the southwestern and you by the brighton asked siegmund hesitating repeating the mornings question  helena looked at him knitting her brows with misgiving and perplexity  no she replied let us go together  siegmund followed her up the iron ladder to the quay  there was no great crowd on the train they easily found a secondclass compartment without occupants he swung the luggage on the rack and sat down facing helena  now said he to himself i wish i were alone  he wanted to think and prepare himself  helena who was thinking actively leaned forward to him to say  shall i not go down to cornwall  by her soothing willingness to do anything for him siegmund knew that she was dogging him closely he could not bear to have his anxiety protracted  but you have promised louisa have you not he replied  oh well she said in the peculiar slighting tone she had when she wished to convey the unimportance of affairs not touching him  then you must go he said  but she began with harsh petulance i do not want to go down to cornwall with louisa and oliveshe accentuated the two namesafter this she added  then louisa will have no holidayand you have promised he said gravely  helena looked at him she saw he had decided that she should go  is my promise so very important she asked she glanced angrily at the three ladies who were hesitating in the doorway nevertheless the ladies entered and seated themselves at the opposite end of the carriage siegmund did not know whether he were displeased or relieved by their intrusion if they had stayed out he might have held helena in his arms for still another hour as it was she could not harass him with words he tried not to look at her but to think  the train at last moved out of the station as it passed through portsmouth siegmund remembered his coming down on the sunday it seemed an indefinite age ago he was thankful that he sat on the side of the carriage opposite from the one he had occupied five days before the afternoon of the flawless sky was ripening into evening the chimneys and the sides of the houses of portsmouth took on that radiant appearance which transfigures the end of day in town a rich bloom of light appears on the surfaces of brick and stone  it will go on thought siegmund being gay of an evening for ever and i shall miss it all  but as soon as the train moved into the gloom of the town station he began again  beatrice will be proud and silent as steel when i get home she will say nothing thank godnor shall i that will expedite matters there will be no interruptions  but we cannot continue together after this why should i discuss reasons for and against we cannot she goes to a cottage in the country already i have spoken of it to her i allow her all i can of my money and on the rest i manage for myself in lodgings in london very good  but when i am comparatively free i cannot live alone i shall want helena i shall remember the children if i have the one i shall be damned by the thought of the other this bruise on my mind will never get better helena says she would never come to me but she would out of pity for me i know she would  but then what then beatrice and the children in the country and me not looking after the children beatrice is thriftless she would be in endless difficulty it would be a degradation to me she would keep a red sore inflamed against me i should be a shameful thing in her mouth besides there would go all her strength she would not make any efforts he has brought it on us she would say let him see what the result is and things would go from bad to worse with them it would be a gangrene of shame  and helenai should have nothing but mortification when she was asleep i could not look at her she is such a strange incongruous creature but i should be responsible for her she believes in me as if i had the power of god what should i think of myself  siegmund leaned with his head against the window watching the country whirl past but seeing nothing he thought imaginatively and his imagination destroyed him he pictured beatrice in the country he sketched the morningbreakfast haphazard at a late hour the elder children rushing off without food miserable and untidy the youngest bewildered under her swift indifferent preparations for school he thought of beatrice in the evening worried and irritable her bills unpaid the work undone declaiming lamentably against the cruelty of her husband who had abandoned her to such a burden of care while he took his pleasure elsewhere  this line exhausted or intolerable siegmund switched off to the consideration of his own life in town he would go to america the agreement was signed with the theatre manager but america would be only a brief shutting of the eyes and closing of the mouth he would wait for the homecoming to helena and she would wait for him it was inevitable then would beginwhat he would never have enough money to keep helena even if he managed to keep himself their meetings would then be occasional and clandestine ah it was intolerable  if i were rich said siegmund all would be plain i would give each of my children enough and beatrice and we would go away but i am nearly forty i have no genius i shall never be rich round and round went his thoughts like oxen over a threshing floor treading out the grain gradually the chaff flew away gradually the corn of conviction gathered small and hard upon the floor  as he sat thinking helena leaned across to him and laid her hand on his knee  if i have made things more difficult she said her voice harsh with pain you will forgive me  he started this was one of the cruel cuts of pain that love gives filling the eyes with blood siegmund stiffened himself slowly he smiled as he looked at her childish plaintive lips and her large eyes haunted with pain  forgive you he repeated forgive you for five days of perfect happiness the only real happiness i have ever known  helena tightened her fingers on his knee she felt herself stinging with painful joy but one of the ladies was looking her curiously she leaned back in her place and turned to watch at the shocks of corn strike swiftly in long rows across her vision  siegmund also quivering turned his face to the window where the rotation of the wide seaflat helped the movement of his thought helena had interrupted him she had bewildered his thoughts from their hawking so that they struck here and there wildly among small pitiful prey that was useless conclusions which only hindered the bringing home of the final convictions  what will she do cried siegmund what will she do when i am gone what will become of her already she has no aim in life then she will have no object is it any good my going if i leave her behind what an inextricable knot this is but what will she do  it was a question she had aroused before a question which he could never answer indeed it was not for him to answer  they wound through the pass of the south downs as siegmund looking backward saw the northern slope of the downs swooping smoothly in a great broad bosom of sward down to the body of the land he warmed with sudden love for the earth there the great downs were naked like a breast leaning kindly to him the earth is always kind it loves us and would foster us like a nurse the downs were big and tender and simple siegmund looked at the farm folded in a hollow and he wondered what fortunate folk were there nourished and quiet hearing the vague roar of the train that was carrying him home  up towards arundel the cornfields of red wheat were heavy with gold it was evening when the green of the trees went out leaving dark shapes proud upon the sky but the red wheat was forged in the sunset hot and magnificent siegmund almost gloated as he smelled the ripe corn and opened his eyes to its powerful radiation for a moment he forgot everything amid the forging of red fields of gold in the smithy of the sunset like sparks poppies blew along the railwaybanks a crimson train siegmund waited through the meadows for the next wheatfield it came like the lifting of yellowhot metal out of the gloom of darkened grasslands  helena was reassured by the glamour of evening over ripe sussex she breathed the land now and then while she watched the sky the sunset was stately the blueeyed day with great limbs having fought its victory and won now mounted triumphant on its pyre and with white arms uplifted took the flames which leaped like blood about its feet the day died nobly so she thought  one gold cloud as an encouragement tossed to her followed the train  surely that cloud is for us said she as she watched it anxiously dark trees brushed between it and her while she waited in suspense it came unswerving from behind the trees  i am sure it is for us she repeated a gladness came into her eyes still the cloud followed the train she leaned forward to siegmund and pointed out the cloud to him she was very eager to give him a little of her faith  it has come with us quite a long way doesnt it seem to you to be travelling with us it is the golden hand it is the good omen  she then proceeded to tell him the legend from aylwin  siegmund listened and smiled the sunset was handsome on his face  helena was almost happy  i am right said he to himself i am right in my conclusions and helena will manage by herself afterwards i am right there is the hand to confirm it  the heavy train settled down to an easy unbroken stroke swinging like a greyhound over the level northwards all the time siegmund was mechanically thinking the wellknown movement from the valkyrie ride his whole self beating to the rhythm it seemed to him there was a certain grandeur in this flight but it hurt him with its heavy insistence of catastrophe he was afraid he had to summon his courage to sit quiet for a time he was reassured he believed he was going on towards the right end he hunted through the country and the sky asking of everything am i right am i right he did not mind what happened to him so long as he felt it was right what he meant by right he did not trouble to think but the question remained for a time he had been reassured then a dullness came over him when his thoughts were stupid and he merely submitted to the rhythm of the train which stamped him deeper and deeper with a brand of catastrophe  the sun had gone down over the west was a gush of brightness as the fountain of light bubbled lower the stars like specks of froth from the foaming of the day clung to the blue ceiling like spiders they hung overhead while the hosts of the gold atmosphere poured out of the hive by the western low door soon the hive was empty a hollow dome of purple with here and there on the floor a bright brushing of wingsa village then overhead the luminous starspider began to run  ah well thought siegmundhe was tiredif one bee dies in a swarm what is it so long as the hive is all right apart from the gold light and the hum and the colour of day what was i nothing apart from these rushings out of the hive along with swarm into the dark meadows of night gathering god knows what i was a pebble well the day will swarm in golden again with colour on the wings of every bee and humming in each activity the gold and the colour and sweet smell and the sound of life they exist even if there is no bee it only happens we see the iridescence on the wings of a bee it exists whether or not bee or no bee since the iridescence and the humming of life are always and since it was they who made me then i am not lost at least i do not care if the spark goes out the essence of the fire is there in the darkness what does it matter besides i have burned bright i have laid up a fine cell of honey somewherei wonder where we can never point to it but it is sowhat does it matter then  they had entered the north downs and were running through dorking towards leatherhead box hill stood dark in the dusky sweetness of the night helena remembered that here she and siegmund had come for their first walk together she would like to come again presently she saw the quick stilettos of stars on the small baffled river they ran between high embankments siegmund recollected that these were covered with roses of sharonthe large golden st johns wort of finest silk he looked and could just distinguish the fullblown delicate flowers ignored by the stars at last he had something to say to helena  do you remember he asked the roses of sharon all along here  i do replied helena glad he spoke so brightly werent they pretty  after a few moments of watching the bank she said  do you know i have never gathered one i think i should like to i should like to feel them and they should have an orangy smell  he smiled without answering  she glanced up at him smiling brightly  but shall we come down here in the morning and find some she asked she put the question timidly would you care to she added  siegmund darkened and frowned here was the pain revived again  no he said gently i think we had better not almost for the first time he did not make apologetic explanation  helena turned to the window and remained looking out at the spinning of the lights of the towns without speaking until they were near sutton then she rose and pinned on her hat gathering her gloves and her basket she was in spite of herself slightly angry being quite ready to leave the train she sat down to wait for the station siegmund was aware that she was displeased and again for the first time he said to himself ah well it must be so  she looked at him he was sad therefore she softened instantly  at least she said doubtfully i shall see you at the station  at waterloo he asked  no at wimbledon she replied in her metallic tone  but he began  it will be the best way for us she interrupted in the calm tone of conviction much better than crossing london from victoria to waterloo  very well he replied  he looked up a train for her in his little timetable  you will get in wimbledon 105leave 1040leave waterloo 1130 he said  very good she answered  the brakes were grinding they waited in a burning suspense for the train to stop  if only she will soon go thought siegmund it was an intolerable minute she rose everything was a red blur she stood before him pressing his hand then he rose to give her the bag as he leaned upon the windowframe and she stood below on the platform looking up at him he could scarcely breathe how long will it be he said to himself looking at the open carriage doors he hated intensely the lady who could not get a porter to remove her luggage he could have killed her he could have killed the dilatory guard at last the doors slammed and the whistle went the train started imperceptibly into motion  now i lose her said siegmund  she looked up at him her face was white and dismal  goodbye then she said and she turned away  siegmund went back to his seat he was relieved but he trembled with sickness we are all glad when intense moments are done with but why did she fling round in that manner stopping the keen note short what would she do    chapter 22   siegmund went up to victoria he was in no hurry to get down to wimbledon london was warm and exhausted after the hot day but this peculiar lukewarmness was not unpleasant to him he chose to walk from victoria to waterloo  the streets were like polished gunmetal glistened over with gold the taxicabs the wild cats of the town swept over the gleaming floor swiftly soon lessening in the distance as if scornful of the other clumsyfooted traffic he heard the merry clickclock of the swinging hansoms then the excited whirring of the motorbuses as they charged fulltilt heavily down the road their hearts as it seemed beating with trepidation they drew up with a sigh of relief by the kerb and stood there pantinggreat nervous clumsy things siegmund was always amused by the headlong floundering career of the buses he was pleased with this scampering of the traffic anything for distraction he was glad helena was not with him for the streets would have irritated her with their coarse noise she would stand for a long time to watch the rabbits pop and hobble along on the common at night but the tearing along of the taxis and the charge of a great motorbus was painful to her discords she said after the trees and sea she liked the glistening of the streets it seemed a fine alloy of gold laid down for pavement such pavement as drew near to the pure gold streets of heaven but this noise could not be endured near any wonderland  siegmund did not mind it it drummed out his own thoughts he watched the gleaming magic of the road raced over with shadows project itself far before him into the night he watched the people soldiers belted with scarlet went jauntily on in front there was a peculiar charm in their movement there was a soft vividness of life in their carriage it reminded siegmund of the soft swaying and lapping of a poised candleflame the women went blithely alongside occasionally in passing one glanced at him then in spite of himself he smiled he knew not why the women glanced at him with approval for he was ruddy besides he had that carelessness and abstraction of despair the eyes of the women said you are comely you are lovable and siegmund smiled  when the street opened at westminster he noticed the city sky a lovely deep purple and the lamps in the square steaming out a vapour of greygold light  it is a wonderful night he said to himself there are not two such in a year  he went forward to the embankment with a feeling of elation in his heart this purple and goldgrey world with the fluttering flamewarmth of soldiers and the quick brightness of women like lights that clip sharply in a draught was a revelation to him  as he leaned upon the embankment parapet the wonder did not fade but rather increased the trams one after another floated loftily over the bridge they went like great burning bees in an endless file into a hive past those which were drifting dreamily out while below on the black distorted water golden serpents flashed and twisted to and fro  ah said siegmund to himself it is far too wonderful for me here as well as by the sea the night is gorgeous and uncouth whatever happens the world is wonderful  so he went on amid all the vast miracle of movement in the city night the swirling of water to the sea the gradual sweep of the stars the floating of many lofty luminous cars through the bridged darkness like an army of angels filing past on one of gods campaigns the purring haste of the taxis the slightly dancing shadows of people siegmund went on slowly like a slow bullet winging into the heart of life he did not lose this sense of wonder not in the train nor as he walked home in the moonless dark  when he closed the door behind him and hung up his hat he frowned he did not think definitely of anything but his frown meant to him now for the beginning of hell  he went towards the diningroom where the light was and the uneasy murmur the clock with its deprecating suave chime was striking ten siegmund opened the door of the room beatrice was sewing and did not raise her head frank a tall thin lad of eighteen was bent over a book he did not look up vera had her fingers thrust in among her hair and continued to read the magazine that lay on the table before her siegmund looked at them all they gave no sign to show they were aware of his entry there was only that unnatural tenseness of people who cover their agitation he glanced round to see where he should go his wicker armchair remained by the fireplace his slippers were standing under the sideboard as he had left them siegmund sat down in the creaking chair he began to feel sick and tired  i suppose the children are in bed he said  his wife sewed on as if she had not heard him his daughter noisily turned over a leaf and continued to read as if she were pleasantly interested and had known no interruption siegmund waited with his slipper dangling from his hand looking from one to another  theyve been gone two hours said frank at last still without raising his eyes from his book his tone was contemptuous his voice was jarring not yet having developed a mans fullness  siegmund put on his slipper and began to unlace the other boot the slurring of the lace through the holes and the snacking of the tag seemed unnecessarily loud it annoyed his wife she took a breath to speak then refrained feeling suddenly her daughters scornful restraint upon her siegmund rested his arms upon his knees and sat leaning forward looking into the barren fireplace which was littered with paper and orangepeel and a bananaskin  do you want any supper asked beatrice and the sudden harshness of her voice startled him into looking at her  she had her face averted refusing to see him siegmunds heart went down with weariness and despair at the sight of her  arent you having any he asked  the table was not laid beatrices workbasket a little wicker fruitskep overflowed scissors and pins and scraps of holland and reels of cotton on the green serge cloth vera leaned both her elbows on the table  instead of replying to him beatrice went to the sideboard she took out a tablecloth pushing her sewing litter aside and spread the cloth over one end of the table vera gave her magazine a little knock with her hand  have you read this tale of a french convent school in here mother she asked  in where  in this months nashs  no replied beatrice what time have i for reading much less for anything else  you should think more of yourself and a little less of other people then said vera with a sneer at the other people she rose let me do this you sit down you are tired mother she said  her mother without replying went out to the kitchen vera followed her frank left alone with his father moved uneasily and bent his thin shoulders lower over his book siegmund remained with his arms on his knees looking into the grate from the kitchen came the chinking of crockery and soon the smell of coffee all the time vera was heard chatting with affected brightness to her mother addressing her in fond tones using all her wits to recall bright little incidents to retail to her beatrice answered rarely and then with utmost brevity  presently vera came in with the tray she put down a cup of coffee a plate with boiled ham pink and thin such as is bought from a grocer and some breadandbutter then she sat down noisily turning over the leaves of her magazine frank glanced at the table it was laid solely for his father he looked at the bread and the meat but restrained himself and went on reading or pretended to do so beatrice came in with the small cruet it was conspicuously bright  everything was correct knife and fork spoon cruet all perfectly clean the crockery fine the bread and butter thinin fact it was just as it would have been for a perfect stranger this scrupulous neatness in a household so slovenly and easygoing where it was an established tradition that something should be forgotten or wrong impressed siegmund beatrice put the serving knife and fork by the little dish of ham saw that all was proper then went and sat down her face showed no emotion it was calm and proud she began to sew  what do you say mother said vera as if resuming a conversation shall it be hampton court or richmond on sunday  i say as i said before replied beatrice i cannot afford to go out  but you must begin my dear and sunday shall see the beginning dîtes donc  there are other things to think of said beatrice  now maman nous avons changé tout cela we are going outa jolly little razzle vera who was rather handsome lifted up her face and smiled at her mother gaily  i am afraid there will be no razzlebeatrice accented the word smiling slightlyfor me you are slangy vera  un doux argot ma mère you look tired  beatrice glanced at the clock  i will go to bed when i have cleared the table she said  siegmund winced he was still sitting with his head bent down looking in the grate vera went on to say something more presently frank looked up at the table and remarked in his grating voice  theres your supper father  the women stopped and looked round at this siegmund bent his head lower vera resumed her talk it died out and there was silence  siegmund was hungry  oh good lord good lord bread of humiliation tonight he said to himself before he could muster courage to rise and go to the table he seemed to be shrinking inwards the women glanced swiftly at him and away from him as his chair creaked and he got up frank was watching from under his eyebrows  siegmund went through the ordeal of eating and drinking in presence of his family if he had not been hungry he could not have done it despite the fact that he was content to receive humiliation this night he swallowed the coffee with effort when he had finished he sat irresolute for some time then he arose and went to the door  good night he said  nobody made any reply frank merely stirred in his chair siegmund shut the door and went  there was absolute silence in the room till they heard him turn on the tap in the bathroom then beatrice began to breathe spasmodically catching her breath as if she would sob but she restrained herself the faces of the two children set hard with hate  he is not worth the flicking of your little finger mother said vera  beatrice moved about with pitiful groping hands collecting her sewing and her cottons  at any rate hes come back red enough said frank in his grating tone of contempt hes like boiled salmon  beatrice did not answer anything frank rose and stood with his back to the grate in his fathers characteristic attitude  he would come slinking back in a funk he said with a young mans sneer  stretching forward he put a piece of ham between two pieces of bread and began to eat the sandwich in large bites vera came to the table at this and began to make herself a more dainty sandwich frank watched her with jealous eyes  there is a little more ham if youd like it said beatrice to him i kept you some  all right ma he replied fetch it in  beatrice went out to the kitchen  and bring the bread and butter too will you called vera after her  the damned coward aint he a rotten funker said frank sotto voce while his mother was out of the room  vera did not reply but she seemed tacitly to agree  they petted their mother while she waited on them at length frank yawned he fidgeted a moment or two then he went over to his mother and putting his hand on her armthe feel of his mothers round arm under the black silk sleeve made his tears risehe said more gratingly than ever  neer mind ma well be all right to you then he bent and kissed her good night mother he said awkwardly and he went out of the room  beatrice was crying    chapter 23   i shall never reestablish myself said siegmund as he closed behind him the diningroom door and went upstairs in the dark i am a family criminal beatrice might come round but the childrens insolent judgement is too much and i am like a dog that creeps round the house from which it escaped with joy i have nowhere else to go why did i come back but i am sleepy i will not bother tonight  he went into the bathroom and washed himself everything he did gave him a grateful sense of pleasure notwithstanding the misery of his position he dipped his arms deeper into the cold water that he might feel the delight of it a little farther his neck he swilled time after time and it seemed to him he laughed with pleasure as the water caught him and fell away the towel reminded him how sore were his forehead and his neck blistered both to a state of rawness by the sun he touched them very cautiously to dry them wincing and smiling at his own childish touchandshrink  though his bedroom was very dark he did not light the gas instead he stepped out into the small balcony his shirt was open at the neck and wrists he pulled it farther apart baring his chest to the deliciously soft night he stood looking out at the darkness for some time the night was as yet moonless but luminous with a certain atmosphere of light the stars were small near at hand large shapes of trees rose up farther lamps like little mushroom groups shone amid an undergrowth of darkness there was a vague hoarse noise filling the sky like the whispering in a shell and this breathing of the summer night occasionally swelled into a restless sigh as a train roared across the distance  what a big night thought siegmund the night gathers everything into a oneness i wonder what is in it  he leaned forward over the balcony trying to catch something out of the night he felt his soul like tendrils stretched out anxiously to grasp a hold what could he hold to in this great hoarse breathing night a star fell it seemed to burst into sight just across his eyes with a yellow flash he looked up unable to make up his mind whether he had seen it or not there was no gap in the sky  it is a good signa shooting star he said to himself it is a good sign for me i know i am right that was my sign  having assured himself he stepped indoors unpacked his bag and was soon in bed  this is a good bed he said and the sheets are very fresh  he lay for a little while with his head bending forwards looking from his pillow out at the stars then he went to sleep  at half past six in the morning he suddenly opened his eyes  what is it he asked and almost without interruption answered well ive got to go through it  his sleep had shaped him perfect premonition which like a dream he forgot when he awoke only this naïve question and answer betrayed what had taken place in his sleep immediately he awoke this subordinate knowledge vanished  another fine day was striding in triumphant the first thing siegmund did was to salute the morning because of its brightness the second thing was to call to mind the aspect of that bay in the isle of wight what would it just be like now said he to himself he had to give his heart some justification for the peculiar pain left in it from his sleep activity so he began poignantly to long for the place which had been his during the last mornings he pictured the garden with roses and nasturtiums he remembered the sunny way down the shore and all the expanse of sea hung softly between the tall white cliffs  it is impossible it is gone he cried to himself it cant be gone i looked forward to it as if it never would come it cant be gone now helena is not lost to me surely then he began a long pining for the departed beauty of his life he turned the jewel of memory and facet by facet it wounded him with its brilliant loveliness this pain though it was keen was half pleasure  presently he heard his wife stirring she opened the door of the room next to his and he heard her  frank its a quarter to eight you will be late  all right mother why didnt you call me sooner grumbled the lad  i didnt wake myself i didnt go to sleep till morning and then i slept  she went downstairs siegmund listened for his son to get out of bed the minutes passed  the young donkey why doesnt he get out said siegmund angrily to himself he turned over pressing himself upon the bed in anger and humiliation because now he had no authority to call to his son and keep him to his duty siegmund waited writhing with anger shame and anxiety when the suave velvety pannn pannnn of the clock was heard striking frank stepped with a thud on to the floor he could be heard dressing in clumsy haste beatrice called from the bottom of the stairs  do you want any hot water  you know there isnt time for me to shave now answered her son lifting his voice to a kind of broken falsetto  the scent of the cooking of bacon filled the house siegmund heard his second daughter marjory aged nine talking to vera who occupied the same room with her the child was evidently questioning and the elder girl answered briefly there was a lull in the household noises broken suddenly by marjory shouting from the top of the stairs  mam she wailed mam still beatrice did not hear her mam mamma beatrice was in the scullery mammaa the child was getting impatient she lifted her voice and shouted mam mamma still no answer mammeee she squealed  siegmund could hardly contain himself  why dont you go down and ask vera called crossly from the bedroom  and at the same moment beatrice answered also crossly what do you want  wheres my stockings cried the child at the top of her voice  why do you ask me are they down here replied her mother what are you shouting for  the child plodded downstairs directly she returned and as she passed into veras room she grumbled and now theyre not mended  siegmund heard a sound that made his heart beat it was the crackling of the sides of the crib as gwen his little girl of five climbed out she was silent for a space he imagined her sitting on the white rug and pulling on her stockings then there came the quick little thud of her feet as she went downstairs  mam siegmund heard her say as she went down the hall has dad come  the answer and the childs further talk were lost in the distance of the kitchen the small anxious question and the quick thudding of gwens feet made siegmund lie still with torture he wanted to hear no more he lay shrinking within himself it seemed that his soul was sensitive to madness he felt that he could not come what might get up and meet them all  the front door banged and he heard franks hasty call goodbye evidently the lad was in an illhumour siegmund listened for the sound of the train it seemed an age the boy would catch it then the water from the washhand bowl in the bathroom ran loudly out that he suggested was vera who was evidently not going up to town at the thought of this siegmund almost hated her he listened for her to go downstairs it was nine oclock  the footsteps of beatrice came upstairs she put something down in the bathroomhis hot water siegmund listened intently for her to come to his door would she speak she approached hurriedly knocked and waited siegmund startled for the moment could not answer she knocked loudly  all right said he  then she went downstairs  he lay probing and torturing himself for another halfhour till veras voice said coldly beneath his window outside  you should clear away then we dont want the breakfast things on the table for a week  siegmunds heart set hard he rose with a shut mouth and went across to the bathroom there he started the quaint figure of gwen stood at the bowl her back was towards him she was sponging her face gingerly her hair all blowsed from the pillow was tied in a stiff little pigtail standing out from her slender childish neck her arms were bare to the shoulder she wore a bodiced petticoat of pink flannelette which hardly reached her knees siegmund felt slightly amused to see her stout little calves planted so firmly close together she carefully sponged her cheeks her pursedup mouth and her neck soaping her hair but not her ears then very deliberately she squeezed out the sponge and proceeded to wipe away the soap  for some reason or other she glanced round her startled eyes met his she too had beautiful dark blue eyes she stood with the sponge at her neck looking full at him siegmund felt himself shrinking the childs look was steady calm inscrutable  hello said her father are you here  the child without altering her expression in the slightest turned her back on him and continued wiping her neck she dropped the sponge in the water and took the towel from off the side of the bath then she turned to look again at siegmund who stood in his pyjamas before her his mouth shut hard but his eyes shrinking and tender she seemed to be trying to discover something in him  have you washed your ears he said gaily  she paid no heed to this except that he noticed her face now wore a slight constrained smile as she looked at him she was shy still she continued to regard him curiously  there is some chocolate on my dressingtable he said  where have you been to she asked suddenly  to the seaside he answered smiling  to brighton she asked her tone was still condemning  much farther than that he replied  to worthing she asked  fartherin a steamer he replied  but who did you go with asked the child  why i went all by myself he answered  twuly she asked  weally and twuly he answered laughing  couldnt you take me she asked  i will next time he replied  the child still looked at him unsatisfied  but what did you go for she asked goading him suspiciously  to see the sea and the ships and the fighting ships with cannons  you might have taken me said the child reproachfully  yes i ought to have done oughtnt i he said as if regretful  gwen still looked full at him  you are red she said  he glanced quickly in the glass and replied  that is the sun hasnt it been hot  mm it made my nose all peel vera said she would scrape me like a new potato the child laughed and turned shyly away  come here said siegmund i believe youve got a tooth out havent you  he was very cautious and gentle the child drew back he hesitated and she drew away from him unwilling  come and let me look he repeated  she drew farther away and the same constrained smile appeared on her face shy suspicious condemning  arent you going to get your chocolate he asked as the child hesitated in the doorway  she glanced into his room and answered  ive got to go to mam and have my hair done  her awkwardness and her lack of compliance insulted him she went downstairs without going into his room  siegmund rebuffed by the only one in the house from whom he might have expected friendship proceeded slowly to shave feeling sick at heart he was a long time over his toilet when he stripped himself for the bath it seemed to him he could smell the sea he bent his head and licked his shoulder it tasted decidedly salt  a pity to wash it off he said  as he got up dripping from the cold bath he felt for the moment exhilarated he rubbed himself smooth glancing down at himself he thought i look young i look as young as twentysix  he turned to the mirror there he saw himself a mature complete man of forty with grave years of experience on his countenance  i used to think that when i was forty he said to himself i should find everything straight as the nose on my face walking through my affairs as easily as you like now i am no more sure of myself have no more confidence than a boy of twenty what can i do it seems to me a man needs a mother all his life i dont feel much like a lord of creation  having arrived at this cynicism siegmund prepared to go downstairs his sensitiveness had passed off his nerves had become callous when he was dressed he went down to the kitchen without hesitation he was indifferent to his wife and children no one spoke to him as he sat to the table that was as he liked it he wished for nothing to touch him he ate his breakfast alone while his wife bustled about upstairs and vera bustled about in the diningroom then he retired to the solitude of the drawingroom as a reaction against his poetic activity he felt as if he were gradually becoming more stupid and blind he remarked nothing not even the extravagant bowl of grasses placed where he would not have allowed iton his piano nor his fiddle laid cruelly on the cold polished floor near the window he merely sat down in an armchair and felt sick  all his unnatural excitement all the poetic stimulation of the past few days had vanished he felt flaccid while his life struggled slowly through him after an intoxication of passion and love and beauty and of sunshine he was prostrate like a plant that blossoms gorgeously and madly he had wasted the tissue of his strength so that now his life struggled in a clogged and broken channel  siegmund sat with his head between his hands leaning upon the table he would have been stupidly quiescent in his feeling of loathing and sickness had not an intense irritability in all his nerves tormented him into consciousness  i suppose this is the result of the suna sort of sunstroke he said realizing an intolerable stiffness of his brain a stunned condition in his head  this is hideous he said his arms were quivering with intense irritation he exerted all his will to stop them and then the hot irritability commenced in his belly siegmund fidgeted in his chair without changing his position he had not the energy to get up and move about he fidgeted like an insect pinned down  the door opened he felt violently startled yet there was no movement perceptible vera entered ostensibly for an autographalbum into which she was going to copy a drawing from the london opinion really to see what her father was doing he did not move a muscle he only longed intensely for his daughter to go out of the room so that he could let go vera went out of the drawingroom humming to herself apparently she had not even glanced at her father in reality she had observed him closely  he is sitting with his head in his hands she said to her mother  beatrice replied im glad hes nothing else to do  i should think hes pitying himself said vera  hes a good one at it answered beatrice  gwen came forward and took hold of her mothers skirt looking up anxiously  what is he doing mam she asked  nothing replied her mothernothing only sitting in the drawingroom  but what has he been doing persisted the anxious child  nothingnothing that i can tell you hes only spoilt all our lives  the little girl stood regarding her mother in the greatest distress and perplexity  but what will he do mam she asked  nothing dont bother run and play with marjory now do you want a nice plum  she took a yellow plum from the table gwen accepted it without a word she was too much perplexed  what do you say asked her mother  thank you replied the child turning away  siegmund sighed with relief when he was again left alone he twisted in his chair and sighed again trying to drive out the intolerable clawing irritability from his belly  ah this is horrible he said  he stiffened his muscles to quieten them  ive never been like this before what is the matter he asked himself  but the question died out immediately it seemed useless and sickening to try and answer it he began to cast about for an alleviation if he could only do something or have something he wanted it would be better  what do i want he asked himself and he anxiously strove to find this out  everything he suggested to himself made him sicken with weariness or distaste the seaside a foreign land a fresh life that he had often dreamed of farming in canada  i should be just the same there he answered himself just the same sickening feeling there that i want nothing  helena he suggested to himself trembling  but he only felt a deeper horror the thought of her made him shrink convulsively  i cant endure this he said if this is the case i had better be dead to have no want no desirethat is death to begin with  he rested awhile after this the idea of death alone seemed entertaining then is there really nothing i could turn to he asked himself  to him in that state of soul it seemed there was not  helena he suggested again appealingly testing himself ah no he cried drawing sharply back as from an approaching touch upon a raw place  he groaned slightly as he breathed with a horrid weight of nausea there was a fumbling upon the doorknob siegmund did not start he merely pulled himself together gwen pushed open the door and stood holding on to the doorknob looking at him  dad mam says dinners ready she announced  siegmund did not reply the child waited at a loss for some moments before she repeated in a hesitating tone  dinners ready  all right said siegmund go away  the little girl returned to the kitchen with tears in her eyes very crestfallen  what did he say asked beatrice  he shouted at me replied the little one breaking into tears  beatrice flushed tears came into her own eyes she took the child in her arms and pressed her to her kissing her forehead  did he she said very tenderly never mind then dearienever mind  the tears in her mothers voice made the child sob bitterly vera and marjory sat silent at table the steak and mashed potatoes steamed and grew cold    chapter 24   when helena arrived home on the thursday evening she found everything repulsive all the odours of the sordid street through which she must pass hung about the pavement having crept out in the heat the house was bare and narrow she remembered children sometimes to have brought her moths shut up in matchboxes as she knocked at the door she felt like a numbed moth which a boy is pushing off its leafrest into his box  the door was opened by her mother she was a woman whose sunken mouth ruddy cheeks and quick brown eyes gave her the appearance of a bird which walks about pecking suddenly here and there as helena reluctantly entered the mother drew herself up and immediately relaxed seeming to peck forwards as she said  well  well here we are replied the daughter in a matteroffact tone  her mother was inclined to be affectionate therefore she became proportionately cold  so i see exclaimed mrs verden tossing her head in a peculiar jocular manner and what sort of a time have you had  oh very good replied helena still more coolly  hm  mrs verden looked keenly at her daughter she recognized the peculiar sulky childish look she knew so well therefore making an effort she forbore to question  you look well she said  helena smiled ironically  and are you ready for your supper she asked in the playful affectionate manner she had assumed  if the supper is ready i will have it replied her daughter  well its not ready the mother shut tight her sunken mouth and regarded her daughter with playful challenge because she continued i didnt known when you were coming she gave a jerk with her arm like an orator who utters the incontrovertible but she added after a tedious dramatic pause i can soon have it ready what will you have  the full list of your capacious larder replied helena  mrs verden looked at her again and hesitated  will you have cocoa or lemonade she asked coming to the point curtly  lemonade said helena  presently mr verden entereda small whitebearded man with a gentle voice  oh so you are back nellie he said in his quiet reserved manner  as you see pater she answered  hm he murmured and he moved about at his accounts  neither of her parents dared to question helena they moved about her on tiptoe stealthily yet neither subserved her her fathers quiet hm her mothers curt question made her draw inwards like a snail which can never retreat far enough from condemning eyes she made a careless pretence of eating she was like a child which has done wrong and will not be punished but will be left with the humiliating smear of offence upon it  there was a quick light palpitating of the knocker mrs verden went to the door  has she come  and there were hasty steps along the passage louisa entered she flung herself upon helena and kissed her  how long have you been in she asked in a voice trembling with affection  ten minutes replied helena  why didnt you send me the time of the train so that i could come and meet you louisa reproached her  why drawled helena  louisa looked at her friend without speaking she was deeply hurt by this sarcasm  as soon as possible helena went upstairs louisa stayed with her that night on the next day they were going to cornwall together for their usual midsummer holiday they were to be accompanied by a third girla minor friend of louisa a slight acquaintance of helena  during the night neither of the two friends slept much helena made confidences to louisa who brooded on these on the romance and tragedy which enveloped the girl she loved so dearly meanwhile helenas thoughts went round and round tethered amid the five days by the sea pulling forwards as far as the morrows meeting with siegmund but reaching no further  friday was an intolerable day of silence broken by little tender advances and playful affectionate sallies on the part of the mother all of which were rapidly repulsed the father said nothing and avoided his daughter with his eyes in his humble reserve there was a dignity which made his disapproval far more difficult to bear than the repeated flagrant questionings of the mothers eyes but the day wore on helena pretended to read and sat thinking she played her violin a little mechanically she went out into the town and wandered about  at last the night fell  well said helena to her mother i suppose id better pack  havent you done it cried mrs verden exaggerating her surprise youll never have it done id better help you what times does the train go  helena smiled  ten minutes to ten  her mother glanced at the clock it was only halfpast eight there was ample time for everything  nevertheless youd better look sharp mrs verden said  helena turned away weary of this exaggeration  ill come with you to the station suggested mrs verden ill see the last of you we shant see much of you just now  helena turned round in surprise  oh i wouldnt bother she said fearing to make her disapproval too evident  yesi willill see you off  mrs verdens animation and indulgence were remarkable usually she was curt and undemonstrative on occasions like these however when she was reminded of the ideal relations between mother and daughter she played the part of the affectionate parent much to the general distress  helena lit a candle and went to her bedroom she quickly packed her dressbasket as she stood before the mirror to put on her hat her eyes gazing heavily met her heavy eyes in the mirror she glanced away swiftly as if she had been burned  how stupid i look she said to herself and siegmund how is he i wonder  she wondered how siegmund had passed the day what had happened to him how he felt how he looked she thought of him protectively  having strapped her basket she carried it downstairs her mother was ready with a white lace scarf round her neck after a short time louisa came in she dropped her basket in the passage and then sank into a chair  i dont want to go nell she said after a few moments of silence  why how is that asked helena not surprised but condescending as to a child  oh i dont know im tired said the other petulantly  of course you are what do you expect after a day like this said helena  and rushing about packing exclaimed mrs verden still in an exaggerated manner this time scolding playfully  oh i dont know i dont think i want to go dear repeated louisa dejectedly  well it is time we set out replied helena rising will you carry the basket or the violin mater  louisa rose and with a forlorn expression took up her light luggage  the west opposite the door was smouldering with sunset darkness is only smoke that hangs suffocatingly over the low red heat of the sunken day such was helenas longedfor night the tramcar was crowded in one corner olive the third friend rose excitedly to greet them helena sat mute while the car swung through the yellow stale lights of a thirdrate street of shops she heard olive remarking on her sunburned face and arms she became aware of the renewed inflammation in her blistered arms she heard her own curious voice answering everything was in a maze to the beat of the car while the yellow blur of the shops passed over her eyes she repeated two hundred and forty milestwo hundred and forty miles    chapter 25   siegmund passed the afternoon in a sort of stupor at teatime beatrice who had until then kept herself in restraint gave way to an outburst of angry hysteria  when does your engagement at the comedy theatre commence she had asked him coldly  he knew she was wondering about money  tomorrowif ever he had answered  she was aware that he hated the work for some reason or other her anger flashed out like sudden lightning at his if ever  what do you think you can do she cried for i think you have done enough we cant do as we like altogetherindeed indeed we cannot you have had your fling havent you you have had your fling and you want to keep on but theres more than one person in the world remember that but there are your children let me remind you whose are they you talk about shirking the engagement but who is going to be responsible for your children do you think  i said nothing about shirking the engagement replied siegmund very coldly  no there was no need to say i know what it means you sit there sulking all day what do you think i do i have to see to the children i have to work and slave i go on from day to day i tell you ill stop i tell you ill do as i like ill go as well no i wouldnt be such a coward you know that you know i wouldnt leave little childrento the workhouse or anything theyre my children they mightnt be yours  there is no need for this said siegmund contemptuously  the pressure in his temples was excruciating and he felt loathsomely sick  beatrices dark eyes flashed with rage  isnt there she cried oh isnt there no there is need for a great deal more i dont know what you think i am how much farther do you think you can go no you dont like reminding of us you sit moping sulking because you have to come back to your own children i wonder how much you think i shall stand what do you think i am to put up with it what do you think i am am i a servant to eat out of your hand  be quiet shouted siegmund dont i know what you are listen to yourself  beatrice was suddenly silenced it was the stillness of whitehot wrath even siegmund was glad to hear her voice again she spoke low and trembling  you cowardyou miserable coward it is i is it who am wrong it is i who am to blame is it you miserable thing i have no doubt you know what i am  siegmund looked up at her as her words died off she looked back at him with dark eyes loathing his cowed wretched animosity his eyes were bloodshot and furtive his mouth was drawn back in a halfgrin of hate and misery she was goading him in his darkness whither he had withdrawn himself like a sick dog to die or recover as his strength should prove she tortured him till his sickness was swallowed by anger which glared redly at her as he pushed back his chair to rise he trembled too much however his chin dropped again on his chest beatrice sat down in her place hearing footsteps she was shuddering slightly and her eyes were fixed  vera entered with the two children all three immediately as if they found themselves confronted by something threatening stood arrested vera tackled the situation  is the table ready to be cleared yet she asked in an unpleasant tone  her fathers cup was half emptied he had come to tea late after the others had left the table evidently he had not finished but he made no reply neither did beatrice vera glanced disgustedly at her father gwen sidled up to her mother and tried to break the tension  mam there was a lady had a dog and it ran into a shop and it licked a sheep mam what was hanging up  beatrice sat fixed and paid not the slightest attention the child looked up at her waited then continued softly  mam there was a lady had a dog  dont bother snapped vera sharply  the child looked wondering and resentful at her sister vera was taking the things from the table snatching them and thrusting them on the tray gwens eyes rested a moment or two on the bent head of her father then deliberately she turned again to her mother and repeated in her softest and most persuasive tones  mam i saw a dog and it ran in a butchers shop and licked a piece of meat mam mam  there was no answer gwen went forward and put her hand on her mothers knee  mam she pleaded timidly  no response  mam she whispered  she was desperate she stood on tiptoe and pulled with little hands at her mothers breast  mam she whispered shrilly  her mother with an effort of selfdenial put off her investment of tragedy and laying her arm round the childs shoulders drew her close gwen was somewhat reassured but not satisfied with an earnest face upturned to the impassive countenance of her mother she began to whisper sibilant coaxing pleading  mam there was a lady she had a dog  vera turned sharply to stop this whispering which was too much for her nerves but the mother forestalled her taking the child in her arms she averted her face put her cheek against the baby cheek and let the tears run freely gwen was too much distressed to cry the tears gathered very slowly in her eyes and fell without her having moved a muscle in her face vera remained in the scullery weeping tears of rage and pity and shame into the towel the only sound in the room was the occasional sharp breathing of beatrice siegmund sat without the trace of a movement almost without breathing his head was ducked low he dared never lift it he dared give no sign of his presence  presently beatrice put down the child and went to join vera in the scullery there came the low sound of womens talkingan angry ominous sound gwen followed her mother her little voice could be heard cautiously asking  mam is dad crossis he what did he do  dont bother snapped vera you are a little nuisance here take this into the diningroom and dont drop it  the child did not obey she stood looking from her mother to her sister the latter pushed a dish into her hand  go along she said gently thrusting the child forth  gwen departed she hesitated in the kitchen her father still remained unmoved the child wished to go to him to speak to him but she was afraid she crossed the kitchen slowly hugging the dish then she came slowly back hesitating she sidled into the kitchen she crept round the table inch by inch drawing nearer her father at about a yard from the chair she stopped he from under his bent brows could see her small feet in brown slippers nearly kicked through at the toes waiting and moving nervously near him he pulled himself together as a man does who watches the surgeons lancet suspended over his wound would the child speak to him would she touch him with her small hands he held his breath and it seemed held his heart from beating what he should do he did not know  he waited in a daze of suspense the child shifted from one foot to another he could just see the edge of her whitefrilled drawers he wanted above all things to take her in his arms to have something against which to hide his face yet he was afraid often when all the world was hostile he had found her full of love he had hidden his face against her she had gone to sleep in his arms she had been like a piece of appleblossom in his arms if she should come to him nowhis heart halted again in suspensehe knew not what he would do it would open perhaps the tumour of his sickness he was quivering too fast with suspense to know what he feared or wanted or hoped  gwen called vera wondering why she did not return gwen  yes answered the child and slowly siegmund saw her feet lifted hesitate move then turn away  she had gone his excitement sank rapidly and the sickness returned stronger more horrible and wearying than ever for a moment it was so bad that he was afraid of losing consciousness he recovered slightly pulled himself up and went upstairs his fists were tightly clenched his fingers closed over his thumbs which were pressed bloodless he lay down on the bed  for two hours he lay in a dazed condition resembling sleep at the end of that time the knowledge that he had to meet helena was actively at workan activity quite apart from his will or his consciousness jogging and pulling him awake at eight oclock he sat up a cramped pain in his thumbs made him wonder he looked at them and mechanically shut them again under his fingers into the position they sought after two hours of similar constraint siegmund opened his hands again smiling  it is said to be the sign of a weak deceitful character he said to himself  his head was peculiarly numbed at the back it felt heavy as if weighted with lead he could think only one detached sentence at intervals betweenwhiles there was a blank grey sleep or swoon  i have got to go and meet helena at wimbledon he said to himself and instantly he felt a peculiar joy as if he had laughed somewhere but i must be getting ready i cant disappoint her said siegmund  the idea of helena woke a craving for rest in him if he should say to her do not go away from me come with me somewhere then he might lie down somewhere beside her and she might put her hands on his head if she could hold his head in her handsfor she had fine silken hands that adjusted themselves with a rare pressure wrapping his weakness up in lifethen his head would gradually grow healed and he could rest this was the one thing that remained for his restorationthat she should with long unwearying gentleness put him to rest he longed for it utterlyfor the hands and the restfulness of helena  but it is no good he said staring like a drunken man from sleep what time is it  it was ten minutes to nine she would be in wimbledon by 1010 it was time he should be getting ready yet he remained sitting on the bed  i am forgetting again he said but i do not want to go what is the good i have only to tie a mask on for the meeting it is too much  he waited and waited his head dropped forward in a sort of sleep suddenly he started awake the back of his head hurt severely  goodness he said its getting quite dark  it was twenty minutes to ten he went bewildered into the bathroom to wash in cold water and bring back his senses his hands were sore and his face blazed with sun inflammation he made himself neat as usual it was ten minutes to ten he would be very late it was practically dark though these bright days were endless he wondered whether the children were in bed it was too late however to wonder  siegmund hurried downstairs and took his hat he was walking down the path when the door was snatched open behind him and vera ran out crying  are you going out where are you going  siegmund stood still and looked at her  she is frightened he said to himself smiling ironically  i am only going a walk i have to go to wimbledon i shall not be very long  wimbledon at this time said vera sharply full of suspicion  yes i am late i shall be back in an hour  he was sorry for her she knew he gave her an honourable promise  you need not keep us sitting up she said  he did not answer but hurried to the station    chapter 26   helena louisa and olive climbed the steps to go to the southwestern platform they were laden with dressbaskets umbrellas and little packages olive and louisa at least were in high spirits olive stopped before the indicator  the next train for waterloo she announced in her contralto voice is 1030 it is now 1012  we go by the 1040 it is a better train said helena  olive turned to her with a heavyarch manner  very well dear there is a parting to be got through i am told we sympathize dear but we regret it starting for a holiday is always a prolonged agony but i am strong to endure it  you look it you look as if you could tackle a bull cried louisa skittish  my dear louisa rang out olives contralto dont judge me by appearances youre sure to be taken in with me its a case of      oh the gladness of her gladness when shes sad     and the sadness of her sadness when shes glad  she looked round to see the effect of this helena expected to say something chimed in sarcastically  they are nothing to her madness  when shes going for a holiday dear cried olive  oh go on being mad cried louisa  what do you like it i thought youd be thanking heaven that sanity was given me in large doses  and holidays in small laughed louisa good no i like your madness if you call it such you are always so serious  its ill talking of halters in the house of the hanged dear boomed olive  she looked from side to side she felt triumphant helena smiled acknowledging the sarcasm  but said louisa smiling anxiously i dont quite see it whats the point  well to be explicit dear replied olive it is hardly safe to accuse me of sadness and seriousness in this trio  louisa laughed and shook herself  come to think of it it isnt she said  helena sighed and walked down the platform her heart was beating thickly she could hardly breathe the station lamps hung low so they made a ceiling of heat and dusty light she suffocated under them for a moment she beat with hysteria feeling as most of us feel when sick on a hot summer night as if she must certainly go crazed smothered under the grey woolly blanket of heat siegmund was late it was already twentyfive minutes past ten  she went towards the bookingoffice at that moment siegmund came on to the platform  here i am he said where is louisa  helena pointed to the seat without answering she was looking at siegmund he was distracted by the excitement of the moment so she could not read him  olive is there too she explained  siegmund stood still straining his eyes to see the two women seated amidst pale wicker dressbaskets and dark rugs the stranger made things more complex  does sheyour other frienddoes she know he asked  she knows nothing replied helena in a low tone as she led him forward to be introduced  how do you do replied olive in most mellow contralto behold the dauntless three with their traps you will see us forth on our perils  i will since i may not do more replied siegmund smiling continuing and how is sister louisa  she is very well thank you it is her turn now cried louisa vindictive triumphant  there was always a faint animosity in her bearing towards siegmund he understood and smiled at her enmity for the two were really good friends  it is your turn now he repeated smiling and he turned away  he and helena walked down the platform  how did you find things at home he asked her  oh as usual she replied indifferently and you  just the same he answered he thought for a moment or two then added the children are happier without me  oh you mustnt say that kind of thing protested helena miserably its not true  its all right dear he answered so long as they are happy its all right after a pause he added but i feel pretty bad tonight  helenas hand tightened on his arm he had reached the end of the platform there he stood looking up the line which ran dark under a haze of lights the high red signallamps hung aloft in a scarlet swarm farther off like spangles shaking downwards from a burst skyrocket was a tangle of brilliant red and green signallamps settling a train with the warm flare on its thick column of smoke came thundering upon the lovers dazed they felt the yellow bar of carriagewindows brush in vibration across their faces the ground and the air rocked then siegmund turned his head to watch the red and the green lights in the rear of the train swiftly dwindle on the darkness still watching the distance where the train had vanished he said  dear i want you to promise that whatever happens to me you will go on remember dear two wrongs dont make a right  helena swiftly with a movement of terror faced him looking into his eyes but he was in the shadow she could not see him the flat sound of his voice lacking resonancethe dead expressionless tonemade her lose her presence of mind she stared at him blankly  what do you mean what has happened something has happened to you what has happened at home what are you going to do she said sharply she palpitated with terror for the first time she felt powerless siegmund was beyond her grasp she was afraid of him he had shaken away her hold over him  there is nothing fresh the matter at home he replied wearily he was to be scourged with emotion again i swear it he added and i have not made up my mind but i cant think of life without youand life must go on  and i swear she said wrathfully turning at bay that i wont live a day after you  siegmund dropped his head the dead spring of his emotion swelled up scalding hot again then he said almost inaudibly ah dont speak to me like that dear it is late to be angry when i have seen your train out tonight there is nothing left  helena looked at him dumb with dismay stupid angry  they became aware of the porters shouting loudly that the waterloo train was to leave from another platform  youd better come said siegmund and they hurried down towards louisa and olive  weve got to change platforms cried louisa running forward and excitedly announcing the news  yes replied helena pale and impassive  siegmund picked up the luggage  i say cried olive rushing to catch helena and louisa by the arm looklookboth of youlook at that hat a lady in front was wearing on her hat a wild and dishevelled array of peacock feathers its the sight of a lifetime i wouldnt have you miss it added olive in hoarse sotto voce  indeed not cried helena turning in wild exasperation to look get a good view of it olive lets have a good mental impression of itone that will last  thats right dear said olive somewhat nonplussed by this outburst  siegmund had escaped with the heaviest two bags they could see him ahead climbing the steps olive readjusted herself from the wildly animated to the calmly ironical  after all dear she said as they hurried in the tail of the crowd its not half a bad idea to get a man on the job  louisa laughed aloud at this vulgar conception of siegmund  just now at any rate she rejoined  as they reached the platform the train ran in before them helena watched anxiously for an empty carriage there was not one  perhaps it is as well she thought we neednt talk there will be threequarters of an hour at waterloo if we were alone olive would make siegmund talk  she found a carriage with four people and hastily took possession siegmund followed her with the bags he swung these on the rack and then quickly received the rugs umbrellas and packages from the other two these he put on the seats or anywhere while helena stowed them she was very busy for a moment or two the racks were full other people entered their luggage was troublesome to bestow  when she turned round again she found louisa and olive seated but siegmund was outside on the platform and the door was closed he saw her face move as if she would cry to him she restrained herself and immediately called  you are coming oh you are coming to waterloo  he shook his head  i cannot come he said  she stood looking blankly at him for some moments unable to reach the door because of the portmanteau thrust through with umbrellas and sticks which stood on the floor between the knees of the passengers she was helpless siegmund was repeating deliriously in his mind  ohgogogowhen will she go  he could not bear her piteousness her presence made him feel insane  would you like to come to the window a man asked of helena kindly  she smiled suddenly in his direction without perceiving him he pulled the portmanteau under his legs and helena edged past she stood by the door leaning forward with some of her old protective grace her hawwa spirit evident benign and shielding she bent forward looking at siegmund but her face was blank with helplessness with misery of helplessness she stood looking at siegmund saying nothing his forehead was scorched and swollen she noticed sorrowfully and beneath one eye the skin was blistered his eyes were bloodshot and glazed in a kind of apathy they filled her with terror he looked up at her because she wished it for himself he could not see her he could only recoil from her all he wished was to hide himself in the dark alone yet she wanted him and so far he yielded but to go to waterloo he could not yield  the people in the carriage made uneasy by this strange farewell did not speak there were a few taut moments of silence no one seems to have strength to interrupt these spaces of irresolute anguish finally the guards whistle went siegmund and helena clasped hands a warm flush of love and healthy grief came over siegmund for the last time the train began to move drawing helenas hand from his  monday she whisperedmonday meaning that on monday she should receive a letter from him he nodded turned hesitated looked at her turned and walked away she remained at the window watching him depart  now dear we are manless said olive in a whisper but her attempt at a joke fell dead everybody was silent and uneasy    chapter 27   he hurried down the platform wincing at every stride from the memory of helenas last look of mute heavy yearning he gripped his fists till they trembled his thumbs were again closed under his fingers like a picture on a cloth before him he still saw helenas face white rounded in feature quite mute and expressionless just made terrible by the heavy eyes pleading dumbly he thought of her going on and on still at the carriage window looking out all through the night rushing west and west to the land of isolde things began to haunt siegmund like a delirium he knew not where he was hurrying always in front of him as on a cloth was the face of helena while somewhere behind the cloth was cornwall a faroff lonely place where darkness came on intensely sometimes he saw a dim small phantom in the darkness of cornwall very far off then the face of helena white inanimate as a mask with heavy eyes came between again  he was almost startled to find himself at home in the porch of his house the door opened he remembered to have heard the quick thud of feet it was vera she glanced at him but said nothing instinctively she shrank from him he passed without noticing her she stood on the doormat fastening the door striving to find something to say to him  you have been over an hour she said still more troubled when she found her voice shaking she had no idea what alarmed her  ay returned siegmund  he went into the diningroom and dropped into his chair with his head between his hands vera followed him nervously  will you have anything to eat she asked  he looked up at the table as if the supper laid there were curious and incomprehensible the delirious lifting of his eyelids showed the whole of the dark pupils and the bloodshot white of his eyes vera held her breath with fear he sank his head again and said nothing vera sat down and waited the minutes ticked slowly off siegmund neither moved nor spoke at last the clock struck midnight she was weary with sleep querulous with trouble  arent you going to bed she asked  siegmund heard her without paying any attention he seemed only to half hear vera waited awhile then repeated plaintively  arent you going to bed father  siegmund lifted his head and looked at her he loathed the idea of having to move he looked at her confusedly  yes im going he said and his head dropped again vera knew he was not asleep she dared not leave him till he was in his bedroom again she sat waiting  father she cried at last  he started up gripping the arms of his chair trembling  yes im going he said  he rose and went unevenly upstairs vera followed him close behind  if he reels and falls backwards he will kill me she thought but he did not fall from habit he went into the bathroom while trying to brush his teeth he dropped the toothbrush on to the floor  ill pick it up in the morning he said continuing deliriously i must go to bedi must go to bedi am very tired he stumbled over the door mat into his own room  vera was standing behind the unclosed door of her room she heard the sneck of his lock she heard the water still running in the bathroom trickling with the mysterious sound of water at dead of night screwing up her courage she went and turned off the tap then she stood again in her own room to be near the companionable breathing of her sleeping sister listening siegmund undressed quickly his one thought was to get into bed  one must sleep he said as he dropped his clothes on the floor he could not find the way to put on his sleepingjacket and that made him pant any little thing that roused or thwarted his mechanical action aggravated his sickness till his brain seemed to be bursting he got things right at last and was in bed  immediately he lapsed into a kind of unconsciousness he would have called it sleep but such it was not all the time he could feel his brain working ceaselessly like a machine running with unslackening rapidity this went on interrupted by little flickerings of consciousness for three or four hours each time he had a glimmer of consciousness he wondered if he made any noise  what am i doing what is the matter am i unconscious do i make any noise do i disturb them he wondered and he tried to cast back to find the record of mechanical sense impression he believed he could remember the sound of inarticulate murmuring in his throat immediately he remembered he could feel his throat producing the sounds this frightened him above all things he was afraid of disturbing the family he roused himself to listen everything was breathing in silence as he listened to this silence he relapsed into his sort of sleep  he was awakened finally by his own perspiration he was terribly hot the pillow the bedclothes his hair all seemed to be steaming with hot vapour whilst his body was bathed in sweat it was coming light immediately he shut his eyes again and lay still he was now conscious and his brain was irritably active but his body was a separate thing a terrible heavy hot thing over which he had slight control  siegmund lay still with his eyes closed enduring the exquisite torture of the trickling of drops of sweat first it would be one gathering and running its irregular hesitating way into the hollow of his neck his every nerve thrilled to it yet he felt he could not move more than to stiffen his throat slightly while yet the nerves in the track of this drop were quivering raw with sensitiveness another drop would start from off the side of his chest and trickle downwards among the little muscles of his side to drip on to the bed it was like the running of a spider over his sensitive moveless body why he did not wipe himself he did not know he lay still and endured this horrible tickling which seemed to bite deep into him rather than make the effort to move which he loathed to do the drops ran off his forehead down his temples those he did not mind he was blunt there but they started again in tiny vicious spurts down the sides of his chest from under his armpits down the inner sides of his thighs till he seemed to have a myriad quivering tracks of a myriad running insects over his hot wet highlysensitized body his nerves were trembling one and all with outrage and vivid suspense it became unbearable he felt that if he endured it another moment he would cry out or suffocate and burst  he sat up suddenly threw away the bedclothes from which came a puff of hot steam and began to rub his pyjamas against his sides and his legs he rubbed madly for a few moments then he sighed with relief he sat on the side of the bed moving from the hot dampness of the place where he had lain for a moment he thought he would go to sleep then in an instant his brain seemed to click awake he was still as loath as ever to move but his brain was no longer clouded in hot vapour it was clear he sat bowing forward on the side of the bed his sleepingjacket open the dawn stealing into the room the morning air entering fresh through the wideflung windowdoor he felt a peculiar sense of guilt of wrongness in thus having jumped out of bed it seemed to him as if he ought to have endured the heat of his body and the infernal trickling of the drops of sweat but at the thought of it he moved his hands gratefully over his sides which now were dry and soft and smooth slightly chilled on the surface perhaps for he felt a sudden tremor of shivering from the warm contact of his hands  siegmund sat up straight his body was reanimated he felt the pillow and the groove where he had lain it was quite wet and clammy there was a scent of sweat on the bed not really unpleasant but he wanted something fresh and cool  siegmund sat in the doorway that gave on to the small veranda the air was beautifully cool he felt his chest again to make sure it was not clammy it was smooth as silk this pleased him very much he looked out on the night again and was startled somewhere the moon was shining duskily in a hidden quarter of sky but straight in front of him in the northwest silent lightning was fluttering he waited breathlessly to see if it were true then again the pale lightning jumped up into the dome of the fading night it was like a white bird stirring restlessly on its nest the night was drenching thinner greyer the lightning like a bird that should have flown before the arm of day moved on its nest in the boughs of darkness raised itself flickered its pale wings rapidly then sank again loath to fly siegmund watched it with wonder and delight  the day was pushing aside the boughs of darkness hunting the poor moon would be caught when the net was flung siegmund went out on the balcony to look at it there it was like a poor white mouse a halfmoon crouching on the mound of its course it would run nimbly over to the western slope then it would be caught in the net and the sun would laugh like a great yellow cat as it stalked behind playing with its prey flashing out its bright paws the moon before making its last run lay crouched palpitating the sun crept forth laughing to itself as it saw its prey could not escape the lightning however leaped low off the nest like a bird decided to go and flew away siegmund no longer saw it opening and shutting its wings in hesitation amid the disturbance of the dawn instead there came a flush the white lightning gone the brief pink butterflies of sunrise and sunset rose up from the mown fields of darkness and fluttered low in a cloud even in the west they flew in a narrow rosy swarm they separated thinned rising higher some flying up became golden some flew rosy gold across the moon the mousemoon motionless with fear soon the pink butterflies had gone leaving a scarlet stretch like a field of poppies in the fens as a wind the light of day blew in from the east puff after puff filling with whiteness the space which had been the night siegmund sat watching the last morning blowing in across the mown darkness till the whole field of the world was exposed till the moon was like a dead mouse which floats on water  when the few birds had called in the august morning when the cocks had finished their crowing when the minute sounds of the early day were astir siegmund shivered disconsolate he felt tired again yet he knew he could not sleep the bed was repulsive to him he sat in his chair at the open door moving uneasily what should have been sleep was an ache and a restlessness he turned and twisted in his chair  where is helena he asked himself and he looked out on the morning  everything out of doors was unreal like a show like a peepshow helena was an actress somewhere in the brightness of this view he alone was out of the piece he sighed petulantly pressing back his shoulders as if they ached his arms too ached with irritation while his head seemed to be hissing with angry irritability for a long time he sat with clenched teeth merely holding himself in check in his present state of irritability everything that occurred to his mind stirred him with dislike or disgust helena music the pleasant company of friends the sunshine of the country each as it offered itself to his thoughts was met by an angry contempt was rejected scornfully as nothing could please or distract him the only thing that remained was to support the discord he felt as if he were a limb out of joint from the body of life there occurred to his imagination a disjointed finger swollen and discoloured racked with pains the question was how should he reset himself into joint the body of life for him meant beatrice his children helena the comic opera his friends of the orchestra how could he set himself again into joint with these it was impossible towards his family he would henceforward have to bear himself with humility that was a cynicism he would have to leave helena which he could not do he would have to play strenuously night after night the music of the saucy little switzer which was absurd in fine it was all absurd and impossible very well then that being so what remained possible why to depart if thine hand offend thee cut it off he could cut himself off from life it was plain and straightforward  but beatrice his young children without him he was bound by an agreement which there was no discrediting to provide for them very well he must provide for them and then what humiliation at home helena forsaken musical comedy night after night that was insufferableimpossible like a man tangled up in a rope he was not strong enough to free himself he could not break with helena and return to a degrading life at home he could not leave his children and go to helena  very well it was impossible then there remained only one door which he could open in this prison corridor of life siegmund looked round the room he could get his razor or he could hang himself he had thought of the two ways before yet now he was unprovided his portmanteau stood at the foot of the bed its straps flung loose a portmanteau strap would do then it should be a portmanteau strap  very well said siegmund it is finally settled i had better write to helena and tell her and say to her she must go on id better tell her  he sat for a long time with his notebook and a pencil but he wrote nothing at last he gave up  perhaps it is just as well he said to himself she said she would come with meperhaps that is just as well she will go to the sea when she knows the sea will take her she must know  he took a card bearing her name and her cornwall address from his pocketbook and laid it on the dressingtable  she will come with me he said to himself and his heart rose with elation  that is a cowardice he added looking doubtfully at the card as if wondering whether to destroy it  it is in the hands of god beatrice may or may not send word to her at tintagel it is in the hands of god he concluded  then he sat down again  but for that fear of something afterdeath he quoted to himself  it is not fear he said the act itself will be horrible and fearsome but the afterdeathits no more than struggling awake when youre sick with a fright of dreams we are such stuff as dreams are made on  siegmund sat thinking of the afterdeath which to him seemed so wonderfully comforting full of rest and reassurance and renewal he experienced no mystical ecstasies he was sure of a wonderful kindness in death a kindness which really reached right through life though here he could not avail himself of it siegmund had always inwardly held faith that the heart of life beat kindly towards him when he was cynical and sulky he knew that in reality it was only a waywardness of his  the heart of life is implacable in its kindness it may not be moved to fluttering of pity it swings on uninterrupted by cries of anguish or of hate  siegmund was thankful for this unfaltering sternness of life there was no futile hesitation between doom and pity therefore he could submit and have faith if each man by his crying could swerve the slow sheer universe what a doom of guilt he might gain if life could swerve from its orbit for pity what terror of vacillation and who would wish to bear the responsibility of the deflection  siegmund thanked god that life was pitiless strong enough to take his treasures out of his hands and to thrust him out of the room otherwise how could he go with any faith to death otherwise he would have felt the helpless disillusion of a youth who finds his infallible parents weaker than himself  i know the heart of life is kind said siegmund because i feel it otherwise i would live in defiance but life is greater than me or anybody we suffer and we dont know why often life doesnt explain but i can keep faith in it as a dog has faith in his master after all life is as kind to me as i am to my dog i have proportionally as much zest and my purpose towards my dog is good i need not despair of life  it occurred to siegmund that he was meriting the old gibe of the atheists he was shirking the responsibility of himself turning it over to an imaginary god  well he said i cant help it i do not feel altogether selfresponsible  the morning had waxed during these investigations siegmund had been vaguely aware of the rousing of the house he was finally startled into a consciousness of the immediate present by the calling of vera at his door  there are two letters for you father  he looked about him in bewilderment the hours had passed in a trance and he had no idea of his time or place  oh all right he said too much dazed to know what it meant he heard his daughter going downstairs then swiftly returned over him the throbbing ache of his head and his arms the discordant jarring of his body  what made her bring me the letters he asked himself it was a very unusual attention his heart replied very sullen and shameful she wanted to know she wanted to make sure i was all right  siegmund forgot all his speculations on a divine benevolence the discord of his immediate situation overcame every harmony he did not fetch in the letters  is it so late he said is there no more time for me  he went to look at his watch it was a quarter to nine as he walked across the room he trembled and a sickness made his bones feel rotten he sat down on the bed  what am i going to do he asked himself  by this time he was shuddering rapidly a peculiar feeling as if his belly were turned into nothingness made him want to press his fists into his abdomen he remained shuddering drunkenly like a drunken man who is sick incapable of thought or action  a second knock came at the door he started with a jolt  here is your shavingwater said beatrice in cold tones its half past nine  all right said siegmund rising from the bed bewildered  and what time shall you expect dinner asked beatrice she was still contemptuous  any time im not going out he answered  he was surprised to hear the ordinary cool tone of his own voice for he was shuddering uncontrollably and was almost sobbing in a shaking bewildered disordered condition he set about fulfilling his purpose he was hardly conscious of anything he did try as he would he could not keep his hands steady in the violent spasms of shuddering nor could he call his mind to think he was one shuddering turmoil yet he performed his purpose methodically and exactly in every particular he was thorough as if he were the servant of some stern will it was a mesmeric performance in which the agent trembled with convulsive sickness    chapter 28   siegmunds lying late in bed made beatrice very angry the later it became the more wrathful she grew at half past nine she had taken up his shavingwater then she proceeded to tidy the diningroom leaving the breakfast spread in the kitchen  vera and frank were gone up to town they would both be home for dinner at two oclock marjory was despatched on an errand taking gwen with her the children had no need to return home immediately therefore it was highly probable they would play in the field or in the lane for an hour or two beatrice was alone downstairs it was a hot still morning when everything outdoors shone brightly and all indoors was dusked with coolness and colour but beatrice was angry she moved rapidly and determinedly about the diningroom thrusting old newspapers and magazines between the cupboard and the wall throwing the litter in the grate which was clear friday having been charwomans day passing swiftly lightly over the front of the furniture with the duster it was saturday when she did not spend much time over the work in the afternoon she was going out with vera that was not however what occupied her mind as she brushed aside her work she had determined to have a settlement with siegmund as to how matters should continue she was going to have no more of the past three years life things had come to a crisis and there must be an alteration beatrice was going to do battle therefore she flew at her work thus stirring herself up to a proper heat of blood all the time as she thrust things out of sight or straightened a cover she listened for siegmund to come downstairs  he did not come so her anger waxed  he can lie skulking in bed she said to herself here ive been up since seven broiling at it i should think hes pitying himself he ought to have something else to do he ought to have to go out to work every morning like another man as his son has to do he has had too little work he has had too much his own way but its come to a stop now ill servanthousekeeper him no longer  beatrice went to clean the step of the front door she clanged the bucket loudly every minute becoming more and more angry that piece of work finished she went into the kitchen it was twenty past ten her wrath was at ignition point she cleared all the things from the table and washed them up as she was so doing her anger having reached full intensity without bursting into flame began to dissipate in uneasiness she tried to imagine what siegmund would do and say to her as she was wiping a cup she dropped it and the smash so unnerved her that her hands trembled almost too much to finish drying the things and putting them away at last it was done her next piece of work was to make the beds she took her pail and went upstairs her heart was beating so heavily in her throat that she had to stop on the landing to recover breath she dreaded the combat with him suddenly controlling herself she said loudly at siegmunds door her voice coldly hostile  arent you going to get up  there was not the faintest sound in the house beatrice stood in the gloom of the landing her heart thudding in her ears  its after half past tenarent you going to get up she called  she waited again two letters lay unopened on a small table suddenly she put down her pail and went into the bathroom the pot of shavingwater stood untouched on the shelf just as she had left it she returned and knocked swiftly at her husbands door not speaking she waited then she knocked again loudly a long time something in the sound of her knocking made her afraid to try again the noise was dull and thudding it did not resound through the house with a natural ring so she thought she ran downstairs in terror fled out into the front garden and there looked up at his room the windowdoor was openeverything seemed quiet  beatrice stood vacillating she picked up a few tiny pebbles and flung them in a handful at his door some spattered on the panes sharply some dropped dully in the room one clinked on the washhand bowl there was no response beatrice was terribly excited she ran with her black eyes blazing and wisps of her black hair flying about her thin temples out on to the road by a mercy she saw the windowcleaner just pushing his ladder out of the passage of a house a little farther down the road she hurried to him  will you come and see if theres anything wrong with my husband she asked wildly  why mum answered the windowcleaner who knew her and was humbly familiar is he taken bad or something yes ill come  he was a tall thin man with a brown beard his clothes were all so loose his trousers so baggy that he gave one the impression his limbs must be bone and his body a skeleton he pushed at his ladders with a will  where is he mum he asked officiously as they slowed down at the side passage  hes in his bedroom and i cant get an answer from him  then i sll want a ladder said the windowcleaner proceeding to lift one off his trolley he was in a very great bustle he knew which was siegmunds room he had often seen siegmund rise from some music he was studying and leave the drawingroom when the windowcleaning began and afterwards he had found him in the small front bedroom he also knew there were matrimonial troubles beatrice was not reserved  is it the least of the front rooms hes in asked the windowcleaner  yes over the porch replied beatrice  the man bustled with his ladder  its easy enough he said the doors open and were soon on the balcony  he set the ladder securely beatrice cursed him for a slow officious fool he tested the ladder to see it was safe then he cautiously clambered up at the top he stood leaning sideways bending over the ladder to peer into the room he could see all sorts of things for he was frightened  i say there he called loudly  beatrice stood below in horrible suspense  go in she cried go in is he there  the man stepped very cautiously with one foot on to the balcony and peered forward but the glass door reflected into his eyes he followed slowly with the other foot and crept forward ready at any moment to take flight  hie hie he suddenly cried in terror and he drew back  beatrice was opening her mouth to scream when the windowcleaner exclaimed weakly as if dubious  i believe es anged imself from the doorooks  no cried beatrice no no no  i believe e as repeated the man  go in and see if hes dead cried beatrice  the man remained in the doorway peering fixedly  i believe he is he said doubtfully  nogo and see screamed beatrice  the man went into the room trembling hesitating he approached the body as if fascinated shivering he took it round the loins and tried to lift it down it was too heavy  i know he said to himself once more bustling now he had something to do he took his claspknife from his pocket jammed the body between himself and the door so that it should not drop and began to saw his way through the leathern strap it gave he started and clutched the body dropping his knife beatrice below in the garden hearing the scuffle and the clatter began to scream in hysteria the man hauled the body of siegmund with much difficulty on to the bed and with trembling fingers tried to unloose the buckle in which the strap ran it was bedded in siegmunds neck the windowcleaner tugged at it frantically till he got it loose then he looked at siegmund the dead man lay on the bed with swollen discoloured face with his sleepingjacket pushed up in a bunch under his armpits leaving his side naked beatrice was screaming below the windowcleaner quite unnerved ran from the room and scrambled down the ladder siegmund lay heaped on the bed his sleepingsuit twisted and bunched up about him his face hardly recognizable    chapter 29   helena was dozing down in the cove at tintagel she and louisa and olive lay on the cool sands in the shadow and steeped themselves in rest in a cool seafragrant tranquillity  the journey down had been very tedious after waiting for half an hour in the midnight turmoil of an august friday in waterloo station they had seized an empty carriage only to be followed by five northcountrymen all of whom were affected by whisky olive helena louisa occupied three corners of the carriage the men were distributed between them the three women were not alarmed their tipsy travelling companions promised to be tiresome but they had a frank honesty of manner that placed them beyond suspicion the train drew out westward helena began to count the miles that separated her from siegmund the northcountrymen began to be jolly they talked loudly in their uncouth english they sang the musichall songs of the day they furtively drank whisky through all this they were polite to the girls as much could hardly be said in return of olive and louisa they leaned forward whispering one to another they sat back in their seats laughing hiding their laughter by turning their backs on the men who were a trifle disconcerted by this amusement  the train spun on and on little homely clusters of lamps suggesting the quiet of country life turned slowly round through the darkness the men dropped into a doze olive put a handkerchief over her face and went to sleep louisa gradually nodded and jerked into slumber helena sat weariedly and watched the rolling of the sleeping travellers and the dull blank of the night sheering off outside neither the men nor the women looked well asleep they lurched and nodded stupidly she thought of bazarof in fathers and sons endorsing his opinion on the appearance of sleepers all but siegmund was siegmund asleep she imagined him breathing regularly on the pillows she could see the under arch of his eyebrows the fine shape of his nostrils the curve of his lips as she bent in fancy over his face  the dawn came slowly it was rather cold olive wrapped herself in rugs and went to sleep again helena shivered and stared out of the window there appeared a wanness in the night and helena felt inexpressibly dreary a rosiness spread out far away it was like a flock of flamingoes hovering over a dark lake the world vibrated as the sun came up  helena waked the tipsy men at exeter having heard them say that there they must change then she walked the platform very jaded the train rushed on again it was a most most wearisome journey the fields were very flowery the morning was very bright but what were these to her she wanted dimness sleep forgetfulness at eight oclock breakfasttime the dauntless three were driving in a waggonette amid blazing breathless sunshine over country naked of shelter ungracious and harsh  why am i doing this helena asked herself  the three friends washed dressed and breakfasted it was too hot to rest in the house so they trudged to the coast silently each feeling in an ill humour  when helena was really rested she took great pleasure in tintagel in the first place she found that the cove was exactly almost identically the same as the walhalla scene in walküre in the second place tristan was here in the tragic country filled with the flowers of a late cornish summer an everlasting reality in the third place it was a sea of marvellous portentous sunsets of sweet morning baths of pools blossomed with life of terrible suave swishing of foam which suggested the anadyomene in sun it was the enchanted land of divided lovers helena for ever hummed fragments of tristan as she stood on the rocks she sang in her little halfarticulate way bits of isoldes love bits of tristans anguish to siegmund  she had not received her letter on sunday that had not very much disquieted her though she was disappointed on monday she was miserable because of siegmunds silence but there was so much of enchantment in tintagel and olive and louisa were in such high spirits that she forgot most whiles  on monday night towards two oclock there came a violent storm of thunder and lightning louisa started up in bed at the first clap waking helena the room palpitated with white light for two seconds the mirror on the dressingtable glared supernaturally louisa clutched her friend all was dark again the thunder clapping directly  there wasnt that lovely cried louisa speaking of the lightning oo wasnt it magnificentglorious  the door clicked and opened olive entered in her long white nightgown she hurried to the bed  i say dear she exclaimed may i come into the fold i prefer the shelter of your company dear during this little lot  dont you like it cried louisa i think its lovelylovely  there came another slash of lightning the night seemed to open and shut it was a pallid vision of a ghostworld between the clanging shutters of darkness louisa and olive clung to each other spasmodically  there exclaimed the former breathless that was fine helena did you see that  she clasped ecstatically the hand of her friend who was lying down helenas answer was extinguished by the burst of thunder  theres no accounting for tastes said olive taking a place in the bed i cant say im struck on lightning what about you helena  im not struck yet replied helena with a sarcastic attempt at a jest  thank you dear said olive you do me the honour of catching hold  helena laughed ironically  catching what asked louisa mystified  why dear answered olive heavily condescending to explain i offered helena the handle of a pun and she took it what a flash you know its not that im afraid  the rest of her speech was overwhelmed in thunder  helena lay on the edge of the bed listening to the ecstatics of one friend and to the impertinences of the other in spite of her ironical feeling the thunder impressed her with a sense of fatality the night opened revealing a ghostly landscape instantly to shut again with blackness then the thunder crashed helena felt as if some secret were being disclosed too swiftly and violently for her to understand the thunder exclaimed horribly on the matter she was sure something had happened  gradually the storm drew away the rain came down with a rush persisted with a bruising sound upon the earth and the leaves  what a deluge exclaimed louisa  no one answered her olive was falling asleep and helena was in no mood to reply louisa disconsolate lay looking at the black window nursing a grievance until she too drifted into sleep helena was awake the storm had left her with a settled sense of calamity she felt bruised the sound of the heavy rain bruising the ground outside represented her feeling she could not get rid of the bruised sense of disaster  she lay wondering what it was why siegmund had not written what could have happened to him she imagined all of them terrible and endued with grandeur for she had kinship with hedda gabler  but no she said to herself it is impossible anything should have happened to himi should have known i should have known the moment his spirit left his body he would have come to me but i slept without dreams last night and today i am sure there has been no crisis it is impossible it should have happened to him i should have known  she was very certain that in event of siegmunds death she would have received intelligence she began to consider all the causes which might arise to prevent his writing immediately to her  nevertheless she said at last if i dont hear tomorrow i will go and see  she had written to him on monday if she should receive no answer by wednesday morning she would return to london as she was deciding this she went to sleep  the next day passed without news helena was in a state of distress her wistfulness touched the other two women very keenly louisa waited upon her was very tender and solicitous olive who was becoming painful by reason of her unsatisfied curiosity had to be told in part of the state of affairs  helena looked up a train she was quite sure by this time that something fatal awaited her  the next morning she bade her friends a temporary goodbye saying she would return in the evening immediately the train had gone louisa rushed into the little waitingroom of the station and wept olive shed tears for sympathy and selfpity she pitied herself that she should be let in for so dismal a holiday louisa suddenly stopped crying and sat up  oh i know im a pig dear am i not she exclaimed spoiling your holiday but i couldnt help it dear indeed i could not  my dear lou cried olive in tragic contralto dont refrain for my sake the bargains made we cant help whats in the bundle  the two unhappy women trudged the long miles back from the station to their lodging helena sat in the swinging express revolving the same thought like a prayerwheel it would be difficult to think of anything more trying than thus sitting motionless in the train which itself is throbbing and bursting its heart with anxiety while one waits hour after hour for the blow which falls nearer as the distance lessens all the time helenas heart and her consciousness were with siegmund in london for she believed he was ill and needed her  promise me she had said if ever i were sick and wanted you you would come to me  i would come to you from hell siegmund had replied  and if you were illyou would let me come to you she had added  i promise he answered  now helena believed he was ill perhaps very ill perhaps she only could be of any avail the miles of distance were like hot bars of iron across her breast and against them it was impossible to strive the train did what it could  that day remains as a smear in the record of helenas life in it there is no spacing of hours no lettering of experience merely a smear of suspense  towards six oclock she alighted at surbiton station deciding that this would be the quickest way of getting to wimbledon she paced the platform slowly as if resigned but her heart was crying out at the great injustice of delay presently the local train came in she had planned to buy a local paper at wimbledon and if from that source she could learn nothing she would go on to his house and inquire she had prearranged everything minutely  after turning the newspaper several times she found what she sought  the funeral took place at two oclock today at kingston cemetery of  deceased was a professor of music and had just returned from a holiday on the south coast  the paragraph in a bald twelve lines told her everything  jury returned a verdict of suicide during temporary insanity sympathy was expressed for the widow and children  helena stood still on the station for some time looking at the print then she dropped the paper and wandered into the town not knowing where she was going  that was what i got she said months afterwards and it was like a brick it was like a brick  she wandered on and on until suddenly she found herself in the grassy lane with only a wire fence bounding her from the open fields on either side beyond which fields on the left she could see siegmunds house standing florid by the road catching the western sunlight then she stopped realizing where she had come for some time she stood looking at the house it was no use her going there it was of no use her going anywhere the whole wide world was opened but in it she had no destination and there was no direction for her to take as if marooned in the world she stood desolate looking from the house of siegmund over the fields and the hills siegmund was gone why had he not taken her with him  the evening was drawing on it was nearly half past seven when helena looked at her watch remembering louisa who would be waiting for her to return to cornwall  i must either go to her or wire to her she will be in a fever of suspense said helena to herself and straightway she hurried to catch a tramcar to return to the station she arrived there at a quarter to eight there was no train down to tintagel that night therefore she wired the news  siegmund dead no train tonight am going home                                       this done she took her ticket and sat down to wait by the strength of her will everything she did was reasonable and accurate but her mind was chaotic  it was like a brick she reiterated and that brutal simile was the only one she could find months afterwards to describe her condition she felt as if something had crashed into her brain stunning and maiming her  as she knocked at the door of home she was apparently quite calm her mother opened to her  what are you alone cried mrs verden  yes louisa did not come up replied helena passing into the diningroom as if by instinct she glanced on the mantelpiece to see if there was a letter there was a newspaper cutting she went forward and took it it was from one of the london papers  inquest was held today upon the body of   helena read it read it again folded it up and put it in her purse her mother stood watching her consumed with distress and anxiety  how did you get to know she asked  i went to wimbledon and bought a local paper replied the daughter in her muted toneless voice  did you go to the house asked the mother sharply  no replied helena  i was wondering whether to send you that paper said her mother hesitatingly  helena did not answer her she wandered about the house mechanically looking for something her mother followed her trying very gently to help her  for some time helena sat at table in the diningroom staring before her her parents moved restlessly in silence trying not to irritate her by watching her praying for something to change the fixity of her look they acknowledged themselves helpless like children they felt powerless and forlorn and were very quiet  wont you go to rest nellie asked the father at last he was an unobtrusive obscure man whose sympathy was very delicate whose ordinary attitude was one of gentle irony  wont you go to rest nellie he repeated  helena shivered slightly  do my dear her mother pleaded let me take you to bed  helena rose she had a great horror of being fussed or petted but this night she went dully upstairs and let her mother help her to undress when she was in bed the mother stood for some moments looking at her yearning to beseech her daughter to pray to god but she dared not helena moved with a wild impatience under her mothers gaze  shall i leave you the candle said mrs verden  no blow it out replied the daughter the mother did so and immediately left the room going downstairs to her husband as she entered the diningroom he glanced up timidly at her she was a tall erect woman her brown eyes usually so swift and searching were haggard with tears that did not fall he bowed down obliterating himself his hands were tightly clasped  will she be all right if you leave her he asked  we must listen replied the mother abruptly  the parents sat silent in their customary places presently mrs verden cleared the supper table sweeping together a few crumbs from the floor in the place where helena had sat carefully putting her pieces of broken bread under the loaf to keep moist then she sat down again one could see she was keenly alert to every sound the father had his hand to his head he was thinking and praying  mrs verden suddenly rose took a box of matches from the mantelpiece and hurrying her stately heavy tread went upstairs her husband followed in much trepidation hovering near the door of his daughters room the mother tremblingly lit the candle helenas aspect distressed and alarmed her the girls face was masked as if in sleep but occasionally it was crossed by a vivid expression of fear or horror her wide eyes showed the active insanity of her brain from time to time she uttered strange inarticulate sounds her mother held her hands and soothed her although she was hardly aware of the mothers presence helena was more tranquil the father went downstairs and turned out the light he brought his wife a large shawl which he put on the bedrail and silently left the room then he went and kneeled down by his own bedside and prayed  mrs verden watched her daughters delirium and all the time in a kind of mental chant invoked the help of god once or twice the girl came to herself drew away her hand on recognizing the situation and turned from her mother who patiently waited until upon relapse she could soothe her daughter again helena was glad of her mothers presence but she could not bear to be looked at  towards morning the girl fell naturally asleep the mother regarded her closely lightly touched her forehead with her lips and went away having blown out the candle she found her husband kneeling in his nightshirt by the bed he muttered a few swift syllables and looked up as she entered  she is asleep whispered the wife hoarsely  is it aa natural sleep hesitated the husband  yes i think it is i think she will be all right  thank god whispered the father almost inaudibly  he held his wifes hand as she lay by his side he was the comforter she felt as if now she might cry and take comfort and sleep he the quiet obliterated man held her hand taking the responsibility upon himself    chapter 30   beatrice was careful not to let the blow of siegmunds death fall with full impact upon her as it were she dodged it she was afraid to meet the accusation of the dead siegmund with the sacred jury of memories when the event summoned her to stand before the bench of her own souls understanding she fled leaving the verdict upon herself eternally suspended  when the neighbours had come alarmed by her screaming she had allowed herself to be taken away from her own house into the home of a neighbour there the children were brought to her there she wept and stared wildly about as if by instinct seeking to cover her mind with confusion the good neighbour controlled matters in siegmunds house sending for the police helping to lay out the dead body before vera and frank came home and before beatrice returned to her own place the bedroom of siegmund was locked  beatrice avoided seeing the body of her husband she gave him one swift glance blinded by excitement she never saw him after his death she was equally careful to avoid thinking of him whenever her thoughts wandered towards a consideration of how he must have felt what his inner life must have been during the past six years she felt herself dilate with terror and she hastened to invoke protection  the children she said to herselfthe children i must live for the children i must think for the children  this she did and with much success all her tears and her wildness rose from terror and dismay rather than from grief she managed to fend back a grief that would probably have broken her vera was too practicalminded she had too severe a notion of what ought to be and what ought not ever to put herself in her fathers place and try to understand him she concerned herself with judging him sorrowfully exonerating him in part because helena that other was so much more to blame frank as a sentimentalist wept over the situation not over the personae the children were acutely distressed by the harassing behaviour of the elders and longed for a restoration of equanimity by common consent no word was spoken of siegmund as soon as possible after the funeral beatrice moved from south london to harrow the memory of siegmund began to fade rapidly  beatrice had had all her life a fancy for a more open public form of living than that of a domestic circle she liked strangers about the house they stimulated her agreeably therefore nine months after the death of her husband she determined to carry out the scheme of her heart and take in boarders she came of a welltodo family with whom she had been in disgrace owing to her early romantic but degrading marriage with a young lad who had neither income nor profession in the tragic but also sordid event of his death the waltons returned again to the aid of beatrice they came hesitatingly and kept their gloves on they inquired what she intended to do she spoke highly and hopefully of her future boardinghouse they found her a couple of hundred pounds glad to salve their consciences so cheaply siegmunds father a winsome old man with a heart of young gold was always ready further to diminish his diminished income for the sake of his grandchildren so beatrice was set up in a fairly large house in highgate was equipped with two maids and gentlemen were invited to come and board in her house it was a huge adventure wherein beatrice was delighted vera was excited and interested frank was excited but doubtful and grudging the children were excited elated wondering the world was big with promise  three gentlemen came before a month was out to beatrices establishment she hoped shortly to get a fourth or a fifth her plan was to play hostess and thus bestow on her boarders the inestimable blessing of family life breakfast was at eightthirty and everyone attended vera sat opposite beatrice frank sat on the maternal right hand mr macwhirter who was superior sat on the left hand next him sat mr allport whose opposite was mr holiday all were young men of less than thirty years mr macwhirter was tall fair and stoutish he was very quietly spoken was humorous and amiable yet extraordinarily learned he never by any chance gave himself away maintaining always an absolute reserve amid all his amiability therefore frank would have done anything to win his esteem while beatrice was deferential to him mr allport was tall and broad and thin as a door he had also a remarkably small chin he was naïve inclined to suffer in the first pangs of disillusionment nevertheless he was waywardly humorous sometimes wistful sometimes petulant always gallant therefore vera liked him whilst beatrice mothered him mr holiday was short very stout very ruddy with black hair he had a disagreeable voice was vulgar in the grain but officiously helpful if appeal were made to him therefore frank hated him vera liked his handsome lusty appearance but resented bitterly his behaviour beatrice was proud of the superior and skilful way in which she handled him clipping him into shape without hurting him  one evening in july eleven months after the burial of siegmund beatrice went into the diningroom and found mr allport sitting with his elbow on the windowsill looking out on the garden it was halfpast seven the red rents between the foliage of the trees showed the sun was setting a fragrance of eveningscented stocks filtered into the room through the open window towards the south the moon was budding out of the twilight  what you here all alone exclaimed beatrice who had just come from putting the children to bed i thought you had gone out  noo whats the use replied mr allport turning to look at his landlady of going out theres nowhere to go  oh come theres the heath and the cityand you must join a tennis club now i know just the thingthe club to which vera belongs  ah yes you go down to the citybut theres nothing therewhat i mean to sayyou want a paland even thenwellhe drawled the wordweell its merely escaping from yourselfkilling time  oh dont say that exclaimed beatrice you want to enjoy life  just so ah just so exclaimed mr allport but all the sameits like thisyou only get up to the same thing tomorrow what i mean to saywhats the good after all its merely living because youve got to  you are too pessimistic altogether for a young man i look at it differently myself yet ill be bound i have more cause for grumbling whats the trouble now  weellyou cant lay your finger on a thing like that what i mean to sayits nothing very definite but after allwhat is there to do but to hop out of life as quickly as possible thats the best way  beatrice became suddenly grave  you talk in that way mr allport she said you dont think of the others  i dont know he drawled what does it matter look herewhod care what i mean to sayfor long  thats all very easy but its cowardly replied beatrice gravely  nevertheless said mr allport its trueisnt it  it is notand i should know replied beatrice drawing a cloak of reserve ostentatiously over her face mr allport looked at her and waited beatrice relaxed toward the pessimistic young man  yes she said i call it very cowardly to want to get out of your difficulties in that way think what you inflict on other people you men youre all selfish the burden is always left for the women  ah but then said mr allport very softly and sympathetically looking at beatrices black dress ive no one depending on me  noyou haventbut youve a mother and sister the women always have to bear the brunt  mr allport looked at beatrice and found her very pathetic  yes they do rather he replied sadly tentatively waiting  my husband began beatrice the young man waited my husband was one of your sort he ran after trouble and when hed found ithe couldnt carry it offand left itto me  mr allport looked at her very sympathetically  you dont mean it he exclaimed softly surely he didnt  beatrice nodded and turned aside her face  yes she said i know what it is to bear that kind of thingand its no light thing i can assure you  there was a suspicion of tears in her voice  and when was this thenthat he asked mr allport almost with reverence  only last year replied beatrice  mr allport made a sound expressing astonishment and dismay little by little beatrice told him so much her husband had got entangled with another woman she herself had put up with it for a long time at last she had brought matters to a crisis declaring what she should do he had killed himselfhanged himselfand left her penniless her people who were very wealthy had done for her as much as she would allow them she and frank and vera had done the rest she did not mind for herself it was for frank and vera who should be now enjoying their careless youth that her heart was heavy  there was silence for a while mr allport murmured his sympathy and sat overwhelmed with respect for this little woman who was unbroken by tragedy the bell rang in the kitchen vera entered  oh what a nice smell sitting in the dark mother  i was just trying to cheer up mr allport he is very despondent  pray do not overlook me said mr allport rising and bowing  well i did not see you fancy your sitting in the twilight chatting with the mater you must have been an unscrupulous bore maman  on the contrary replied mr allport mrs macnair has been so good as to bear with me making a fool of myself  in what way asked vera sharply  mr allport is so despondent i think he must be in love said beatrice playfully  unfortunately i am notor at least i am not yet aware of it said mr allport bowing slightly to vera  she advanced and stood in the bay of the window her skirt touching the young mans knees she was tall and graceful with her hands clasped behind her back she stood looking up at the moon now white upon the richly darkening sky  dont look at the moon miss macnair its all rind said mr allport in melancholy mockery somebodys bitten all the meat out of our slice of moon and left us nothing but peel  it certainly does look like a piece of melonshellone portion replied vera  never mind miss macnair he said whoever got the slice found it raw i think  oh i dont know she said but isnt it a beautiful evening i will just go and see if i can catch the primroses opening  what primroses he exclaimed  evening primrosesthere are some  are there he said in surprise vera smiled to herself  yes come and look she said  the young man rose with alacrity  mr holiday came into the diningroom whilst they were down the garden  what nobody in they heard him exclaim  there is holiday murmured mr allport resentfully  vera did not answer holiday came to the open window attracted by the fragrance  ho thats where you are he cried in his nasal tenor which annoyed veras trained ear she wished she had not been wearing a white dress to betray herself  what have you got he asked  nothing in particular replied mr allport  mr holiday sniggered  oh well if its nothing particular and private said mr holiday and with that he leaped over the windowsill and went to join them  curst fool muttered mr allport i beg your pardon he added swiftly to vera  have you ever noticed mr holiday asked vera as if very friendly how awfully tantalizing these flowers are they wont open while youre looking  no sniggered he i dont blame em why should they give themselves away any more than you do you wont open while youre watched he nudged allport facetiously with his elbow  after supper which was late and badly served the young men were in poor spirits mr macwhirter retired to read mr holiday sat picking his teeth mr allport begged vera to play the piano  oh the piano is not my instrument mine was the violin but i do not play now she replied  but you will begin again pleaded mr allport  no never she said decisively allport looked at her closely the family tragedy had something to do with her decision he was sure he watched her interestedly  mother used to play she began  vera said beatrice reproachfully  let us have a song suggested mr holiday  mr holiday wishes to sing mother said vera going to the musicrack  nayiits not me holiday began  the village blacksmith said vera pulling out the piece holiday advanced vera glanced at her mother  but i have not touched the piano forfor years i am sure protested beatrice  you can play beautifully said vera  beatrice accompanied the song holiday sang atrociously allport glared at him vera remained very calm  at the end beatrice was overcome by the touch of the piano she went out abruptly  mother has suddenly remembered that tomorrows jellies are not made laughed vera  allport looked at her and was sad  when beatrice returned holiday insisted she should play again she would have found it more difficult to refuse than to comply  vera retired early soon to be followed by allport and holiday at half past ten mr macwhirter came in with his ancient volume beatrice was studying a cookerybook  you too at the midnight lamp exclaimed macwhirter politely  ah i am only looking for a pudding for tomorrow beatrice replied  we shall feel hopelessly in debt if you look after us so well smiled the young man ironically  i must look after you said beatrice  you dowonderfully i feel that we owe you large debts of gratitude the meals were generally late and something was always wrong  because i scan a list of puddings smiled beatrice uneasily  for the puddings themselves and all your good things the piano for instance that was very nice indeed he bowed to her  did it disturb you but one does not hear very well in the study  i opened the door said macwhirter bowing again  it is not fair said beatrice i am clumsy nowclumsy i once could play  you play excellently why that once could said macwhirter  ah you are amiable my old master would have said differently she replied  we said macwhirter are humble amateurs and to us you are more than excellent  good old monsieur fannière how he would scold me he said i would not take my talent out of the napkin he would quote me the new testament i always think scripture false in french do not you  ermy acquaintance with modern languages is not extensive i regret to say  no i was brought up at a convent school near rouen  ahthat would be very interesting  yes but i was there six years and the interest wears off everything  alas assented macwhirter smiling  those times were very different from these said beatrice  i should think so said macwhirter waxing grave and sympathetic    chapter 31   in the same month of july not yet a year after siegmunds death helena sat on the top of the tramcar with cecil byrne she was dressed in blue linen for the day had been hot byrne was holding up to her a yellowbacked copy of einsame menschen and she was humming the air of the russian folksong printed on the front page frowning nodding with her head and beating time with her hand to get the rhythm of the song she turned suddenly to him and shook her head laughing  i cant get itits no use i think its the swinging of the car prevents me getting the time she said  these little outside things always come a victory over you he laughed  do they she replied smiling bending her head against the wind it was six oclock in the evening the sky was quite overcast after a dim warm day the tramcar was leaping along southwards out of the corners of his eyes byrne watched the crisp morsels of hair shaken on her neck by the wind  do you know she said it feels rather like rain  then said he calmly but turning away to watch the people below on the pavement you certainly ought not to be out  i ought not she said for im totally unprovided  neither however had the slightest intention of turning back  presently they descended from the car and took a road leading uphill off the highway trees hung over one side whilst on the other side stood a few villas with lawns upraised upon one of these lawns two great sheepdogs rushed and stood at the brink of the grassy declivity at some height above the road barking and urging boisterously helena and byrne stood still to watch them one dog was grey as is usual the other pale fawn they raved extravagantly at the two pedestrians helena laughed at them  they are she began in her slow manner  villa sheepdogs baying us wolves he continued  no she said they remind me of fafner and fasolt  fasolt they are like that i wonder if they really dislike us  it appears so she laughed  dogs generally chum up to me he said  helena began suddenly to laugh he looked at her inquiringly  i remember she said still laughing at knockholtyoua halfgrown lamba dogin procession she marked the position of the three with her finger  what an ass i must have looked he said  sort of silent pied piper she laughed  dogs do follow me like that though he said  they did siegmund she said  ah he exclaimed  i remember they had for a long time a little brown dog that followed him home  ah he exclaimed  i remember too she said a little blackandwhite kitten that followed me mater would not have it inshe would not and i remember finding it a few days after dead in the road i dont think i ever quite forgave my mater that  more sorrow over one kitten brought to destruction than over all the sufferings of men he said  she glanced at him and laughed he was smiling ironically  for the latter you see she replied i am not responsible  as they neared the top of the hill a few spots of rain fell  you know said helena if it begins it will continue all night look at that  she pointed to the great dark reservoir of cloud ahead  had we better go back he asked  well we will go on and find a thick tree then we can shelter till we see how it turns out we are not far from the cars here  they walked on and on the raindrops fell more thickly then thinned away  it is exactly a year today she said as theywalked on the round shoulder of the down with an oakwood on the left hand exactly  what anniversary is it then he inquired  exactly a year today siegmund and i walked hereby the day thursday we went through the larchwood have you ever been through the larchwood  no  we will go then she said  history repeats itself he remarked  how she asked calmly  he was pulling at the heads of the cocksfoot grass as he walked  i see no repetition she added  no he exclaimed bitingly you are right  they went on in silence as they drew near a farm they saw the men unloading a last wagon of hay on to a very brown stack he sniffed the air though he was angry he spoke  they got that hay rather damp he said cant you smell itlike hot tobacco and sandalwood  what is that the stack she asked  yes its always like that when its picked damp  the conversation was restarted but did not flourish when they turned on to a narrow path by the side of the field he went ahead leaning over the hedge he pulled three sprigs of honeysuckle yellow as butter full of scent then he waited for her she was hanging her head looking in the hedgebottom he presented her with the flowers without speaking she bent forward inhaled the rich fragrance and looked up at him over the blossoms with her beautiful beseeching blue eyes he smiled gently to her  isnt it nice he said arent they fine bits  she took them without answering and put one piece carefully in her dress it was quite against her rule to wear a flower he took his place by her side  i always like the goldgreen of cut fields he said they seem to give off sunshine even when the skys greyer than a tabby cat  she laughed instinctively putting out her hand towards the glowing field on her right  they entered the larchwood there the chill wind was changed into sound like a restless insect he hovered about her like a butterfly whose antennae flicker and twitch sensitively as they gather intelligence touching the aura as it were of the female he was exceedingly delicate in his handling of her  the path was cut windingly through the lofty dark and closely serried trees which vibrated like chords under the soft bow of the wind now and again he would look down passages between the treesnarrow pillared corridors dusky as if webbed across with mist all round was a twilight thickly populous with slender silent trunks helena stood still gazing up at the treetops where the bow of the wind was drawn causing slight perceptible quivering byrne walked on without her at a bend in the path he stood with his hand on the roundness of a larchtrunk looking back at her a blue fleck in the brownness of congregated trees she moved very slowly down the path  i might as well not exist for all she is aware of me he said to himself bitterly nevertheless when she drew near he said brightly  have you noticed how the thousands of dry twigs between the trunks make a brown mist a brume  she looked at him suddenly as if interrupted  hm yes i see what you mean  she smiled at him because of his bright boyish tone and manner  thats the larch fog he laughed  yes she said you see it in pictures i had not noticed it before  he shook the tree on which his hand was laid  it laughs through its teeth he said smiling playing with everything he touched  as they went along she caught swiftly at her hat then she stooped picking up a hatpin of twined silver she laughed to herself as if pleased by a coincidence  last year she said the larchfingers stole both my pinsthe same ones  he looked at her wondering how much he was filling the place of a ghost with warmth he thought of siegmund and seemed to see him swinging down the steep bank out of the wood exactly as he himself was doing at the moment with helena stepping carefully behind he always felt a deep sympathy and kinship with siegmund sometimes he thought he hated helena  they had emerged at the head of a shallow valleyone of those wide hollows in the north downs that are like a great length of tapestry held loosely by four people it was raining byrne looked at the dark blue dots rapidly appearing on the sleeves of helenas dress they walked on a little way the rain increased helena looked about for shelter  here said byrnehere is our tenta black tartarsready pitched  he stooped under the low boughs of a very large yew tree that stood just back from the path she crept after him it was really a very good shelter byrne sat on the ledge of a root helena beside him he looked under the flap of the black branches down the valley the grey rain was falling steadily the dark hollow under the tree was immersed in the monotonous sound of it in the open where the bright young corn shone intense with wet green was a fold of sheep exposed in a large pen on the hillside they were moving restlessly now and again came the tongtingtong of a sheepbell first the grey creatures huddled in the high corner then one of them descended and took shelter by the growing corn lowest down the rest followed bleating and pushing each other in their anxiety to reach the place of desire which was no whit better than where they stood before  thats like us all said byrne whimsically were all penned out on a wet evening but we think if only we could get where someone else is it would be deliciously cosy  helena laughed swiftly as she always did when he became whimsical and fretful he sat with his head bent down smiling with his lips but his eyes melancholy she put her hand out to him he took it without apparently observing it folding his own hand over it and unconsciously increasing the pressure  you are cold he said  only my hands and they usually are she replied gently  and mine are generally warm  i know that she said its almost the only warmth i get nowyour hands they really are wonderfully warm and closetouching  as good as a baked potato he said  she pressed his hand scolding him for his mockery  so many calories per weekisnt that how we manage it he asked on credit  she put her other hand on his as if beseeching him to forgo his irony which hurt her they sat silent for some time the sheep broke their cluster and began to straggle back to the upper side of the pen  tongtong tong went the forlorn bell the rain waxed louder  byrne was thinking of the previous week he had gone to helenas home to read german with her as usual she wanted to understand wagner in his own language  in each of the armchairs reposing across the arms was a violincase he had sat down on the edge of one seat in front of the sacred fiddle helena had come quickly and removed the violin  i shant knock itit is all right he had said protesting  this was siegmunds violin which helena had managed to purchase and byrne was always ready to yield its precedence  it was all right he repeated  but you were not she had replied gently  since that time his heart had beat quick with excitement now he sat in a little storm of agitation of which nothing was betrayed by his gloomy pondering expression but some of which was communicated to helena by the increasing pressure of his hand which adjusted itself delicately in a stronger and stronger stress over her fingers and palm by some movement he became aware that her hand was uncomfortable he relaxed she sighed as if restless and dissatisfied she wondered what he was thinking of he smiled quietly  the babes in the wood he teased  helena laughed with a sound of tears in the tree overhead some bird began to sing in spite of the rain a broken evening song  that little beggar sees its a hopeless case so he reminds us of heaven but if hes going to cover us with yewleaves hes set himself a job  helena laughed again and shivered he put his arm round her drawing her nearer his warmth after this new and daring move neither spoke for a while  the rain continues he said  and will do she added laughing  quite content he said  the bird overhead chirruped loudly again  strew on us roses roses quoted byrne adding after a while in wistful mockery and never a sprig of yeweh  helena made a small sound of tenderness and comfort for him and weariness for herself she let herself sink a little closer against him  shall it not be sono yew he murmured  he put his left hand with which he had been breaking larchtwigs on her chilled wrist noticing that his fingers were dirty he held them up  i shall make marks on you he said  they will come off she replied  yes we come clean after everything time scrubs all sorts of scars off us  some scars dont seem to go she smiled  and she held out her other arm which had been pressed warm against his side there just above the wrist was the red suninflammation from last year byrne regarded it gravely  but its wearing offeven that he said wistfully  helena put her arms found him under his coat she was cold he felt a hot wave of joy suffuse him almost immediately she released him and took off her hat  that is better he said  i was afraid of the pins said she  ive been dodging them for the last hour he said laughing as she put her arms under his coat again for warmth  she laughed and making a small moaning noise as if of weariness and helplessness she sank her head on his chest he put down his cheek against hers  i want rest and warmth she said in her dull tones  all right he murmured
