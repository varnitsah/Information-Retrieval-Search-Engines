3280051	eight or nine   wise words   about   letterwriting     by   lewis carroll     emberlin and son   4 magdalen street   oxford       first published   1890     contents                                       page    on stampcases                      5    how to begin a letter               9    how to go on with a letter         12    how to end a letter                21    on registering correspondence      23     § 1 on stampcases   some american writer has said the snakes in this district may be divided into one speciesthe venomous the same principle applies here postagestampcases may be divided into one species the wonderland imitations of it will soon appear no doubt but they cannot include the two pictorial surprises which are copyright  you dont see why i call them surprises well take the case in your lefthand and regard it attentively you see alice nursing the duchesss baby an entirely new combination by the way it doesnt occur in the book now with your right thumb and forefinger lay hold of the little book and suddenly pull it out the baby has turned into a pig if that doesnt surprise you why i suppose you wouldnt be surprised if your own motherinlaw suddenly turned into a gyroscope  this case is not intended to carry about in your pocket far from it people seldom want any other stamps on an emergency than pennystamps for letters sixpennystamps for telegrams and a bit of stampedging for cut fingers it makes capital stickingplaster and will stand three or four washings cautiously conducted and all these are easily carried in a purse or pocketbook no this is meant to haunt your envelopecase or wherever you keep your writingmaterials what made me invent it was the constantly wanting stamps of other values for foreign letters parcel post c and finding it very bothersome to get at the kind i wanted in a hurry since i have possessed a wonderland stamp case life has been bright and peaceful and i have used no other i believe the queens laundress uses no other  each of the pockets will hold 6 stamps comfortably i would recommend you to arrange the 6 before putting them in something like a bouquet making them lean to the right and to the left alternately thus there will always be a free corner to get hold of so as to take them out quickly and easily one by one otherwise you will find them apt to come out two or three at a time  according to my experience the 5d 9d and 1s stamps are hardly ever wanted though i have constantly to replenish all the other pockets if your experience agrees with mine you may find it convenient to keep only a couple say of each of these 3 kinds in the 1s pocket and to fill the other 2 pockets with extra 1d stamps     § 2 how to begin a letter   if the letter is to be in answer to another begin by getting out that other letter and reading it through in order to refresh your memory as to what it is you have to answer and as to your correspondents present address otherwise you will be sending your letter to his regular address in london though he has been careful in writing to give you his torquay address in full  next address and stamp the envelope what before writing the letter most certainly and ill tell you what will happen if you dont you will go on writing till the last moment and just in the middle of the last sentence you will become aware that times up then comes the hurried windupthe wildlyscrawled signaturethe hastilyfastened envelope which comes open in the postthe address a mere hieroglyphicthe horrible discovery that youve forgotten to replenish your stampcasethe frantic appeal to every one in the house to lend you a stampthe headlong rush to the post office arriving hot and gasping just after the box has closedand finally a week afterwards the return of the letter from the deadletter office marked address illegible  next put your own address in full at the top of the notesheet it is an aggravating thingi speak from bitter experiencewhen a friend staying at some new address heads his letter dover simply assuming that you can get the rest of the address from his previous letter which perhaps you have destroyed  next put the date in full it is another aggravating thing when you wish years afterwards to arrange a series of letters to find them dated feb 17 aug 2 without any year to guide you as to which comes first and never never dear madam nb this remark is addressed to ladies only no man would ever do such a thing put wednesday simply as the date  that way madness lies     § 3 how to go on with a letter   here is a golden rule to begin with write legibly the average temper of the human race would be perceptibly sweetened if everybody obeyed this rule a great deal of the bad writing in the world comes simply from writing too quickly of course you reply i do it to save time a very good object no doubt but what right have you to do it at your friends expense isnt his time as valuable as yours years ago i used to receive letters from a friendand very interesting letters toowritten in one of the most atrocious hands ever invented it generally took me about a week to read one of his letters i used to carry it about in my pocket and take it out at leisure times to puzzle over the riddles which composed itholding it in different positions and at different distances till at last the meaning of some hopeless scrawl would flash upon me when i at once wrote down the english under it and when several had been thus guessed the context would help one with the others till at last the whole series of hieroglyphics was deciphered if all ones friends wrote like that life would be entirely spent in reading their letters  this rule applies specially to names of people or placesand most specially to foreign names i got a letter once containing some russian names written in the same hasty scramble in which people often write yours sincerely the context of course didnt help in the least and one spelling was just as likely as another so far as i knew it was necessary to write and tell my friend that i couldnt read any of them  my second rule is dont fill more than a page and a half with apologies for not having written sooner  the best subject to begin with is your friends last letter write with the letter open before you answer his questions and make any remarks his letter suggests then go on to what you want to say yourself this arrangement is more courteous and pleasanter for the reader than to fill the letter with your own invaluable remarks and then hastily answer your friends questions in a postscript your friend is much more likely to enjoy your wit after his own anxiety for information has been satisfied  in referring to anything your friend has said in his letter it is best to quote the exact words and not to give a summary of them in your words as impression of what b has said expressed in as words will never convey to b the meaning of his own words  this is specially necessary when some point has arisen as to which the two correspondents do not quite agree there ought to be no opening for such writing as you are quite mistaken in thinking i said soandso it was not in the least my meaning c c which tends to make a correspondence last for a lifetime  a few more rules may fitly be given here for correspondence that has unfortunately become controversial  one is dont repeat yourself when once you have said your say fully and clearly on a certain point and have failed to convince your friend drop that subject to repeat your arguments all over again will simply lead to his doing the same and so you will go on like a circulating decimal did you ever know a circulating decimal come to an end  another rule is when you have written a letter that you feel may possibly irritate your friend however necessary you may have felt it to so express yourself put it aside till the next day then read it over again and fancy it addressed to yourself this will often lead to your writing it all over again taking out a lot of the vinegar and pepper and putting in honey instead and thus making a much more palatable dish of it if when you have done your best to write inoffensively you still feel that it will probably lead to further controversy keep a copy of it there is very little use months afterwards in pleading i am almost sure i never expressed myself as you say to the best of my recollection i said soandso far better to be able to write i did not express myself so these are the words i used  my fifth rule is if your friend makes a severe remark either leave it unnoticed or make your reply distinctly less severe and if he makes a friendly remark tending towards making up the little difference that has arisen between you let your reply be distinctly more friendly if in picking a quarrel each party declined to go more than threeeighths of the way and if in making friends each was ready to go fiveeighths of the waywhy there would be more reconciliations than quarrels which is like the irishmans remonstrance to his gadabout daughtershure youre always goin out you go out three times for wanst that you come in  my sixth rule and my last remark about controversial correspondence is dont try to have the last word how many a controversy would be nipped in the bud if each was anxious to let the other have the last word never mind how telling a rejoinder you leave unuttered never mind your friends supposing that you are silent from lack of anything to say let the thing drop as soon as it is possible without discourtesy remember speech is silvern but silence is golden nbif you are a gentleman and your friend a lady this rule is superfluous you wont get the last word  my seventh rule is if it should ever occur to you to write jestingly in dispraise of your friend be sure you exaggerate enough to make the jesting obvious a word spoken in jest but taken as earnest may lead to very serious consequences i have known it to lead to the breakingoff of a friendship suppose for instance you wish to remind your friend of a sovereign you have lent him which he has forgotten to repayyou might quite mean the words i mention it as you seem to have a conveniently bad memory for debts in jest yet there would be nothing to wonder at if he took offence at that way of putting it but suppose you wrote long observation of your career as a pickpocket and a burglar has convinced me that my one lingering hope for recovering that sovereign i lent you is to say pay up or ill summons yer he would indeed be a matteroffact friend if he took that as seriously meant  my eighth rule when you say in your letter i enclose cheque for £5 or i enclose johns letter for you to see leave off writing for a momentgo and get the document referred toand put it into the envelope otherwise you are pretty certain to find it lying about after the post has gone  my ninth rule when you get to the end of a notesheet and find you have more to say take another piece of papera whole sheet or a scrap as the case may demand but whatever you do dont cross remember the old proverb crosswriting makes cross reading the old proverb you say enquiringly how old well not so very ancient i must confess in fact im afraid i invented it while writing this paragraph still you know old is a comparative term i think you would be quite justified in addressing a chicken just out of the shell as old boy when compared with another chicken that was only halfout     § 4 how to end a letter   if doubtful whether to end with yours faithfully or yours truly or yours most truly c there are at least a dozen varieties before you reach yours affectionately refer to your correspondents last letter and make your windingup at least as friendly as his in fact even if a shade more friendly it will do no harm  a postscript is a very useful invention but it is not meant as so many ladies suppose to contain the real gist of the letter it serves rather to throw into the shade any little matter we do not wish to make a fuss about for example your friend had promised to execute a commission for you in town but forgot it thereby putting you to great inconvenience and he now writes to apologize for his negligence it would be cruel and needlessly crushing to make it the main subject of your reply how much more gracefully it comes in thus ps dont distress yourself any more about having omitted that little matter in town i wont deny that it did put my plans out a little at the time but its all right now i often forget things myself and those who live in glasshouses mustnt throw stones you know  when you take your letters to the post carry them in your hand if you put them in your pocket you will take a long countrywalk i speak from experience passing the postoffice twice going and returning and when you get home will find them still in your pocket     § 5 on registering correspondence   let me recommend you to keep a record of letters received and sent i have kept one for many years and have found it of the greatest possible service in many ways it secures my answering letters however long they have to wait it enables me to refer for my own guidance to the details of previous correspondence though the actual letters may have been destroyed long ago and most valuable feature of all if any difficulty arises years afterwards in connection with a halfforgotten correspondence it enables me to say with confidence i did not tell you that he was an invaluable servant in every way and that you couldnt trust him too much i have a précis of my letter what i said was he is a valuable servant in many ways but dont trust him too much so if hes cheated you you really must not hold me responsible for it  i will now give you a few simple rules for making and keeping a letterregister  get a blank book containing say 200 leaves about 4 inches wide and 7 high it should be well fastened into its cover as it will have to be opened and shut hundreds of times have a line ruled in red ink down each margin of every page an inch off the edge the margin should be wide enough to contain a number of 5 digits easily i manage with a 34 inch margin but unless you write very small you will find an inch more comfortable  write a précis of each letter received or sent in chronological order let the entry of a received letter reach from the lefthand edge to the righthand marginal line and the entry of a sent letter from the lefthand marginal line to the righthand edge thus the two kinds will be quite distinct and you can easily hunt through the received letters by themselves without being bothered with the sent letters and vice versâ  use the righthand pages only and when you come to the end of the book turn it upsidedown and begin at the other end still using righthand pages you will find this much more comfortable than using lefthand pages  you will find it convenient to write at the top of every sheet of a received letter its registernumber in full  i will now give a few ideal specimen pages of my letterregister and make a few remarks on them after which i think you will find it easy enough to manage one for yourself        29217              90                                                            217  ap 1  tu   jones mrs  am  27518     sendg as present  from  self and mr

corner the next entrynumber i am going to use in full the last 3 digits of each entrynumber are enough afterwards and i put the date of the year at the top in the centre  i begin each entry with the last 3 digits of the entrynumber enclosed in an oval this is difficult to reproduce in print so i have put roundparentheses here then for the first entry in each page i put the day of the month and the day of the week afterwards do is enough for the monthday till it changes i do not repeat the weekday  next if the entry is not a letter i put a symbol for parcel see nos 243 245 or telegram see nos 230 231 as the case may be  next the name of the person underlined indicated here by italics  if an entry needs special further attention i put  at the end and when it has been attended to i fill in the appropriate symbol eg in no 218 it showed that the bill had to be paid in no 222 that an answer was really needed the × means attended to in no 234 that i owed the old lady a visit in no 235 that the item had to be entered in my account book in no 236 that i must not forget to write in no 239 that the address had to be entered in my addressbook in no 245 that the book had to be returned  i give each entry the space of 2 lines whether it fills them or not in order to have room for references and at the foot of each page i leave 2 or 3 lines blank often useful afterwards for entering omitted letters and miss one or 2 numbers before i begin the next page  at any odd moments of leisure i make up the entrybook in various ways as follows  1 i draw a second line at the righthand end of the received entries and at the lefthand end of the sent entries this i usually do pretty well up to date in my register the first line is red the second blue here i distinguish them by making the first thin and the second thick  2 beginning with the last entry and going backwards i read over the names till i recognise one as having occurred already i then link the two entries together by giving the one that comes first in chronological order a footreference see nos 217 225 i do not keep this uptodate but leave it till there are 4 or 5 pages to be done i work back till i come among entries that are all supplied with footreferences when i once more glance through the last few pages to see if there are any entries not yet supplied with headreferences their predecessors may need a special search if an entry is connected in subject with another under a different name i link them by crossreferences distinguished from the head and footreferences by being written further from the marginal line see no 229 when 2 consecutive entries have the same name and are both of the same kind ie both received or both sent i bracket them see nos 242 243 if of different kinds i link them with the symbol used for nos 219 220  3 beginning at the earliest entry not yet done with and going forwards i cross out every entry that has got a head and footreference and is done with by continuing the extra line through it see nos 221 223 225 thus wherever a break occurs in this extra line it shows there is some matter still needing attention i do not keep this anything like up to date but leave it till there are 30 or 40 pages to look through at a time when the first page in the volume is thus completely crossed out i put a mark at the foot of the page to indicate this and so with pages 2 3 c hence whenever i do this part of the making up i need not begin at the beginning of the volume but only at the earliest page that has not got this mark  all this looks very complicated when stated at full length but you will find it perfectly simple when you have had a little practice and will come to regard the makingup as a pleasant occupation for a rainy day or at any time that you feel disinclined for more severe mental work in the game of whist hoyle gives us one golden rule when in doubt win the tricki find that rule admirable for real life when in doubt what to do i makeup my
