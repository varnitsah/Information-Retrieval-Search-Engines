problems   i  with few exceptions the incidents recorded in these pages take place in one of the largest cities of the united states of america and of that portion called the middle westa city once conservative and provincial and rather proud of these qualities but now outgrown them and linked by lightning limited trains to other teeming centers of the modern world a city overtaken in recent years by the plague which has swept our country from the atlantic to the pacificprosperity before its advent the goodriches and gores the warings the prestons and the atterburys lived leisurely lives in a sleepy quarter of shade trees and spacious yards and muddy macadam streets now passed away forever existence was decorous marriage an irrevocable step wives were wives and the authorized version of the bible was true from cover to cover so dr gilman preached and so they believed  sunday was then a day essentially different from other daysyou could tell it without looking at the calendar the sun knew it and changed the quality of his light the very animals dogs and cats and horses knew it and most of all the children knew it by sunday school by dr gilmans sermon by a dizzy afternoon connected in some of their minds with ceramics and a lack of exercise by a cold tea and by church bells you were not allowed to forget it for one instant the city suddenly became full of churches as though they had magically been let down from heaven during saturday night they must have been there on week days but few persons ever thought of them  among the many church bells that rang on those bygone sundays was that of st johns of which dr gilman of beloved memory was rector dr gilman was a saint and if you had had the good luck to be baptized or married or buried by him you were probably fortunate in an earthly as well as heavenly sense one has to be careful not to deal exclusively in superlatives and yet it is not an exaggeration to say that st johns was the most beautiful and churchly edifice in the city thanks chiefly to several gentlemen of sense and one gentleman at least of tastemr horace bentley the vicissitudes of civil war interrupted its building but when in 1868 it stood completed its stone unsoiled as yet by factory smoke its spire delicately pointing to untainted skies its rose window glowing above the porch citizens on tower street often stopped to gaze at it diagonally across the vacant lot set in order by mr thurston gore with the intent that the view might be unobstructed  little did the goodriches and gores the warings and prestons and atterburys and other prominent people foresee the havoc that prosperity and smoke were to play with their residential plans one by one sooty commerce drove them out westward conservative though they were from the paradise they had created blacker and blacker grew the gothic facade of st johns thurston gore departed but leased his corner first for a goodly sum his ancestors being from connecticut leased also the vacant lot he had beautified where stores arose and hid the spire from tower street cable cars moved serenely up the long hill where a panting third horse had been necessary cable cars resounded in burton street between the new factory and the church where dr gilman still preached of peace and the delights of the newjerusalem and before you could draw your breath the cable cars had become electric gray hairs began to appear in the heads of the people dr gilman had married in the 60s and their children were going east to college    ii  in the first decade of the twentieth century asa waring still clung to the imposing early victorian mansion in hamilton street it presented an uncompromising and rather scornful front to the sister mansions with which it had hitherto been on intimate terms now fast degenerating into a shabby gentility seeking covertly to catch the eye of boarders but as yet refraining from open solicitation their lawns were growing a little ragged their stone steps and copings revealing cracks  asa waring looked with a stern distaste upon certain aspects of modern life and though he possessed the means to follow his friends and erstwhile neighbours into the newer paradise five miles westward he had successfully resisted for several years a formidable campaign to uproot him his three married daughters lived in that clean and verdant district surrounding the park spelled with a capital while evelyn and rex spent most of their time in the west end or at the country clubs even mrs waring who resembled a roman matron with her wavy white hair parted in the middle and her gentle yet classic features sighed secretly at times at the unyielding attitude of her husband although admiring him for it the grandchildren drew her  on the occasion of sunday dinner when they surrounded her her heart was filled to overflowing  the autumn sunlight reddened somewhat by the slight haze of smoke poured in at the high windows of the diningroom glinted on the silver and was split into bewildering colors by the prisms of the chandelier many precious extra leaves were inserted under the white cloth and mrs warings eyes were often dimmed with happiness as she glanced along the ranks on either side until they rested on the man with whom she had chosen to pass her life her admiration for him had gradually grown into heroworship his anger sometimes roused had a terrible moral quality that never failed to thrill her and the loyal legion button on his black frock coat seemed to her an epitome of his character he sat for the most part silent his remarkable penetrating eyes lighting under his grizzled brows smiling at her at the children at the grandchildren and sometimes he would go to the corner table where the four littlest sat and fetch one back to perch on his knee and pull at his white military mustache  it was the childrens day uproar greeted the huge white cylinder of icecream borne by katie the senior of the elderly maids uproar greeted the cake and finally there was a rush for the chocolates little tablets wrapped in tinfoil and tied with red and blue ribbon after that the pandemonium left the diningroom to spread itself over the spacious house from the basement to the great playroom in the attic where the dolls and blocks and hobbyhorses of the parental generation stoically awaited the new  sometimes a visitor was admitted to this sacramental feat the dearest old gentleman in the world with a great high bridged nose a slight stoop a kindling look and snow white hair though the top of his head was bald he sat on mrs warings right and was treated with the greatest deference by the elders and with none at all by the children who besieged him the bigger ones knew that he had had what is called a history that he had been rich once with a great mansion of his own but now he lived on dalton street almost in the slums and worked among the poor his name was mr bentley  he was not there on the particular sunday when this story opens otherwise the conversation about to be recorded would not have taken place for st johns church was not often mentioned in mr bentleys presence  well grandmother said phil goodrich who was the favourite soninlaw how was the new rector today  mr hodder is a remarkable young man phil mrs waring declared and delivered such a good sermon i couldnt help wishing that you and rex and evelyn and george had been in church  phil couldnt go explained the unmarried and sunburned evelyn he had a match on of eighteen holes with me  mrs waring sighed  i cant think whats got into the younger people these days that they seem so indifferent to religion your fathers a vestryman phil and i believe it has always been his hope that you would succeed him im afraid rex wont succeed his father she added with a touch of regret and a glance of pride at her husband you never go to church rex phil does  i got enough church at boardingschool to last me a lifetime mother her son replied he was slightly older than evelyn and just out of college besides any heathen can get on the vestryits a financial board and theyre due to put phil on some day theyre always putting him on boards  his mother looked a little distressed  rex i wish you wouldnt talk that way about the church  im sorry mother he said with quick penitence mr langmaids a vestryman you know and theyve only got him there because hes the best corporation lawyer in the city he isnt exactly what youd call orthodox he never goes  we are indebted to mr langmaid for mr hodder this was one of mr warings rare remarks  eleanor goodrich caught her husbands eye and smiled  i wonder why it is she said that we are so lukewarm about church in these days i dont mean you lucy or laureston she added to her sister mrs grey youre both exemplary lucy bowed ironically but most people of our ages with whom we associate martha preston for instance we were all brought up like the children of jonathan edwards do you remember that awful roundandround feeling on sunday afternoons sally and only the wabbly noahs ark elephant to play with right in this house instead of that there was a bump in the hall without and shrieks of laughter ill never forget the first time it occurred to mewhen i was reading darwinthat if the ark were as large as barnums circus and the natural history museum put together it couldnt have held a thousandth of the species on earth it was a blow  i dont know what were coming to exclaimed mrs waring gently  i didnt mean to be flippant mother said eleanor penitently but i do believe the christian religion has got to be presented in a different way and a more vital way to appeal to a new generation i am merely looking facts in the face  what is the christian religion asked sallys husband george bridges who held a chair of history in the local flourishing university ive been trying to find out all my life  you couldnt be expected to know george said his wife you were brought up an unitarian and went to harvard  never mind professor said phil goodrich in a quizzical affectionate tone take the floor and tell us what it isnt  george bridges smiled he was a striking contrast in type to his squarecut and vigorous brotherinlaw very thin with slightly protruding eyes the color of the faded blue glaze of ancient pottery and yet humorous  ive had my chance at any rate sally made me go last sunday and hear mr hodder  i cant see why you didnt like him george lucy cried i think hes splendid  oh i like him said mr bridges  thats just it exclaimed eleanor i like him i think hes sincere and that first sunday he came when i saw him get up in the pulpit and wave that long arm of his all i could think of was a modern savonarola he looks one and then when he began to preach it was maddening i felt all the time that he could say something helpful if he only would but he didnt it was all about the sufficiency of gracewhatever that may be he didnt explain it he didnt give me one notion as to how to cope a little better with the frightful complexities of the modern lives we live or how to stop quarrelling with phil when he stays at the office and is late for dinner  eleanor i think youre unjust to him said lucy amid the laughter of the men of the family most people in st johns think he is a remarkable preacher  so were many of the greek sophists george bridges observed  now if it were only dear old doctor gilman eleanor continued i could sink back into a comfortable indifference but every sunday this new man stirs me up not by what he says but by what he is i hoped wed get a rector with modern ideas who would be able to tell me what to teach my children little phil and harriet come back from sunday school with all sorts of questions and i feel like a hypocrite at any rate if mr hodder hasnt done anything else hes made me want to know  what do you mean by a man of modern ideas eleanor inquired mr bridges with evident relish  eleanor put down her coffee cup looked at him helplessly and smiled  somebody who will present christianity to me in such a manner that it will appeal to my reason and enable me to assimilate it into my life  good for you nell said her husband approvingly come now professor you sit up in the university club all sunday morning and discuss recondite philosophy with other learned agnostics tell us what is the matter with mr hodders theology that is if it will not shock grandmother too much  im afraid ive got used to being shocked phil said mrs waring with her quiet smile  its unfair mr bridges protested to ask a prejudiced pagan like me to pronounce judgment on an honest parson who is labouring according to his lights  go on george you shant get out of it that way  well said george the trouble is from the theological point of view that your parson is preaching what auguste sabatier would call a diminished and mitigated orthodoxy  great heavens cried phil whats that  its neither fish flesh nor fowl nor good red herring the professor declared if mr hodder were cornered he couldnt maintain that he as a priest has full power to forgive sins and yet he wont assert that he hasnt the mediaeval conception of the church before luthers day was consistent at any rate if you once grant the premises on which it was based  what premises  that the almighty had given it a charter like an insurance company of a monopoly of salvation on this portion of the universe and agreed to keep his hands off under this conception the sale of indulgences masses for the soul and temporal power are perfectly logicalinevitable kings and princes derive their governments from the church but if we once begin to doubt the validity of this charter as the reformers did the whole system flies to pieces like sticking a pin into a soap bubble  that is the reason whyto change the figurethe socalled protestant world has been gradually sliding down hill ever since the reformation the great majority of men are not willing to turn good to renounce the material and sensual rewards under their hands without some definite and concrete guaranty that if they do so they are going to be rewarded hereafter they demand some sort of infallibility and when we let go of the infallibility of the church we began to slide toward what looked like a bottomless pit and we clutched at the infallibility of the bible and now that has begun to roll  what i mean by a mitigated orthodoxy is this i am far from accusing mr hodder of insincerity but he preaches as if every word of the bible were literally true and had been dictated by god to the men who held the pen as if he as a priest held some supernatural power that could definitely be traced through what is known as the apostolic succession back to peter  do you mean to say george asked mrs waring with a note of pain in her voice that the apostolic succession cannot be historically proved  my dear mother said george i hope you will hold me innocent of beginning this discussion as a harmless professor of history in our renowned university of which we think so much that we do not send our sons to it i have been compelled by the children whom you have brought up to sit in judgment on the theology of your rector  they will leave us nothing she sighed  nothing perhaps that was invented by man to appeal to mans superstition and weakness of the remainderwho can say  what asked mrs waring do they say about the apostolic succession  mother is as bad as the rest of us said eleanor  isnt she grandfather  if i had a house to rent said mr bridges when the laughter had subsided i shouldnt advertise five bath rooms when there were only two or electricity when there was only gas i should be afraid my tenants might find it out and lose a certain amount of confidence in me but the orthodox churches are running just such a risk today and if any person who contemplates entering these churches doesnt examine the premises first he refrains at his own cost  the situation in the early christian church is now a matter of history and he who runs may read the first churches like those of corinth and ephesus and rome were democracies no such thing as a priestly line to carry on a hierarchy an ecclesiastical dynasty was dreamed of it may be gathered from the gospels that such an idea was so far from the mind of christ that his mission was to set at naught just such another hierarchy which then existed in israel the apostles were no more bishops than was john the baptist but preachers who travelled from place to place like paul the congregations at rome and elsewhere elected their own presbyteri episcopoi or overseers it is to say the least doubtful and it certainly cannot be proved historically that peter ever was in rome  the professor ought to have a pulpit of his own said phil  there was a silence and then evelyn who had been eating quantities of hothouse grapes spoke up  so far as i can see the dilemma in which our generation finds itself is thiswe want to know what there is in christianity that we can lay hold of we should like to believe but as george says all our education contradicts the doctrines that are most insisted upon we dont know where to turn we have the choice of going to people like george who know a great deal and dont believe anything or to clergymen like mr hodder who demand that we shall violate the reason in us which has been so carefully trained  upon my word i think youve put it rather well evelyn said eleanor admiringly  in spite of personalities added mr bridges  i dont see the use of fussing about it proclaimed laureston grey who was the richest and sprucest of the three sonsinlaw why cant we let well enough alone  because it isnt well enough evelyn replied i want the real thing or nothing i go to church once a month to please mother it doesnt do me any good and i dont see what good it does you and lucy to go every sunday you never think of it when youre out at dinners and dances during the week and besides she added with the arrogance of modern youth you and lucy are both intellectually lazy  i like that from you evelyn her sister flared up  you never read anything except the sporting columns and the annual rules of tennis and golf and polo  must everything be reduced to terms mrs waring gently lamented why cant we as laury suggests just continue to trust  they are the more fortunate perhaps who can mother george bridges answered with more of feeling in his voice than he was wont to show unhappily truth does not come that way if roger bacon and galileo and newton and darwin and harvey and the others had just trusted the worlds knowledge would still remain as stationary as it was during the thousandodd years the hierarchy of the church was supreme when theology was history philosophy and science rolled into one if god had not meant man to know something of his origin differing from the account in genesis he would not have given us darwin and his successors practically every great discovery since the revival we owe to men who by their very desire for truth were forced into opposition to the tremendous power of the church which always insisted that people should just trust and take the mixture of cosmogony and greek philosophy tradition and fable paganism judaic sacerdotalism and temporal power wrongly called spiritual dealt out by this same church as the last word on science philosophy history metaphysics and government  stop cried eleanor you make me dizzy  nearly all the pioneers to whom we owe our age of comparative enlightenment were heretics george persisted and if they could have been headed off or burned most of us would still be living in mud caves at the foot of the cliff on which stood the noblemans castle and kings would still be kings by divine decree scientistsif there were anyworkers in the black art and every phenomenon we failed to understand a miracle  i choose the united states of america ejaculated evelyn  i gather george said phil goodrich that you dont believe in miracles  miracles are becoming suspiciously fewer and fewer once an eclipse of the sun was enough to throw men on their knees because they thought it supernatural if they were logical theyd kneel today because it has been found natural only the inexplicable phenomena are miracles and after a whileif the theologians will only permit us to finish the jobthere wont be any inexplicable phenomena mystery as i believe william james puts it may be called the moretobeknown  in taking that attitude george arent you limiting the power of god said mrs waring  how does it limit the power of god mother her soninlaw asked to discover that he chooses to work by laws the most suicidal tendency in religious bodies today is their mediaeval insistence on what they are pleased to call the supernatural which is the more marvellousthat god can stop the earth and make the sun appear to stand still or that he can construct a universe of untold millions of suns with planets and satellites each moving in its orbit according to law a universe wherein every atom is true to a sovereign conception and yet this marvel of marvelsthat makes god in the twentieth century infinitely greater than in the sixteenthwould never have been discovered if the champions of theology had had their way  mrs waring smiled a little  you are too strong for me george she said but you mustnt expect an old woman to change  mother dear cried eleanor rising and laying her hand on mrs warings cheek we dont want you to change its ourselves we wish to change we wish for a religious faith like yours only the same teaching which gave it to you is powerless for us thats our trouble we have only to look at you she added a little wistfully to be sure there is somethingsomething vital in christianity if we could only get at it something that does not depend upon what we have been led to believe is indispensable george and men like him can only show the weakness in the old supports i dont mean that they arent doing the world a service in revealing errors but they cannot reconstruct  that is the clergymans business declared mr bridges but he must first acknowledge that the old supports are worthless  well said phil i like your rector in spite of his anthropomorphismperhaps as george would say because of it there is something manly about him that appeals to me  there cried eleanor triumphantly ive always said mr hodder had a spiritual personality you feelyou feel there is truth shut up inside of him which he cannot communicate ill tell you who impresses me in that way more strongly than any one elsemr bentley and he doesnt come to church any more  mr bentley said her mother is a saint your father tried to get him to dinner today but he had promised those working girls of his who live on the upper floors of his house to dine with them one of them told me so of course he will never speak of his kindnesses  mr bentley doesnt bother his head about theology said sally he just lives  theres eldon parr suggested george bridges mentioning the name of the citys famous financier im told he relieved mr bentley of his property some twentyfive years ago if mr hodder should begin to preach the modern heresy which you desire mr parr might object hes very orthodox im told  and mr parr remarked the modern evelyn sententiously pays the bills at st johns doesnt he father  i fear he pays a large proportion of them mr waring admitted in a serious tone  in these days said evelyn the man who pays the bills is entitled to have his religion as he likes it  no matter how he got the money to pay them added phil  that suggests another little hitch in the modern church which will have to be straightened out said george bridges  woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess  why george you of all people quoting the bible eleanor exclaimed  and quoting it aptly too said phil goodrich  im afraid if we began on the scribes and pharisees we shouldnt stop with mr parr asa wiring observed with a touch of sadness  in spite of all they say he has done i cant help feeling sorry for him said mrs waring he must be so lonely in that huge palace of his beside the park his wife dead and preston running wild around the world and alison no comfort the idea of a girl leaving her father as she did and going off to new york to become a landscape architect  but mother evelyn pleaded i cant see why a woman shouldnt lead her own life she only has one like a man and generally she doesnt get that  mrs waring rose  i dont know what were coming to i was taught that a womans place was with her husband and children or if she had none with her family i tried to teach you so my dear  well said evelyn im here yet i havent alisons excuse cheer up mother the worlds no worse than it was  i dont know about that answered mrs waring  listen ejaculated eleanor  mrs warings face brightened sounds of mad revelry came down from the floor above     chapter ii mr langmaids mission   i  looking back over an extraordinary career it is interesting to attempt to fix the time when a name becomes a talisman and passes current for power this is peculiarly difficult in the case of eldon parr like many notable men before him nobody but mr parr himself suspected his future greatness and he kept the secret but if we are to search what is now ancient history for a turningpoint perhaps we should find it in the sudden acquisition by him of the property of mr bentley  the transaction was a simple one those were the days when gentlemen as matters of courtesy put their names on other gentlemens notes and modern financiers while they might be sorry for mr bentley would probably be unanimous in the opinion that he was foolish to write on the back of thomas garretts mr parr was then as now a business man and could scarcely be expected to introduce philanthropy into finance such had been mr bentleys unfortunate practice and it had so happened a few years before for the accommodation of some young men of his acquaintance that he had invested rather generously in grantham mining stock at twentyfive cents a share and had promptly forgotten the transaction to cut a long story short in addition to mr bentleys house and other effects mr parr became the owner of the grantham stock which not long after went to one hundred dollars the reader may do the figuring  where was some talk at this time but many things had happened since for example mr parr had given away great sums in charity and it may likewise be added in his favour that mr bentley was glad to be rid of his fortune he had said so he deeded his pew back to st johns and protesting to his friends that he was not unhappy he disappeared from the sight of all save a few the rising waters of prosperity closed over him but eliza preston now mrs parr was one of those who were never to behold him againin this world at least  she was another conspicuous triumph in that career we are depicting gradual indeed had been the ascent from the sweeping out of a store to the marrying of a preston but none the less sure inevitable for many years after this event eldon parr lived modestly in what was known as a stonefront house in ransome street set well above the sidewalk with a long flight of yellow stone steps leading to it steps scrubbed with sapoho twice a week by a negro in rubber boots there was a stable with a tarred roof in the rear to be discerned beyond the conventional side lawn that was broken into by the bay window of the diningroom there in that house his two children were born there within those inartistic walls eliza preston lived a life that will remain a closed book forever what she thought what she dreamed if anything will never be revealed she did not at least have neurasthenia and for all the world knew she may have loved her exemplary and successful husband with whom her life was as regular as the strasburg clock she breakfasted at eight and dined at seven she heard her childrens lessons and read them bible stories and at half past ten every sunday morning rain or shine walked with them and her husband to the cars on tower street to attend service at st johns for mr parr had scruples in those days about using the carriage on the sabbath  she did not live alas to enjoy for long the medicean magnificence of the mansion facing the park to be a companion moon in the greater orbit eldon parts grief was real and the beautiful english window in the south transept of the church bears witness to it and yet it cannot be said that he sought solace in religion so apparently steeped in it had he always been it was destiny that he should take his place on the vestry destiny indeed that he should ultimately become the vestry as well as the first layman of the diocese unobtrusively as he had accomplished everything else in life in spite of prestons and warings atterburys goodriches and gores and he was wont to leave his weighty business affairs to shift for themselves while he attended the diocesan and general conventions of his church  he gave judiciously as becomes one who holds a fortune in trust yet generously always permitting others to help until st johns was a very gem of finished beauty and as the rothschilds and the fuggera made money for grateful kings and popes so in a democratic age eldon parr became the benefactor of an adulatory public the university the library the hospitals and the parks of his chosen city bear witness    ii  for forty years dr gilman had been the rector of st johns one sunday morning he preached his not unfamiliar sermon on the text for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face and when the next sunday dawned he was in his grave in winterbourne cemetery sincerely mourned within the parish and without in the nature of mortal things his death was to be expected no less real was the crisis to be faced at the vestry meeting that followed the problem was tersely set forth by eldon parr his frock coat tightly buttoned about his chest his glasses in his hand  gentlemen he said we have to fulfil a grave responsibility to the parish to the city and to god the matter of choosing a rector today when clergymen are meddling with all sorts of affairs which do not concern them is not so simple as it was twenty years ago we have at st johns always been orthodox and dignified and i take it to be the sense of this vestry that we remain so i conceive it our duty to find a man who is neither too old nor too young who will preach the faith as we received it who is not sensational and who does not mistake socialism for christianity  by force of habit undoubtedly mr parr glanced at nelson langmaid as he sat down innumerable had been the meetings of financial boards at which mr parr had glanced at langmaid who had never failed to respond he was that sine qua non of modern affairs a corporation lawyeralthough he resembled a big and genial professor of scandinavian extraction he wore round tortoiseshell spectacles he had a high domelike forehead and an ample light brown beard which he stroked from time to time it is probable that he did not believe in the immortality of the soul  his eyes twinkled as he rose  i dont pretend to be versed in theology gentlemen as you know he said and the entire vestry even mr parr smiled for vestries in spite of black coats and the gravity of demeanour which first citizens are apt to possess are human after all mr parr has stated i believe the requirements and i agree with him that it is not an easy order to fill you want a parson who will stick to his last who will not try experiments who is not too high or too low or too broad or too narrow who has intellect without too much initiative who can deliver a good sermon to those who can appreciate one and yet will not get the church uncomfortably full of strangers and run you out of your pews in short you want a levelheaded clergyman about thirtyfive years old who will mind his own business  the smiles on the faces of the vestry deepened the ability to put a matter thus humorously was a part of nelson langmaids power with men and juries  i venture to add another qualification he continued and that is virility we dont want a bandbox rector well i happen to have in mind a young man who errs somewhat on the other side and who looks a little like a cliff profile i once saw on lake george of george washington or an indian chief who stands about six feet two hes a bachelorif thats a drawback but i am not at all sure he can be induced to leave his present parish where he has been for ten years  i am announced wallis plimpton with his hands in his pockets provided the right man tackles him    iii  nelson langmaids most notable achievement before he accomplished the greater one of getting a new rector for st johns had been to construct the watertight box whereby the consolidated tractions company had become a lawproof possibility but his was an esoteric reputationthe greater fame had been eldon parrs mens minds had been dazzled by the breadth of the conception of scooping all the streetcar lines of the city long and short into one big basket as it were and when the stock had been listed in new york butcher and baker clerk and proprietor widow and maid brought out their hoardings the great project was discussed in clubs cafes and department stores and by citizens hanging on the straps of the very cars that were to be consolidatedgolden word very little appeared about nelson langmaid who was philosophically content but to mr parr who was known to dislike publicity were devoted pages in the sunday newspapers with photographs of the imposing front of his house in park street his altar and window in st johns the parr building and even of his private car antonia  later on another kind of publicity had come the wind had whistled for a time but it turned out to be only a squall the consolidated tractions company had made the voyage for which she had been constructed and thus had fulfilled her usefulness and the cleverest of the rats who had mistaken her for a permanent home scurried ashore before she was broken up  all of which is merely in the nature of a commentary on mr langmaids genius his reputation for judgmentwhich by some is deemed the highest of human qualitieswas impaired and a man who in his time had selected presidents of banks and trust companies could certainly be trusted to choose a parsonparticularly if the chief requirements were not of a spiritual nature  a week later he boarded an eastbound limited train armed with plenary powers  his destination was the hill town where he had spent the first fifteen years of his life amid the most striking of new england landscapes and the sight of the steep yet delicately pastoral slopes never failed to thrill him as the train toiled up the wide valley to bremerton the vision of these had remained with him during the years of his toil in the growing western city and embodied from the first homesick days an ideal to which he hoped sometime permanently to return but he never had his family had shown a perversity of taste in preferring the sea and he had perforce been content with a visit of a month or so every other summer accompanied usually by his daughter helen on such occasions he stayed with his sister mrs whitely  the whitely mills were significant of the new bremerton now neither village nor city but partaking of the characteristics of both french canadian might be heard on the main square as well as yankee and that revolutionary vehicle the automobile had inspired there a great brick edifice with a banner called the bremerton house enterprising italians had monopolized the corners with fruit stores and plate glass and asphalt were in evidence but the hills looked down unchanged and in the cool mapleshaded streets though dotted with modern residences were the same demure colonial houses he had known in boyhood  he was met at the station by his sister a large matronly woman who invariably set the world whizzing backward for langmaid so completely did she typify the contentment the point of view of an age gone by for life presented no more complicated problems to the middleaged mrs whitely than it had to alice langmaid  i know what youve come for nelson she said reproachfully when she greeted him at the station dr gilmans dead and you want our mr hodder i feel it in my bones well you cant get him hes had ever so many calls but he wont leave bremerton  she knew perfectly well however that nelson would get him although her brother characteristically did not at once acknowledge his mission alice whitely had vivid memories of a childhood when he had never failed to get what he wanted a trait of his of which although it had before now caused her much discomfort she was secretly inordinately proud she was therefore later in the day not greatly surprised to find herself supplying her brother with arguments much as they admired and loved mr hodder they had always realized that he could not remain buried in bremerton his talents demanded a wider field  talents exclaimed langmaid i didnt know he had any  oh nelson how can you say such a thing when you came to get him exclaimed his sister  i recommended him because i thought he had none langmaid declared  hell be a bishop some dayevery one says so said mrs whitely indignantly  that reassures me said her brother  i cant see why they sent youyou hardly ever go to church she cried i dont mind telling you nelson that the confidence men place in you is absurd  youve said that before he replied i agree with you im not going on my judgmentbut on yours and geralds because i know that you wouldnt put up with anything that wasnt strictly allwool orthodox  i think youre irreverent said his sister and its a shame that the canons permit such persons to sit on the vestry  gerald asked nelson langmaid of his brotherinlaw that night after his sister and the girls had gone to bed are you sure that this young mans orthodox  hes been here for over ten years ever since he left the seminary and hes never done or said anything radical yet replied the mill owner of bremerton if you dont want him wed be delighted to have him stay were not forcing him on you you know what the deuce has got into you youve talked to him for two hours and youve sat looking at him at the dinner table for another two i thought you were a judge of men  nelson langmaid sat silent  im only urging hodder to go for his own good mr whitely continued i can take you to dozens of people tomorrow morning who worship himpeople of all sorts the cashier in the bank men in the mills the hotel clerk my private stenographerhes built up that little church from nothing at all and you may write the bishop if you wish  how has he built up the church langmaid demanded  how how does any clergyman buildup a church  i dont know langmaid confessed it strikes me as quite a tour de force in these days does he manage to arouse enthusiasm for orthodox christianity  well said gerard whitely i think the service appeals weve made it as beautiful as possible and then mr hodder goes to see these people and sits up with them and they tell him their troubles hes reformed one or two rather bad cases i suppose its the mans personality  ah langmaid exclaimed now youre talking  i cant see what youre driving at confessed his brotherinlaw youre too deep for me nelson  if the truth be told langmaid himself did not quits see on behalf of the vestry he offered next day to mr hodder the rectorship of st johns and that offer was taken under consideration but there was in the lawyers mind no doubt of the acceptance which in the course of a fortnight after he had returned to the west followed  by no means a negligible element in nelson langmaids professional success had been his possession of what may called a sixth sense and more than once on his missions of trust he had listened to its admonitory promptings  at times he thought he recognized these in his conversation with the reverend john hodder at bremertonespecially in that last interview in the pleasant little study of the rectory overlooking bremerton lake but the promptings were faint and langmaid out of his medium he was not choosing the head of a trust company  he himself felt the pull of the young clergymans personality and instinctively strove to resist it and was more than ever struck by mr hodders resemblance to the cliff sculpture of which he had spoken at the vestry meeting  he was roughhewn indeed with graygreen eyes and hair the color of golden sand it would not stay brushed it was this hair that hinted most strongly of individualism that was by no means orthodox langmaid felt an incongruity but he was fascinated and he had discovered on the rectors shelves evidences of the taste for classical authors that he himself possessed thus fate played with him and the two men ranged from euripides to horace from horace to dante and gibbon and when hodder got up to fetch this or that edition he seemed to tower over the lawyer who was a big man himself  then they discussed business langmaid describing the parish the people the peculiar situation in st johns caused by dr gilmans death while hodder listened he was not talkative he made no promises his reserve on occasions was even a little disconcerting and it appealed to the lawyer from hodder as a man but somehow not as a clergyman nor did the rector volunteer any evidences of the soundness of his theological or political principles  he gave langmaid the impressionthough without apparent egotismthat by accepting the call he would be conferring a favour on st johns and this was when he spoke with real feeling of the ties that bound him to bremerton langmaid felt a certain deprecation of the fact that he was not a communicant  for the rest if mr hodder were disposed to take himself and his profession seriously he was by no means lacking in an appreciation of langmaids humour  the tempering of the lawyers elation as he returned homeward to report to mr parr and the vestry may be best expressed by his own exclamation which he made to himself  i wonder what that fellow would do if he ever got started a parson was after all a parson and he had done his best    iv  a high oozing note of the brakes and the heavy train came to a stop hodder looked out of the window of the sleeper to read the sign marcion against the yellow brick of the station set down in the prairie mud and flanked by a long row of duncolored freight cars backed up to a factory  the factory was flimsy somewhat resembling a vast greenhouse with its multitudinous windows and bore the name of a firm whose offices were in the city to which he was bound  we most in now sah the negro porter volunteered you kin see the smoke yondah  hodders mood found a figure in this portentous sign whereby the citys presence was betrayed to travellers from afarthe huge pall seemed an emblem of the weight of the citys sorrows or again a cloud of her own making which shut her in from the sight of heaven absorbed in the mad contest for life for money and pleasure and power she felt no need to lift her eyes beyond the level of her material endeavours  he john hodder was to live under that cloud to labour under it the mission on which he was bound like the prophets of old was somehow to gain the ears of this selfabsorbed population to strike the fear of the eternal into their souls to convince them that there was something above and beyond that smoke which they ignored to their own peril  yet the task at this nearer view took on proportions overwhelmingso dense was that curtain at which he gazed and today the very skies above it were leaden as though nature herself had turned atheist in spite of the vigour with which he was endowed in spite of the belief in his own soul doubts assailed him of his ability to cope with this problem of the modern ninevehat the very moment when he was about to realize his matured ambition of a great city parish  leaning back on the cushioned seat as the train started again he reviewed the years at bremerton his first and only parish hitherto to his surprise since he had been prepared for trials he had found the religious life a primrose path clouds had indeed rested on bremertons crests but beneficent clouds always scattered by the sun and there amid the dazzling snows he had on occasions walked with god  his success modest though it were had been too simple he had loved the people and they him and the pang of homesickness he now experienced was the intensest sorrow he had known since he had been among them yes bremerton had been for him he realized now that he had left it as near an approach to arcadia as this life permits and the very mountains by which it was encircled had seemed effectively to shut out those monster problems which had set the modern world outside to seething gerald whitelys thousand operatives had never struck the new york newspapers the magazines that discussed with vivid animus the corporationpolitical problems in other states had found bremerton interested but unmoved and mrs whitely who was a trustee of the library wasted her energy in deploring the recent volumes on economics sociology philosophy and religion that were placed on the shelves if bremerton read themand a portion of bremerton didno difference was apparent in the attendance at hodders church the womans club discussed them strenuously but made no attempt to put their doctrines into practice  hodder himself had but glanced at a few of them and to do him justice this abstention had not had its root in cowardice his life was fullhis religion worked and the conditions with which these books dealt simply did not exist for him the fact that there were other churches in the town less successful than his own one or two indeed virtually starving he had found it simple to account for in that their denominations had abandoned the true conception of the church and were logically degenerating into atrophy what better proof of the barrenness of these modern philosophical and religious books did he need than the spectacle of other ministerswho tarried awhile on starvation salariesreading them and preaching from them  he john hodder had held fast to the essential efficacy of the word of god as propounded in past ages by the fathers it is only fair to add that he did so without pride or bigotry and with a sense of thankfulness at the simplicity of the solution ancient in truth which apparently by special grace had been vouchsafed him and to it he attributed the flourishing condition in which he had left the church of the ascension at bremerton  well never get another rector like you alice whitely had exclaimed with tears in her eyes as she bade him goodby and he had rebuked her others had spoken in a similar strain and it is a certain tribute to his character to record that the underlying hint had been lost on hodder his efficacy he insisted lay in the word  hodder looked at his watch only to be reminded poignantly of the chief cause of his heaviness of spirit for it represented concretely the affections of those whom he had left behind brought before him vividly the purple haze of the bremerton valley and the garden party in the ample whitely grounds which was their tribute to him and he beheld moving from the sunlight to shadow the figure of rachel ogden she might have been with him now speeding by his side into the larger life  in his loneliness he seemed to be gazing into reproachful eyes nothing had passed between them it was he who had held back a fact that in the retrospect caused him some amazement for if wifehood were to be regarded as a profession rachel ogden had every qualification and mrs whitelys skilful suggestions had on occasions almost brought him to believe in the reality of the miragenever quite  orthodox though he were there had been times when his humour had borne him upward toward higher truths and he had once remarked that promising to love forever was like promising to become president of the united states  one might achieve it but it was independent of the will hodders idealsif he had only knowntranscended the rubric his feeling for rachel ogden had not been lacking in tenderness and yet he had recoiled from marriage merely for the sake of getting a wife albeit one with easy qualification he shrank instinctively from the humdrum and sought the heights stormy though these might prove as yet he had not analyzed this craving  this he did knowfor he had long ago torn from his demon the draperies of disguisethat women were his great temptation ordination had not destroyed it and even during those peaceful years at bremerton he had been forced to maintain a watchful guard he had a power over women and they over him that threatened to lead him constantly into wayside paths and often he wondered what those who listened to him from the pulpit would think if they guessed that at times he struggled with suggestion even now yet with his hatred of compromises he had scorned marriage  the yoke of augustine the caldron of unholy loves even now as he sat in the train his mind took its own flight backward into that remoter past that was still a part of him to secret acts of his college days the thought of which made him shudder yes and to riots and revels in youth his had been one of those boiling contagious spirits that carry with them irresistibly tamer companions he had been a leader in intermittent raids into forbidden spheres a leader also in certain more decorous pursuitsif athletics may be so accounted yet he had capable of long periods of selfcontrol for a cause through it all a spark had miraculously been kept alive  popularity followed him from the small new england college to the harvard law school he had been soberer there marked as a pleader and at last the day arrived when he was summoned by a great new york lawyer to discuss his future sunday intervened obeying a wayward impulse he had gone to one of the metropolitan churches to hear a preacher renowned for his influence over men there is indeed much that is stirring to the imagination in the spectacle of a mass of human beings thronging into a great church pouring up the aisles crowding the galleries joining with full voices in the hymns what drew them he himself was singing words familiar since childhood and suddenly they were fraught with a startling meaning            fill me radiancy divine           scatter all my unbelief  visions of the crusades rose before him of a friar arousing france of a maid of orleans of masses of soiled warworn sinworn humanity groping towards the light even after all these ages the belief the hope would not down  outside a dismal february rain was falling a rain to wet the soul the reek of damp clothes pervaded the gallery where he sat surrounded by clerks and shop girls and he pictured to himself the dreary rooms from which they had emerged drawn by the mysterious fire on that altar was it a willothewisp below him in the pews were the rich did they too need warmth  then came the sermon i will arise and go to my father  after the service far into the afternoon he had walked the wet streets heedless of his direction in an exaltation that he had felt before but never with such intensity it seemed as though he had always wished to preach and marvelled that the perception had not come to him sooner if the man to whom he had listened could pour the light into the dark corners of other mens souls he john hodder felt the same hot spark within himdespite the dark corners of his own  at dusk he came to himself hungry tired and wet in what proved to be the outskirts of harlem he could see the place now the lonely wooden houses the ramshackle saloon the ugly yellow gleam from the street lamps in a line along the glistening pavement beside him a towering hill of granite with a real estate sign this lot for sale and he had stood staring at it thinking of the rock that would have to be cut away before a man could build thereand so read his own parable  how much rock would have to be cut away how much patient chipping before the edifice of which he had been dreaming could be reared could he ever do it once removed he would be building on rock but could he remove it to help revive a faith a dying faith in a material agethat indeed were a mission for any man he found his way to an elevated train and as it swept along stared unseeing at the people who pushed and jostled him still under the spell he reached his room and wrote to the lawyer thanking him but saying that he had reconsidered coming to new york it was not until he had posted the letter and was on his way back to cambridge that he fully realized he had made the decision of his life  misgivings many of them had come in the months that followed misgivings and struggles mocking queries would it last there was the incredulity and amazement of nearest friends who tried to dissuade him from so extraordinary a proceeding nobody they said ever became a parson in these days nobody at least with his ability he was throwing himself away ethics had taken the place of religion intelligent men didnt go to church and within him went on an endless debate public opinion made some allowance for frailties in other professions in the ministry none he would be committing himself to be good the rest of his life and that seemed too vast an undertaking for any human  the chief horror that haunted him was not failurefor oddly enough he never seriously distrusted his power it was disaster would god give him the strength to fight his demon if he were to gain the heights only to stumble in the sight of all men to stumble and fall  seeming echoes of the hideous mockery of it rang in his ears where is the god that this man proclaimed he saw the newspaper headlines listened in imagination to cynical comments beheld his name trailed through the soiled places of the cities the shuttlecock of men and women to him that overcometh to him will i give of the hidden manna and i will give him a white stone and upon the stone a new name written which no one knoweth but he that receiveth it might he ever win that new name eat of the hidden manna of a hidden power become the possessor of the morning star  unless there be in the background a mother no portrait of a man is complete she explains him is his complement through good mothers are men conceived of god and with god they sit forever yearning forever reaching out helpless except for him with him they have put a man into the world thus into the supreme canvas came the virgin  john hodders mother was a widow and to her in the white gabled house which had sheltered stern ancestors he travelled in the june following his experience standing under the fanlight of the elmshaded doorway she seemed a vision of the peace wherein are mingled joy and sorrow faith and tears a tall quiet woman who had learned the lesson of mothershow to wait and how to pray how to be silent with a clamouring heart  she had lived to see him established at bremerton to be with him there awhile  he awoke from these memories to gaze down through the crisscross of a trestle to the twisted turbid waters of the river far below beyond was the city the train skirted for a while the hideous sootstained warehouses that faced the water plunged into a lane between humming factories and clothesdraped tenements and at last glided into semidarkness under the high reverberating roof of the union station     chapter iii the primrose path   i  nelson langmaids extraordinary judgment appeared once more to be vindicated  there had been indeed a critical anxious moment emphasized by the agitation of bright feminine plumes and the shifting of masculine backs into the corners of the pews none got so far as to define to themselves why there should be an apparent incompatibility between ruggedness and orthodoxybut there were some who hoped and more who feared luther had been orthodox once savonarola also in appearance neither was more canonical than the new rector  his congregation for the most part were not analytical but they felt a certain anomaly in virility proclaiming tradition it took them several sundays to get accustomed to it  to those who had been used for more than a quarter of a century to seeing old dr gilmans gentle face under the familiar and faded dove of the soundingboard to the deliberation of his walk and the hesitation of his manner the first impression of the reverend john hodder was somewhat startling they felt that there should be a leisurely element in religion he moved across the chancel with incredible swiftness his white surplice flowing like the draperies of a moving victory wasted no time with the pulpit lights announced his text in a strong and penetrating but by no means unpleasing voice and began to speak with the certainty of authority  here in an age when a new rector had ceased to be an allabsorbing topic in social life was a new and somewhat exhilarating experience and it may be privately confessed that there were some who sat in st johns during those first weeks of his incumbency who would indignantly have repudiated the accusation that they were not good churchmen and churchwomen and who nevertheless had queer sensations in listening to ancient doctrines set forth with emersonian conviction some were courageous enough to ask themselves in the light of this forceful presentation whether they really did believe them as firmly as they supposed they had  dear old dr gilman had been mildermuch milder as the years gained upon him and latterly when he had preached his voice had sounded like the unavailing protest of one left far behind who called out faintly with unheeded warnings they had loved him but the modern world was a busy world and dr gilman did not understand it this man was different here was what the church taught he said and they might slight it at their peril  it is one thing to believe ones self orthodox and quite another to have that orthodoxy so definitely defined as to be compelled whether or no to look it squarely in the face and own or disown it some indeed like gordon atterbury stood the test responded to the clarion call for which they had been longing but little everett constable who also sat on the vestry was a trifle uncomfortable in being reminded that absence from the communion table was perilous although he would have been the last to deny the efficacy of the sacrament  the new rector was plainly not a man who might be accused of policy in pandering to the tastes of a wealthy and conservative flock but if in the series of sermons which lasted from his advent until well after christmas he had deliberately consulted their prejudices he could not have done better it is true that he went beyond the majority of them but into a region which they regarded as preeminently safea region the soil of which was traditional to wit st paul had left to the world a consistent theology historical research was ignored rather than condemned and it might reasonably have been gathered from these discourses that the main proofs of christs divinity lay in his virgin birth his miracles and in the fact that his body had risen from the grave had been seen by many and even touched hence unbelief had no excuse by divine commission there were bishops priests and deacons in the new hierarchy and it was through the apostolic succession that he their rector derived his sacerdotal powers there were no doubt many obscure passages in the scripture but mens minds were finite a catholic acceptance was imperative and the evils of the present daya sufficiently sweeping statementwere wholly due to deplorable lapses from such acceptance the apostolic teaching must be preserved since it transcended all modern wanderings after truth hell though not definitely defined in terms of flames was no less a state of torture future by implication of which fire was but a faint symbol and he gave them clearly to understand that an unbaptized person ran no inconsiderable risk he did not declare unqualifiedly that the church alone had the power to save but such was the inference    ii  it was entirely fitting no doubt when the felicitations of certain of the older parishioners on his initial sermon were over that mr hodder should be carried westward to lunch with the first layman of the diocese but mr parr as became a person of his responsibility had been more moderate in his comment for he had seen in his day many men whose promise had been unfulfilled tightly buttoned silk hatted upright he sat in the corner of his limousine the tasselled speakingtube in his hand from time to time cautioning his chauffeur  carefully he cried ive told you not to drive so fast in this part of town ive never got used to automobiles he remarked to hodder and i formerly went to church in the streetcars but the distances have grown so greatand i have occasionally been annoyed in them  hodder was not given to trite acquiescence his homely composure belied the alertness of his faculties he was striving to adapt himself to the sudden broadening and quickening of the stream of his life and he felt a certain excitementalthough he did not betray itin the presence of the financier much as he resented the thought it was impossible for him not to realize that the mans pleasure and displeasure were important for since his arrival he had had delicate reminders of this from many sources recurrently it had caused him a vague uneasiness hinted at a problem new to him he was jealous of the dignity of the church and he seemed already to have detected in mr parrs manner a subtle note of patronage nor could hodders years of provincialism permit him to forget that this man with whom he was about to enter into personal relations was a capitalist of national importance  the neighbourhood they traversed was characteristic of our rapidly expanding american cities there were rows of dwelling houses once ultrarespectable now slatternly and lawns gone grey some of these houses had been remodelled into thirdrate shops or thrown together to make manufacturing establishments saloons occupied all the favourable corners flaming posters on vacant lots announced pictorially dubious attractions at the theatres it was a wonderful indian summer day the sunlight soft and melting and the smoke which continually harassed this district had lifted a little as though in deference to the sabbath  hodder read the sign on a lamp post dalton street the name clung in his memory  we thought some twenty years ago of moving the church westward said mr parr but finally agreed to remain where we were  the rector had a conviction on this point and did not hesitate to state it without waiting to be enlightened as to the bankers views  it would seem to me a wise decision he said looking out of the window and wholly absorbed in the contemplation of the evidences of misery and vice with this poverty at the very doors of the church  something in his voice impelled eldon parr to shoot a glance at his profile  poverty is inevitable mr hodder he declared the weak always sink  hodders reply whatever it might have been was prevented by the sudden and unceremonious flight of both occupants toward the ceiling of the limousine caused by a deep pit in the asphalt  what are you doing gratton mr parr called sharply through the tube  presently the lawns began to grow brighter the houses more cheerful and the shops were left behind they crossed the third great transverse artery of the city not so long ago mr parr remarked a quagmire now lined by hotels and stores with alluring displays in plate glass windows and entered a wide boulevard that stretched westward straight to the great park this boulevard the financier recalled as a country road of clay it was bordered by a vivid strip of green a row of tall and graceful lamp posts like sentinels marked its course while the dwellings set far back on either side were for the most part large and pretentious betraying in their many tentative styles of architecture the reaching out of a commercial nation after beauty some indeed were simple of line and restful to the trained eye  they came to the wide entrance of the park so wisely preserved as a breathing place for future generations a slight haze had gathered over the rolling forests to the westward but this haze was not smoke here in this enchanting region the autumn sunlight was undiluted gold the lawns emerald and the red gravel around the statesmans statue glistening the automobile quickly swung into a street that skirted the parkif street it might be called for it was more like a generous private drivewayflanked on the right by fences of ornamental ironwork and high shrubbery that concealed the fore yards of dominating private residences which might without great exaggeration have been called palaces  thats fergusons house volunteered mr parr indicating a marble edifice with countless windows hes one of your vestrymen you know fergusons department store the bankers eyes twinkled a little for the first time youll probably find it convenient most people do clever business man ferguson  but the rector was finding difficulty in tabulating his impressions  they turned in between two posts of a gateway toward a huge house of rough granite and hodder wondered whether in the swift onward roll of things the time would come when this too would have been deemed ephemeral with its massive walls and heavy redtiled roof that sloped steeply to many points it seemed firmly planted for ages to come it was surrounded yet not hemmed in by trees of a considerable age his host explained that these had belonged to the original farm of which all this park street property had made a part  they alighted under a portecochere with a glass roof  im sorry said mr parr as the doors swung open and he led the way into the house im sorry i cant give you a more cheerful welcome but my son and daughter for their own reasons see fit to live elsewhere  hodders quick ear detected in the tone another cadence and he glanced at eldon parr with a new interest  presently they stood face to face across a table reduced to its smallest proportions in the tempered light of a vast diningroom an apartment that seemed to symbolize the fortresslike properties of wealth the odd thought struck the clergyman that this man had made his own tower of london had built with his own hands the prison in which he was to end his days the carved oaken ceiling lofty though it was had the effect of pressing downward the heavy furniture matched the heavy walls and even the silent quickmoving servants had a watchful air  mr parr bowed his head while hodder asked grace they sat down  the constraint which had characterized their conversation continued yet there was a subtle change in the attitude of the clergyman the financier felt this though it could not be said that hodder appeared more at his ease his previous silences had been by no means awkward eldon parr liked selfcontained men but his perceptions were as keen as nelson langmaids and like langmaid he had gradually become conscious of a certain baffling personality in the new rector of st johns from time to time he was aware of the greygreen eyes curiously fixed on him and at a loss to account for their expression he had no thought of reading in it an element of pity yet pity was nevertheless in the rectors heart and its advent was emancipating him from the limitations of provincial inexperience  suddenly the financier launched forth on a series of shrewd and searching questions about bremerton its church its people its industries and social conditions all of which hodder answered to his apparent satisfaction  coffee was brought hodder pushed back his chair crossed his knees and sat perfectly still regarding his host his body suggesting a repose that did not interfere with his perceptive faculties  you dont smoke mr hodder  the rector smiled and shook his head mr parr selected a diminutive yellow cigar and held it up  this he said has been the extent of my indulgence for twenty years they are made for me in cuba  hodder smiled again but said nothing  i have had a letter from your former bishop speaking of you in the highest terms he observed  the bishop is very kind  mr parr cleared his throat  i am considerably older than you he went on and i have the future of st johns very much at heart mr hodder i trust you will remember this and make allowances for it as i talk to you  i need not remind you that you have a grave responsibility on your shoulders for so young a man and that st johns is the oldest parish in the diocese  i think i realize it mr parr said hodder gravely it was only the opportunity of a larger work here that induced me to leave bremerton  exactly agreed the banker the parish i believe is in good running orderi do not think you will see the necessity for manyahemchanges but we sadly needed an executive head and if i may say so mr hodder you strike me as a man of that type who might have made a success in a business career  the rector smiled again  i am sure you could pay me no higher compliment he answered  for an instant eldon parr as he stared at the clergyman tightened his lipslips that seemed peculiarly formed for compression then they relaxed into what resembled a smile if it were one the other returned it  seriously mr parr declared it does me good in these days to hear from a young man such sound doctrine as you preach i am not one of those who believe in making concessions to agnostics and atheists you were entirely right in my opinion when you said that we who belong to the churchand of course you meant all orthodox christiansshould stand by our faith as delivered by the saints of course he added smiling i should not insist upon the sublapsarian view of election which i was taught in the presbyterian church as a boy  hodder laughed but did not interrupt  on the other hand mr parr continued i have little patience with clergymen who would make religion attractive what does it amount toluring people into the churches on one pretext or another sugarcoating the pill salvation is a more serious matter let the churches stick to their own we have at st johns a godfearing conservative congregation which does not believe in taking liberties with sound and established doctrine and i may confess to you mr hodder that we were naturally not a little anxious about dr gilmans successor that we should not get in spite of every precaution a man tinged with the new and dangerous ideas so prevalent i regret to say among the clergy i need scarcely add that our anxieties have been set at rest  that said hodder must be taken as a compliment to the dean of the theological seminary from which i graduated  the financier stared again but he decided that mr hodder had not meant to imply that he mr parr was attempting to supersede the dean the answer had been modest  i take it for granted that you and i and all sensible men are happily agreed that the church should remain where she is let the people come to her she should be if i may so express it the sheet anchor of society our bulwark against socialism in spite of socialists who call themselves ministers of god the church has lost groundwhy because she has given ground the sanctity of private property is being menaced demagogues are crying out from the housetops and inciting people against the men who have made this country what it is who have risked their fortunes and their careers for the present prosperity we have no longer any right it seems to employ whom we will in our factories and our railroads we are not allowed to regulate our rates although the risks were all ours even the women are meddlingthey are not satisfied to stay in the homes where they belong you agree with me  as to the women said the rector i have to acknowledge that i have never had any experience with the militant type of which you speak  i pray god you may never have exclaimed mr parr with more feeling than he had yet shown  womans suffrage and what is called feminism in general have never penetrated to bremerton indeed i must confess to have been wholly out of touch with the problems to which you refer although of course i have been aware of their existence  you will meet them here said the banker significantly  yes the rector replied thoughtfully i can see that i know that the problems here will be more complicated more modernmore difficult and i thoroughly agree with you that their ultimate solution is dependent on christianity if i did not believein spite of the evident fact which you point out of the churchs lost ground that her future will be greater than her past i should not be a clergyman  the quiet but firm note of faith was not lost on the financier and yet was not he quite sure what was to be made of it he had a faint and fleeting sense of disquiet which registered and was gone  i hope so he said vaguely referring perhaps to the resuscitation of which the rector spoke he drummed on the table ill go so far as to say that i too think that the structure can be repaired and i believe it is the duty of the men of influenceall men of influenceto assist i dont say that men of influence are not factors in the church today but i do say that they are not using the intelligence in this task which they bring to bear for instance on their business  perhaps the clergy might help hodder suggested and added more seriously i think that many of them are honestly trying to do so  no doubt of it why is it mr parr continued reflectively that ministers as a whole are by no means the men they were you will pardon my frankness when i was a boy the minister was looked up to as an intellectual and moral force to be reckoned with i have heard it assigned as one reason that in the last thirty years other careers have opened up careers that have proved much more attractive to young men of ability  business careers inquired the rector  precisely  in other words said hodder with his curious smile the ministry gets the men who cant succeed at anything else  well thats putting it rather strong answered mr parr actually reddening a little but come now most young men would rather be a railroad president than a bishopwouldnt they  most young men would agreed hodder quickly but they are not the young men who ought to be bishops youll admit that  the financier be it recorded to his credit did not lack appreciation of this thrust and for the first time he laughed with something resembling heartiness this laughter in which hodder joined seemed suddenly to put them on a new footinga little surprising to both  come said the financier rising im sure you like pictures and langmaid tells me you have a fancy for first editions would you care to go to the gallery  by all means the rector assented  their footsteps as they crossed the hardwood floors echoed in the empty house after pausing to contemplate a millet on the stair landing they came at last to the huge silent gallery where the soft but adequate light fell upon many masterpieces ancient and modern and it was here while gazing at the corots and bonheurs lawrences romneys copleys and halses that hodders sense of their owners isolation grew almost overpowering once glancing over his shoulder at mr parr he surprised in his eyes an expression almost of pain  these pictures must give you great pleasure he said  oh replied the banker in a queer voice im always glad when any one appreciates them i never come in here alone  hodder did not reply they passed along to an upstairs sittingroom which must hodder thought be directly over the diningroom between its windows was a case containing priceless curios  my wife liked this room mr parr explained as he opened the case when they had inspected it the rector stood for a moment gazing out at a formal garden at the back of the house the stalks of late flowers lay withering but here and there the leaves were still vivid and clusters of crimson berries gleamed in the autumn sunshine a pergola ran down the middle and through denuded grapevines he caught a glimpse at the far end of sculptured figures and curving marble benches surrounding a pool  what a wonderful spot he exclaimed  my daughter alison designed it  she must have great talent said the rector  shes gone to new york and become a landscape architect said his host with a perceptible dryness women in these days are apt to be everything except what the lord intended them to be  they went downstairs and hodder took his leave although he felt an odd reluctance to go mr parr rang the bell  ill send you down in the motor he said  id like the exercise of walking said the rector i begin to miss it already in the city  you look as if you had taken a great deal of it mr parr declared following him to the door i hope youll drop in often even if im not here the gallery and the library are at your disposal  their eyes met  youre very good hodder replied and went down the steps and through the open doorway  lost in reflection he walked eastward with long and rapid strides striving to reduce to order in his mind the impressions the visit had given him only to find them too complex too complicated by unlookedfor emotions before its occurrence he had in spite of an inherent common sense felt a little uneasiness over the prospective meeting with the financier and nelson langmaid had hinted goodnaturedly that it was his hodders business to get on good terms with mr parrotherwise the rectorship of st johns might not prove abed of roses although the lawyer had spoken with delicacy he had once more misjudged his manthe result being to put hodder on his guard he had been the more determined not to cater to the banker  the outcome of it all had been that the rector left him with a sense of having crossed barriers forbidden to other men and not understanding how he had crossed them whether this incipient intimacy were ominous or propitious whether there were involved in it a germ engendered by a radical difference of temperament capable of developing into future conflict he could not now decide if eldon parr were procrustes he hodder had fitted the bed and to say the least this was extraordinary if not a little disquieting now and again his thoughts reverted to the garden and to the woman who had made it why had she deserted  at length after he had been walking for nearly an hour he halted and looked about him he was within a few blocks of the church a little to one side of tower street the main east and west highway of the city in the midst of that district in which mr parr had made the remark that poverty was inevitable slovenly and depressing at noonday it seemed now frankly to have flung off its mask dusk was gathering and with it a smokestained fog that lent a sickly tinge to the lights women slunk by him the saloons apparently closed and many houses with veiled windows betrayed secret and sinister gleams in the midst of a block rose a tall pretentious though cheaply constructed building with the words hotel albert in flaming electric letters above an archway once more his eye read dalton street on a lamp  hodder resumed his walk more slowly and in a few minutes reached his rooms in the parish house     chapter iv some riddles of the twentieth century   i although he found the complications of a modern city parish somewhat bewildering the new rector entered into his duties that winter with apostolic zeal he was aware of limitations and anomalies but his faith was boundless his energy the subject of goodnatured comment by his vestry and parishioners whose pressing invitations to dinners he was often compelled to refuse there was in john hodder something indefinable that inflamed curiosity and left it unsatisfied  his excuse for attending these dinners which indeed were relaxing and enjoyable he found in the obvious duty of getting to know the most important members of his congregation but invariably he came away from them with an inner sense of having been baffled in this object with a few exceptions these modern people seemed to have no time for friendship in the real meaning of the word no desire to carry a relationship beyond a certain point although he was their spiritual pastor he knew less about most of them at the end of the winter than their butlers and their maids  they were kind they were delightful they were interested in himhe occasionally thoughtas a somewhat anachronistic phenomenon they petted respected him and deferred to him he represented to them an element in life they recognized and which had its proper niche what they failed to acknowledge was his point of viewand this he was wise enough not to press at dinner tables and in drawingroomsthat religion should have the penetrability of ether that it should be the absorbent of life he did not have to commit the banality of reminding them of this conviction of his at their own tables he had sufficient humour and penetration to credit them with knowing it nay he went farther in his unsuspected analysis and perceived that these beliefs made one of his chief attractions for them it was pleasant to have authority in a black coat at ones board to defer if not to bend to it the traditions of fashion demanded a clergyman in the milieu and the more tenaciously he clung to his prerogatives the better they liked it  although they were conscious of a certain pressure which they gently resisted they did not divine that the radiating and rugged young man cherished serious designs upon them he did not expect to transform the world in a day especially the modern world he was biding his time awaiting individual opportunities  they talked to him of the parish work congratulated him on the vigour with which he had attacked it and often declared themselves jealous of it because it claimed too much of him dear dr gilman they said had had neither the strength nor the perception of modern needs and mccrae the first assistant clergyman while a good man was a plodder and lacking in imagination they talked sympathetically about the problems of the poor and some of themparticularly mrs wallis plimpton were inclined to think hodders replies a trifle noncommittal the trouble although he did not tell them so was that he himself had by no means solved the problem and he felt a certain reluctance to discuss the riddle of poverty over champagne and porcelain  mrs plimpton and mrs constable mrs ferguson mrs langmaid mrs larrabbee mrs atterbury mrs grey and many other ladies and their daughters were honorary members of his guilds and societies and found time in their busy lives to decorate the church adorn the altar care for the vestments and visit the parish house some of them did more mrs larrabbee for instance when she was in town often graced the girls classes with her presence which was a little disquieting to the daughters of immigrants a little disquieting too to john hodder during the three years that had elapsed since mr larrabbees death she had with characteristic grace and ease taken up philanthropy become in particular the feminine patron saint of galt house nonsectarian a rescue home for the erring of her sex  there were too in this higher realm of wealth in and out of which hodder plunged women like mrs constable much older than mrs larrabbee with whom philanthropy and what is known as church work had become second nature in a wellordered life and who attended with praiseworthy regularity the meetings of charitable boards and committees not infrequently taking an interest in individuals in mr hodders classes with her on occasions he did discuss such matters only to come away from her with his bewilderment deepened  it was only natural that he should have his moods of depression but the recurrent flow of his energy swept them away cynicism had no place in his militant christianity and yet there were times when he wondered whether these good people really wished achievements from their rector they had the air of saying bravo and then of turning away and he did not conceal from himself that he was really doing nothing but labour the distances were great and between his dinner parties classes services and visits he was forced to sit far into the night preparing his sermons when his brain was not so keen as it might have been indeedand this thought was cynical and out of characterhe asked himself on one occasion whether his principal achievement so far had not consisted in getting on unusual terms with eldon parr they were not lacking who thought so and who did not hesitate to imply it they evidently regarded his growing intimacy with the banker with approval as in some sort a supreme qualification for a rector of st johns and a proof of unusual abilities there could be no question for instance that he had advanced perceptibly in the estimation of the wife of another of his vestrymen mrs wallis plimpton  the daughter of thurston gore with all her astuteness and real estate was of a naivete in regard to spiritual matters that hodder had grown to recognize as impermeable in an evening gown with a string of large pearls testing on her firm and glowing neck she appeared a concrete refutation of the notion of rebirth the triumph of an unconscious philosophy of material commonsense however in parish house affairs hodder had found her practical brain of no slight assistance  i think it quite wonderful she remarked on the occasion at which he was the guest of honour in what was still called the new gore mansion that you have come to know mr parr so well in such a short time how did you do it mr hodder of course wallis knows him and sees a great deal of him in business matters he relies on wallis but they tell me you have grown more intimate with him than any one has been since alison left him  there is in proverbs or ecclesiastes a formula for answering people in accordance with their point of view the rector modestly disclaimed intimacy and he curbed his curiosity about alison for the reason that he preferred to hear her story from another source  oh but you are intimate mrs plimpton protested everybody says sothat mr parr sends for you all the time what is he like when hes alone and relaxed is he ever relaxed the lady had a habit of not waiting for answers to her questions do you know it stirs my imagination tremendously when i think of all the power that man has i suppose you know he has become one of a very small group of men who control this country and naturally he has been cruelly maligned all he has to do is to say a word to his secretary and he can make men or ruin them it isnt that he does ruin themi dont mean that he uses his wealth wallis says to maintain the prosperity of the nation he feels his trusteeship and he is so generous he has given a great deal to the church and now she added i am sure he will give more  hodder was appalled he felt helpless before the weight of this onslaught  i dare say he will continue to assist as he has in the past he managed to say  of course its your disinterestedness she proclaimed examining him frankly he feels that you dont want anything you always strike me as so splendidly impartial mr hodder  fortunately he was spared an answer mr plimpton who was wont to apply his gifts as a toastmaster to his own festivals hailed him from the other end of the table  and nelson langmaid who had fallen into the habit of dropping into hodders rooms in the parish house on his way uptown for a chat about books had been struck by the rectors friendship with the banker  i dont understand how you managed it hodder in such a short time he declared mr parrs a difficult man in all these years ive been closer to him than any one else and i dont know him today half as well as you do  i didnt manage it said hodder briefly  well replied the lawyer quizzically you neednt eat me up im sure you didnt do it on purpose if you hadto use a hibernian phraseyou never would have done it ive seen it tried before to tell you the truth after id come back from bremerton that was the one thing i was afraid ofthat you mightnt get along with him  hodder himself was at a loss to account for the relationship it troubled him vaguely for mr parr was the aggressor and often at dusk when hodder was working under his study lamp the telephone would ring and on taking down the receiver he would hear the bankers voice im alone tonight mr hodder will you come and have dinner with me  had he known it this was a different method of communication than that which the financier usually employed one which should have flattered him if wallis plimpton for instance had received such a personal message the fact would not have remained unknown the next day at his club sometimes it was impossible for hodder to go and he said so but he always went when he could  the unwonted note of appeal which the telephone seemed somehow to enhance in mr parrs voice never failed to find a response in the rectors heart and he would ponder over it as he walked across to tower street to take the electric car for the sixmile trip westward  this note of appeal he inevitably contrasted with the dry matteroffact reserve of his greeting at the great house which loomed all the greater in the darkness unsatisfactory from many points of view as these evenings were they served to keep whetted hodders curiosity as to the life of this extraordinary man all of its vaster significance for the world its tremendous machinery was out of his sight  mr parr seemed indeed to regard the rest of his fellowcreatures with the suspicion at which langmaid had hinted to look askance at the amenities people tentatively held out to him and the private watchman whom hodder sometimes met in the darkness and who invariably scrutinized pedestrians on park street seemed symbolic of this attitude on rare occasions when in town the financier dined out limiting himself to a few houses  once in a long while he attended what are known as banquets such as those given by the chamber of commerce though he generally refused to speak hodder through mr parrs intervention had gone to one of these ably and breezily presided over by the versatile mr plimpton  hodder felt not only curiosity and sympathy but a vexing sense of the fruitlessness of his visits to park street mr parr seemed to like to have him there and the very fact that the conversation rarely took any vital turn oddly contributed to the increasing permanence of the lien to venture on any topic relating to the affairs of the day were merely to summon forth the bankers dogmatism and hodders own opinions on such matters were now in a strange and unsettled state mr parr liked best to talk of his treasures and of the circumstances during his trips abroad that had led to their acquirement once the banker had asked him about parish house matters  im told youre working very hardstirring up mccrae he needs it  im only trying to study the situation hodder replied i dont think you quite do justice to mccrae he added hes very faithful and seems to understand those people thoroughly  mr parr smiled  and what conclusions have you come to if you think the system should be enlarged and reorganized i am willing at any time to go over it with you with a view to making an additional contribution personally while i have sympathy for the unfortunate im not at all sure that much of the energy and money put into the institutional work of churches isnt wasted  i havent come to any conclusionsyet said the rector with a touch of sadness perhaps i demand too muchexpect too much  the financier deep in his leather chair under the shaded light the tips of his fingers pressed together regarded the younger man thoughtfully but the smile lingered in his eyes  i told you you would meet problems he said    ii  hodders cosmos might have been compared indeed to that set forth in the ptolemaic theory of the ancients like a cleverly carved chinese object of ivory in the bankers collection it was a system of spheres touching concentric yet separate in an outer space swung mr parr then came the scarcely less rarefied atmosphere of the constables and atterburys fergusons plimptons langmaids prestons larrabbees greys and gores and then a smaller sphere which claims but a passing mention there were in the congregation of st johns a few people of moderate means whose houses or apartments the rector visited people to whom modern life was increasingly perplexing  in these ranks were certain maiden ladies and widows who found in church work an outlet to an otherwise circumscribed existence hodder met them continually in his daily rounds there were people like the bradleys who rented half a pew and never missed a sunday mr bradley an elderly man whose children had scattered was an upper clerk in one of mr parrs trust companies there were bachelors and young women married or single who taught in the sunday school or helped with the night classes for the most part all of these mentioned above belonged to an element that once had had a comfortable and wellrecognized place in the community yet had somehow been displaced many of them were connected by blood with more fortunate parishioners but economic pressure had scattered them throughout new neighbourhoods and suburbs tradition still bound them to st johns  with no fixed orbit the rector cut at random through all of these strata and into a fourth not very far into it for this apparently went down to limitless depths the very contemplation of which made him dizzy the parish house seemed to float precariously on its surface  owing partly to the oldfashioned ideas of dr gilman and partly to the conservatism of its vestry the institutionalism of st johns was by no means up to date no settlement house with day nurseries was maintained in the slums the parish house built in the early nineties had its gymnasium hall and class and reading rooms but was not what in these rapidly moving times would be called modern presiding over its activities and seconded by a pale but earnest young man recently ordained was hodders first assistant the reverend mr mccrae  mccrae was another puzzle he was fifty and gaunt with a wide flat forehead and thinning grey hair and wore steel spectacles he had a numerous family his speech of which he was sparing bore strong traces of a caledonian accent and this with the addition of the fact that he was painstaking and methodical in his duties and that his sermons were orthodox in the sense that they were extremely noncommittal was all that hodder knew about him for many months he never doubted however the mans sincerity and loyalty  but mccrae had a peculiar effect on him and as time went on his conviction deepened that his assistant was watching him the fact that this tacit criticism did not seem unkindly did not greatly alleviate the impatience that he felt from time to time he had formed a higher estimate of mccraes abilities than that generally prevailing throughout the parish and in spite of perhaps because of his attitude was drawn toward the man this attitude as hodder analyzed it from the expressions he occasionally surprised on his assistants face was one of tolerance and experience contemplating with a faint amusement and a certain regret the wasteful expenditure of youthful vitality yet it involved more mccrae looked as if he knewknew many things that he deemed it necessary for the new rector to find out by experience  but he was a difficult man to talk to  if the truth be told the more hodder became absorbed in these activities of the parish house the greater grew his perplexity the more acute his feeling of incompleteness or rather his sense that the principle was somehow fundamentally at fault out of the waters of the proletariat they fished assiduously and benignly but at random strange specimens brought them as it were blinking to the light and held them by sheer struggling and sometimes when they slipped away dived after them the young curate mr tompkinson for the most part did the diving or in scriptural language the searching after the lost sheep  the results accomplished seemed indeed as mr parr had remarked strangely disproportionate to the efforts for they laboured abundantly the italian mothers appeared stolidly appreciative of the altruism of miss ramsay who taught the kindergarten in taking their charges off their hands for three hours of a morning and the same might be said of the jews and germans and russians the newsboys enjoyed the gymnasium and readingrooms some of them were drafted into the choir yet the singing of te deums failed somehow to accomplish the miracle of regeneration the boys as a rule were happier no doubt the new environments not wholly without results but the rector was an idealist  he strove hard to become their friend and that of the men to win their confidence and with a considerable measure of success on more than one occasion he threw aside his clerical coat and put on boxinggloves and he gave a series of lectures with lantern slides collected during the six months he had once spent in europe the irishamericans and the germans were the readiest to respond and these were for the most part young workingmen and youths by no means destitute when they were out of a place he would often run across them in the readingroom or sitting among the lockers beside the gymnasium and they would rise and talk to him cordially and even familiarly about their affairs they liked and trusted himon a tacit condition there was a boundary he might not cross and the existence of that boundary did not seem to trouble mccrae  one night as he stood with his assistant in the hall after the men had gone hodder could contain himself no longer  look here mccrae he broke out these men never come to churchor only a very few of them  no more they do mccrae agreed  why dont they  yeve asked them perhaps  ive spoken to one or two of them admitted the rector  and what do they tell you  hodder smiled  they dont tell me anything they dodge  precisely said mccrae  were not making christians of them said hodder beginning to walk up and down why is it  its a big question  it is a big question its the question of all questions it seems to me the function of the church in my opinion is to make christians  try to teach them religion said mccraehe almost pronounced it releegionand see what happens yell have no classes at all they only come the best of them because ye let them alone that way and they get a little decency and society help its somewhat to keep them out of the dancehalls and saloons maybe  its not enough the rector asserted youve had a great deal of experience with them and i want to know why in your view more of them dont come into the church  would ye put jimmy flanagan and otto bauer and tony baldassaro in mr parrs pew mccrae inquired with a slight flavour of irony that was not illnatured or perhaps mrs larrabbee would make room for them  ive considered that of course replied hodder thoughtfully though he was a little surprised that mccrae should have mentioned it you think their reasons are social thenthat they feel the gap i feel it myself most strongly and yet none of these men are socialists if they were they wouldnt come here to the parish house  theyre not socialists agreed mccrae  but there is room in the back and sides of the church and there is the early service and the sunday night service when the pews are free why dont they come to these  religion doesnt appeal to them  why not  yeve asked me a riddle all i know is that the minute ye begin to preach off they go and never come back  hodder with unconscious fixity looked into his assistants honest face he had an exasperating notion that mccrae might have said more if he would  havent you a theory  try yourself said mccrae his manner was abrupt yet oddly enough not ungracious  dont think im criticizing said the rector quickly  i know well yere not  ive been trying to learn it seems to me that we are only accomplishing half our task and i know that st johns is not unique in this respect ive been talking to andrews of trinity about their poor  does he give you a remedy  no hodder said he cant see any more than i can why christianity doesnt appeal any longer the fathers and mothers of these people went to church in the old country and in this of course he sees as you and i do that society has settled into layers and that the layers wont mix and he seems to agree with me that there is a good deal of energy exerted for a comparatively small return  i understand thats what mr parr says  these references to mr parr disturbed hodder he had sometimes wondered when he had been compelled to speak about his visits to the financier how mccrae regarded them he was sure that mccrae did regard them  mr parr is willing to be even more generous than he has been hodder said the point is whether its wise to enlarge our scope on the present plan what do you think  ye can reach more mccrae spoke without enthusiasm  whats the use of reaching them only to touch them in addition to being helped materially and socially and kept away from the dancehalls and saloons they ought to be fired by the gospels to be remade they should be going out into the highways and byways to bring others into the church  the scotchmans face changed a little for an instant his eyes lighted up whether in sympathy or commiseration or both hodder could not tell  im with ye mr hodder if yell show me the way but oughtnt we to begin at both ends  at both ends hodder repeated  surely with the people in the pews oughtnt we to be firing them too  yes said the rector youre right  he turned away to feel mccraes hand on his sleeve  maybe it will come mr hodder he said theres no telling when the light will strike in  it was the nearest to optimism he had ever known his assistant to approach  mccrae he asked have you ever tried to do anything with dalton street  dalton street  the real mccrae whom he had seemed to see emerging retired abruptly presenting his former baffling and noncommittal exterior  yes hodder forced himself to go on and it came to him that he had repeated virtually the same words to mr parr it is at our very doors a continual reproach there is real poverty in those rooming houses and i have never seen vice so defiant and shameless  its a shifty place that mccrae replied theyre in it one day and gone the next a sort of catchbasin for all the rubbish of the city i can recall when decent people lived there and now its all light housekeeping and dives and what not  but that doesnt relieve us of responsibility hodder observed  im not denying it i think yell find theres very little to get hold of  once more he had the air of stopping short of being able to say more hodder refrained from pressing him  dalton street continued to haunt him and often at nightfall as he hurried back to his bright rooms in the parish house from some of the many errands that absorbed his time he had a feeling of selfaccusation as he avoided women wearily treading the pavements or girls and children plodding homeward through the wet wintry streets some glanced at him with heavy eyes others passed sullenly with bent heads at such moments his sense of helplessness was overpowering he could not follow them to the dreary dwellings where they lodged  eldon parr had said that poverty was inevitable     volume 2     chapter v the rector has more food for thought   i  sunday after sunday hodder looked upon the same picture the winter light filtering through emblazoned windows falling athwart stone pillars and staining with rich colours the marble of the centre aisle the organ rolled out hymns and anthems the voices of the white robed choir echoed among the arches and hodders eye sweeping over the decorous congregation grew to recognize certain landmarks eldon parr rigid at one end of his empty pew little everett constable comfortably but always pompously settled at one end of his his whitehaired and distinguishedlooking wife at the other the space between them had once been filled by their children there was mr ferguson who occasionally stroked his black whiskers with a prodigious solemnity mrs ferguson resplendent and always a little warm and their daughter nan dainty and appealing her eyes uplifted and questioning  the plimptons with their rubicund and aggressively healthy offspring were always in evidence and there was mrs larrabbee what between wealth and youth independence and initiative a widowhood now emerged from a mourning unexceptionable an elegance so unobtrusive as to border on mystery she never failed to agitate any atmosphere she entered even that of prayer from time to time hodder himself was uncomfortably aware of her presence and he read in her upturned face an interest which by a little stretch of the imagination might have been deemed personal  another was gordon atterbury still known as young gordon though his father was dead and he was in the vestry he was unmarried and fortyfive and mrs larrabbee had said he reminded her of a shrivelling seed set aside from a once fruitful crop he wore invariably checked trousers and a black cutaway coat eyeglasses that fell off when he squinted and were saved from destruction by a gold chain no wedding or funeral was complete without him and one morning as he joined mr parr and the other gentlemen who responded to the appeal let your light so shine before men a strange ironical question entered the rectors mindwas gordon atterbury the logical product of those doctrines which he hodder preached with such feeling and conviction  none at least was so fervent a defender of the faith so punctilious in all observances so constant at the altar rail none so versed in rubrics ritual and canon law none had such a knowledge of the church fathers mr atterbury delighted to discuss them with the rector at the dinner parties where they met none was more zealous for foreign missions he was the treasurer of st johns  it should undoubtedly have been a consolation to any rector to possess mr atterburys unqualified approval to listen to his somewhat delphic complimentsheralded by a clearing of the throat he represented the faith as delivered to the saints and he spoke for those in the congregation to whom it was precious why was it that to hodder he should gradually have assumed something of the aspect of a cerberus why was it that he incited a perverse desire to utter heresies  hodder invariably turned from his contemplation of gordon atterbury to the double blaring pew which went from aisle to aisle in his heart he would have preferred the approval of eleanor goodrich and her husband and of asa waring instinct spoke to him here he seemed to read in their faces that he failed to strike in them responsive chords he was drawn to them the conviction grew upon him that he did not reach them and it troubled him as he thought disproportionately  he could not expect to reach all but they were the type to which he most wished to appeal of all of his flock this family seemed best to preserve the vitality and ideals of the city and nation asa waring was a splendid uncompromising survival his piercing eyes sometimes met hodders across the church and they held for him a question and a riddle eleanor goodrich bore on her features the stamp of true nobility of character and her husband hodder knew was a man among men in addition to a respected lineage he possessed an unusual blending of aggressiveness and personal charm that men found irresistible  the rectors office in the parish house was a businesslike room on the first floor fitted up with a desk a table straightbacked chairs and a revolving bookcase and to it one windy morning in march came eleanor goodrich hodder rose to greet her with an eagerness which from his kindly yet penetrating glance she did not suspect  am i interrupting you mr hodder she asked a little breathlessly  not at all he said drawing up a chair wont you sit down  she obeyed there was an awkward pause during which the colour slowly rose to her face  i wanted to ask you one or two things she began not very steadily as perhaps you may know i was brought up in this church baptized and confirmed in it ive come to fear that when i was confirmed i wasnt old enough to know what i was doing  she took a deep breath amazed at her boldness for this wasnt in the least how she had meant to begin and she gazed at the rector anxiously to her surprise he did not appear to be inordinately shocked  do you know any better now he asked  perhaps not she admitted but the things of which i was sure at that time i am not sure of now my faith isis not as complete  faith may be likened to an egg mrs goodrich he said it must be kept whole if the shell is chipped it is spoiled  eleanor plucked up her courage eggs she declared had been used as illustrations by conservatives before now  hodder relieved her by smiling in ready appreciation  columbus had reference to this world he said i was thinking of a more perfect cue  oh she cried i dare say there is a more perfect one i should hate to think there wasntbut i cant imagine it theres nothing in the bible in the way of description of it to make me really wish to go there the new jerusalem is too insipid too material im sure im shocking you but i must be honest and say what i feel  if some others were as honest said the rector the problems of clergymen would be much easier and it is precisely because people will not tell us what they feel that we are left in the dark and cannot help them of course the language of st john about the future is figurative  figurativeyes she consented but not figurative in a way that helps me a modern american woman the figures to be of any use ought to appeal to my imaginationoughtnt they but they dont i cant see any utility in such a heavenit seems powerless to enter as a factor into my life  it is probable that we are not meant to know anything about the future  then i wish it hadnt been made so explicit its very definiteness is somehowstultifying and mr hodder if we were not meant to know its details it seems to me that if the hereafter is to have any real value and influence over our lives here we should know something of its conditions because it must be in some sense a continuation of this im not sure that i make myself clear  admirably clear but we have our lords example of how to live here  if we could be sure said eleanor just what that example meant  hodder was silent a moment  you mean that you cannot accept what the church teaches about his life he asked  no i cant she faltered you have helped me to say it i want to have the churchs side better explainedthats why im here she glanced up at him hesitatingly with a puzzled wonder such a positive dynamic representative of that teaching did he appear and my husband cantso many people i know cant mr hodder only some of them dont mention the fact they accept it and you say things with such a certainty she paused  i know he replied i know i have felt it since i have come here more than ever before he did not add that he had felt it particularly about her about her husband nor did he give voice to his instinctive conviction that he respected and admired these two more than a hundred others whose professed orthodoxy was without a flaw what is it in particular he asked troubled that you cannot accept i will do my best to help you  well she hesitated again  please continue to be frank he begged  i cant believe in the doctrine of the virgin birth she responded in a low voice it seems to me soso material and i feel i am stating a difficulty that many have mr hodder why should it have been thought necessary for god to have departed from what is really a sacred and sublime fact in nature to resort to a material proof in order to convince a doubting humanity that jesus was his son oughtnt the proof of christs essential godship to lie in his life to be discerned by the spiritual and wasnt he continually rebuking those who demanded material proof the very acceptance of a material proof it seems to me is a denial of faith since faith ceases to have any worth whatever the moment the demand for such proof is gratified knowledge puts faith out of the question for faith to me means a trusting on spiritual grounds and surely the acceptance of scriptural statements like that of the miraculous birth without investigation is not faithit is mere credulity if jesus had been born in a miraculous way the disciples must have known it joseph must have known it when he heard the answer i must be about my fathers business and their doubts are unexplained  i see you have been investigating said the rector  yes replied eleanor with an unconscious shade of defiance people want to know mr dodderthey want to know the truth and if you consider the preponderance of the evidence of the gospels themselvesmy brotherinlaw saysyou will find that the miraculous birth has very little to stand on take out the first two chapters of matthew and luke and the rest of the four gospels practically contradict it the genealogies differ and they both trace through joseph  i think people suffer in these days from giving too much weight to the critics of christianity said the rector from not pondering more deeply on its underlying truths do not think that i am accusing you of superficiality mrs goodrich i am sure you wish to go to the bottom or else you would be satisfied with what you have already read and heard  i do she murmured  and the more one reflects on the life of our lord the more one is convinced that the doctrine of the virgin birth is a vital essential without it christianity falls to pieces let us go at the matter the other way round if we attribute to our lord a natural birth we come at once to the dilemma of having to admit that he was merely an individual human personin an unsurpassed relationship with god it is true but still a human person that doctrine makes christ historical some one to go back to instead of the everpresent preexistent son of god and mankind i will go as far as to assert that if the virgin birth had never been mentioned in the gospels it would nevertheless inevitably have become a fundamental doctrine of the christian faith such a truth is too vast too farreaching to have been neglected and it has a much higher significance than the mere record of a fact in spite of the contradictions of science it explains as nothing else can the mystery of the divinity as well as the humanity of the saviour  eleanor was unconvinced she felt as she listened the pressure of his sincerity and force and had to strive to prevent her thoughts from becoming confused  no mr hodder i simply cant see any reason for resorting to a physical miracle in order to explain a spiritual mystery i can see why the ancients demanded a sign of divinity as it were but for us it has ceased even to be that it cant be proved you ask me in the face of overwhelming evidence against it to teach my children that the incarnation depends on it but when they grow up and go to college and find it discredited they run the risk of losing everything else with it and for my part i fail utterly to see why if with god all things are possible it isnt quite as believable as we gather from st marks gospel that he incarnated himself in one naturally born if you reach the conclusion that jesus was not a mere individual human person you reach it through the contemplation of his life and death  then it isnt the physical miracle you object to especially he asked  its the uselessness of it for this age she exclaimed i think clergymen dont understand the harm it is doing in concentrating the attention on such a vulnerable and nonessential point those of us who are striving to reorganize our beliefs and make them tenable do not bother our heads about miracles they may be true or may not or some of them may be we are beginning to see that the virgin birth does not add anything to christ we are beginning to see that perfection and individuality are not incompatibleone is divine and the other human and isnt it by his very individuality that we are able to recognize jesus today  you have evidently thought and read a great deal dodder said genuinely surprised why didnt you come to me earlier  eleanor bit her lip he smiled a little  i think i can answer that for you he went on you believe we are prejudicedive no doubt many of us are you think we are bound to stand up for certain dogmas or go down and that our minds are consequently closed i am not blaming you he added quickly as she gave a sign of protest but i assure you that most of us so far as my observation has gone are honestly trying to proclaim the truth as we see it  insincerity is the last thing i should have accused you of mr hodder she said flushing as i told you you seem so sure  i dont pretend to infallibility except so far as i maintain that the church is the guardian of certain truths which human experience has verified let me ask you if you have thought out the difference your conception of the incarnationthe lack of a patently divine commission as it weremakes in the doctrine of grace  yes i have she answered a little it gives me more hope i cannot think i am totally depraved i do not believe that god wishes me to think so and while i am still aware of the distance between christs perfection and my own imperfection i feel that the possibility is greater of lessening that distance it gives me more selfrespect more selfreliance george bridges says that the logical conclusion of that old doctrine is what philosophers call determinismcalvinistic predestination i cant believe in that the kind of grace god gives me is the grace to help myself by drawing force from the element of him in my soul he gives me the satisfaction of developing  of one thing i am assured mrs goodrich hodder replied that the logical result of independent thinking is anarchy under this modern tendency toward individual creeds the church has split and split again until if it keeps on we shall have no church at all to carry on the work of our lord on earth history proves that to take anything away from the faith is to atrophy to destroy it the answer to your arguments is to be seen on every side atheism hypocrisy vice misery insane and cruel grasping after wealth there is only one remedy i can see he added inflexibly yet with a touch of sadness believe  what if we cant believe she asked  you can he spoke with unshaken conviction  you can if you make the effort and i am sure you will my experience is that in the early stages of spiritual development we are impervious to certain truths will you permit me to recommend to you certain books dealing with these questions in a modern way  i will read them gladly she said and rose  and then perhaps we may have another talk he added looking down at her give my regards to your husband  yet as he stood in the window looking after her retreating figure there gradually grew upon him a vague and uncomfortable feeling that he had not been satisfactory and this was curiously coupled with the realization that the visit had added a considerable increment to his already pronounced liking for eleanor goodrich she was paradoxically his kind of a personsuch was the form the puzzle took and so ably had she presented her difficulties that at one point of the discussion it had ironically occurred to him to refer her to gordon atterbury mr atterburys faith was like an egg and he took precious care not to have it broken or chipped  hodder found himself smiling it was perhaps inevitable that he began at once to contrast mrs goodrich with other feminine parishioners who had sought him out and who had surrendered unconditionally they had evinced an equally disturbing tendencya willingness to be overborne for had he not indeed overborne them he could not help suspecting these other ladies of a craving for the luxury of the confessional one thing was certainhe had much less respect for them than for eleanor goodrich  that afternoon he sent her the list of books but the weeks passed and she did not come back once when he met her at a dinner of mrs prestons both avoided the subject of her visit both were conscious of a constraint she did not know how often unseen by her his eyes had sought her out from the chancel for she continued to come to church as frequently as before and often brought her husband    ii  one bright and boisterous afternoon in march hodder alighted from an electric car amid a swirl of dust and stood gazing for a moment at the stone gatehouses of that rus in urbe waverley place and at the gold blockletters written thereon no thoroughfare against those gates and their contiguous grill the rude onward rush of the city had beaten in vain and baffled had swept around their serene enclosure westward  within a silvery sunlight lit up the grass of the island running down the middle and in the beds the softening earth had already been broken by the crocus sheaves the bare branches of the trees swayed in the gusts as hodder penetrated this hallowed precinct he recognized on either hand the residences of several of his parishioners each in its ample allotted space mrs larrabbees the laureston greys thurston gores of which mr wallis plimpton was now the mastermr plimpton before whose pertinacity the walls of jericho had fallen and finally the queer twisted richardson mansion of the everett constables whither he was bound with its recessed doorway and tiny windows peeping out from under mediaeval penthouses  he was ushered into a library where the shades were already drawn where awhiteclothed teatable was set before the fire the red rays dancing on the silver teakettle on the centretable he was always sure to find neatly set in a rack the books about which the world was talking or rather would soon begin to talk and beside them were ranged magazines french english and american punch the spectator the nation the revue des deux mondes like the able general she was mrs constable kept her communications open and her acquaintance was by no means confined to the city of her nativity and if a celebrity were passing through it were pretty safe if in doubt to address him in her care  hodder liked and admired her but somehow she gave him the impression of having attained her ascendancy at a price an ascendancy which had apparently been gained by impressing upon her environment a new noteliterary aesthetic cosmopolitan she held herself and those she carried with her abreast of the times and he was at a loss to see how so congenial an effort could have left despite her sweetnessthe little mark of hardness he discerned of worldliness for she was as well born as any woman in the city and her husband was a constable he had inherited so the rector had been informed one of those modest fortunes that were deemed affluence in the eighties his keeping abreast of the times was the enigma and hodder had often wondered how financial genius had contrived to house itself in the welldressed gently pompous little man whose lack of force seemed at times so painfully evident and yet he was rated one of the rich men of the city and his name hodder had read on many boards with mr parrs  a person more versed in the modern world of affairs than the late rector of bremerton would not have been so long in arriving at the answer to this riddle hodder was astute he saw into people more than they suspected but he was not sophisticated  he stood picturing now the woman in answer to whose summons he had come with her finely chiselled features her abundant white hair her slim figure and erect carriage she reminded him always of a vigee lebrun portrait he turned at the sound of her voice behind him  how good of you to come mr hodder when you were so busy she said taking his hand as she seated herself behind the teakettle i wanted the chance to talk to you and it seemed the best way what is that you have soters book  i pinked it up on the table he explained  then you havent read it you ought to as a clergyman it would interest you religion treated from the economic side you know the effect of lack of nutrition on character very unorthodox of course  i find that i have very little time to read he said i sometimes take a book along in the cars  your profession is not so leisurely as it once was i often think it such a pity but you too are paying the penalty of complexity she smiled at him sympathetically how is mr parr i havent seen him for several weeks  he seemed well when i saw him last replied hodder  hes a wonderful man the amount of work he accomplishes without apparent effort is stupendous mrs constable cast what seemed a tentative glance at the powerful head and handed him his tea i wanted to talk to you about gertrude she said  he looked unenlightened  about my daughter mrs warren she lives in new york you knowon long island  then he had remembered something he had heard  yes he said  she met you at the fergusons just for a moment when she was out here last autumn what really nice and simple people the fergusons are with all their money  very nice indeed he agreed puzzled  i have been sorry for them in the past she went on evenly they had rather a hard timeperhaps you may have heard nobody appreciated them they were entombed so to speak in a hideous big house over on the south side which fortunately burned down and then they bought in park street and took a pew in st johns i suppose the idea of that huge department store was rather difficult to get used to but i made up my mind it was nonsense to draw the line at department stores especially since mr fergusons was such a useful and remarkable one so i went across and called mrs ferguson was so grateful it was almost pathetic and shes a very good friendshe came here everyday when genevieve had appendicitis  shes a good woman the rector said  and nani adore nan everybody adores nan she reminds me of one of those exquisite blueeyed dolls her father imports now if i were a bachelor mr hodder mrs constable left the rest to his imagination  he smiled  im afraid miss ferguson has her own ideas running through hodders mind a troubled current were certain memories connected with mrs warren was she the divorced daughter or was she not  but i was going to speak to you about gertrude shes had such a hard time poor dear my heart has bled for her there was a barely perceptible tremor in mrs constables voice all that publicity and the inevitable suffering connected with it and no one can know the misery she went through she is so sensitive but now at last she has a chance for happinessthe real thing has come  the real thing he echoed  yes shes going to marry a splendid man eldridge sumner i know the family well they have always stood for public spirit and this mr summer although he is little over thirty was chairman of that vice commission which made such a stir in new york a year ago hes a lawyer with a fine future and theyre madly in love and gertrude realizes now after her experience the true values in life she was only a child when she married victor warren  but mr warren hodder managed to say is still living  i sometimes wonder mr hodder she went on hurriedly whether we can realize how different the world is today from what it was twenty years ago until something of this kind is actually brought home to us i shall never forget how distressed how overwhelmed mr constable and i were when gertrude got her divorce i know that they are regarding such things differently in the east but out herewe never dreamed that such a thing could happen to us and we regarded it as a disgrace but gradually she hesitated and looked at the motionless clergymangradually i began to see gertrudes point of view to understand that she had made a mistake that she had been too young to comprehend what she was doing victor warren had been ruined by money he wasnt faithful to her but an extraordinary thing has happened in his case hes married again and gertrude tells me hes absurdly happy and has two children  as he listened hodders dominating feeling was amazement that such a course as her daughter had taken should be condoned by this middleaged lady a prominent member of his congregation and the wife of a vestryman who had been nurtured and steeped in christianity and not only that mrs constable was plainly defending a further step which in his opinion involved a breach of the seventh commandment to have invaded these precincts the muddy turbulent river of individualism had risen higher than he would have thought possible  wait she implored checking his speechshe had been watching him with what was plainly anxiety dont say anything yet i have a letter here which she wrote meat the time i kept it let me read a part of it to you that you may understand more fully the tragedy of it  mrs constable thrust her hand into her lap and drew forth a thickly covered sheet  it was written just after she left himit is an answer to my protest she explained and began to read  i know i promised to love victor mother but how can one promise to do a thing over which one has no control i loved him after he stopped loving me he wasnt a bit suited to mei see that nowhe was attracted by the outside of me and i never knew what he was like until i married him his character seemed to change completely he grew morose and quicktempered and secretive and nothing i did pleased him we led a catanddog life i never let you knowand yet i see now we might have got along in any other relationship we were very friendly when we parted and im not a bit jealous because he cares for another woman who i can see is much better suited to him  i cant honestly regret leaving him and im not conscious of having done anything wrong i dont want to shock you and i know how terribly you and father must feel but i can see now somehow that i had to go through this experience terrible as it was to find myself if it were thirty years ago before people began to be liberal in such matters i shudder to think what might have become of me i should now be one of those terrible women between fifty and sixty who have tried one frivolity and excess after anotherbut im not coming to that and my friends have really been awfully kind and supported meeven victors family dont dont think that im not respectable i know how you look at such things mrs constable closed the letter abruptly  i did look at such things in that way she added but ive changed that letter helped to change me and the fact that it was gertrude who had been through this if you only knew gertrude mr hodder you couldnt possibly think of her as anything but sweet and pure  although the extent of hodders acquaintance with mrs warren had been but five minutes the letter had surprisingly retouched to something like brilliancy her faded portrait the glow in her cheeks the iris blue in her eyes he recalled the little shock he had experienced when told that she was divorced for her appeal had lain in her very freshness her frank and confiding manner she was one of those women who seem to say here i am you cant but like me and he had respondedhe remembered thathe had liked her and now her letter despite his resistance had made its appeal so genuinely human was it so honest although it expressed a philosophy he abhorred  mrs constable was watching him mutely striving to read in his grave eyes the effect of her pleadings  you are telling me this mrs constablewhy he asked  because i wished you to know the exact situation before i asked you as a great favour to me to mr constable toto marry her in st johns of course she went on controlling her rising agitation and anticipating a sign of protest we shouldnt expect to have any peopleand gertrude wasnt married in st johns before that wedding was at passumset our seashore place oh mr hodder before you answer think of our feelings mr constables and mine if you could see mr constable you would know how he suffersthis thing has upset him more than the divorce his family have such pride i am so worried about him and he doesnt eat anything and looks so haggard i told him i would see you and explain and that seemed to comfort him a little she is after all our child and we dont want to feel so far as our church is concerned that she is an ishmaelite we dont want to have the spectacle of her having to go around outside to find a clergymanthat would be too dreadful i know how strict how unflinching you are and i admire you for it but this is a special case  she paused breathing deeply and hodder gazed at her with pity what he felt was more than pity he was experiencing indeed but with a deeper emotion something of that same confusion of values into which eleanor goodrichs visit had thrown him at the same time it had not escaped his logical mind that mrs constable had made her final plea on the score of respectability  it gives me great pain to have to refuse you he said gently  oh dont she said sharply dont say that i cant have made the case clear you are too big too comprehending mr hodder to have a hardandfast rule there must be timesextenuating circumstancesand i believe the canons make it optional for a clergyman to marry the innocent person  yes it is optional but i do not believe it should be the question is left to the clergymans conscience according to my view mrs constable the church as the agent of god effects an indissoluble bond and much as i should like to do anything in my power for you and mr constable you have asked the impossiblebelieving as i do there can be no special case no extenuating circumstance and it is my duty to tell you it is because people today are losing their beliefs that we have this lenient attitude toward the sacred things if they still held the conviction that marriage is of god they would labour to make it a success instead of flying apart at the first sign of what they choose to call incompatibility  but surely she said we ought not to be punished for our mistakes i cannot believe that christ himself intended that his religion should be so inelastic so hard and fast so cruel as you imply surely there is enough unhappiness without making more you speak of incompatibilitybut is it in all cases such an insignificant matter we are beginning to realize in these days something of the effects of character on characterdeteriorating effects in many instances with certain persons we are lifted up inspired to face the battle of life and overcome its difficulties i have known fine men and women whose lives have been stultified or ruined because they were badly mated and i cannot see that the character of my own daughter has deteriorated because she has got a divorce from a man with whom she was profoundly out of sympathyof harmony on the contrary she seems more of a person than she was she has clearer saner views of life she has made her mistake and profited by it her views changedvictor warrens did not she began to realize that some other woman might have an influence over his lifeshe had none simply because he did not love her and love is not a thing we can compel  you are making it very hard for me mrs constable he said you are now advocating an individualism with which the church can have no sympathy christianity teaches us that life is probationary and if we seek to avoid the trials sent us instead of overcoming them we find ourselves farther than ever from any solution we have to stand by our mistakes if marriage is to be a mere trial of compatibility why go through a ceremony than which there is none more binding in human and divine institutions one either believes in it or one does not and if belief be lacking the state provides for the legalization of marriages  oh she exclaimed  if persons wish to be married in church in these days merely because it is respectable if such be their only reason they are committing a great wrong they are taking an oath before god with reservations knowing that public opinion will release them if the marriage does not fulfil their expectations  for a moment she gazed at him with parted lips and pressing her handkerchief to her eyes began silently to cry the sudden spectacle in this condition of a selfcontrolled woman of the world was infinitely distressing to hodder whose sympathies were even more sensitive than in her attempt to play upon them she had suspected she was aware that he had got to his feet and was standing beside her speaking with an oddly penetrating tenderness  i did not mean to be harsh he said and it is not that i do not understand how you feel you have made my duty peculiarly difficult  she raised up to him a face from which the mask had fallen from which the illusory look of youth had fled he turned away and presently she began to speak again in disconnected sentences  i so want her to be happyi cannot think i will not think that she has wrecked her lifeit would be too unjust too cruel you cannot know what it is to be a woman  before this cry he was silent  i dont ask anything of god except that she shall have a chance and it seems to me that he is making the world betterless harsh for women  he did not reply and presently she looked up at him again steadfastly now searchingly the barriers of the conventions were down she had cast her pride to the winds he seemed to read in her a certain relief  i am going to tell you something mr hodder which you may think strange but i have a reason for saying it you are still a young man and i feel instinctively that you have an unusual career before you you interested me the first time you stepped into the pulpit of st johnsand it will do me good to talk to you this once frankly you have reiterated today in no uncertain terms doctrines which i once believed which i was brought up to think infallible but i have lived since then and life itself has made me doubt them  i recognize in you a humanity a sympathy and breadth which you are yourself probably not aware of all of which is greater than the rule which you so confidently apply to fit all cases it seems to me that christ did not intend us to have such rules he went beyond them into the spirit  under the conditions of societyof civilization today most marriages are merely a matter of chance even judgment cannot foresee the development of character brought about by circumstances by environment and in many marriages i have known about intimately both the man and the woman have missed the most precious thing that life can give something i cannot but thinkgod intends us to have you seeshe smiled at him sadlyi am still a little of an idealist  i missedthe thing i am talking about and it has been the great sorrow of my lifenot only on my account but on my husbands and so far as i am concerned i am telling you the truth when i say i should have been content to have lived in a log cabin ifif the gift had been mine not all the money in the world nor the intellect nor the philanthropythe socalled interests of life will satisfy me for its denial i am a disappointed woman i sometimes think a bitter woman i cant believe that life is meant to be so those energies have gone into ambition which should have been absorbed byby something more worth while  and i can see so plainly now that my husband would have been far far happier with another kind of woman i drew him away from the only work he ever enjoyedhis painting i do not say he ever could have been a great artist but he had a little of the divine spark in his enthusiasm at leastin his assiduity i shall never forget our first trip abroad after we were marriedhe was like a boy in the galleries in the studios i could not understand it then i had no real sympathy with art but i tried to make sacrifices what i thought were christian sacrifices the motive power was lacking and no matter how hard i tried i was only halfhearted and he realized it instinctivelyno amount of feigning could deceive him something deep in me which was a part of my nature was antagonistic stultifying to the essentials of his own being of course neither of us saw that then but the results were not long in developing to him art was a sacred thing and it was impossible for me to regard it with equal seriousness he drew into himselfclosed up as it wereno longer discussed it i was hurt and when we came home he kept on in businesshe still had his fathers affairs to look afterbut he had a little workroom at the top of the house where he used to go in the afternoon  it was a question which one of us should be warpedwhich personality should be annihilated so to speak and i was the stronger and as i look back mr hodder what occurred seems to me absolutely inevitable given the ingredients as inevitable as a chemical process we were both striving against each other and i wonat a tremendous cost the conflict one might say was subconscious instinctive rather than deliberate my attitude forced him back into business although we had enough to live on very comfortably and then the scale of life began to increase luxuries formerly unthought of seemed to become necessities and while it was still afar off i saw a great wave rolling toward us the wave of that new prosperity which threatened to submerge us and i seized the buoy fate had placed in our handsor rather by suggestion i induced my husband to seize ithis name  i recognized the genius the future of eldon parr at a time when he was not yet independent and supreme when association with a constable meant much to him mr parr made us as the saying goes needless to say money has not brought happiness but a host of hard false ambitions which culminated in gertrudes marriage with victor warren i set my heart on the match helped it in every way and until now nothing but sorrow has come of it but my pointis thisi see so clearly now that it is too late that two excellent persons may demoralize each other if they are illmated it may be possible that i had the germs of false ambition in me when i was a girl yet i was conscious only of the ideal which is in most womens hearts  you must not think that i have laid my soul bare in the hope of changing your mind in regard to gertrude i recognize clearly now that that is impossible oh i know you do not so misjudge me she added reading his quick protest in his face  indeed i cannot analyze my reasons for telling you something of which i have never spoken to any one else  mrs constable regarded him fixedly you are the strongest reason you have somehow drawn it out of me and i suppose i wish some one to profit by it you can mr hodderi feel sure of that you may insist now that my argument against your present conviction of the indissolubility of marriage is mere individualism but i want you to think of what i have told you not to answer me now i know your argument by heart that christian character develops by submission by suffering that it is the womans place to submit to efface herself but the root of the matter goes deeper than that i am far from deploring sacrifice yet commonsense tells us that our sacrifice should be guided by judgment that foolish sacrifices are worse than useless and there are times when the very limitations of our individualitynecessary limitations for usprevent our sacrifices from counting  i was wrong i grant you grievously wrong in the course i took even though it were not consciously deliberate but if my husband had been an artist i should always have remained separated from his real life by a limitation i had no power to remove the more i tried the more apparent my lack of insight became to him the more irritated he grew i studied his sketches i studied masterpieces but it was all hopeless the thing wasnt in me and he knew it wasnt every remark made him quiver  the church i think will grow more liberal must grow more liberal if it wishes to keep in touch with people in an age when they are thinking out these questions for themselves the law cannot fit all cases i am sure the gospel can and sometimes women have an instinct a kind of second sight into persons mr hodder i cannot explain why i feel that you have in you elements of growth which will eventually bring you more into sympathy with the point of view i have set forth but i do feel it  hodder did not attempt to refute hershe had indeed made discussion impossible she knew his arguments as she had declared and he had the intelligence to realize that a repetition of them on his part would be useless she brought home to him as never before a sense of the anomalistic position of the church in these modern days of its appallingly lessened weight even with its own members as a successor of the apostles he had no power over this woman or very little he could neither rebuke her nor sentence her to penance she recognized his authority to marry her daughter to baptize her daughters children but not to interfere in any way with her spiritual life it was as a personality he had moved hera personality apparently not in harmony with his doctrine women had hinted at this before and while mrs constable had not as she perceived shaken his conviction the very vividness and unexpectedness of a confession from herhad stirred him to the marrow had opened doors perforce which he himself had marked forbidden and given him a glimpse beyond before he could lower his eyes was there after all something in him that responded in spite of himself  he sat gazing at her his head bent his strong hands on the arms of the chair  we never can foresee how we may change he answered a light in his eyes that was like a smile yet having no suggestion of levity and his voicedespite his disagreementmaintained the quality of his sympathy neither felt the oddity then of the absence of a jarring note you may be sure at least of my confidence and of my gratitude for what you have told me  his tone belied the formality of his speech mrs constable returned his gaze in silence and before words came again to either a step sounded on the threshold and mr constable entered  hodder looked at him with a new vision his face was indeed lined and worn and dark circles here under his eyes but at mrs constables heres mr hodder dear he came forward briskly to welcome the clergyman  how do you do he said cordially we dont see you very often  i have been telling mr hodder that modern rectors of big parishes have far too many duties said his wife  and after a few minutes of desultory conversation the rector left     chapter vi watchman what of the night  it was one of those moist nights of spring when the air is pungent with the odour of the softened earth and the gentle breaths that stirred the curtains in mr parrs big diningroom wafted from the garden the perfumes of a revived creationdelicious hothouse smells at intervals showers might be heard pattering on the walk outside the rector of st johns was dining with his great parishioner  here indeed were a subject for some modern master a chance to picture for generations to come an aspect of a mighty age an age that may some day be deemed but a grotesque and anomalistic survival of a more ancient logic a gargoyle carved out of chaos that bears on its features a resemblance to the past and the future  our scene might almost be mediaeval with its encircling gloom through which the heavy tapestries and shadowy corners of the huge apartment may be dimly made out in the center the soft red glow of the candles the gleaming silver the shining cloth the church on one sideand what on the other no name given it now no royal name but still power the two are still in apposition not yet in opposition but the discerning may perchance read a prophecy in the salient features of the priest  the man of power of the beginning of the twentieth century demands a subtler analysis presents an enigma to which the immortal portraits of forgotten medicis and capets give no clew imagine if you can a lorenzo or a grand louis in a tightlybuttoned frock coat there must be some logical connection between the habit and the age since crimson velvet and gold brocade would have made eldon parr merely ridiculous  he is by no means ridiculous yet take him out of the setting and put him in the street and you might pass him a dozen times without noticing him nature and perhaps unconscious art have provided him with a protective exterior he is the colour of his jungle after he has crippled youif you surviveyou will never forget him you will remember his eye which can be unsheathed like a rapier you will recall his lips as the expression of a relentless negative the significance of the slight bridge on the narrow nose is less easy to define he is neither tall nor short his face is cleanshaven save for scanty unobtrusive reddish tufts high on the cheeks his hair is thin  it must be borne in mind however that our rector did not see him in his jungle and perhaps in the traditional nobility of the lion there is a certain truth an interesting biography of some of the powerful of this earth might be written from the point of view of the confessor or the physician who find something to love something to pity and nothing to fearthus reversing the sentiments of the public  yet the friendship between john hodder and eldon parr defied any definite analysis on the rectors part and was perhaps the strangestand most disquieting element that had as yet come into hodders life the nature of his intimacy with the banker if intimacy it might be called might have surprised his other parishioners if they could have been hidden spectators of one of these dinners there were long silences when the medium of communication tenuous at best seemed to snap and the two sat gazing at each other as from mountain peaks across impassable valleys with all the will in the world their souls lost touch though the sense in the clergyman of the others vague yearning for human companionship was never absent it was this yearning that attracted hodder who found in it a deep pathos  after one of these intervals of silence eldon parr looked up from his claret  i congratulate you hodder on the stand you took in regard to constables daughter he said  i didnt suppose it was known answered the rector in surprise  constable told me i have reason to believe that he doesnt sympathize with his wife in her attitude on this matter its pulled him downyouve noticed that he looks badly  yes said the rector he did not care to discuss the affair he had hoped it would not become known and he shunned the congratulations of gordon atterbury which in such case would be inevitable and in spite of the conviction that he had done his duty the memory of his talk with mrs constable never failed to make him uncomfortable  exasperation crept into mr pares voice  i cant think whats got into women in these timesat mrs constables age they ought to know better nothing restrains them they have reached a point where they dont even respect the church and when that happens it is serious indeed the church is the governor on our social engine and it is supposed to impose a restraint upon the lawless  hodder could not refrain from smiling a little at the bankers conception  doesnt that reduce the church somewhere to the level of the police force he asked  not at all said eldon parr whose feelings seemed to be rising i am sorry for constable he feels the shame of this thing keenly and he ought to go away for a while to one of these quiet resorts i offered him my car sometimes i think that women have no morals at any rate this modern notion of giving them their liberty is sheer folly look what they have done with it instead of remaining at home where they belong they are going out into the world and turning it topsyturvy and if a man doesnt let them have a free hand they get a divorce and marry some idiot who will  mr parr pushed back his chair and rose abruptly starting for the door the rector followed him forcibly struck by the unusual bitterness in his tone  if i have spoken strongly it is because i feel strongly he said in a strange thickened voice hodder how would you like to live in this housealone  the rector looked down upon him with keen comprehending eyes and saw eldon parr as he only of all men had seen him for he himself did not understand his own strange power of drawing forth the spirit from its shell of compelling the inner suffering thing to reveal itself  this poison eldon parr went on unevenly has eaten into my own family my daughter who might have been a comfort and a companion since she chose not to marry was carried away by it and thought it incumbent upon her to have a career of her own and now i have a choice of thirty rooms and not a soul to share them with sometimes at night i make up my mind to sell this house but i cant do itsomething holds me back hope superstition or whatever youve a mind to call it youve never seen all of the house have you he asked  the rector slowly shook his head and the movement might have been one that he would have used in acquiescence to the odd whim of a child mr parr led the way up the wide staircase to the corridor above traversing chamber after chamber turning on the lights  these were my wifes rooms he said they are just as she left them and these my daughter alisons when she chooses to pay me a visit i didnt realize that i should have to spend the last years of my life alone and i meant when i gave my wife a house to have it the best in the city i spared nothing on it as you see neither care nor money i had the best architect i could find and used the best material and what good is it to me only a reminderof what might have been but ive got a boy hodderi dont know whether ive ever spoken of him to youpreston hes gone away too but ive always had the hope that he might come back and get decently married and live here thats why i stay ill show you his picture  they climbed to the third floor and while mr parr way searching for the electric switch a lightning flash broke over the forests of the park prematurely revealing the room it was a boys room hung with photographs of school and college crews and teams and groups of intimates with deep window seats and draped pennons of harvard university over the fireplace eldon parr turned to one of the groups on the will the earliest taken at school  there he is he said pointing out a sunny little face at the bottom a boy of twelve bareheaded with short crisping yellow hair smiling lips and laughing eyes and here he is again indicating another group thus he traced him through succeeding years until they came to those of college  there he is said the rector i think i can pick him out now  yes thats preston said his father staring hard at the picture the face had developed the body had grown almost to mans estate but the hint of crispness was still in the hair the mischievous laughter in the eyes the rector gazed earnestly at the face remembering his own boyhood his own youth his mind dwelling too on what he had heard of the original of the portrait what had happened to the boy to bring to naught the fair promise of this earlier presentment  he was aroused by the voice of eldon parr who had sunk into one of the leather chairs  i can see him now he was saying as he used to come running down that long flight of stone steps in ransome street to meet me when i came home such laughter and once in his eagerness he fell and cut his forehead i shall never forget how i felt and when i picked him up he tried to laugh still with the tears rolling down his face you know the way a childs breath catches hodder he was always laughing and how he used to cling to me and beg me to take him out and show such an interest in everything he was a bright boy a remarkable child i thought but i suppose it was my foolishness he analyzed all he saw and when he used to go off in my car brennan the engineer would always beg to have him in the cab and such sympathy he knew in an instant when i was worried i had dreams of what that boy would become but i was too sure of it i went on doing other thingsthere were so many things and i was a slave to them and before i knew it hed gone off to school that was the year i moved up here and my wife died and after that all seemed to go wrong perhaps i was too severe perhaps they didnt understand him at boardingschool perhaps i didnt pay enough attention to him at any rate the first thing i knew his whole nature seemed to have changed he got into scrape after scrape at harvard and later he came within an ace of marrying a woman  hes my weakness today i can say no to everybody in the world but to him and when i try to remember him as he used to come down those steps on ransome street  he never knew how much i caredthat what i was doing was all for him building for him that he might carry on my work i had dreams of developing this city the great southwest and after i had gone preston was to bring them to fruition  for some reason i never was able to tell him all thisas i am telling you the words would not come we had grown apart and he seemed to thinkgod knows whyhe seemed to think i disliked him i had langmaid talk to him and other men i trustedtell him what an unparalleled opportunity he had to be of use in the world once i thought i had him started straight and then a woman came alongoff the streets or little better he insisted on marrying her and wrecking his life and when i got her out of the way as any father would have done he left me he has never forgiven me most of the time i havent even the satisfaction of knowing were he islondon paris or new york i try not to think of what he does i ought to cut him offi cant do iti cant do it hodderhes my one weakness still im afraidhed sink out of sight entirely and its the one hold i have left on him  eldon parr paused with a groan that betokened not only a poignant sorrow but also something of relieffor the tortures of not being able to unburden himself had plainly become intolerable he glanced up and met the compassionate eyes of the rector who stood leaning against the mantel  with alison it was different he said i never understood hereven when she was a childand i used to look at her and wonder that she could be my daughter she was moody intense with a yearning for affection ive since sometimes thoughtshe could not express i did not feel the need of affection in those days so absorbed was i in building upso absorbed and driven you might say i suppose i must accept my punishment as just but the child was always distant with me and i always remember her in rebellion a dark little thing with a quivering lip hair awry and eyes that flashed through her tears she would take any amount of punishment rather than admit she had been in the wrong i recall she had once a fox terrier that never left her that fought all the dogs in the neighbourhood and destroyed the rugs and cushions in the house i got rid of it one summer when she was at the sea and i think she never forgave me the first question she asked when she came home was for that dogmischief his name wasfor mischief i told her what i had done it took more courage than i had thought she went to her room locked herself in and stayed there and we couldnt get her to come out for two days she wouldnt even eat  perhaps she was jealous of preston but she never acknowledged it when she was little she used once in a while to come shyly and sit on my lap and look at me without saying anything i hadnt the slightest notion what was in the childs mind and her reserve increased as she grew older she seemed to have developed a sort of philosophy of her own even before she went away to school and to have certain strongly defined tastes she liked for instance to listen to music and for that very reason would never learn to play we couldnt make her as a child  bad music she said offended her she painted she was passionately fond of flowers and her room was always filled with them when she came back from school to live with me she built a studio upstairs after the first winter she didnt care to go out much by so pronounced a character young men in general were not attracted but there were a few who fell under a sort of spell i can think of no other words strong enough and i used to watch them when they came here with a curious interest i didnt approve of all of them alison would dismiss them or ignore them or be kind to them as she happened to feel yet it didnt seem to make any difference one i suspect she was in love witha fellow without a cent  then there was bedloe hubbell i have reason enough to be thankful now that she didnt care for him theyve made him president you know of this idiotic municipal league as they call it but in those days he hadnt developed any nonsense he was making a good start at the bar and was well off his father was elias hubbell who gave the botanical garden to the city i wanted her to marry gordon atterbury he hung on longer than any of themfive or six years but she wouldnt hear of it that was how the real difference developed between us although the trouble was deep rooted for we never really understood each other i had set my heart on it and perhaps i was too dictatorial and insistent i dont know i meant the best for her god knows gordon never got over it it dried him up irritation was creeping back into the bankers voice  then it came into alisons head that she wanted to make something of her lifeas she expressed it she said she was wasting herself and began going to lectures with a lot of faddish women became saturated with these nonsensical ideas about her sex that are doing so much harm nowadays i suppose i was wrong in my treatment from the first i never knew how to handle her but we grew like flint and steel ill say this for her she kept quiet enough but she used to sit opposite me at the table and i knew all the time what she was thinking of and then id break out of course shed defend herself but she had her temper under better control than i she wanted to go away for a year or two and study landscape gardening and then come back and establish herself in an office here i wouldnt listen to it and one morning when she was late to breakfast i delivered an ultimatum i gave her a lecture on a womans place and a womans duty and told her that if she didnt marry shed have to stay here and live quietly with me or id disinherit her  hodder had become absorbed in this portrait of alison parr drawn by her father with such unconscious vividness  and then he asked  in spite of the tone of bitterness in which he had spoken eldon parr smiled it was a reluctant tribute to his daughter  i got an ultimatum in return he said alison should have been a man his anger mounted quickly as he recalled the scene she said she had thought it all out that our relationship had become impossible that she had no doubt it was largely her fault but that was the way she was made and she couldnt change she had naturally an affection for me as her father but it was very plain we couldnt get along together she was convinced that she had a right to individual freedomas she spoke of itto develop herself she knew if she continued to live with me on the terms i demanded that her character would deteriorate certain kinds of sacrifice she was capable of she thought but what i asked would be a useless one perhaps i didnt realize it but it was slavery slavery he repeated the kind of slavery her mother had lived  he took a turn around the room  so far as money was concerned she was indifferent to it she had enough from her mother to last until she began to make more she wouldnt take any from me in any case i laughed yet i have never been so angry in my life nor was it wholly anger hodder but a queer tangle of feelings i cant describe there was affection mixed up in iti realized afterwardbut i longed to take her and shake her and lock her up until she should come to her senses i couldnt i didnt dare i was helpless i told her to go she didnt say anything more but there was a determined look in her eyes when she kissed me as i left for the office i spent a miserable day more than once i made up my mind to go home but pride stopped me i really didnt think she meant what she said when i got back to the house in the afternoon she had left for new york  then i began to look forward to the time when her money would give out she went to paris with another young woman and studied there and then to england she came back to new york hired an apartment and a studio and has made a success  the rector seemed to detect an unwilling note of pride at the magic word  it isnt the kind of success i think much of but its what she started out to do she comes out to see me once in a while and she designed that garden  he halted in front of the clergyman  i suppose you think its strange my telling you this he said it has come to the point he declared vehemently where it relieves me to tell somebody and you seem to be a man of discretion and commonsense  hodder looked down into mr parrs face and was silent perhaps he recognized as never before the futility of the traditional words of comfort of rebuke he beheld a soul in torture and realized with sudden sharpness how limited was his knowledge of the conditions of existence of his own time everywhere individualism reared its ugly head everywhere it seemed plausible to plead justification and once more he encountered that incompatibility of which mrs constable had spoken he might blame the son blame the daughter yet he could not condemn them utterly one thing he saw clearly that eldon parr had slipped into what was still for him a meaningless hell  the bankers manner suddenly changed reverted to what it had been he arose  ive tried to do my duty as i saw it and it comes to thisthat we who have spent the best years of our lives in striving to develop this country have no thanks from our children or from any one else  with his hand on the electric switch he faced hodder almost defiantly as he spoke these words and suddenly snapped off the light as though the matter admitted of no discussion in semidarkness they groped down the upper flight of stairs     chapter vii the kingdoms of the world   i  when summer arrived the birds of brilliant plumage of mr hodders flock arose and flew lightly away thus reversing the seasons only the soberer ones came fluttering into the cool church out of the blinding heat and settled here and there throughout the nave the ample mr bradley perspiring in an alpaca coat took up the meagre collection on the right of the centre aisle for mr parr properly heralded had gone abroad on one of those periodical though lonely tours that sent anticipatory shivers of delight down the spines of foreign picturedealers the faithful gordon atterbury was worshipping at the sea and even mr constable and mr plimpton when recalled to the city by financial cares succumbed to the pagan influence of the sun and were usually to be found on sunday mornings on the wide veranda of the country club with glasses containing liquid and ice beside them and surrounded by heaps of newspapers  to judge by st johns the city was empty but on occasions before he himself somewhat tardily departeddrawn thither by a morbid though impelling attraction hodder occasionally walked through dalton street of an evening if not in st johns summer was the season in dalton street it flung open its doors and windows and moved out on the steps and the pavements and even on the asphalt and the music of its cafes and dancehalls throbbed feverishly through the hot nights dalton street resorted neither to country club nor church  mr mccrae hodders assistant seemed to regard these annual phenomena with a grim philosophya relic perhaps of the calvinistic determinism of his ancestors he preached the same indefinite sermons with the same imperturbability to the dwindled congregations in summer and the enlarged ones in winter but hodder was capable of no such resignationif resignation it were for the selfcontained assistant continued to be an enigma and it was not without compunction that he left about the middle of july on his own vacation he was tired and yet he seemed to have accomplished nothing in this first year of the city parish whereof he had dreamed and it was no doubt for that very reason that he was conscious of a depressing exhaustion as his train rolled eastward over that same high bridge that spanned the hot and muddy waters of the river he felt a fugitive in no months since he had left the theological seminary had he seemingly accomplished so little in no months had he had so magnificent an opportunity  after he had reached the peaceful hills at bremertonwhere he had gone on mrs whitelys invitationhe began to look back upon the spring and winter as a kind of mad nightmare a period of ceaseless distracted and dissipated activity of rushing hither and thither with no results he had been aware of invisible barriers restricting hemming him in on all sides there had been no time for reflection and now that he had a breathing space he was unable to see how he might reorganize his work in order to make it more efficient  there were other perplexities brought about by the glimpses he had had into the lives and beliefsor rather unbeliefsof his new parishioners and sometimes in an unwonted moment of pessimism he asked himself why they thought it necessary to keep all that machinery going when it had so little apparent effect on their lives he sat wistfully in the chancel of the little bremerton church and looked into the familiar faces of those he had found in it when he came to it and of those he had brought into it wondering why he had been foolish enough to think himself endowed for the larger work here he had been a factor a force in the community had entered into its life and affections what was he there  nor did it tend to ease his mind that he was treated as one who has passed on to higher things  i was afraid youd work too hard said mrs whitely in her motherly way i warned you against it mr hodder you never spared yourself but in a big city parish its different but youve made such a success nelson tells me and everybody likes you there i knew they would of course that is our only comfort in losing you that you have gone to the greater work but we do miss you    ii  the air of bremerton and later the air of bar harbor had a certain reviving effect and john hodder although he might be cast down had never once entertained the notion of surrender he was inclined to attribute the depression through which he had passed the disappointment he had undergone as a just punishment for an overabundance of egoonly hodder used the theological term for the same sin had he not after all laboured largely for his own glory and not gods had he ever forgotten himself had the idea ever been far from his thoughts that it was he john hodder who would build up the parish of st johns into a living organization of faith and works the curious thing was that he had the power and save in moments of weariness he felt it in him he must try to remember always that this power was from god but why had he been unable to apply it  and there remained disturbingly in his memory certain phrases of mrs constables such as elements of growth  he would change she had said and he had appeared to her as one with depths unsuspected depthspockets that held the steam which was increasing in pressure at bremerton it had not gathered in the pockets he had used it allall had counted but in the feverish ceaseless activity of the city parish he had never once felt that intense satisfaction of emptying himself nor the sweet weariness that follows it his seemed the weariness of futility and introspection was revealing a crackafter so many yearsin that self that he had believed to be so strongly welded such was the strain of the pentup force he recognized the dangersignal the same phenomenon had driven him into the church where the steam had found an outletuntil now and yet so far as his examination went he had not lost his beliefs but the power of communicating them to others  bremerton and the sight of another carrying on the work in which he had been happy weighed upon him and bar harbor offered distraction mrs larrabbee had not hesitated to remind him of his promise to visit her if the gallery of portraits of the congregation of st johns were to be painted this ladys at the age of thirty would not be the least interesting it would have been out of place in no ancestral hall and many of her friends were surprised after her husbands death that she did not choose one wherein to hang it she might have for she was the quintessence of that feminine product of our country at which europe has never ceased to wonder and to give her history would no more account for her than the process of manufacture explains the most delicate of scents her poise her quick detection of sham in others not so fortunate her absolute conviction that all things were as they ought to be her charity her interest in its recipients her smile which was kindness itself her delicate features her white skin with its natural bloom the grace of her movements and her hair which had a different color in changing lightssuch an ensemble is not to be depicted save by a skilled hand  the late mr larrabbees name was still printed on millions of bright labels encircling cubes of tobacco now manufactured by a trust however since the kind that entered mrs larrabbees house or houses was all imported from egypt or cuba what might have been in the nature of an unpleasant reminder was remote from her sight and she never drove into the northern part of the city where some hundreds of young women bent all day over the cuttingmachines to enter too definitely into mrs larrabbees history therefore were merely to be crude for she is not a lady to caricature her father had been a steamboat captainonce an honoured calling in the city of her nativitya devout presbyterian who believed in the most rigid simplicity few who remembered the gaucheries of captain coringtons daughter on her first presentation to his familys friends could recognize her in the cosmopolitan mrs larrabbee why with new york and london at her disposal she elected to remain in the middle west puzzled them though they found her answer that she belonged there satisfying grace larrabbees cosmopolitanism was of that apperception that knows the value of roots and during her widowhood she had been thrusting them out mrs larrabbee followed by of was much more important than just mrs larrabbee and she was moreover genuinely attached to her roots  her girlhood shynessrudeness some called it mistaking the effect for the causehad refined into a manner that might be characterized as difficile though hodder had never found her so she liked direct men to discover no guile on first acquaintance went a long way with her and not the least of the new rectors social triumphs had been his simple conquest  enveloped in white flannel she met his early train at the ferry an unusual compliment to a guest had he but known it but he accepted it as a tribute to the church  i was so afraid you wouldnt come she said in a voice that conveyed indeed more than a perfunctory expression she glanced at him as he sat beside her on the cushions of the flying motor boat his strange eyes fixed upon the blue mountains of the island whither they were bound his unruly hair fanned by the wind  why he asked smiling at the face beneath the flying veil  you need the rest i believe in men taking their work seriously but not so seriously as you do  she was so undisguisedly glad to see him that he could scarcely have been human if he had not responded and she gave him in that fortnight a glimpse of a life that was new and distracting at times made him forgetand he was willing to forgetthe lower forms of which it was the quintessencethe factories that hummed the forges that flung their fires into the night in order that it might exist the dalton streets that went without the effluvia from hot asphalt bore no resemblance to the saltladen air that rattled the venetian blinds of the big bedroom to which he was assigned her villa was set high above the curving shore facing a sheltered terracegarden resplendent in its august glory to seaward islands danced in the haze and behind the house in the sunlight were massed spruces of a brilliant arsenic green with purple cones the fluttering awnings were striped cardinal and white  nature and man seemed to have conspired to make this place vividly unreal as a toy village comes painted from the shop there were no halftones no povertyin sight at least no litter on the streets and roads at the casino attached to the swimmingpool and at the golf club were to be seen bewildering arrays of welldressed wellfed women intent upon pleasure and exercise some of them gave him glances that seemed to say you belong to us and almost succeeded in establishing the delusion the whole effect upon hodder in the state of mind in which he found himself was reacting stimulating disquieting at luncheons and dinners he was what is known as a successalways that magic word  he resisted and none so quick as women to scent resistance his very unbending attitude aroused their inherent craving for rigidity in his profession he was neither plastic unctuous nor subservient his very homeliness redeemed by the eyes and mouth compelled their attention one of them told mrs larrabbee that that rector of hers would do something  but what he asked himself was he resisting he was by no means a puritan and while he looked upon a reasonable asceticism as having its place in the faith that he professed it was no asceticism that prevented a more complete acquiescence on his part in the mad carnival that surrounded him  im afraid you dont wholly approve of bar harbor his hostess remarked one morning  at first sight it is somewhat staggering to the provincial mind he replied  she smiled at him yet with knitted brows  you are always putting me offi never can tell what you think and yet im sure you have opinions you think these people frivolous of course  most of them are so he answered but that is a very superficial criticism the question is why are they so the sight of bar harbor leads a stranger to the reflection that the carnival mood has become permanent with our countrymen and especially our countrywomen  the carnival mood she repeated thoughtfully yes that expresses it we are light we are always trying to get away from ourselves and sometimes i wonder whether there are any selves to get away from you ought to atop us she added almost accusingly to bring us to our senses  thats just it he agreed why dont we why cant we  if more clergymen were like you i think perhaps you might  his tone his expression were revelations  i he exclaimed sharply and controlled himself but in that moment grace larrabbee had a glimpse of the man who had come to arouse in her an intense curiosity for an instant a tongue of the fires of vulcan had shot forth fires that she had suspected  arent you too ambitious she asked gently and again although she did not often blunder she saw him wince i dont mean ambitious for yourself but surely you have made a remarkable beginning at st johns everybody admires and respects you has confidence in you you are so sure of yourself she hesitated a moment for she had never ventured to discuss religion with him of your faith clergymen ought not to be apologetic and your conviction cannot fail in the long run to have its effect  its effecton what he asked  mrs larrabbee was suddenly at sea and she prided herself on a lack of that vagueness generally attributed to her sex  onon everything on what we were talking aboutthe carnival feeling the levity on the unbelief of the age isnt it because the control has been taken off  he saw an opportunity to slip into smoother waters  the engine has lost its governor  exactly cried mrs larrabbee what a clever simile  it is mr pares said hodder only he was speaking of other symptoms socialism and its opposite individualismnot carnivalism  poor man said mrs larrabbee accepting the new ground as safer yet with a baffled feeling that hodder had evaded her once more he has had his share of individualism and carnivalism his son preston was here last month and was taken out to the yacht every night in an unspeakable state and alison hasnt been what might be called a blessing  she must be unusual said the rector musingly  oh alison is a person she has become quite the fashion and has more work than she can possibly attend to very few women with her good looks could have done what she has without severe criticism and something worse perhaps the most extraordinary thing about her is her contempt for what her father has gained and for conventionalities it always amuses me when i think that she might have been the wife of gordon atterbury the goddess of liberty linked towhat  hodder thought instinctively of the church but he remained silent  as a rule men are such fools about the women they wish to marry she continued she would have led him a dance for a year or two and then calmly and inexorably left him and there was her father with all his ability and genius couldnt see it either but fondly imagined that alison as gordon atterburys wife would magically become an atterbury and a bourgeoise see that the corners were dusted in the big house sew underwear for the poor and fast in lent  and she is happywhere she is he inquired somewhat naively  she is selfsufficient said mrs larrabbee with unusual feeling and that is just what most women are not in these days oh why has life become such a problem sometimes i think with all that i have im not so well off as one of those salesgirls in fergusons at home im always searching for things to donothing is thrust on me there are the charitiesgalt house and all that but i never seem to get at anything at the people id like to help its like sending money to china there is no direct touch any more its like seeing ones opportunities through an iron grating  hodder started at the phrase so exactly had she expressed his own case  ah he said the iron grating bars the path of the church too  and just what was the iron grating  they had many moments of intimacy during that fort night though none in which the plumb of their conversation descended to such a depth for he was as she had said always putting her off was it because he couldnt satisfy her craving give her the solution for whichhe began to seeshe thirsted why didnt that religion that she seemed outwardly to profess and accept without qualificationthe religion he taught set her at rest show her the path  down in his heart he knew that he feared to ask    that mrs larrabbee was still another revelation that she was not at rest was gradually revealed to him as the days passed her spirit too like his own like mrs constables like eldon parrs like eleanor goodrichs was divided against itself and this phenomenon in mrs larrabbee was perhaps a greater shock to him since he had always regarded her as essentially in equilibrium one of his reasons indeedin addition to the friendship that had grown up between themfor coming to visit her had been to gain the effect of her poise on his own poise in a modern woman leading a modern life it was thus she attracted him it was not that he ignored her frivolous side it was nicely balanced by the other and that other seemed growing the social she accepted at what appeared to be its own worth unlike mrs plimpton for instance she was so innately a lady that she had met with no resistance in the eastern watering places and her sense of values had remained the truer for it  he did not admire her the less now he had discovered that the poise was not so adjusted as he had thought it but his feeling about her changed grew more personal more complicated she was showing an alarming tendency to lean on him at a time when he was examining with some concern his own supports she possessed intelligence and fascination she was a woman whose attentions would have flattered and disturbed any man with a spark of virility and hodder had constantly before his eyes the spectacle of others paying her court here were dangersignals again  mrs plaice a middleaged english lady staying in the house never appeared until noon breakfast was set out in the tiled and sheltered loggia where they were fanned by the cool airs of a softly breathing ocean the world on these mornings had a sparkling unreality the cold cobalt sea stretching to sunlit isles and beyond the vividly painted shorethe setting of luxury had never been so complete and the woman who sat opposite him seemed like one of her own nectarines to be the fruit that crowned it all  why not yield to the enchantment why rebel when nobody else complained were it not more simple to accept what life sent in its orderly course instead of striving for an impossible and shadowy ideal very shadowy indeed and to what end were his labours in that smoky western city with its heedless dalton streets which went their inevitable ways for he had the choice  to do him justice he was slow in arriving at a realization that seemed to him so incredible so preposterous he was her rector and he had accepted all unconsciously the worldly point of view as to mrs larrabbeethat she was reserved for a worldly match a clergymans wife what would become of the clergyman and yet other clergymen had married rich women despite the warning of the needles eye  she drove him in her buckboard to jordans pond set like a jewel in the hills and even to the deep cliff bordered inlet beyond north east which reminded her she said of a norway fiord and sometimes they walked together through wooded paths that led them to beetling shores and sat listening to the waves crashing far below silences and commonplaces became the rule instead of the eager discussions with which they had begunon such safer topics as the problem of the social work of modern churches her aromatic presence and in this setting continually disturbed him natures perfumes more definableexhalations of the sea and sprucemingled with hers anaesthetics compelling lethargy he felt himself drowning even wished to drownand yet strangely resisted  i must go tomorrow he said  tomorrowwhy there is a dinner you know and mrs waterman wished so particularly to meet you  he did not look at her the undisguised note of pain found an echo within him and this was mrs larrabbee  i am sorry but i must he told her and she may not have suspected the extent to which the firmness was feigned  you have promised to make other visits the fergusonsthey said they expected you  im going westhome he said and the word sounded odd  at this season but there is nobody in church at least only a few and mr mccrae can take care of thosehe always does he likes it  hodder smiled in spite of himself he might have told her that those outside the church were troubling him but he did not since he had small confidence in being able to bring them in  i have been away too long i am getting spoiled he replied with an attempt at lightness he forced his eyes to meet hers and she read in them an unalterable resolution  it is my opinion you are too conscientious even for a clergyman she said and now it was her lightness that hurt she protested no more and as she led the way homeward through the narrow forest path her head erect still maintaining this lighter tone he wondered how deeply she had read him how far her intuition had carried her below the surface whether she guessed the presence of that stifled thing in him which was crying feebly for life whether it was that she had discovered or something else he must give it the chance it craved he must get awayhe must think to surrender now would mean destruction  early the next morning as he left the pier in the motor boat he saw a pink scarf waving high above him from the loggia and he flung up his hand in return mingled with a faint sense of freedom was intense sadness     chapter viii the line of least resistance  from the vantage point of his rooms in the parish house hodder reviewed the situation and despite the desires thronging after him in his flight he had the feeling of once who in the dark has been very near to annihilation what had shaken him most was the revelation of an old enemy which watching its chance had beset him at the first opportunity and at a time when the scheme of life which he flattered himself to have solved forever was threatening once more to resolve itself into fragments he had as if by a miracle escaped destruction in some insidious form  he shrank instinctively from an analysis of the woman in regard to whom his feelings were so complicated and yet by no means lacking in tenderness but as time went on he recognized more and more that she had come into his life at a moment when he was peculiarly vulnerable she had taken him off his guard that the brilliant mrs larrabbee should have desired himor what she believed was himwas food enough for thought was an indication of an idealism in her nature that he would not have suspected from a worldly point of view the marriage would have commended itself to none of her friends yet hodder perceived clearly that he could not have given her what she desired since the marriage would have killed it in him she offered him the other thing once again he had managed somehow to cling to his dream of what the relationship between man and woman should be and he saw more and more distinctly that he had coveted not only the jewel but its setting he could not see her out of itshe faded nor could he see himself in it  luxuryof coursethat was what he had spurned luxury in contrast to dalton street to the whirring factories near the church which discharged at nightfall their quotas of wan women and stunted children and yet here he was catering to luxury providing religion for it religion  early in november he heard that mrs larrabbee had suddenly decided to go abroad without returning home  that winter hodder might have been likened to a niagara for energy an unharnessed niagarasuch would have been his own comment he seemed to turn no wheels or only a few at least and feebly and while the spectacle of their rectors zeal was no doubt an edifying one to his parishioners they gave him to understand that they would have been satisfied with less they admired but chided him gently and in february mr parr offered to take him to florida he was tired and it was largely because he dreaded the reflection inevitable in a period of rest that he refused and throughout these months the feeling recurred with increased strength that mccrae was still watching himthe notion persisted that his assistant held to a theory of his own if he could but be induced to reveal it hodder refrained from making the appeal sometimes he was on the point of losing patience with this enigmatic person  congratulations on the fact that his congregation was increasing brought him little comfort since a cold analysis of the newcomers who were renting pews was in itself an indication of the lack of that thing he so vainly sought the decorous families who were now allying themselves with st johns did so at the expense of other churches either more radical or less fashionable what was it he sought what did he wish to fill the church to overflowing with the poor and needy as well as the rich and to enter into the lives of all yet at a certain point he met a resistance that was no less firm because it was baffling the word on his lips at least seemed to have lost it efficacy the poor heeded it not and he preached to the rich as from behind a glass they went on with their carnival why this insatiate ambition on his part in an age of unbelief other clergymen not half so fortunate were apparently satisfied or elsefrom his conversation with themeither oddly optimistic or resigned why not he  it was strange in spite of everything that hope sprang up within him a recurrent geyser  gradually almost imperceptibly he found himself turning more and more towards that line of least resistance which other churches were following as the one modern solutioninstitutional work after all in the rescuing of bodies some method might yet be discovered to revive the souls and there were the children hodder might have been likened to an explorer seeking a direct path when there was nonea royal road and if this were oblique it offered at least a definite outlet for his energy  such was approximately the state of his mind early in march when gordon atterbury came back from a conference in new york on institutional work and filled with enthusiasm st johns was incredibly behind the times so he told hodder and later the vestry now that they had in mr hodder a man of action and abilityahem there was no excuse for a parish as wealthy as st johns a parish with their opportunities considering the proximity of dalton street neighbourhood not enlarging and modernizing the parish house not building a settlement house with kindergartens schools workshops libraries a dispensary and day nurseries it would undoubtedly be an expenseand mr atterbury looked at mr parr who drummed on the vestry table they would need extra assistants deaconesses trained nurses and all that but there were other churches in the city that were ahead of st johnsa reproachahem  mr parr replied that he had told the rector that he stood ready to contribute to such a scheme when he the rector should be ready to approve it and he looked at mr hodder  mr hodder said he had been considering the matter ever since his arrival he had only one criticism of institutional work that in his observation it did not bring the people whom it reached into the church in any great numbers perhaps that were too much to ask in these days for his part he would willingly assume the extra burden and he was far from denying the positive good such work accomplished through association and by the raising of standards  mr ferguson declared his readiness to help many of his salesgirls he said lived in this part of the city and he would be glad to do anything in his power towards keeping them out of the dancehalls and such places  a committee was finally appointed consisting of mr parr mr atterbury and the rector to consult architects and to decide upon a site  hodder began a correspondence with experts in other cities collected plans pamphlets statistics spent hours with the great childspecialist dr jarvis and with certain clergymen who believed in institutionalism as the hope of the future  but mccrae was provokingly noncommittal  oh they may try it he assented somewhat grudgingly one day when the rector had laid out for his inspection the architects sketch for the settlement house no doubt it will help many poor bodies along  is there anything else the rector asked looking searchingly at his assistant  it may as well be that replied mccrae  the suspicion began to dawn on hodder that the scotch mans ideals were as high as his own both of them secretly regarded the new scheme as a compromise a yielding to the inevitable  mr fergusons remark that an enlarged parish house and a new settlement house might help to keep some of the young women employed in his department store out of the dancehalls interested hodder who conceived the idea of a dancehall of their own for the rector in the course of his bachelor shopping often resorted to the emporium of his vestryman to stand on the stairway which carried him upward without lifting his feet to roam fascinated through the mazes of its aisles where he invariably got lost and was rescued by suave floorwalkers or pert young women in black gowns and white collars and cuffs but they were not all pertthere were many characters many types and he often wondered whether they did not get tired standing on their feet all day long hesitating to ask them speculated on their livesflung as most of them were on a heedless city and left to shift for themselves why was it that the church which cared for mr fergusons soul was unable to get in touch with or make an appeal to those of his thousand employees  it might indeed have been said that francis ferguson cared for his own soul as he cared for the rest of his property and kept it carefully insuredsomewhat perhaps on the principle of pascals wager that he had been a benefactor to his city no one would deny who had seen the facade that covered a whole block in the business district from tower to vine surmounted by a red standard with the familiar motto when in doubt go to fergusons at fergusons you could buy anything from a penwiper to a piano or a paris gown sit in a cool restaurant in summer or in a palm garden in winter leave your babyif you had onein charge of the most capable trained nurses if your taste were literary mull over the novels in the book department if you were stout you might be reduced in the hygiene department unknown to your husband and intimate friends in short if there were any virtuous human wish in the power of genius to gratify fergusons was the place they even taught you how to cook it was a modern aladdins palace and like everything else modern much more wonderful than the original and the soda might be likened to the waters of trevito partake of which is to return  when in doubt go to ferguson thus mrs larrabbee and other ladies interested in good works had altered his motto he was one of the supporters of galt house into which some of his own young saleswomen had occasionally strayed and none save mr parr alone had been so liberal in his gifts holder invariably found it difficult to reconcile the unassuming man whose conversation was so commonplace with the titanic genius who had created fergusons nor indeed with the owner of the imposing marble mansion at number 5 park street  the rector occasionally dined there he had acquired a real affection for mrs ferguson who resembled a burgomasters wife in her evening gowns and jewels and whose simple social ambitions had been gratified beyond her dreams her heart had not shrunken in the process nor had she forgotten her somewhat heterogeneous acquaintances in the southern part of the city and it was true that when gertrude constable had nearly died of appendicitis it was on this ladys broad bosom that mrs constable had wept mrs ferguson had haunted the house regardless of criticism and actually quivering with sympathy her more important dinner parties might have been likened to illmatched foursinhand and holder had sometimes felt more of pity than of amusement as she sat with an expression of terror on her face helplessly watching certain unruly individuals taking their bits in their teeth and galloping madly downhill on one occasion when he sat beside her a young man who shall be nameless was suddenly heard to remark in the midst of an accidental lull  i never go to church whats the use im afraid most of us dont believe in hell any more  a silence followed of the sort that chills and the young man glancing down the long board at the clergyman became as red as the carnation in his buttonhole and in his extremity gulped down more champagne  things are in a dreadful state nowadays mrs ferguson gasped to a paralyzed company and turned an agonized face to holder im so sorry she said i dont know why i asked him tonight except that i have to have a young man for nan and hes just come to the city and i was sorry for him hes very promising in a business way hes in mr plimptons trust company  please dont let it trouble you holder turned and smiled a little and added whimsically we may as well face the truth  oh i should expect you to be good about it but it was unpardonable she cried  in the intervals when he gained her attention he strove by talking lightly of other things to take her mind off the incident but somehow it had left him strangely andhe feltdisproportionately depressedalthough he had believed himself capable of facing more or less philosophically that condition which the speaker had so frankly expressed yet the remark somehow had had an illuminating effect like a flashlight revealing to him the isolation of the church as never before and after dinner as they were going to the smokingroom the offender accosted him shamefacedly  im awfully sorry mr holder he stammered  that the tall rectors regard was kindly did not relieve his discomfort hodder laid a hand on his shoulder  dont worry about it he answered i have only one regret as to what you saidthat it is true  the other looked at him curiously  its mighty decent of you to take it this way he laid further speech failed him  he was a nicelooking young man with firm white teeth and honesty was written all over his boyish face and the palpable fact that his regret was more on the clergymans account than for the social faux pas drew holder the more since it bespoke a genuineness of character  he did not see the yearning in the rectors eyes as he turned away why was it they could not be standing side by side fighting the same fight the church had lost him and thousands like him and she needed them could not indeed do without them  where indeed were the young men they did not bother their heads about spiritual matters any more but were they not he asked himself franker than many of these others the socalled pillars of the spiritual structure  mr plimpton accosted him i congratulate you upon the new plans mr hoddertheyre great he said mr parr and our host are coming down handsomely eh when we get the new settlement house well have a plant as uptodate as any church in the country when do you break ground  not until autumn i believe hodder replied there are a good many details to decide upon yet  well i congratulate you  mr plimpton was forever congratulating  uptodateplant more illuminating words eloquent of mr plimptons ideals st johns down at the heels to be brought up to the state of efficiency of mr plimptons trust company it was by no means the first time he had heard modern attributes on mr plimptons lips applied to a sacred institution but tonight they had a profoundly disquieting effect tonight a certain clairvoyance had been vouchsafed him and he beheld these men his associates and supporters with a detachment never before achieved  they settled in groups about the room which was square and high and panelled in italian walnut with fluted pilastersthe capitals of which were elaborately carved and hodder found himself on a deep leather sofa in a corner engaged in a desultory and automatic conversation with everett constable mr plimpton with a large cigar between his lips was the radiating centre of one of the liveliest groups and of him the rector had fallen into a consideration piecing together bits of information that hitherto had floated meaninglessly in his mind it was mrs larrabbee who had given character to the career of the still comparatively youthful and unquestionably energetic president of the chamber of commerce by likening it to a great spiral starting somewhere in outer regions of twilight and gradually drawing nearer to the centre from which he had never taken his eyes at the centre were eldon parr and charlotte gore wallis plimpton had made himself indispensable to both  his campaign for the daughter of thurston gore had been comparable to one of the great sieges of history for mr plimpton was a laughingstock when he sat down before that fortress at the end of ten years charlotte had capitulated with a sigh of relief realizing at last her destiny she had become slightly stout revealing as time went on no wrinklesa proof that the union was founded on something more enduring than poetry statesmanshipthat was the secret step by step slowly but surely the memoranda in that matrimonial portfolio were growing into accomplished facts all events such as displacements of power were foreseen and the plimptons like bismarck had only to indicate in case of sudden news the pigeonhole where the plan of any particular campaign was filed  mrs larrabbees temptation to be witty at the expense of those for whom she had no liking had led hodder to discount the sketch he had not disliked mr plimpton who had done him many little kindnesses he was goodnatured never ruffled widely tolerant hailfellowwellmet with everybody and he had enlivened many a vestry meeting with his stories it were hypercritical to accuse him of a lack of originality and if by taking thought he had arrived from nowhere at his present position of ease and eminence success had not turned to ashes in his mouth he fairly exhaled wellbeing happiness and good cheer life had gone well with him he wished the same to others  but tonight from his corner hodder seemed to see mr plimpton with new eyes not that he stood revealed a villain which he was far from being it was the air of sophistication of goodnatured if cynical acceptance of things as they wereand plenty good enough toothat jarred upon the rector in his new mood and it was made manifest to him as never before why his appeals from the pulpit had lacked efficacy mr plimpton didnt want the world changed and in this desire he represented the men in that room and the majority of the congregation of st johns the rector had felt something of this before and it seemed to him astonishing that the revelation had not come to him sooner did any one of them in his heart care anything for the ideals and aspirations of the church  as he gazed at them through the gathering smoke they had become strangers receded all at once to a great distance across the room he caught the name bedloe hubbell pronounced with peculiar bitterness by mr ferguson at his side everett constable was alert listening  ten years ago said a stout mr varnum the president of the third national bank if youd told me that that man was to become a demagogue and a reformer i wouldnt have believed you why his company used to take rebates from the l  g and the southerni know it he emphasized the statement with a blow on the table that made the liqueur glasses dance and now with his municipal league hes going to clean up the city is he put in a reform mayor show up what he calls the consolidated tractions company scandal pooh  you got out all right varnum you wont be locked up said mr plimpton banteringly  so did you retorted varnum  so did ferguson so did constable  so did eldon parr remarked another man amidst a climax of laughter  langmaid handled that pretty well  hodder felt everett constable fidget  bedloes all right but hes a dreamer mr plimpton volunteered  then i wish hed stop dreaming said mr ferguson and there was more laughter although he had spoken savagely  thats what he is a dreamer varnum ejaculated say he told george carter the other day that prostitution wasnt necessary that in fifty years wed have largely done away with it think of that and its as old as sodom and gomorrah  if hubbell had his way hed make this town look like a connecticut hill villagehed drive all the prosperity out of it all the railroads would have to abandon their terminalsthered be no more traffic and youd have to walk across the bridge to get a drink  well said mr plimpton tom beattys good enough for me for a while  beatty hodder knew was the boss of the city with headquarters in a downtown saloon  beattys been maligned mr varnum declared i dont say hes a saint but hes run the town pretty well on the whole and kept the vice where it belongs out of sight hes made his pile but hes entitled to something we all are you always know where you stand with beatty but say if hubbell and his crowd  dont worry about bedloehell get called in hell come home to roost like the rest of them said mr plimpton cheerfully the people cant govern themselvesonly bedloe doesnt know it some day hell find it out  the french window beside him was open and hodder slipped out unnoticed into the warm night and stood staring at the darkness his one desire had been to get away out of hearing and he pressed forward over the tiled pavement until he stumbled against a stone balustrade that guarded a drop of five feet or so to the lawn below at the same time he heard his name called  is that you mr hodder  he started the voice had a wistful tremulousness and might almost have been the echo of the leaves stirring in the night air then he perceived in a shaft of light from one of the drawingroom windows near by a girl standing beside the balustrade and as she came towards him with tentative steps the light played conjurer catching the silvery gauze of her dress and striking an aura through the film of her hair  its nan ferguson she said  of course he exclaimed collecting himself how stupid of me not to have recognized you  im so glad you came out she went on impulsively yet shyly i wanted to tell you how sorry i was that that thing happened at the table  i like that young man he said  do you she exclaimed with unexpected gratitude so do i he really isntso bad as he must seem  im sure of it said the rector laughing  i was afraid youd think him wicked said nan he works awfully hard and hes sending a brother through college he isnt a bit likesome others i know he wants to make something of himself and i feel responsible because i had mother ask him tonight  he read her secret no doubt she meant him to do so  you know were going away next week for the summerthat is mother and i she continued father comes later and i do hope youll make us a visit mr hodderwe were disappointed you couldnt come last year nan hesitated and thrusting her hand into her gown drew forth an envelope and held it out to him i intended to give you this tonight to usefor anything you thought best  he took it gravely she looked up at him  it seems so littlesuch a selfish way of discharging ones obligations just to write out a cheque when there is so much trouble in the world that demands human kindness as well as material help i drove up dalton street yesterday from downtown you know how hot it was and i couldnt help thinking how terrible it is that we who have everything are so heedless of all that misery the thought of it took away all my pleasure  id do something more something personal if i could perhaps i shall be able to next winter why is it so difficult for all of us to know what to do  we have taken a step forward at any rate when we know that it is difficult he said  she gazed up at him fixedly her attention caught by an indefinable something in his voice in his smile that thrilled and vaguely disturbed her she remembered it long afterwards it suddenly made her shy again as if in faring forth into the darkness she had come to the threshold of a mystery of a revelation withheld and it brought back the sense of adventure of the palpitating fear and daring with which she had come to meet him  it is something to know she repeated half comprehending the scraping of chairs within alarmed her and she stood ready to fly  but i havent thanked you for this he said holding up the envelope it may be that i shall find some one in dalton street  oh i hope so she faltered breathlessly hesitating a moment and then she was gone into the house     volume 3     chapter ix the divine discontent  i  it was the last sunday in may and in another week the annual flight to the seashore and the mountains would have begun again the breezes stealing into the church through the open casements wafted hither and thither the odours of the chancel flowers and mingled with those fainter and subtler perfumes set free by the rustling of summer gowns  as on this day he surveyed his decorous and fashionable congregation hodder had something of that sense of extremity which the great apostle to the gentiles himself must have felt when he stood in the midst of the areopagus and made his vain yet sublime appeal to athenian indifference and luxury and the times of this ignorance god winked at but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent some indeed stirred uneasily as the rector paused lowering their eyes before the intensity of his glance vaguely realizing that the man had flung the whole passion of his being into the appeal  heedlessnessthat was gods accusation against them against the age materialism individualism so absorbed were they in the pursuit of wealth of distraction so satisfied with the current philosophy so intent on surrounding themselves with beautiful things and thus shutting out the sterner view that they had grown heedless of the divine message how few of them availed themselves of their spiritual birthright to renew their lives at the altar rail and they had permitted their own children to wander away repent  there was a note of desperation in his appeal like that of the hermit who stands on a mountain crag and warns the gay and thoughtless of the valley of the coming avalanche had they heard him at last there were a few moments of tense silence during which he stood gazing at them then he raised his arm in benediction gathered up his surplice descended the pulpit steps and crossed swiftly the chancel  he had as it were turned on all the power in a supreme effort to reach them what if he had failed again such was the misgiving that beset him after the service as he got out of his surplice communicated by some occult telepathy mr parr was awaiting him and summoning his courage hope battling against intuition he opened the door into the now empty church and made his way toward the porch where the sound of voices warned him that several persons were lingering the nature of their congratulations confirmed his doubts mrs plimpton resplendent and looking less robust than usual in one of her summer paris gowns greeted him effusively  oh mr hodder what a wonderful sermon she cried i cant express how it made me feelso delinquent of course that is exactly the effect you wished and i was just telling wallis i was so glad i waited until tuesday to go east or i should have missed it you surely must come on to hampton and visit us and preach it over again in our little stone church there by the sea goodby and dont forget ill write you setting the date only wed be glad to have you any time  one of the finest i ever heardif not the finest mr plimpton declared with a kind of serious empressement squeezing his hand  others stopped him everett constable for one and the austere mrs atterbury hodder would have avoided the ever familiar figure of her son gordon in the invariable black cutaway and checked trousers but he was standing beside mr parr  ahem why mr hodder he exclaimed squinting off his glasses that was a magnificent effort i was saying to mr parr that it isnt often one hears a sermon nowadays as able as that and as sound many clergymen refrain from preaching them i sometimes think because they are afraid people wont like them  i scarcely think its that the rector replied a little shortly were afraid people wont heed them  he became aware as he spoke of a tall young woman who had cast an enigmatic glance first at gordon atterbury and then at himself  it was a good sermon said mr parr youre coming to lunch hodder  the rector nodded im ready when you are he answered  the motors waiting said the banker leading the way down the steps to the sidewalk where he turned alison let me introduce mr hodder this is my daughter he added simply  this sudden disclosure of the young womans identity had upon hodder a certain electric effect and with it came a realization of the extent to whichfrom behind the scenes so to speakshe had gradually aroused him to a lively speculation she seemed to have influenced to a greater or less degree so many lives with which he had come into touch compelled persons to make up their minds about her and while he sympathized with eldon parr in his abandonment he had never achieved the full condemnation which he feltan impartial christian morality would have meted out  as he uttered the conventional phrase and took her hand he asked himself whether her personality justified his interest her glance at gordon atterbury in the midst of that gentlemans felicitations on the sermon had been expressive hodder thought of veiled amusement slightly tinctured with contempt and he hodder felt himself to have grown warm over it he could not be sure that alison parr had not included in her inner comment the sermon likewise on which he had so spent himself what was she doing at church as her eyes met his own he seemed to read a challenge he had never encountered a womanhe decidedwho so successfully concealed her thought and at the same time so incited curiosity about it  the effect of her reappearance on gordon atterbury was painfully apparent and mrs larrabbees remark that he had never got over it recurred to hodder he possessed the virtue of being faithful at least in spite of the ladys apostasy and he seemed to be galvanized into a tenfold nervousness as he hustled after them and handed her with the elaborate attention little men are apt to bestow upon women into the motor  erhow long shall you be here alison he asked i dont know she answered not unkindly but with a touch of indifference  you treat us shamefully he informed her upon my word but im coming to call  do said alison hodder caught her eye again and this time he was sure that she surprised in him a certain disdain of mr atterburys zeal her smile was faint yet unmistakable  he resented it indeed it was with a welldefined feeling of antagonism that he took his seat and this was enhanced as they flew westward mr parr wholly absorbed with the speaking trumpet energetically rebuking at every bounce in the back of the rectors mind lay a weight which he identified at intervals with what he was now convinced was the failure of his sermon alison took no part in the casual conversation that began when they reached the boulevard and mr parr abandoned the trumpet but lay back in silence and apparently with entire comfort in a corner of the limousine  at the lunchtable mr parr plunged into a discussion of some of the still undecided details of the new settlement house in which as the plan developed he had become more and more interested he had made himself responsible from time to time for additional sums until the original estimate had been almost doubled most of his suggestions had come from hodder who had mastered the subject with a thoroughness that appealed to the financier and he had gradually accepted the rectors idea of concentrating on the children thus he had purchased an adjoining piece of land that was to be a model playground in connection with the gymnasium and swimmingpool the hygienic department was to be all that modern science could desire  if we are going to do the thing the banker would remark we may as well do it thoroughly we may as well be leaders and not followers  so little by little the scheme had grown to proportions that sometimes appalled the rector when he realized how largely he had been responsible for the additionsin spite of the lukewarmness with which he had begun and yet it had occasionally been mr parr who with a sweep of his hand had added thousands to a particular feature thus the dancehall had become in prospect a huge sunparlour at the top of the building where the children were to have their kindergartens and games in winter and which might be shaded and opened up to the breezes in summer what had reconciled hodder to the enterprise most of all however was the chapelin the plan a beautiful gothic churchwhereby he hoped to make the religious progress keep pace with the social mr parr was decidedly in sympathy with this intention and referred to it now  i was much impressed by what you said in your sermon today as to the need of insisting upon authority in religious matters he declared and i quite agree that we should have a chapel of some size at the settlement house for that reason those people need spiritual control its what the age needs and when i think of some of the sermons printed in the newspapers today and which are served up as christianity there is only one term to apply to themthey are criminally incendiary  but isnt true christianity incendiary in your meaning of the word  it was alison who spoke in a quiet and musical voice that was in striking contrast to the tone of mr parr which the rector had thought unusually emphatic it was the first time she had shown an inclination to contribute to the talk but since hodder had sat down at the table her presence had disturbed him and he had never been wholly free from an uncomfortable sense that he was being measured and weighed  once or twice he had stolen a glance at her as she sat perfectly at ease and asked himself whether she had beauty and it dawned upon him little by little that the very proportion she possessed made for physical unobtrusiveness she was really very tall for a woman at first he would have said her nose was straight when he perceived that it had a delicate hidden curve her eyes were curiously set her dark hair parted in the middle brought down low on each side of the forehead and tied in a grecian knot thus in truth he observed were seemingly all the elements of the classic even to the firm yet slender column of the neck how had it eluded him  her remark if it astonished hodder had a dynamic effect on eldon parr and suddenly the rector comprehended that the banker had not so much been talking to him as through him had been as it were courting opposition  what do you mean by christianity being incendiary he demanded  incendiary from your point of viewi made the qualification alison replied apparently unmoved by his obvious irritation i dont pretend to be a christian as you know but if there is one element in christianity that distinguishes it it is the brotherhood of man thats pure nitroglycerin though its been mixed with so much sawdust incendiary is a mild epithet i never read the sermons you refer to i dare say theyre crude but theyre probably attempts to release an explosive which would blow your comfortable social system and its authority into atoms  hodder who had listened in amazement glanced at the banker he had never before heard him opposed or seen him really angry  ive heard that doctrine cried mr parr those who are dissatisfied with things as they are because they have been too stupid or too weak or selfindulgent to rise find it easy to twist the principles of christianity into revolutionary propaganda its a case of the devil quoting scripture the brotherhood of man there has never been an age when philanthropy and organized charity were on such a scale as today  a certain gallant indomitable ring crept into alisons voice she did not seem in the least dismayed or overborne  but isnt that just where most socalled christians make their mistake she asked philanthropy and organized charity as they exist today have very little to do with the brotherhood of man mightnt it be you who are fooling yourselves instead of the incendiaries fooling themselves so long as you can make yourselves believe that this kind of charity is a logical carrying out of the christian principles so long are your consciences satisfied with the social system which your class very naturally finds so comfortable and edifying the weak and idiotic ought to be absurdly grateful for what is flung to them and heaven is gained in the throwing in this way the rich inevitably become the elect both here and hereafter and the needles eye is widened into a gap  there was on mr parrs lips a smile not wholly pleasant to see indeed in the last few minutes there had been revealed to hodder a side of the bankers character which had escaped him in the two years of their acquaintance  i suppose said mr parr slowly drumming on the table you would say that of the new settlement house of st johns whereby we hope to raise a whole neighbourhood  yes i should replied alison with spirit the social system by which you thrive and which politically and financially you strive to maintain is diametrically opposed to your creed which is supposed to be the brotherhood of man but if that were really your creed you would work for it politically and financially you would see that your church is trying to do infinitesimally what the government but for your opposition might do universally your true creed is the survival of the fittest you grind these people down into what is really an economic slavery and dependence and then you insult and degrade them by inviting them to exercise and read books and sing hymns in your settlement house and give their children crackers and milk and kindergartens and sunlight i dont blame them for not becoming christians on that basis why the very day i left new york a man over eighty who had been swindled out of all he had rather than go to one of those christian institutions deliberately forged a check and demanded to be sent to the penitentiary he said he could live and die there with some selfrespect  i might have anticipated that you would ultimately become a socialist alison mr parr remarkedbut his voice trembled  i dont know whether im a socialist or an anarchist she answered hodder thought he detected a note of hopelessness in her voice and the spirit in it ebbed a little not only did she seem indifferent to her fathers feelingwhich incidentally added fuel to itbut her splendid disregard of him as a clergyman had made an oddly powerful appeal and her argument his feelings as he listened to this tremendous arraignment of eldon parr by his daughter are not easily to be described to say that she had compelled him the rector of st johns at last to look in the face many conditions which he had refused to recognize would be too definite a statement nevertheless some such thing had occurred refutations sprang to his lips and died there though he had no notion of uttering them he saw that to admit her contentions would be to behold crumble into ruins the structure that he had spent a life in rearing and yet something within him responded to her wordsthey had the passionate convincing ring of truth  by no means the least of their disturbing effects was due to the fact that they came as a climax to as a fulfilment of the revelation he had had at the fergusons when something of the true nature of mr plimpton and others of his congregation had suddenly been laid bare and now hodder looked at eldon parr to behold another man from the one he had known and in that moment realized that their relationship could never again be the same were his sympathies with the daughter  i dont know what i believe said alison after a pause ive ceased trying to find out whats the use she appeared now to be addressing no one in particular  a servant entered with a card and the bankers hand shook perceptibly as he put down his claret and adjusted his glasses  show him into my office upstairs and tell him ill see him at once he said and glanced at the rector but it was alison whom he addressed i must leave mr hodder to answer your arguments he added with an attempt at lightness and then to the rector perhaps you can convince her that the church is more sinned against than sinning and that christians are not such terrible monsters after all youll excuse me  certainly hodder had risen    ii  shall we have coffee in the garden alison asked its much nicer outside this time of year  for an instant he was at a loss to decide whether to accede or to make an excuse and leave the house wisdom seemed to point to flight but when he glanced at her he saw to his surprise that the mood of abstraction into which she had fallen still held her that the discussion which had aroused eldon parr to such dramatic anger had left her serious and thoughtful she betrayed no sense of triumph at having audaciously and successfully combated him and she appeared now only partially to be aware of hodders presence his interest his curiosity mounted suddenly again overwhelming once more the antagonism which he had felt come and go in waves and once more his attempted classification of her was swept away she had relapsed into an enigma  i like the open air he answered and i have always wished to see the garden i have admired it from the windows  its been on my mind for some years she replied as she led the way down a flight of steps into the vinecovered pergola and i intend to change parts of it while i am out here it was one of my first attempts and ive learned more since  you must forgive my ignorant praise he said and smiled i have always thought it beautiful but i can understand that an artist is never satisfied  she turned to him and suddenly their eyes met and held in a momentary electric intensity that left him warm and agitated there was nothing coquettish in the glance but it was the first distinct manifestation that he was of consequence she returned his smile without levity  is a clergyman ever satisfied she asked  he ought not to be replied hodder wondering whether she had read him  although you were so considerate i suppose you must have thought it presumptuous of me to criticize your profession which is religion  religion i think should be everybodys he answered quietly  she made no reply and he entered as into another world the circular arbour in which the pergola ended so complete in contrast was its atmosphere to that of the house the mansion he had long since grown to recognize as an expression of the personality of its owner but this classic bower was as remote from it as though it were in greece he was sensitive to beauty yet the beauty of the place had a perplexing quality which he felt in the perfect curves of the marble bench in the marble basin brimming to the tip with clear waterthe surface of which flecked with pink petals mirrored the azure sky through the leafy network of the roof in one green recess a slender mercury hastily adjusted his sandal  was this her art the true expression of her baffling personality as she had leaned back in the corner of the automobile she had given him the impression of a languor almost oriental but this had been startlingly dispelled at the lunchtable by the revelation of an animation and a vitality which had magically transformed her but now as under the spell of a new encompassment of her own weaving she seemed to revert to her former self sinking relaxed into a wicker lounge beside the basin one long and shapely hand in the water the other idle in her lap her eyes he remarked were the contradiction in her face had they been larger and almondshaped the illusion might have been complete they were neither opaque nor smoulderingbut western eyes ambercoloured with delicately stencilled rays and long lashes and as they gazed up at him now they seemed to reflect without disclosing the flitting thoughts behind them he felt antagonism and attraction in almost equal degreethe situation transcended his experience  you dont intend to change this he asked with an expressive sweep of his hand  no she said ive always liked it tell me what you feel about it  he hesitated  you resent it she declared  why do you say that he demanded quickly  i feel it she answered calmly but with a smile  resent would scarcely be the proper word he contended returning her smile yet hesitating again  you think it pagan she told him  perhaps i do he answered simply as though impressed by her felicitous discovery of the adjective  alison laughed  its pagan because im pagan i suppose  its very beautifulyou have managed to get an extraordinary atmosphere he continued bent on doing himself an exact justice but i should say if you pressed me that it represents to me the deification of beauty to the exclusion of all else you have made beauty the alpha and omega  there is nothing else for me she said  the coffeetray arrived and was deposited on a wicker table beside her she raised herself on an elbow filled his cup and handed it to him  and yet he persisted from the manner in which you spoke at the table  oh dont imagine i havent thought but thinking isntbelieving  no he admitted with a touch of sadness you are right there were certain comments you made on the christian religion  she interrupted him again  as to the political side of it which is socialism so far as i can see if there is any other side i have never been able to discover it it seems to me that if christians were logical they should be socialists the brotherhood of man cooperationall that is socialism isnt it its opposed to the principle of the survival of the fittest which so many of these socalled christians practise i used to think when i came back from paris that i was a socialist and i went to a lot of their meetings in new york and to lectures but after a while i saw there was something in socialism that didnt appeal to me something smotheringa forced cooperation that did not leave one free i wanted to be free ive been striving all my life to be free she exclaimed passionately and was silent an instant inspecting him perhaps i owe you an apology for speaking as i did before a clergymanespecially before an honest one  he passed over the qualification with a characteristic smile  oh if we are going to shut our ears to criticism wed better give up being clergymen he answered im afraid there is a great deal of truth in what you said  thats generous of you she exclaimed and thrilled him with the tribute nor was the tribute wholly in the words there had come spontaneously into her voice an exquisite modulated note that haunted him long after it had died away  i had to say what i thought she continued earnestly i stood it as long as i could perhaps you didnt realize it but my father was striking at me when he referred to your sermon and spiritual controland in other things he said when you were talking about the settlementhouse he reserves for himself the right to do as he pleases but insists that those who surround him shall adopt the subserviency which he thinks proper for the rest of the world if he were a christian himself i shouldnt mind it so much  hodder was silent the thought struck him with the force of a great wind  hes a pharisee alison went on following the train of her thought i remember the first time i discovered thatit was when i was reading the new testament carefully in the hope of finding something in christianity i might take hold of and i was impressed particularly by the scorn with which christ treated the pharisees my father too if he had lived in those days would have thought christ a seditious person an impractical fanatical idealist and would have tried to trip him up with literal questions concerning the law his real and primary interestis in a social system that benefits himself and his kind and because this is so he and men like him would have it appear that christianity is on the side of what they term law and order i do not say that they are hypocritical that they reason this out they are elemental and they feel intuitively that christianity contains a vital spark which if allowed to fly would start a conflagration beyond their control the theologians have helped them to cover the spark with ashes and naturally they wont allow the ashes to be touched if they can help it  she lay very still  the rector had listened to her at first with amazement then with more complicated sensations as she thus dispassionately discussed the foremost member of his congregation and the first layman of the diocese who was incidentally her own father in her masterly analysis of eldon parr she had brought hodder face to face with the naked truth and compelled him to recognize it how could he attempt to refute it with honesty  he remembered mr parrs criticism of alison there had been hardness in that though it were the cry of a lacerated paternal affection in that too a lack of comprehension an impotent anger at a visitation not understood a punishment apparently unmerited hodder had pitied him thenhe still pitied him in the daughters voice was no trace of resentment no one seemingly could be farther removed from him the rector of st johns in her opinions and views of life than allison parr and yet he felt in her an undercurrent deep and strong which moved him strangely strongly irresistibly he recognized a passionate desire for the truth and the courage to face it at any cost and a capacity for tenderness revealed in flashes  i have hurt you she exclaimed i am sorry  he collected himself  it is not you who have hurt me he replied reflections on the contradictions and imperfections of life are always painful and since i have been here i have seen a great deal of your father  you are fond of him  he hesitated it was not an ordinary conversation they were dealing with realities and he had a sense that vital issues were at stake he had in that moment to make a revaluation of his sentiments for the financierto weigh the effect of her indictment  yes he answered slowly i am fond of him he has shown me a side of himself perhaps that other men have not seenand he is very lonely  you pity him he started at her word i guessed that from an expression that crossed your face when we were at the table but surely you must have observed the incongruity of his relationship with your church surely in preaching as you did this morning against materialism individualism absorption in the pursuit of wealth you must have had my father in mind as the supreme example and yet he listened to you as serenely as though he had never practised any of these things  clergymen wonder why christianity doesnt make more progress today well what strikes the impartial observer who thinks about the subject at all as one reason is the paralyzing inconsistency of an alliance between those who preach the brotherhood of man and those who are opposed to it ive often wondered what clergymen would say about it if they were frankonly i never see any clergymen  he was strongly agitated he did not stopstrangely enoughto reflect how far they had gone to demand by what right she brought him to the bar challenged the consistency of his life for she had struck with a ruthless precision at the very core of his trouble revealed it for what it was  yes he said i can see how we may be accused of inconsistency and with much justice  his refusal to excuse and vindicate himself impressed her as no attempt at extenuation could have done perhaps in that moment her quick instinct divined something of his case something of the mental suffering he strove to conceal contrition shone in her eyes  i ought not to have said that she exclaimed gently it is so easy for outsiders to criticize those who are sincereand i am sure you are we cannot know all the perplexities but when we look at the church we are puzzled by thatwhich i have mentionedand by other things  what other things he demanded  she hesitated in her turn  i suppose you think it odd my having gone to church feeling as i do she said but st johns is now the only place vividly associated with my mother she was never at home here in this house i always go at least once when i am out here and i listened to your sermon intently  yes  i wanted to tell you this you interested me as i had not been interested since i was twenty when i made a desperate attempt to become a christianand failed do you know how you struck me it was as a man who actually had a great truth which he was desperately trying to impart and could not i have not been in a church more than a dozen times in the last eight years but you impressed me as a man who felt somethingwhatever it is  he did not speak  but why she cried do you insist on what you cell authority as a modern woman who has learned to use her own mind i simply cant believe if the god of the universe is the moral god you assert him to be that he has established on earth an agency of the kind you infer and delegated to it the power of life and death over human souls perhaps you do not go so far but if you make the claim at all you must make it in its entirety there is an idea of commercialism of monopoly in that conception which is utterly repugnant to any one who tries to approach the subject with a fresh mind and from an ideal point of view and religion must be idealismmustnt it  your ancient monks and saints werent satisfied until they had settled every detail of the invisible world of the past and future they mapped it out as if it were a region they had actually explored like geographers they used their reason and what science they had to make theories about it which the churches still proclaim as the catholic and final truth you forbid us to use our reason you declare in order to become christians that we have to accept authoritative statements oh cant you see that an authoritative statement is just what an ethical person doesnt want belieffaith doesnt consist in the mere acceptance of a statement but in something much higherif we can achieve it acceptance of authority is not faith it is mere credulity it is to shirk the real issue we must believe if we believe at all without authority if we knew there would be no virtue in striving if i choose a god she added after a pause i cannot take a consensus of opinion about himhe must be my god  hodder did not speak immediately strange as it may seem he had never heard the argument and the strength of it reenforced by the extraordinary vitality and earnestness of the woman who had uttered it had a momentary stunning effect he sat contemplating her as she lay back among the cushions and suddenly he seemed to see in her the rebellious child of which her father had spoken no wonder eldon parr had misunderstood her had sought to crush her spirit she was to be dealt with in no common way nor was the consuming yearning he discerned in her to be lightly satisfied  the god of the individualist he said at lengthmusingly not accusingly  i am an individualist she admitted simply but i am at least logical in that philosophy and the individualists who attend the churches today are not the inconsistency of their lives is what makes those of us who do not go to church doubt the efficacy of their creed which seems to have no power to change them the majority of people in st johns are no more christians than i am they attend service once a week and the rest of the time they are bent upon getting all they can of pleasure and profit for themselves do you wonder that those who consider this spectacle come inevitably to the conclusion that either christianity is at fault is outworn or else that it is presented in the wrong way  the rector rose abruptly walked to the entrance of the arbour and stood staring out across the garden presently he turned and came back and stood over her  since you ask me he said slowly i do not wonder at it  she raised her eyes swiftly  when you speak like that she exclaimed with an enthusiasm that stirred him despite the trouble of his mind i cannot think of you as a clergymanbut as a man indeed she added in the surprise of her discovery i have never thought of you as a clergymaneven when i first saw you this morning i could not account then for a sense of duality about you that puzzled me do you always preach as earnestly as that  why  i felt as if you were throwing your whole soul into the effortoh i felt it distinctly you made some of them temporarily a little uncomfortable but they do not understand you and you didnt change them it seemed to me you realized this when gordon atterbury spoke to you i tried to analyze the effect on myselfif it had been in the slightest degree possible for my reason to accept what you said you might through sheer personality have compelled me to reconsider as it was i found myself resisting you  with his hands clasped behind him he paced across the arbour and back again  have you ever definitely and sincerely tried to put what the church teaches into practice he asked  orthodox christianity penance asceticism selfabnegationrepressionfalling on my knees and seeking a forgiveness out of all proportion to the trespass and filled with a sense of total depravity if i did that i should lose myselfthe only valuable thing ive got  hodder who had resumed his pacing glanced at her involuntarily and fought an inclination to agree with her  i see no one upon whom i can rely but myself she went on with the extraordinary energy she was able to summon at will and i am convinced that selfsacrificeat least indiscriminate unreasoning selfsacrificeis worse than useless and to teach it is criminal ignorance none of the socalled christian virtues appeals to me i hate humility you havent it the only happiness i can see in the world lies in selfexpression and i certainly shouldnt find that in sewing garments for the poor  the last thing that i could wish for would be immortality as orthodox christianity depicts it and suppose i had followed the advice of my christian friends and remained here where they insisted my duty was what would have happened to me in a senseless selfdenial i should gradually have withered into a meaningless old maid with no opinions of my own and no more definite purpose in life than to write checks for charities your christianity commands that women shall stay at home and declares that they are not entitled to seek their own salvation to have any place in affairs or to meddle with the realm of the intellect those forbidden gardens are reserved for the lordly sex st paul you say put us in our proper place some twenty centuries ago and we are to remain there for all time  he felt sweeping through him the reverse current of hostility  and what i preach he asked has tended to confirm you in such a mean conception of christianity  her eye travelled over the six feet of himthe kindling reflecting eye of the artist it rested for a moment on the protesting locks of his hair which apparently could not be cut short enough to conform on the hands which were strong and sinewy on the wide tolerant mouth with its rugged furrows on the breadth and height of the forehead she lay for a moment inert considering  what you preachyes she answered bravely meeting his look what you areno you and your religion are as far apart as the poles oh this old argument the belief that has been handed down to the man the authority with which he is clothed and not the man himself how can one be a factor in life unless one represents something which is the fruit of actual personal experience your authority is for the weak the timid the credulousfor those who do not care to trust themselves who run for shelter from the storms of life to a papiermache fortress made to look like rock in order to preach that logically you should be a white ascetic with a welloiled manner a downcast look lest you stumble in your pride lest by chance you might do something original that sprang out of your own soul instead of being an imitation of the saints and if your congregation took your doctrine literally i can see a whole army of white meek christians but you are not like that cant you see it for yourself she exclaimed  cant you feel that you are an individual a personality a force that might be put to great uses that will be because you are openminded because there is room in you for growth and change  he strove with all his might to quell the inner conflagration which she had fanned into leaping flames though he had listened before to doubt and criticism this woman with her strange shifting moods of calm and passion with her bewildering faculty of changing from passive to active resistance her beauty once manifest never to be forgotten her unique individuality that now attracted now repelled seemed for the moment the very incarnation of the forces opposed to him and his religion holder as he looked at her had a flash of fierce resentment that now of all times she should suddenly have flung herself across his path for she was to be reckoned with why did he not tell her she was an egoist why didnt he speak out defend his faith denounce her views as prejudiced and false  have i made you angry he heard her say i am sorry  it was the hint of reproach in her tone to which the man in him instantly responded and what he saw now was his portrait she had painted the thought came to him was he indeed greater more vital than the religion he professed god forbid did he ring true and it false  she returned his gaze and gradually under her clear olive skin he saw the crimson colour mounting higher she put forth her hand simply naturally and pressed his own as though they had been friends for a lifetime     chapter x the messenger in the church   i  the annual scourge of summer had descended pitilessly upon the city once more enervating depressing stagnating and people moved languidly in the penetrating heat that steamed from the pores of the surrounding river bottoms  the rector of st johns realized that a crisis had come in his lifea crisis he had tried to stave off in vain and yet there was a period during which he pursued his shrunken duties as though nothing had happened to him as a man who has been struck in battle keeps on loath to examine to acknowledge the gravity of his wound fearing to perhaps sometimes as his mind went back to the merciless conflict of his past his experience at the law school it was the unchaining of that other man he dreaded the man he believed himself to have finally subdued but night and day he was haunted by the sorrowful and reproachful face of truth  had he the courage now to submit the beliefs which had sustained him all these years to truths inexorable inspection did he dare to turn and open those books which she had inspiredthe new philosophies the historical criticisms which he had neglected and condemned which he had flattered himself he could do withoutand read of the fruit of knowledge twice thrice he had hesitated on the steps of the big library and turned away with a wildly beating heart  day by day the storm increased until from a cloud on the horizon it grew into a soulshaking tempest profoundly moved parrs he had been on that sunday afternoon in eldon parrs garden he had resolutely resolved to thrust the woman and the incident from his mind to defer the consideration of the questions she had raisedgrave though they wereto a calmer period for now he was unable to separate her to eliminate the emotionhe was forced to acknowledgethe thought of her aroused from the problems themselves who was she at moments he seemed to see her shining accusing as truth herself and again as a circe who had drawn him by subtle arts from his wanderings luring him to his death or at other times as the mutinous daughter of revolt but when he felt in memory the warm touch of her hand the old wildness of his nature responded he ceased to speculate or care and he longed only to crush and subdue her by the brute power of the man in him for good or bad she had woven her spell  here was the old elemental twofold contest carnal and spiritual thoroughly revived  he recalled in his musings the little theological school surrounded by southern woods and fields where he had sometime walked under autumn foliage with the elderly gentleman who had had such an influence on his lifethe dean mildmannered and frail patient in ordinary conversea lion for the faith he would have died for it as cheerfully as any martyr in history by the marvels of that faith holder had beheld from his pew in the chapel the little man transformed he knew young men their perplexities and temptations and he dealt with them personally like a father holders doubts were stilled he had gained power of his temptations and peace for his soul and he had gone forth inspired by the reminder that there was no student of whom the dean expected better things where now were the thousands of which he had dreamed and which he was to have brought into the church  now he asked himself was it the dean or the deans theology through which his regeneration had come might not the inherent goodness of the dean be one thing and his theology quite another personality again he recalled one of the many things which alison parr had branded on his memorythe belief the authority in which the man is clothed and not the man the deans god had remained silent on the subject of personality or at the best he had not encouraged it and there werehodder could not but perceivecertain contradictions in his character which were an anomalistic blending of that of the jealous god of moses and of the god of christ there must be continuitygod could not change therefore the god of infinite love must retain the wrath which visited sins of the fathers on the children which demanded sacrifice atonementan exact propitiation for his anger against mankind an innocent life of sorrow and suffering  and again you and your religion are as far apart as the poles had he hodder outgrown the deans religion or had it ever been his own was there after all such a thing as religion might it not be merely a figment of the fertile imagination of man he did not escape the terror of this thought when he paused to consider his labour of the past two years and the vanity of its results and little by little the feeling grew upon him such being the state of his mind that he ought not to continue for the present at least to conduct the services should he resign or go away for a while to some quiet place before he made such a momentous decision there was no one to whom he could turn no layman and no clergyman not even the old bishop whom he had more than once mentally accused of being too broad and too tolerant no he did not wish a clergymans solution the significance of this thought flashed through himthat the world itself was no longer seeking clergymens solutions he must go off alone and submit his faith to the impartial test  it was in a vigil of the night when he lay in the hot darkness unable to sleep that he came at length to this resolve and now that he had cut the knot he was too just to blame alison parr for having pointed outwith what often had seemed a pitiless crueltysomething of which he had had a constantly growing perception yet had continually sought to evade and he reviewed as the church bells recorded the silent hours how little by little his confidence had crumbled before the shocks of the successive revelationssome of them so slight that they had passed unnoticed comparisons inevitably compelled dalton street the confessions of eleanor goodrich and mrs constable mr plimpton and his views of lifeeldon parr even the slamming of the carriage doors in burton street had had a significance  might it not prove that this woman had let fall into the turbid waters of his soul the drop that was to clear them forever he would go away he would not see her again  over the sleeping city unapprehended stole the dawn  he arose but instead of falling on his knees he went to the window and lifted his face to the whitening sky slowly out of the obscurity of the earths shadow emerged the vague outlines of familiar things until they stood sharply material in a silence as of death a sparrow twittered and suddenly the familiar sootgrimed roofs were bathed in light and by a touch made beautiful  some hours later the city was wide awake and hodder bathed and dressed stood staring down from his study window into the street below full now of young men and girls some with set faces hurrying intent others romping and laughing as they dodged the trucks and trolley cars all on their way to the great shoe factory around the corner the huge funnels of which were belching forth smoke into the morning air the street emptied a bell rang a whistle blew the hum of distant machinery began    ii  later that morning hodder sat in his study the shutters were closed and the intensity of the tropical glare without was softened and diffused by the slanting green slats his eye wandered over the long and comfortable room which had been his sanctuary in the feverish days of his ministry resting affectionately on the hospitable chairs the wide fireplace before which he had been wont to settle himself on winter nights and even on the green mattinga cooling note in summer and there in the low cases along the walls were the rows of his precious bookshis one hobby and extravagance he had grown to love the room would he ever come back to it  a step sounded in the hall a knock and the wellknown gaunt form and spectacled face of mccrae appeared in the doorway  ye wished to see me he asked  mccrae said the rector i am going off for a while  his assistant regarded him a moment in silence although hodder had no intention of explaining his reasons he had a curious conviction that it were superfluous to do so that mccrae had guessed them  why shouldnt ye theres but a handful left to preach to in this weather  i wouldnt go in this sudden way if it were not imperative hodder added trying to speak calmly  why shouldnt ye mccrae repeated almost fiercely  hodder smiled in spite of himself  theres no reason he said except the added work put on you without warning and in this heat  yell not need to worry his assistant assured him the heats nothing to me mccrae hesitated and then demanded abruptly yell not be visiting  the question took hodder by surprise  no he answered quickly and not quite steadily and hesitated in his turn i shant be visiting  its a rest ye need ive been wanting to say it mccrae took a step forward and for a moment it seemed as though he were at last about to break the bonds of his reserve perhaps he detected an instinctive shrinking on the rectors part at any rate there was another instant of silence in which the two men faced each other across the desk and mccrae held out his hand good luck to ye he said as hodder took it and dont have the pariah on your mind stay till yere rested and come back to us  he left the room abruptly hodder remained motionless looking after him and then moved apparently by a sudden impulse started toward the dooronly to halt and turn before he got to it almost he had opened his lips to call his assistant back he could not do itthe moment had come and fled when it might have been possible did this man hide under his brusqueness and brevity of speech the fund of wisdom and the wider sympathy and understanding he suspected hodder could have vouched for it and yet he had kept his own counsel and he was struck suddenly by the significance of the fact often remarked that mccrae in his brief and commonsense and by no means enlivening sermons had never once referred in any way to doctrine or dogma  he spent half an hour in collecting and bestowing in two large valises such articles as his simple needs would demand and then set out for a railroad office in the business portion of the city where he bought his ticket and berth then after a moment of irresolution on the threshold of the place he turned to the right thrusting his way through the sluggish crowds on tower street until he came to the large bookstore where he had been want to spend from time to time some of his leisure moments a clerk recognized him and was about to lead the way to the rear where the precious editions were kept when hodder stopped him  in casting about for a beginning in his venture over unknown seas there had naturally come into his mind three or four works which were anathema to the orthodox one of which in seven volumes went back to his seminary days and had been the subject of a ringing denunciatory sermon by the dean himself three of them were by germans of established reputations another by a professor of the university of paris the habit of years is strong  and though he knew that many clergymen read these books hodder found it impossible to overcome a nervous sense of adventurenay knowing his resolution of apostasy almost of clandestine guilt when he mentioned them and it seemed to him that the face of the clerk betrayed surprise one of the works was not in stock he would send the others that afternoon mr hodder would take them they made a formidable parcel but a little handle was supplied and the rector hurried out swinging himself on a tower street car  it must not be thought that the whole of what is called modern criticism was new to hodder this would indeed be too much of a reflection on the openmindedness of the seminary from which he had graduated but he found himself now pondering a little cynically on that openmindedness on that concessionif it had been a concessionto the methods of science there had been in truth a course of lectures on this subject but he saw now very clearly what a concerted effort had been put forward in the rest of the teaching to minimize and discredit it even the professor who gave the lectures had had the air of deploring them here it is but on the whole one would better let it alonesuch was the inference and he had let it alone through all these years  in the seminary too volumes by semilearned clergymen had been thrust into his hands efforts which hodder recalled now in spite of his mental state with a smile these invariably championed the doctrine of the virgin birth as the pillar on which the incarnation depended a favourite argument declared that although the gospel texts in regard to it might be proven untrustworthy the miraculous birth must have happened anyway and one of these clerical authors whom he had more recently read actually had had the audacity to turn the weapons of the archenemy science back upon itself the virgin birth was an established fact in nature and had its place in the social economy of the bee and did not parthenogenesis occur in the silk moth  in brief the conclusion impressed upon him by his seminary instruction was this that historical criticism had corrected some ideas and put some things in their right place what these things were remained sufficiently vague but whenever it attacked a cherished dogma it was on general principles wrong  once again in his cool study he cut the cord with a trembling hand and while he was eating the lunch his housekeeper had prepared dipped into one of the larger volumes as he read again the critical disproofs he felt an acute almost physical pain as though a vital part of him were being cut away as his mind dwelt upon those beautiful legends to which he had so often turned and which had seemed the very fountain of his faith legends  he closed the book the clock on the mantel struck three his train was to leave at five he rose and went down into the silent church he had grown to love seating himself in one of the carved stalls of the choir his eye lingering in turn on each beautiful object on the glowing landscape in the window in memory of eliza parr portraying the delectable country with the bewildered yet enraptured faces of the pilgrims in the foreground on the graceful shining lectern the aspiring arches the carved marble altar behind the rail and above it the painting of the christ on the cross  the hours of greatest suffering are the empty hours eloi eloi lama sabachthani the hours when the mysterious sustaining and driving force is withdrawn and a lassitude and despair comes over us like that of a deserted child the hours when we feel we have reached the limit of service when our brief span of usefulness is done had god brought him john hodder to the height of the powers of his manhood only to abandon him to cast him adrift on the face of the watersled him to this great parish with all its opportunities only that he might fail and flee  he sat staring at the face of the man on the cross did he in his overwrought state imagine there an expression he had never before remarked or had the unknown artist of the seventies actually risen above the mediocrity of the figure in his portrayal of the features of the christ the rector started and stared again there was no weakness in the face no meekness no suggestion of the conception of the sacrificed lamb no hint of a beatific vision of opening heavensand yet no accusation no despair a knowingthat were nearera knowing of all things through the experiencing of all things the suffering of all things for suffering without revelation were vain indeed a perfected wisdom that blended inevitably with a transcendent love love and wisdom were one then to reach comprehension through conquering experience was to achieve the love that could exclaim they know not what they do  human or divine man or god hodder found himself inwardly repeating the words the controversy which had raged for nineteen hundred years and not yet was stilled perfection is divine human hodder repeated the word as one groping on the threshold of a great discovery    iii  he was listeninghe had for a long time been listening to a sound which had seemed only the natural accompaniment of the drama taking place in his soul as though some inspired organist were expressing in exquisite music the undercurrent of his agony only gradually did he become aware that it arose from the nave of the church and turning his eyes fell upon the bowed head and shoulders of a woman kneeling in one of the pews she was sobbing  his movement he recalled afterward did not come of a conscious volition as he rose and descended the chancel steps and walked toward her he stood for what seemed a long time on the white marble of the aisle looking down on her his heart wrung by the violence of her grief which at moments swept through her like a tempest she seemed still young but poverty had marked her with unmistakable signs the white blueveined hands that clung to the railing of the pew were thin and the shirtwaist though clean was cheap and frayed at last she rose from her knees and raised a tearstained face to his staring at him in a dumb bewilderment  can i do anything for you he said gently i am the rector here she did not answer but continued to stare uncomprehendingly he sat down beside her in the pew  you are in trouble he said will you let me try to help you a sob shook herthe beginning of a new paroxysm he waited patiently until it was over suddenly she got rather wildly and unsteadily to her feet  i must go she cried oh god what would i do ifif he wasnt there  hodder rose too she had thrust herself past him into the aisle but if he had not taken her arm she would have fallen thus they went together to the door of the church and out into the white burning sunlight in spite of her weakness she seemed actually to be leading him impelled by a strange force and fled down the steps of the porch to the sidewalk and there she paused seeing him still beside her fortunately he had his hat in his hand  where are you going she asked  to take you home he replied firmly you ought not to go alone  a look of something like terror came into her eyes  oh no she protested with a vehemence that surprised him i am strong oh thank you sirbut i can go alone its dickymy little boy ive never left him so long i had gone for the medicine and i saw the church i used to go to church sir before we had our troublesand i just went in it suddenly came over me that god might help methe doctor can do nothing  i will go with you he said  she ceased to resist as one submitting to the fatality of a superior will  the pavements that afternoon as hodder and the forlorn woman left the cool porticoes of st johns were like the floor of a stone oven and the work horses wore little bonnets over their heads keeping to the shady side the rector and his companion crossed tower street with its trolley cars and its awninged stores and came to that depressing district which had reproached him since the first sunday of his ministry when he had traversed it with eldon parr they passed the once prosperous houses the corner saloons pandering to two vices decked with the flamboyant signs of the breweries the trees were dying along the asphalt and in the yards the iron fences broken here and there the copings stained with rust and soot hodders thoughts might have been likened to the heated air that simmered above the bricks  they were in dalton street she seemed to have forgotten his presence her pace quickened as she turned into a gate and flew up a flight of dirty stone steps broken and sagging hodder took in subconsciously that the house was a dingy grey of three stories and a mansard roof with a bay window on the yard side and a flyblown sign rooms to rent hanging in one window across the street on a lot that had once held a similar dignified residence was the yellow brick building of the albert hotel and next door on the east a remodelled house of apartments with speaking tubes in the doorway  the woman led him up another flight of steps to the open door of the house through a hallway covered with a ragged carpet where a dilapidated walnut hatrack stood up the stairs threading a dark passage that led into a lowceiled stifling room at the very back a stout slatternly person in a wrapper rose as they entered but the mother cast herself down beside the lounge where the child was hodder had a moment of fear that she was indeed too late so still the boy lay so pathetically wan was the little face and wasted the form under the cotton nightgown the mother passed her hand across his forehead  dicky she whispered fearfully dicky  he opened his eyes and smiled at her feebly  the stout woman who had been looking on with that intensity of sympathy of which the poor are capable began waving gently the palmleaf fan she was german  he is so good is dicky he smile at me when i fan himonce twice he complains not at all  the mother took the fan from her hand  thank you for staying with him mrs breitmann i was gone longer than i expected the fact that the child still lived that she was again in his presence the absorbing act of caring for him seemed to have calmed her  it is nothing what i do answered mrs breitmann and turned away reluctantly the tears running on her cheeks when you go again i come always mrs garvin ach  her exclamation was caused by the sight of the tall figure and black coat of the rector and as she left the room mrs garvin turned and he noticed in her eyes the same expression of dread they had held when she had protested against his coming  please dont think that im not thankful she faltered  i am not offering you charity he said can you not take from other human beings what you have accepted from this woman who has just left  oh sir it isnt that she cried with a look of trust of appeal that was new i would do anythingi will do anything but my husbandhe is so bitter against the church against ministers if he came home and found you here  i knowmany people feel that way he assented too many but you cannot let a prejudice stand in the way of saving the boys life mrs garvin  it is more than that if you knew sir  whatever it is he interrupted a little sternly it must not interfere i will talk to your husband  she was silent gazing at him now questioningly yet with the dawning hope of one whose strength is all but gone and who has found at last a stronger to lean upon  the rector took the fan from her arrested hand and began to ply it  listen mrs garvin if you had come to the church half an hour later i should have been leaving the city for a place far distant  you were going away you stayed on my account  i much prefer to stay if i can be of any use and i think i can i am sure i can what is the matter with the child  i dont know sirhe just lies there listless and gets thinner and thinner and weaker and weaker sometimes he feels sick but not often the doctor dont seem to know  what doctor have you  his name is welling hes around the corner  exactly said the rector this is a case for dr jarvis who is the best child specialist in the city he is a friend of mine and i intend to send for him at once and the boy must go to a hospital  oh i couldnt sir  he had a poignant realization of the agony behind the cry she breathed quickly through her parted lips and from the yearning in her tired eyesas she gazed at the poor little formhe averted his glance  now mrs garvin you must be sensible he said this is no place for a sick child and it is such a nice little hospital the one i have in mind and so many children get well and strong there he added cheerfully  he wouldnt hear of it hodder comprehended that she was referring to her husband she added inconsequently if i let him go and he never came back oh i couldnt do iti couldnt  he saw that it was the part of wisdom not to press her to give her time to become accustomed to the idea come backto what his eye wandered about the room that bespoke the last shifts of poverty for he knew that none but the desperate were driven to these dalton street houses once the dwellings of the welltodo and all the more pitiful for the contrast the heated air reeked with the smell of stale cooking there was a gas stove at one side a linoleumcovered table in the centre littered with bottles plates and pitchers a bed and chairs which had known better days new obviously bruised and battered by many enforced movings in one corner was huddled a little group of toys  he was suddenly and guiltily aware that the woman had followed his glance  we had them in alder street she said we might have been there yet if we hadnt been foolish its a pretty street sirperhaps you know ityou take the fanshawe avenue cars to sherman heights the air is like the country there and all the houses are new and dicky had a yard to play in and he used to be so healthy and happy in it we were rich thennot what youd call rich she added apologetically but we owned a little home with six rooms and my husband had a good place as bookkeeper in a grocery house and every year for ten years we put something by and the boy came we never knew how well off we were until it was taken away from us i guess and then richardhes my husbandput his savings into a companyhe thought it was so safe and we were to get eight per centand the company failed and he fell sick and lost his place and we had to sell the house and since he got well again hes been going around trying for something else oh hes tried so hardevery day and all day long you wouldnt believe it sir and hes so proud he got a job as porter but he wasnt able to hold ithe wasnt strong enough that was in april it almost broke my heart to see him getting shabbyhe used to look so tidy and folks dont want you when youre shabby  there sprang to hodders mind a sentence in a book he had recently read our slums became filled with sick who need never have been sick with derelicts who need never have been abandoned  suddenly out of the suffocating stillness of the afternoon a womans voice was heard singing a concerthall air accompanied by a piano played with vigour and abandon and hodder following the sound looked out across the grimy yardto a window in the apartment house opposite  theres that girl again said the mother lifting her head she does sing nice and play poor thing there was a time when i wouldnt have wanted to listen but dicky liked it so its the very tune he loved he dont seem to hear it now he dont even ask for mr bentley any more  mr bentley the rector repeated the name was somehow familiar to him  the piano and the song ceased abruptly with a bang  he lives up the street here a waythe kindest old gentleman you ever saw he always has candy in his pockets for the children and its a sight to see them follow him up and down the sidewalk he takes them to the park in the cars on saturday afternoons that was all dicky could think about at firstwould he be well enough to go with mr bentley by saturday and he was forever asking me to tell mr bentley he was sick i saw the old gentleman on the street today and i almost went up to him but i hadnt the courage  the child moaned stirred and opened his eyes gazing at them feverishly yet without seeming comprehension she bent over him calling his name hodder thrust the fan into her hand and rose  i am going to telephone dr jarvis he said and then i shall come back in order to be here when he arrives  she looked up at him  oh thank you siri guess its for the best  her voice died away and the rector seeking for the cause saw that a man had entered the room he walked up to the couch and stood for a moment staring moodily at the child while the woman watched him transfixed  richard she said  he paid no attention to her she turned to hodder this is my husband sir richard i went into the churchjust for a momentii couldnt help it and this gentlemanthe ministercame home with me he wanted tohe thought i was sick and now hes going out to get the best doctor in the city for dicky  the man turned suddenly and confronted the rector  why dont you let him die you and your church people he asked youve done your worst to kill him  the woman put her hand fearfully imploringly on the mans arm  richard she whispered  but as hodder glanced from the derelict beside him a wave of comprehension passed through him that swept him clean of indignation of resentment and this man had been prosperous and happy  there is but one way to save the boys life mr garvin he said and that is to put him in charge of dr jarvis  the man made no reply but went over to the window staring out into the yard there was something vaguely ominous in his attitude the rector watched him a moment and then turned to the mother  you must not lose hope he told her  she looked at him with terrorstricken eyes that sought to be grateful he had picked up his hat from a corner of the littered table and started to leave when garvin by a sudden movement planted himself in the doorway whether he had been drinking or whether he were merely crazed by misfortune and the hopeless search in the heat for employment and by lack of proper nourishment hodder could not say there was a light in his eyes like that in a wounded animals and although he was thin and slight he had the concentrated power of desperation  say what church do you come from he demanded  from st johns said the rector  eldon parrs church  hodder started in spite of himself at the name  mr parr is a member of the congregation  come off he owns it and runs it the same as he does everything else in this town maybe you dont think i read the sunday papers say i was respectable once and had a good place you wouldnt believe it would you  hodder hesitated there was obviously no way to pass the man except by using physical force  if you have anything to say to me mr garvin i shall be glad to talk to you later you must not stop me now he said with a touch of severity  youll listen to me right here and now cried garvin if you think i am going to let eldon parrs minister or any one else belonging to him save that boys life youve got another guess comin thats all id rather have him diedye hear id rather have him die  the woman behind them whimpered the name was ringing like a knell in hodders headeldon parr coming as it had like a curse from the lips of this wretched halfdemented creature it filled his soul with dismay and the accusation had in it the profound ring of truth he was eldon parrs minister and it was eldon parr who stood between him and his opportunity  why do you speak of mr parr he asked though the question cost him a supreme effort  why do i speak of him my god because he ruined me if it hadnt been for him damn him id have a home and health and happiness today and the boy would be well and strong instead of lying there with the life all but gone out of him eldon parr did for me and now hes murdered my sonthats why i mention him  in the sudden intensity of his feeling hodder seized garvin by the armsarms that were little more than skin and bone the man might be crazed he might be drunk that he believed what he was saying there could be no question he began to struggle violently but the rector was strong  be still he commanded and suddenly overcome less by the physical power than by the aspect of the clergyman an expression of bewilderment came into his eyes and he was quiet hodder dropped his arms i do not intend to go until i hear what you have to say it would be useless at any rate since your childs life is at stake tell me how mr parr has ruined you  garvin stared at him half in suspicion half in amazement  i guess you never knew of his ruining anybody did you he demanded sullenly well ill tell you all right and you can go and tell him he wont care muchhes used to it by this time and he gets square with god by his churches and charities did you ever hear of a stock called consolidated tractions  consolidated tractions in contrast to the sordid misery and degradation of this last refuge of the desperate hodder saw the lofty panelled smoking room at francis fergusons and was listening again to wallis plimptons cynical amusement as to how he and everett constable and eldon parr himself had gat out before the crash got out with all the money of the wretch who now stood before him his parishioners his christians oh god  the man was speaking in his shrill voice  well i was a traction sucker all right and i guess you wouldnt have to walk more than two blocks to find another in this neighbourhood you think eldon parrs a big noble man dont you youre proud to run his church aint you you wouldnt believe there was a time when i thought he was a big man when i was kind of proud to live in the same city with him shell tell you how i used to come home from the store and talk about him after supper and hope that the kid there would grow up into a financier like eldon parr the boys at the store talked about him he sort of laid hold on our imaginations with the library he gave and elmwood park and the picture of the big organ in your church in the newspapersand sometimes mary and me and the boy in the baby carriage on sunday afternoons we used to walk around by his house just to look at it you couldnt have got me to believe that eldon parr would put his name to anything that wasnt straight  then consolidated tractions came along with parrs name behind it everybody was talking about it and how it was payin eight per cent from the start and extra dividends and all and what a marvel of finance it was before the kid came as soon as i married her we began to save up for him we didnt go to the theatres or nothing well i put it all five thousand dollars into consolidated shell tell you how we sat up half the night after we got the first dividend talking about how wed send the kid to college and after we went to bed we couldnt sleep it wasnt more than a year after that we began to hear thingsand we couldnt sleep for sure and the dividends stopped and the stock tumbled even then i wouldnt believe it of him that hed take poor peoples money that way when he had more than he knew what to do with i made up my mind if i went down to see him and told him about it hed make it right i asked the boss for an hour off and headed for the parr buildingive been there as much as fifty times sincebut he dont bother with small fry the clerks laugh when they see me comin i got sick worryin and when i was strong enough to be around theyd filled my job at the grocery and it wasnt long before we had to move out of our little home in alder street weve been movin ever since he cried and tears of weakness were in his eyes until weve come to this and well have to get out of here in another week god knows where well go then  hodder shuddered  then i found out how he done itfrom a lawyer the lawyer laughed at me too say do you wonder i aint got much use for your church people parr got a corporation lawyer named langmaidhes another one of your millionnaire crooksto fix it up and get around the law and keep him out of jail and then they had to settle with tim beatty for something like three hundred thousand you know who beatty ishe owns this cityhis saloons around here on elm street all the crooks had to be squared say he demanded aggressively are parr and langmaid any better than beatty or any of the holdup men beatty covers theres a streetwalker over there in those flats thats got a million times more chance to get to heavenif there is anythan those financiers as they call emselvesi aint much on high finance but ive got some respect for a second story man nowhe takes some risks ill tell you what they did they bought up the short car lines that didnt pay and sold em to themselves for fifty times as much as they were worth and they got controlling interests in the big lines and leased em to themselves with dividends guaranteed as high as eighteen per cent they capitalized the consolidated for more millions than a little man like me can think of and we handed em our money because we thought they were honest we thought the men who listed the stock on the exchange were honest and when the crash came theyd got away with the swag like any common housebreakers there were dummy directors and a dummy president eldon parr didnt have a sharesold out everything when she went over two hundred but you bet he kept his stock in the leased lines which guarantee more than they earn he cleaned up five million they say my moneythe money that might give that boy fresh air and good doctors say you believe in hell dont you you tell eldon parr to keep his charityhe cant send any of it in here and youd better go back to that church of his and pray to keep his soul out of hell  his voice which had risen even to a higher pitch fell silent and all at once without warning garvin sank or rather tumbled upon the bed sobbing in a way that was terrible to see the wife stole across the room sat down beside him and laid her hand on his shoulder  in spite of the intensity of his own anguish hodder was conscious of a curious detachment and for months afterward particular smells the sight of a gasoline stove a certain popular tune gave him a sharp twinge of pain the acid distilling in his soul etched the scene the sounds the odours forever in his memory a stale hot wind from the alley rattled the shutterslats and blew the door to the child stirred and above the strident irregular weeping rose main in ironical contrast the piano and the voice across the yard in that glimpse he had into the heart of lifes terrible mystery he momentarily understood many things he knew that behind the abandon of the womans song was the same terror which reigned in the room in which he stood  there were voices in the passageway without a woman saying in a german accentit is here sir  there was a knock at the door     chapter xi the lost parishioner   i  hodder opened the door in the dingy passageway he perceived a tall figure which immediately turned out to be that of an old gentleman in spite of the heat he wore a long coat and an oldfashioned high collar a black tie under which was exposed a triangle of immaculate pleated linen in one hand he held a goldheaded stick a large tall hat of which the silk nap was a little rubbed a string sustaining a parcel the brown paper wrapping of which was soaked in the other a manila bag containing lemons  his head was bent forward a little the high dome of it was bald but the white hair clustered thickly behind the temples the face was cleanshaven the cheeks touched with red the nose high and dominating distinctly philanthropic and the blue eyes rested on the clergyman with a benevolence unfeigned  good afternoon sir the old gentleman said i am told mrs garvin lives here  before the rector could reply mrs garvin herself stood between them  its mr bentley she exclaimed  i fear im intruding maam he said but some of dickys little friends have just informed me that he is ill and i have taken the liberty of calling to inquire  mr bentley entered the roomsimple words to express that which was in some sort an event he laid his parcels on the table his hat and stick on a chair and stood looking down in silence at the thin little form on the couch presently he turned  im afraid hes very ill maam he said gently you have your own doctor no doubt but if you will permit me as a friend to make a suggestion we have in the city one of the best child specialists in the united states who is never weary of curing these little onesdr jarvis and i shall be happy to ask him to come and see dicky  mrs garvin glanced at hodder who came forward  i was just about to telephone for dr jarvis mr bentley when you arrived i am mr hodder of st johns  how do you do sir the kindly eyes alight with a gentle flame rested upon the rugged figure of the rector i am glad that you too agree that dr jarvis is advisable mr hodder  there was a sound from the bed garvin had got to his feet and was staring wildly with reddened lids  are you horace bentley he demanded  that is my name sir mr bentley replied his expression of surprise was only momentary and in all his life hodder had never beheld a greater contrast in human beings than between that gracious and courtly old man and the haggard unkempt unshaved and starving outcast facing him something like a film came over garvins eyes  he ruined you too twenty years backeldon parr did for you too oh i know his record ive followed his trailhe got all the grantham stock that would have made you a millionnaire  ah replied mr bentley smiling to humour him thats something i have no wish to be sira millionaire he met the frightened gaze of the wife good day maam if you will allow me ill come tomorrow morning to learn what dr jarvis will have had to say have courage maam have courage you may have faith in dr jarvis  the poor woman was incapable of speech mr bentley picked up his hat and stick  ive taken the liberty of bringing dicky a little ice and a few lemons his eyes rested again on the couch by the window then he turned to garvin who stood mutely staring good evening sir he said we must look for the best    ii  they went down the stairs of the shabby and battered house stairs by the side of which holes had been knocked through the faded wallpaperscars of frequent movings the sound and smell of frying came out of the open door of what once had been the parlour and on the front steps a little girl darted past them with a pitcher of beer when they reached the sidewalk mr bentley halted  if you were intending to telephone dr jarvis mr hodder there is a public station in the drug store just above here i know that clergymen are busy persons and i am passing it if you are pressed for time  my only concern is to get jarvis here said the rector if i may go with you  once again in the hot sunlight reaction had set in hodder was suddenly unstrung and the kindly old gentleman beside him seemed for the instant the only fixture in a chaotic universe it was not until later reflection that he realized mr bentley might by an intuitive sympathy a depth of understanding have drained something of his state since the incidents which followed were to be accounted for on no other grounds in such elemental moments the frail conventions are swept away mr bentley whoever he might be was no longer a stranger and it seemed wholly natural to be walking with him up the street to hear him sayingnot with perfunctory politeness but in a tone that was itself an invitationwith pleasure sir well go together and let us trust that the doctor will be at home  nor did hodder stop to wonder then why mr bentley should have sought in his conversation to dissipate something of the hideous blackness of a tragedy which must have moved him profoundly how fortunate he declared that they should have arrived before it was too late for it was plain to be seen that these garvins were good people who had been broken by adversity the boy had struck him particularlya lovable merry little fellow whose clothes mr bentley observed were always neatly mended betokening a mother with selfrespect and character he even spoke of garvin adversity worry the heat constant brooding over a happier past and an uncertain futurewas it surprising that the poor mans mind had become unhinged they must make some plan for garvin said mr bentley get the man and his wife into the country for a while amongst kindly people this might no doubt be arranged  here we are sir  the familiar smell of drugs the sound of the trickling water in the soda fountain roused hodder to reality to action and he hurried into the telephone booth fumbled in the dogeared book got dr jarviss number and called it an eternity seemed to elapse before he had a reply heard his coin jangling in the bog recognized the voice of the great doctors secretary yes the doctor was in would he speak to mr hodder of st johns an interval during which hodder was suddenly struck with this designation of himself was he still of st johns then an aeon might have elapsed since he had walked down the white marble of its aisle toward the crouching figure in the pew he was not that man but anotherand still mr hodder of st johns then he heard the specialist say hello mr hodder what can i do for you heard his own voice in reply explaining the case could the doctor find time the doctor could he was never too busy to attend to the poorthough he did not say so he would be thereby halfpast six the rector hung up the receiver opened the door of the booth and mopped his brow for the heat was stifling  the doctor will go he explained in answer to mr bentleys inquiring look  now sir said the old gentleman when they were out of the store we have done all that we can for the time being i do not live far from here perhaps you would give me the pleasure of taking supper with me if you have no other engagement  no other engagement not until then did hodder remember his empty rooms in the parish house and the train which was to have borne him away from all this already speeding northward he accepted gratefully nor did he pause to speculate upon the mystery by which the stream of his life seemed so suddenly to have been diverted he had indeed no sense of mystery in the presence of this splendidly sane serene old man any more than the children who ran after him from the dingy yards and passages calling his name clinging to the skirts of his coat these accepted him simply as an anomalous fact in their universe grinned at his pleasantries and held up grimy little hands for the kidneyshaped candy beans he drew forth from his capacious pockets in the intervals he reminisced to the rector about the neighbourhood  it seems but a short while ago when the trees met overheadmagnificent trees they were the asphalt and the soot killed them and there were fruit trees in that yardhe pointed with his stick to a littered sun parched plot adjoining a battered mansionall pink and white with blossoms in the spring mr hadley lived thereone of our forgotten citizens he is dead and gone now and his family scattered that other house where the boy lies belonged to mr villars a relation of the atterbury family and i can recall very well a little girl with a pink sash and a white dress who used to come running out to meet me with flowers in her hands incredible as it may seem she picked them in that yard i thought of her as i went in how fresh and happy she used to be and what a different place this was for children then she must have some of her own by this time  the character of the street had changed to what might be called shabbygenteel and they stopped before a threestory brick houseone of a rowthat showed signs of scrupulous care the steps were newly scrubbed the woodwork neatly painted  this is where i live sir said mr bentley opening the door with a latchkey and leading the way into a high room on the right darkened and cool and filled with superb oldfashioned rosewood furniture it was fitted up as a library with tall shelves reaching almost to the ceiling  an old negro appeared dressed in a swallowtailed coat his hair was as white as his masters and his face creased with age  sam said mr bentley i have brought home a gentleman for supper  yassah misteh hoace i was jest agwine to open up de blins  he lifted the wire screens and flung back the shutters beamed on the rector as he relieved him of his hat and noiselessly retired curiosity hitherto suppressed by more powerful feelings awoke in hodder speculations which ordinarily would have been aroused before every object in the room bespoke gentility was eloquent of a day when wealth was honoured and respected photographs daguerreotypes in oldfashioned frames bore evidence of friendships of the past and over the marble mantel hung a portrait of a sweetfaced woman in the costume of the thirties whose eyes reminded hodder of mr bentleys who was she  hodder wondered presently he found himself before a photograph on the wall beyond at which he had been staring unconsciously  ah you recognize it said mr bentley  st johns  yes mr bentley repeated st johns he smiled at hodders glance of bewilderment and put his hand on the younger mans arm that picture was taken before you were born sir i venture to sayin 1869 i am very fond of it for it gives the church in perspective as you see that was mr gores househe indicated a square heavily corniced mansionwhere the hotel now stands and that was his garden next the church where you see the trees above the wall  the rector turned again and looked at his host who was gazing at the picture thoughtfully  i ought to have remembered he said i have seen your name in the church records sir and i have heard mr waring speak of you  my dear mr hodder there is no reason why you should have known me a great many years have passed since i was a parishioner of st johnsa great many years  but it was you the rector began uncertainly and suddenly spoke with conviction it was you who chose the architect who did more than other men to make the church what it is  whatever i may have done replied mr bentley with simple dignity has brought its reward to this day i have not ceased to derive pleasure from it and often i go out of my way through burton street although the view is cramped and sometimes he added with the hint of a twinkle in his eye i go in this afternoon is not the first time i have seen you mr hodder  but said the rector he stared at the others face and the question died on his lips  you wonder why i am no longer a parishioner the time came when i could not afford to be there was no hint of reproach in his voice of bitterness he spoke regretfully indeed but as one stating an incontrovertible fact i lost my fortune i could not keep my pew so i deeded it back to the church my old friends mrs dimock and asa waring and others too were very kind but i could not accept their hospitality  hodder bowed his head in silence what thundered indictment of the church of christ could have been as severe as wholly condemning as these few words so dispassionately uttered by the man beside him  the old darky entered and announced supper  hodder had lost his way yet a hand had been held out to him and he seized it with a sense of being led psychically as well as physically he followed mr bentley into a large bedroom where a high fourposted bed lifted a pleated canopy toward the ceiling and after he had washed his hands they entered a diningroom looking out upon a little yard in the rear which had been transformed into a garden roses morning glories and nasturtiums were growing against the walls a hose lay coiled upon the path the bricks baked during the day were splashed with water the leaves and petals were wet and the acrid odour of moist earth mingling with perfumes penetrated the room hodder paused in the window  sam keeps our flowers alive he heard mr bentley say i dont know how  i scrubs em sah said sam yassah i washes em like chilluns  he found himself at mr bentleys request asking grace the old darky with reverently bent head standing behind his master sitting down at a mahogany table that reflected like a mirror the few pieces of old silver to a supper of beaten biscuits that burned ones fingers of broiled chicken and coffee and sliced peaches and cream mr bentley was talking of other daysnot so long gone by when the great city had been a village or scarcely more the furniture it seemed had come from his own house in what was called the wilderness road not far from the river banks over the site of which limited trains now rolled on their way eastward toward the northernmost of the citys bridges he mentioned many names some remembered some forgotten like his own dwelt on pleasures and customs gone by forever  a little while after i moved in here i found that one old man could not fill the whole of this house so i let the upper floors he explained smilingly some day i must introduce you to my tenants mr hodder  by degrees as hodder listened he became calm like a child he found himself distracted talking asking questions and the intervals grew longer between the recurrent surges of fear when the memory rose before him of the events of the dayof the woman the child and the man of eldon parr and this deed he had done hinting as it did of closed chambers of other deeds yet to be opened of countless hidden miseries still to be revealed when he heard once more the tortured voice of the banker and the question how would you like to live in this housealone in contrast now he beheld the peace in the face of the man whose worldly goods eldon parr had taken and whom he had driven out of the church surely this man had found a solution what was it  hodder thought of the child of the verdict of dr jarvis but he lingered on loth to leaveif the truth be toldafraid to leave drawing strength from his hosts calm wondering as to the source of it as to the life which was its expression longing yet not presuming to question the twilight deepened and the old darky lit a lamp and led the way back to the library  sam said mr bentley draw up the armchair for mr hodder beside the window it is cooler there  i ought to go hodder said i ought to see how the child is jarvis will have been there by this time and there may be necessaries  jarvis will have attended to that mr bentley replied sit down mr hodder i am not sure that for the present we have not done all in this case that is humanly possible  you mean said the rector that they will accept nothing from me it came from him spontaneously like a cry he had not meant to say it i dont blame them i dont blame them for losing their faith in god and man in the church i ought to have seen it before but i was blind incredibly blinduntil it struck me in the face you saw it sir and you left a church from which the poor are thrust out which refuses to heed the first precept of its master  i saw it answered mr bentley but i could do nothing perhaps you can dosomething  ah hodder exclaimed sharply why do you say that the church is paralyzed chained how can she reach these wretched people who are the victims of the ruthless individualism and greed of those who control her you knowthat man mr bentley hodder could not bring himself to pronounce eldon parrs name i had an affection for him i pitied him because he suffers  yes echoed mr bentley he suffers  hodder was momentarily arrested by the sadness of his tone  but he doesnt know why he suffershe cannot be made to see the rector went on and he is making others sufferhideously while he imagines himself a christian he is the church to that miserable hopeless wretch we saw today and to hundreds of the same kind whom he has driven to desperation and iwho am supposed to be the vicar of godi am powerless they have a contempt for me a just contempt they thrust me out of their doors bid me to return and minister to their oppressors you were right to leave and i should have left long since  he had not spoken with violence or with a lack of control he seemed rather to have regained a mastery of himself and felt as a man from whom the shackles have been struck proclaiming his freedom mr bentleys eyes lighted in involuntary response as he gazed at the figure and face before him he pressed his hands together  if you will forgive a curiosity mr hodder that is somewhat due to my interest in a church with which i have many precious associations may i ask if this is a sudden determination on your part  no hodder said i have known ever since i came here that something was wrong but at first i couldnt see it and after that i wouldnt see it that is about what happened as i look back on it  but the farther in i went hodder continued the more tangled and bewildered i became i was hypnotized i think he added with a gesturehypnotized as a man is who never takes his eyes from a pattern i wanted to get at this neighbourhooddalton streeti mean and finally i agreed to the establishment of a settlement house over here to be paid for largely by eldon parr and francis ferguson i couldnt see the folly of such an undertakingthe supreme irony of it untiluntil it was pointed out to me he hesitated the remembrance of alison parr ran through him a thread of pain and even then i tried to dodge the issue i tried to make myself believe that good might flow out of evil that the church which is supposed to be founded on the highest ideal ever presented to man might compromise and be practical that she might accept money which had been wrung from a trusting public by extortion by thinly disguised thievery such as this consolidated tractions company fraud and do good with it and at last i made up my mind to go away today to a quiet place where i might be alone and reflect when by a singular circumstance i was brought into contact with this man garvin i see now clearly enough that if i had gone i should never have come back  and you still intend to go mr bentley asked  hodder leaned his elbow against the mantel the lamplight had a curious effect on mr bentleys face  what can i do he demanded the question was not aimed directly at his hostit was in the nature of a renewed appeal to a tribunal which had been mute but with which he now seemed vaguely aware of a certain contact even supposing i could bring myself to accept the compromisenow that i see it clearly that the end justifies the meanswhat good could i accomplish you saw what happened this afternoonthe man would have driven me out if it hadnt been for you this whole conception of charity is a crime against civilizationi had to have that pointed out to me toothis system of legalized or semilegalized robbery and the distribution of largesse to the victims the church is doing wrong is stultifying herself in encouraging it she should set her face rigidly against it stand for morality and justice and christianity in government not for pauperizing it is her mission to enlighten these people all peopleto make them selfrespecting to give them some notion of the dignity of their souls and their rights before god and man  arent you yourself suggesting said mr bentley the course which will permit you to remain  hodder was silent the thought struck him with tremendous force had he suggested it and howwhy could it be done could he do it or begin it  we have met at last in a singular way he heard mr bentley going on in a way that has brushed aside the conventions in a wayi am happy to saythat has enabled you to give me your confidence and i am an old manthat has made it easier i saw this afternoon mr hodder that you were troubled although you tried to hide it  i knew that you saw it hodder said  nor was it difficult for me to guess something of the cause of it the same thing has troubled me  you  yes mr bentley answered i left st johns but the habits and affections of a lifetime are not easily severed and some time before i left it i began to have visions of a future for it there was a question many years ago as to whether a new st johns should not be built in the west end on a site convenient to the parishioners and this removal i opposed mr waring stood by me we foresaw the day when this district would bewhat it is nowthe precarious refuge of the unfortunate in the battle of life of just such unhappy families as the garvins of miserable women who sell themselves to keep alive i thought of st johns as you did as an oasis in a desert of misery and vice at that time i too believed in the system of charities which you have so well characterized as pauperizing  and now  mr bentley smiled as at a reminiscence  my eyes were opened he replied and in these simple words summed up and condemned it all they are craving bread and we fling them atones i came here it was a house i owned which i saved from the wrecks and as i look back upon what the world would call a misfortune sir i can see that it was a propitious event for me the street ran down as the saying goes i grew gradually to know these people my new neighbours largely through their children and i perceived many things i had not dreamed ofbefore then i saw how the church was hampered fettered i saw why they disliked and distrusted it  and yet you still believed that it had a mission hodder interrupted he had been listening with rapt attention  i still believed it said mr bentley my conception of that mission changed grew and yet it seemed further and further from fulfilment and then you came to st johns  i the cry was involuntary  you mr bentley repeated sometimes he added whimsically i go there as i have told you i saw you i heard you preach i talked to my friend waring about you i saw that your eyes were not opened but i think i had a certain presentiment for which i do not pretend to account that they would be opened  you mean said the rector that if i believe in the mission of the church as i have partially stated it here tonight ishould stay and fight for it  precisely mr bentley replied  there was a note of enthusiasm almost of militancy in the old gentlemans tone that surprised and agitated hodder he took a turn up and down the room before he answered  i ought to tell you that the view i expressed a moment ago is new to me i had not thought of it before and it is absolutely at variance with any previous ideas i have held i can see that it must involve if carried to its logical conclusion a change in the conception of christianity i have hitherto held  he was too intent upon following up the thought to notice mr bentleys expression of assent  and suppose he asked i were unable to come to any conclusion i will be frank mr bentley and confess to you that at present i cannot see my way you have heard me preachyou know what my beliefs have been they are shattered and while i feel that there is some definite connection between the view of the church which i mentioned and her message to the individual i do not perceive it clearly i am not prepared at present to be the advocate of christianity because i do not know what christianity is i thought i knew  i shall have to begin all over again as though i had never taken orders submit to a thorough test examine the evidence impartially it is the only way of this much i am sure that the church as a whole has been engaged in a senseless conflict with science and progressive thought that she has insisted upon the acceptance of facts which are in violation of reason and which have nothing to do with religion she has taught them to memade them in fact a part of me i have clung to them as long as i can and in throwing them over i dont know where i shall land  his voice was measured his words chosen yet they expressed a withering indignation and contempt which were plainly the culmination of months of bewildermentnow replaced by a clearcut determination  i do not blame any individual he continued but the system by which clergymen are educated  i intend to stay here now without conducting any services and find out for myself what the conditions are here in dalton street you know those people mr bentley you understand them and i am going to ask you to help me you have evidently solved the problem  mr bentley rose and he laid a hand which was not quite steady on the rectors shoulder  believe me sir he replied i appreciate something of what such a course must mean to youa clergyman he paused and a look came upon his face a look that might scarce have been called a smilehodder remembered it as a glowreminiscent of many things in it a life was summed ups in it understanding beneficence charity sympathy were all expressed yet seemingly blended into one i do not know what my testimony may be worth to you my friend but i give it freely i sometimes think i have been peculiarly fortunate but i have lived a great many years and the older i get and the more i see of human nature the firmer has grown my conviction of its essential nobility and goodness  hodder marvelled and was silent  you will come here oftenevery day if you can there are many men and women friends of mine whom i should like you to know who would like to know you  i will and thank you hodder answered words were inadequate for the occasion     chapter xii the woman of the song  on leaving mr bentley hodder went slowly down dalton street wondering that mere contact with another human being should have given him the resolution to turn his face once again toward the house whither he was bound and this man had given him something more it might hardly have been called faith a new courage to fare forth across the unknownthat was it hope faint but revived  presently he stopped on the sidewalk looked around him and read a sign in glaring electric letters hotel albert despite the heat the place was ablaze with lights men and women were passing pausinggoing in a motor with a liveried chauffeur whom he remembered having seen before was standing in front of the rathskeller the nightly carousal was beginning  hodder retraced his steps crossed the street diagonally came to the dilapidated gate he remembered so well and looked up through the dusk at the house if death had entered it there was no sign death must be a frequent visitor hereabouts on the doorsteps he saw figures outlined slatternly women and men in shirtsleeves who rose in silence to make way for him staring at him curiously he plunged into the hot darkness of the hall groped his way up the stairs and through the passage and hesitated a single gas jet burned low in the stagnant air and after a moment he made out by its dim light a woman on her knees beside the couch mechanically moving the tattered palmleaf over the motionless little figure the child was still alive he drew a deep breath and entered at the sound of his step mrs garvin suddenly started up  richard she cried and then stood staring at the rector have you seen my husband sir he went away soon after you left  hodder taken by surprise replied that he had not her tone her gesture of anxiety he found vaguely disquieting  the doctor has been here he asked  yes she answered absently i dont know where he can berichard he didnt even wait to see the doctor and he thinks so much of dicky sir he sits here of an evening  hodder sat down beside her and taking the palmleaf from her hand began himself to fan the child something of her misgiving had communicated itself to him  dont worry he said remember that you have been through a great deal and it is natural that you should be overwrought your husband feels strongly i dont blame him and the sight of me this afternoon upset him he has gone out to walk  richard is proud she answered simply he used to say hed rather die than take charityand now hes come to it and itsthat man sir whos got on his brain and changed him he wasnt always like this but now he cant seem to think of anything else he wakes up in the night  and he used to have such a sweet natureyou wouldnt have known him and came home so happy in the evenings in alder street often with a little fruit or something hed bought for us and romp with dicky in the yard and id stand and laugh at them even after wed lost our money when he was sick that time he didnt feel this way it grew on him when he couldnt get work and then he began to cut things out of the papers about mr parr and i have sometimes thought that thats kept him from getting work he talks about it and people dont know what to make of him they dont know how hard hed try if theyd give him something  we shall find something said the rector striving to throw into his voice confidence and calm he did not dare to look at her but continued to move the fan  the child stirred a little mrs garvin put out her hand  yes the doctor was here he was very kind oh sir she exclaimed i hope you wont think us ungratefuland that mr bentley wont dr jarvis has hopes sirhe saysi forget the name he called it what dicky has its something uncommon he says it wasbrought on by the heat and want of foodgood food and hes coming himself in the morning to take him out to that hospital beyond the parkin an automobile sir i was just thinking what a pity it is dicky wouldnt realize it hes always wanted to ride in one suddenly her tears flowed unheeded and she clung to the little hand convulsively i dont know what i shall do without him sir i dont ive always had him and when hes sick among strangers  the rector rose to the occasion  now mrs garvin he said firmly you must remember that there is only one way to save the boys life it will be easy to get you a room near the hospital where you can see him constantly  i knowi know sir but i couldnt leave his father i couldnt leave richard she looked around distractedly where is he  he will come back presently said the rector if not i will look for him  she did not reply but continued to weep in silence suddenly above the confused noises of the night the loud notes of a piano broke and the woman whose voice he had heard in the afternoon began once more with appalling vigour to sing the child moaned  mrs garvin started up hysterically  i cant stand iti cant stand her singing that now she sobbed  thirty feet away across the yard hodder saw the gleaming window from which the music came he got to his feet another verse began with more of the brazen emphasis of the concerthall singer than ever he glanced at the woman beside him irresolutely  ill speak to her he said  mrs garvin did not appear to hear him but flung herself down beside the lounge as he seized his hat and left the room he had the idea of telephoning for a nurse when he almost ran into some one in the upper hall and recognized the stout german woman mrs breitmann  mrs garvinhe said she ought not to be left  i am just now going said mrs breitmann i stay with her until her husband come  such was the confidence with which for some reason she inspired him that he left with an easier mind  it was not until the rector had arrived at the vestibule of the apartment house next door that somethingof the difficulty and delicacy of the errand he had undertaken came home to him impulse had brought him thus far but now he stood staring helplessly at a row of bells speaking tubes and cards which for example belonged to the lady whose soprano voice pervaded the neighbourhood he looked up and down the street in the vain hope of finding a messenger the song continued he had promised to stop it hodder accused himself of cowardice  to his horror hodder felt stealing over him incredible though it seemed after the depths through which he had passed a faint sense of fascination in the adventure it was this that appalled himthis tenacity of the fleshwhich no terrors seemed adequate to drive out the sensation faint as it was unmanned him there were still many unexplored corners in his soul  he turned once more contemplated the bells and it was not until then he noticed that the door was ajar he pushed it open climbed the staircase and stood in the doorway of what might be called a sitting room his eyes fixed on a swaying back before an upright piano against the wall his heart seemed to throb with the boisterous beat of the music the womans hair in two long and heavy plaits falling below her waist suddenly fascinated him it was of the rarest of russet reds she came abruptly to the end of the song  i beg your pardon he began  she swung about with a start her music dropping to the floor and stared at him her tattered blue kimono fell away at her elbows her full throat was bare and a slipper she had kicked off lay on the floor beside her he recoiled a little breathing deeply she stared at him  my god how you scared me she exclaimed evidently a second glance brought to her a realization of his clerical costume say how did you get in here  i beg your pardon he said again but there is a very sick child in the house next door and i came to ask you if you would mind not playing any more tonight  she did not reply at once and her expression he found unsolvable much of it might be traced to a life which had contracted the habit of taking nothing on trust a life which betrayed itself in unmistakable traces about the eyes and hodder perceived that the face if the stamp of this expression could have been removed was not unpleasing although indulgence and recklessness were beginning to remould it  quit stringin me she said  for a moment he was at a loss he gathered that she did not believe him and crossed to the open window  if you will come here he said i will show you the room where he lies we hope to be able to take him to the hospital tomorrow he paused a moment and added he enjoyed your music very much when he was better  the comment proved a touchstone  say she remarked with a smile that revealed a set of surprisingly good teeth i can make the box talk when i get agoin theres no stopping me this side of grand operathats no fable im not so bad for an enginoo am i  thus directly appealed to in common courtesy he assented  no indeed he said  thats right she declared but the managers wont have it at any price those jays dont know anything do they theyve only got a dream of what the public wants you wouldnt believe it but ive sung for em and they threw me out you wouldnt believe it would you  i must own said the rector that i have never had any experience with managers  she sat still considering him from the piano stool her knees apart her hands folded in her lap mockery came into her eyes  say what did you come in here for honest injun she demanded  he was aware of trying to speak sternly and of failing to save his life he could not then bring up before himself the scene in the little back room across the yard in its full terror and reality reproduce his own feelings of only a few minutes ago which had impelled him hither a month a year might have elapsed every faculty was now centred on the woman in front of him and on her life  why do you doubt me he asked  she continued to contemplate him her eyes were strange baffling smouldering yellowbrown shifting yet not shifty eyes with a history her laugh proclaimed both effrontery and uneasiness  dont get huffy she said the kids sickthats on the level is it you didnt come round to see me the insinuation was in her voice as well as in her words he did not resent it but felt an odd thrill of commingled pity andfear  i came for the reason i have given you he replied and added more gently i know it is a good deal to ask but you will be doing a great kindness the mother is distracted the child as i told you will be taken to the hospital in the morning  she reached out a hand and closed the piano softly  i guess i can hold off for tonight she said sometimes things get kind of dullyou know when theres nothing doing and this keeps me lively how old is the kid  about nine he estimated  say im sorry she spoke with a genuineness of feeling that surprised him he went slowly almost apologetically toward the door  good night he said and thank you  her look halted him  whats your hurry she demanded  im sorry he said hastily but i must be going he was in truth in a panic to leave  youre a minister aint you  yes he said  i guess you dont think much of me do you she demanded  he halted abruptly struck by the challenge and he saw that this woman had spoken not for herself but for an entire outlawed and desperate class the fact that the words were mocking and brazen made no difference it would have been odd had they not been so with a shock of surprise he suddenly remembered that his inability to reach this class had been one of the causes of his despair and now with the realization reaction set in an overpowering feeling of weariness a desirefor restfor sleep the electric light beside the piano danced before his eyes yet he heard within him a voice crying out to him to stay desperately tired though he was he must not leave now he walked slowly to the table put his hat on it and sat down in a chair beside it  why do you say that he asked  oh cut it out said the woman im on to you church folks she laughed one of em came in here once and wanted to pray i made a monkey of him  i hope said the rector smiling a little that is not the reason why you wish me to stay  she regarded him doubtfully  youre not the same sort she announced at length  what sort was he  he was easyold enough to know bettermost of the easy ones are he marched in sanctimonious as you please with his mouth full of salvation and bible verses she laughed again at the recollection  and after that said the rector you felt that ministers were a lot of hypocrites  i never had much opinion of em she admitted nor of church people either she added with emphasis  theres ferguson who has the department storehes way up in church circles i saw him a couple of months ago one sunday morning driving to that church on burton street where all the rich folks go i forget the name  st johns he supplied he had got beyond surprise  st johnsthats it they tell me he gives a lot of money to itmoney that he steals from the girls he hires oh yes hell get to heaveni dont think  how do you mean that he steals money from the girls  say you are innocentaint you did you ever go down to that store do you know what a floorwalker is did you ever see the cheap guys hanging around and the young swells waiting to get a chance at the girls behind the counters why do you suppose so many of em take to the easy life ill put you nextbecause ferguson dont pay em enough to live on thats why he makes em sign a paper when he hires em that they live at home that theyve got some place to eat and sleep and they sign it all right thats to square up fergusons conscience but say if you think a girl can support herself in this city and dress on what he pays youve got another guess comin  there rose up before him unsummoned the image of nan ferguson in all her freshness and innocence as she had stood beside him on the porch in park street he was somewhat astonished to find himself defending his parishioner  may it not be true in order to compete with other department stores that mr ferguson has to pay the same wages he said  forget it i guess you know what galt house is thats where women like me can go when we get all played out and theres nothing left in the gameits on river street maybe youve been there  hodder nodded  well she continued ferguson pays a lot of money to keep that going and gets his name in the papers he hands over to the hospitals where some of us dieand its all advertised he forks out to the church now i put it to you why dont he sink some of that money where it belongsin living wages because theres nothing in it for himthats why  the rector looked at her in silence he had not suspected her of so much intellect he glanced about the apartment at the cheap portiere flung over the sofa at the gaudy sofa cushions two of which bore the names and colours of certain colleges the gas log was almost hidden by dried palm leaves a cigarette stump lay on the fender on the mantel above were several photographs of men and at the other side an open door revealed a bedroom  this is a nice place aint it she observed i furnished it when i was on velvetnothing was too good for me moneys like champagne when you take the cork out it wont keep i was rich once it was lively while it lasted she added with a sigh ive struck the down trail i oughtnt by rights to be here fooling with you theres nothing in it she glanced at the clock i ought to get busy  as the realization of her meaning came to him he quivered  is there no way but that he asked in a low voice  say youre not agoin to preach are you  no he answered god forbid i was not asking the question of you  she stared at him  of who then  he was silent  youve left me at the station but on the level you dont seem to know much thats a fact you dont think the man who owns these flats is in it for charity do you single ladies like me have to give up and then there are other little grafts that wouldnt interest you what church do you come from anyway  you mentioned it a little while ago  st johns she leaned back against the piano and laughed unrestrainedly thats a good one to think how straight ive been talking to you  im much obliged to you he said  again she gazed at him now plainly perplexed  what are you giving me  i mean what i say he answered i am obliged to you for telling me things i didnt know and i appreciateyour asking me to stay  she was sitting upright now her expression changed her breath came more rapidly her lips parted as she gazed at him  do you know she said i havent had anybody speak to me like that for four years her voice betrayed excitement and differed in tone and she had cast off unconsciously the vulgarity of speech at that moment she seemed reminiscent of what she must once have been and he found himself going through an effort at reconstruction  like what he asked  like a woman she answered vehemently  my name is john hodder he said and i live in the parish house next door to the church i should like to be your friend if you will let me if i can be of any help to you now or at any other time i shall feel happy i promise not to preach he added  she got up abruptly and went to the window and when she turned to him again it was with something of the old bravado  youd better leave me alone im no good she said im much obliged to you but i dont want any charity or probation houses in mine and honest works a thing of the past for meeven if i could get a job nobody would have me but if they would i couldnt work any more ive got out of the hang of it with a swift and decisive movement she crossed the room opened a cabinet on the wall revealing a bottle and glasses  so youre bent upon goingdownhill he said  what can you do to stop it she retorted defiantly give me religioni guess youd tell me religions all right for those on top but say it would be a joke if i got it there aint any danger but if i did it wouldnt pay roomrent and board  he sat mute once more the truth overwhelmed the folly of his former optimism arose to mock him what he beheld now in its true aspect was a disease of that civilization he had championed  she took the bottle from the cupboard and laid it on the table  whats the difference she demanded its all over in a little while anyway i guess youd tell me there was a hell but if thats so some of your church folksll broil too ill take my chance on it if they will she looked at him half in defiance half in friendliness across the table say you mean all right but youre only wastin time here you cant do me any good i tell you and ive got to get busy  may we not at least remain friends he asked after a moment  her laugh was a little harsh  what kind of friendship would that be you a minister and me a woman on the town  if i can stand it i should think you might  well i cant stand it she answered  he got up and held out his hand she stood seemingly irresolute and then took it  good night he said  good night she repeated nonchalantly  as he went out of the door she called after him  dont be afraid ill worry the kid  the stale odour of cigarette smoke with which the dim corridor was charged intoxicated threatened to overpower him it seemed to be the reek of evil itself a closing door had a sinister meaning he hurried obscurity reigned below the light in the lower hall being out fumbled for the doorknob and once in the street took a deep breath and mopped his brow but he had not proceeded half a block before he hesitated retraced his steps reentered the vestibule and stooped to peer at the cards under the speaking tubes cheaply printed in large script was the name of the tenant of the second floor rearmiss kate marcy  in crossing tower street he was frightened by the sharp clanging of a great electric car that roared past him aflame with light his brain had seemingly ceased to work and he stumbled at the curb for he was very tired the events of the day no longer differentiated themselves in his mind but lay a composite weight upon his heart at length he reached the silent parish house climbed the stairs and searched in his pocket for the key of his rooms the lock yielded but while feeling for the switch he tripped and almost fell over an obstruction on the floor  the flooding light revealed his travellingbags as he had piled them packed and ready to go to the station     volume 4     chapter xiii winterbourne   i  hodder fell asleep from sheer exhaustion awaking during the night at occasional intervals to recall chimerical dreams in which the events of the day before were reflected but caricatured and distorted alison parr was talking to the woman in the flat and both were changed and yet he identified both and on another occasion he saw a familiar figure surrounded by romping ragged childrena figure which turned out to be eldon parrs  finally he was aroused by what seemed a summons from the unknownthe prolonged morning whistle of the shoe factory for a while he lay as one benumbed and the gradual realization that ensued might be likened to the straining of stiffened wounds little by little he reconstructed until the process became unbearable and then rose from his bed with one object in mindto go to horace bentley at firsthe seized upon the excuse that mr bentley would wish to hear the verdict of dr jarvis but immediately abandoned it as dishonest acknowledging the true reason that in all theworld the presence of this one man alone might assuage in some degree the terror in his soul for the first time in his life since childhood he knew a sense of utter dependence upon another human being he felt no shame would make no explanation for his early visit  he turned up tower deliberately avoiding dalton street in its lower part reached mr bentleys door the wrinkled hospitable old darky actually seemed to radiate something of the personality with which he had so long been associated and hodder was conscious of a surge of relief a return of confidence at sight of him yes mr bentley was at home in the dining room the rector said he would wait and not disturb him  he done tole me to bring you out sah if you come said sam  he expects me exclaimed hodder with a shock of surprise  thats what he done tole me sah to ax you kindly for to step out when you come  the sun was beginning to penetrate into the little back yard where the flowers were still glistening with the drops of their morning bath and mr bentley sat by the window reading his newspaper his spectacles on his nose and a great grey cat rubbing herself against his legs he rose with alacrity  good morning sir he said and his welcome implied that early morning visits were the most common and natural of occurrences sam a plate for mr hodder i was just hoping you would come and tell me what dr jarvis had said about the case  but hodder was not deceived he believed that mr bentley understood perfectly why he had come and the knowledge of the old gentlemans comprehension curiously added to his sense of refuge he found himself seated once more at the mahogany table permitting sam to fill his cup with coffee  jarvis has given a favourable report and he is coming this morning himself in an automobile to take the boy out to the hospital  that is like jarvis was mr bentleys comment we will go there together after breakfast if convenient for you he added  i hoped you would replied the rector and i was going to ask you a favour i have a check given me by a young lady to use at my discretion and it occurred to me that garvin might be willing to accept some proposal from you he thought of nan ferguson and of the hope he lead expressed of finding some one in dalton street  i have been considering the matter mr bentley said i have a friend who lives on the trolley line a little beyond the hospital a widow it is like the country there you know and i think mrs bledsoe could be induced to take the garvins and then something can be arranged for him i will find an opportunity to speak to him this morning  hodder sipped his coffee and looked out at the morningglories opening to the sun  mrs garvin was alone last night he had gone out shortly after we left and had not waited for the doctor she was greatly worried  hodder found himself discussing these matters on which an hour before he had feared to permit his mind to dwell and presently not without feeling but in a manner eliminating all account of his personal emotions he was relating that climactic episode of the woman at the piano the old gentleman listened intently and in silence  yes he said when the rector had finished that is my observation most of them are driven to the life and held in it of course by a remorseless civilization individuals may be culpable mr hodderare culpable but we cannot put the whole responsibility on individuals  no hodder assented i can see that now he paused a moment and as his mind dwelt upon the scene and he saw again the woman standing before him in bravado the whole terrible meaning of her life and end flashed through him as one poignant sensation her dauntless determination to accept the consequence of her acts her willingness to look her future in the face cried out to him in challenge  she refused unconditionally he said  mr bentley seemed to read his thought divine his appeal  we must wait he answered  do you think hodder began and stopped abruptly  i remember another case somewhat similar said mr bentley this woman too had the spirit you describewe could do nothing with her we kept an eye on heror rather sally grover didshe deserves creditand finally an occasion presented itself  and the woman you speak of wasrehabilitated hodder asked he avoided the word saved  yes sir it was one of the fortunate cases there are others which are not so fortunate  hodder nodded  we are beginning to recognize that we are dealing in many instances with a disease mr bentley went on i am far from saying that it cannot be cured but sometimes we are forced to admit that the cure is not within our power mr hodder  two thoughts struck the rector simultaneously the revelation of what might be called a modern enlightenment in one of mr bentleys age an indication of uninterrupted growth of the sense of continued youth which had impressed him from the beginning and secondly an intimation from the use of the plural pronoun we of an association of workers informal undoubtedly behind mr bentley while he was engaged in these speculations the door opened  heahs miss sally marse hoace said sam  good morning sally said mr bentley rising from the table with his customary courtesy im glad you came in let me introduce mr hodder of st johns  miss grover had capability written all over her she was a young woman of thirty slim to spareness simply dressed in a shirtwaist and a dark blue skirt alert so distinctly american in type as to give a suggestion of the indian her quick deepset eyes searched hodders face as she jerked his hand but her greeting was cordial and matteroffact she stimulated curiosity  well sally whats the news mr bentley asked  gratz the cabinetmaker was on the rampage again mr bentley his wife was here yesterday when i got home from work and i went over with her he was in a beastly state and all the niggers and children in the neighbourhood including his own around the shop fusel oil labelled whiskey she explained succinctly  what did you do  took the bottle away from him said miss grower the simplicity of this method holder thought was undeniable stayed there until he came to then i reckon i scared him some  how mr bentley smiled  i told him hed have to see you hed rather serve three months than do thatsaid so i reckon he would too she declared grimly hes better than he was last year i think she thrust her hand in the pocket of her skirt and produced some bills and silver which she counted heres three thirtyfive from sue brady i told her she hadnt any business bothering you but she swears shed spend it  that was wrong sally  miss grower tossed her head  oh she knew id take it well enough  i imagine she did mr bentley replied and his eyes twinkled he rose and led the way into the library where he opened his desk produced a ledger and wrote down the amount in a fine hand  susan brady three dollars and thirtyfive cents ill put it in the savings bank today that makes twentytwo dollars and forty cents for sue shes growing rich  some manll get it said sally  sally said mr bentley turning in his chair mr holders been telling me about a rather unusual woman in that apartment house just above fourteenth street on the south side of dalton  i think i know herby sight sally corrected herself she appealed to holder red hair and lots of iti suppose a man would call it auburn she must have been something of a beauty once  the rector assented in some astonishment  couldnt do anything with her could you i reckoned not ive noticed her up and down dalton street at night  holder was no longer deceived by her matteroffact tone  ill tell you what mr holder she went on energetically theres not a particle of use running after those people and the sooner you find it out the less worry and trouble you give yourself  mr holder didnt run after her sally said mr bentley in gentle reproof  holder smiled  well said miss grower ive had my eye on her she has a historymost of em have but this ones out of the common when theyre brazen like that and have had good looks you can nearly always tell youve got to wait for something to happen and trust to luck to be on the spot or near it its a tossup of course one thing is sure you cant make friends with that kind if they get a notion youre up to anything  sally you must remember mr bentley began  her tone became modified mr bentley was apparently the only human of whom she stood in awe  all i meant was she said addressing the rector that youve got to run across em in some natural way  i understood perfectly and i agree with you holder replied i have come quite recently to the same conclusion myself  she gave him a penetrating glance and he had to admit inwardly that a certain satisfaction followed miss growers approval  mercy i have to be going she exclaimed glancing at the black marble clock on the mantel weve got a lot of invoices to put through today see you again mr holder she jerked his hand once more good morning mr bentley  good morning sally  mr bentley rose and took his hat and goldheaded stick from the rack in the hall  you mustnt mind sally he said when they had reached the sidewalk sometimes her brusque manner is not understood but she is a very extraordinary woman  i can see that the rector assented quickly and with a heartiness that dispelled all doubt of his liking for miss grower once more many questions rose to his lips which he suppressed since mr bentley volunteered no information hodder became in fact so lost in speculation concerning mr bentleys establishment as to forget the errand on whichthey were bound and sally growers words apropos of the woman in the flat seemed but an energetic driving home of the severe lessons of his recent experiences and how blind he had been he reflected not to have seen the thing for himself not to have realized the essential artificiality of his former method of approach and then it struck him that sally grower herself must have had a history  mr bentley too was preoccupied  presently in the midst of these thoughts hodders eyes were arrested by a crowd barring the sidewalk on the block ahead no unusual sight in that neighbourhood and yet one which aroused in him sensations of weakness and nausea thus were the hidden vice and suffering of these sinister places occasionally brought to light exposed to the curious and morbid stares of those whose own turn might come on the morrow it was only by degrees he comprehended that the people were gathered in front of the house to which they were bound an ambulance was seen to drive away it turned into the aide street in front of them  a city ambulance the rector exclaimed  mr bentley did not reply  the murmuring group which overflowed the uneven brick pavement to the asphalt was characteristic women in calico drudges women in wrappers with sleepy awestricken faces idlers men and boys who had run out of the saloons whose comments were more audible and caustic and a fringe of children ceaselessly moving on the outskirts the crowd parted at their approach and they reached the gate where a burly policeman his helmet in his hand was standing in the morning sunlight mopping his face with a red handkerchief he greeted mr bentley respectfully by name and made way for them to pass in  what is the trouble ryan mr bentley asked  suicide sir the policeman replied jumped off the bridge this morning a tug picked him up but he never came tothe strength wasnt in him sure its all wore out he was there was a letter on him with the home number so they knew where to fetch him its a sad case sir with the woman in there and the child gone to the hospital not an hour ago  you mean garvin mr bentley demanded  its him i mean sir  wed like to go in said mr bentley we came to see them  youre welcome air and the minister too its only them im holdin back and the policeman shook his stick at the people  mr bentley walked up the steps and took off his hat as he went through the battered doorway hodder followed with a sense of curious faces staring at them from the thresholds as they passed they reached the upper passage and the room and paused the shutters were closed the little couch where the child had been was empty on the bed lay a formcovered with a sheet and beside it a woman kneeling shaken by sobs ceaselessly calling a name  a stout figure hitherto unperceived rose from a corner and came silently toward themmrs breitmann she beckoned to them and they followed her into a room on the same floor where she told them what she knew heedless of the tears coursing ceaselessly down her cheeks  it seemed that mrs garvin had had a premonition which she had not wholly confided to the rector she had believed her husband never would come back and early in the morning in spite of all that mrs breitmann could do had insisted at intervals upon running downstairs and scanning the street at half past seven dr jarvis had come and himself carried down the child and put him in the back of his automobile the doctor had had a nurse with him and had begged the mother to accompany them to the hospital saying that he would send her back but she would not be persuaded to leave the house the doctor could not wait and had finally gone off with little dicky leaving a powder with mrs breitmann for the mother then she had become uncontrollable  ach it was terrible said the kind woman she was crazy yesshe was not in her mind i make a little coffee but she will not touch it all those things about her home she would talk of and how good he was and how she loved him more again than the child  und then the wheels in the street and she makes a cry and runs to seei cannot hold her  it would be well not to disturb her for a while said mr bentley seating himself on one of the dilapidated chairs which formed apart of the german womans meagre furniture i will remain here if you mr hodder will make the necessary arrangements for the funeral have you any objections sir  not at all replied the rector and left the house the occupants of which had already returned to the daily round of their lives the rattle of dishes and the noise of voices were heard in the ci devant parlour and on the steps he met the little waif with the pitcher of beer in the street the boys who had gathered around the ambulance were playing baseball hodder glanced up involuntarily at the window of the woman he had visited the night before but it was empty he hurried along the littered sidewalks to the drug store where he telephoned an undertaker and then as an afterthought telephoned the hospital the boy had arrived and was seemingly no worse for the journey  all this hodder performed mechanically not until he was returningnot indeed until he entered the house did the whiff of its degrading heated odours bring home to him the tragedy which it held and he grasped the banister on the stairs the thought that shook him now was of the cumulative misery of the city of the world of which this history on which he had stumbled was but one insignificant incident but he went on into mrs breitmanns room and saw mr bentley still seated where he had left him the old gentleman looked up at him  mrs breitmann and i are agreed mr hodder that mrs garvin ought not to remain in there what do you think  by all means no said the rector  the german woman burst into a soliloquy of sympathy that became incoherent  she will not leave himneinshe will not come  they went the three of them to the doorway of the death chamber and stood gazing at the huddled figure of the woman by the bedside she had ceased to cry out she was as one grown numb under torture occasionally a convulsive shudder shook her but when mrs breitmann touched her spoke to her her grief awoke again in all its violence and it was more by force than persuasion that she was finally removed mrs breitmann held one arm mr bentley another and between them they fairly carried her out for she was frail indeed  as for hodder something held him backsome dread that he could not at once define and while he groped for it he stood staring at the man on the bed for the hand of love had drawn back the sheet from the face the battle was over of this poor weakling against the world the torments of haunting fear and hate of drink and despair had triumphed the sight of the little group of toys brought up the image of the home in alder street as the wife had pictured it was it possible that this man who had gone alone to the bridge in the night had once been happy content with life grateful for it possessed of a simple trust in his fellowmenin eldon parr once more unsummoned came the memory of that evening of rain and thunder in the boys room at the top of the great horse in park street he had pitied eldon parr then did he now  he crossed the room on tiptoe as though he feared to wake once more this poor wretch to his misery and hate gently he covered again the face with the sheet  suddenly he knew the reason of his dreadhe had to face the woman he was a minister of christ it was his duty to speak to her as he had spoken to others in the hour of sorrow and death of the justice and goodness of the god to whom she had prayed in the church what should he say now in an agony of spirit he sat down on the little couch beside the window and buried his face in his hands the sight of poor garvins white and wasted features the terrible contrast between this miserable tenement and the palace with its unseen pictures and porcelains and tapestries brought home to him with indescribable poignancy his own predicament he was going to ask this woman to be comforted by faith and trust in the god of the man who had driven her husband to death he beheld eldon parr in his pew complacently worshipping that god who had rewarded him with riches and successbeheld himself as another man in his white surplice acquiescing in that god preaching vainly  at last he got to his feet went out of the room reached the doorway of that other room and looked in mr bentley sat there and the woman whose tears had ceased to flow was looking up into his face    ii  the office ensuing says the book of common prayer meaning the burial of the dead is not to be used for any unbaptized adult any who die excommunicate or who have laid violent hands on themselves  hodder had bought with a part of nan fergusons money a tiny plot in a remote corner of winterbourne cemetery and thither the next morning the body of richard garvin was taken  a few mourners had stolen into the house and up the threadbare stairs into the miserable little back room somehow dignified as it had never been before and laid their gifts upon the coffin an odd and pitiful assortment they weremourners and gifts men and women whose only bond with the man in life had been the bond of misery who had seen him as he had fared forth morning after morning in the hopeless search for work and slunk home night after night bitter and dejected many of whom had listened jeeringly perhaps to his grievance against the world though it were in some sort their own death for them had ennobled him the little girl whom hodder had met with the pitcher of beer came tiptoeing with a wilted bunch of pansies picked heaven knows where stolen maybe from one of the gardens of the west end carnations lilies of the valley geraniums evensuch were the offerings scattered loosely on the lid until a woman came with a mass of white roses that filled the room with their fragrancea woman with burnished red hair hodder started as he recognized her her gaze was a strange mixture of effrontery andsomething else sorrow did not quite express it the very lavishness of her gift brought to him irresistibly the reminder of another offering  she was speaking  i dont blame him for what he doneid have done it too if id been him but say i felt kind of bad when i heard it knowing about the kid and all i had to bring something  instinctively hodder surmised that she was in doubt as to the acceptance of her flowers he took them from her hand and laid them at the foot of the coffin  thank you he said simply  she stared at him a moment with the perplexity she had shown at times on the night he visited her and went out  funerals if they might be dignified by this name were not infrequent occurrences in dalton street and why this one should have been looked upon as of sufficient importance to collect a group of onlookers at the gate it is difficult to say perhaps it was because of the seeming interest in it of the higher powersfor suicide and consequent widows and orphans were not unknown there this widow and this orphan were to be miraculously rescued were to know dalton street no more the rector of a fashionable church of all beings was the agent in the miracle thus the occasion was tinged with awe as for mr bentley his was a familiar figure and had been remarked in dalton street funerals before  they started the three mourners on the long drive to the cemetery through unfrequented streets lined with mediocre dwellings interspersed with groceries and saloonsshort cuts known only to hearse drivers they traversed for some distance that very wilderness road where mr bentleys oldfashioned mansion once had stood on its long green slope framed by ancient trees the wilderness road now paved with hot blocks of granite over which the carriage rattled spread with car tracks bordered by heterogeneous buildings of all characters and descriptions bakeries and breweries slaughter houses and markets tumbledown shanties weedy corner lots and refreshmenthouses that announced lager beer wines and liquors at last they came to a region which was neither country nor city where the roadhouses were still in evidence where the glass roofs of greenhouses caught the burning rays of the sun where yards filled with marble blocks and halffinished tombstones appeared and then they turned into the gates of winterbourne  like the city itself there was a fashionable district in winterbourne unlike the city this district remained stationary there was no soot here and if there had been the dead would not have minded it they passed the prestons and the parrs the lots grew smaller the tombstones less pretentious and finally they came to an open grave on a slope where the trees were still young and where three men of the cemetery force lifted the coffin from the hearserichard garvins pallbearers  john hodder might not read the service but there was none to tell him that the gospel of john was not written for this man he stood an the grass beside the grave and a breeze from across the great river near by stirred the maple leaves above his head i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live nor was there any canon to forbid the words of paul it is sown in corruption it is raised in in corruption it is sown in dishonour it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body  they laid the flowers on the fresh earth even the white roses and then they drove back to the city      chapter xiv a saturday afternoon   i  the sight of a certain old gentleman as he walked along the shady side of twentysecond street about two oclock on a broiling saturday afternoon in midsummer was one not easily to be forgotten a younger man tall and vigorous clad in a thin suit of blue serge walked by his side they were followed by a shouting troop of small boys who overran the pavements and some of whom were armed with baseball bats the big trolley car was hailed by a dozen dirty little hands  even the grumpy passengers were disarmed the conductor took mr bentleys bill deprecatingly as much as to say that the newly organized traction companyjust out of the receivers handswere the moloch not he and rang off the fares under protest and mr bentley as had been his custom for years sat down and took off his hat and smiled so benignly at those around him that they immediately began to talk to him it was always irresistible this desire to talk to mr bentley if you had left your office irritated and out of sorts your nerves worn to an edge by the uninterrupted heat you invariably got off at your corner feeling better it was phil goodrich who had said that horace bentley had only to get on a tower street car to turn it into a church and if he had chosen to establish that dernier cri of modern civilization where ladies go who have weltschmerz without knowing whya sanitarium he might have gained back again all the money he had lost in giving his grantham stock to eldon parr  like the pied piper of hamelin he could have emptied dalton street of its children in the first place there was the irresistible inducement to any boy to ride several miles on a trolley without having this right challenged by the irate guardian of the vehicle without being summarily requested to alight at twentyfive miles an hour in the second place there was the soda water and sweet biscuit partaken of after the baseball game in that pavilion more imposing in ones eyes than the taj mahal mr bentley would willingly have taken all dalton street he had his own weltschmerz though he did not go to a sanitarium to cure it he was forced to set an age limit of ten and then establish a high court of appeal for there were boys whose biographies if they are ever written will be as hazy as those of certain worldwide celebrities who might be mentioned concerning the date and exact spot of the entrance of their heroes into the light the solemn protestations the tears the recrimination even brought pangs to the old gentlemans heart for with all the will in the world he had been forced in the nature of things to set a limit  this limit had recently been increased by the unlookedfor appearance on these excursions of the tall man in the blue serge suit whose knowledge of the national game and of other matters of vital import to youth was gratifying if sometimes disconcerting who towered an unruffled gulliver over their lilliputian controversies in which bats were waved and fists brought into play and language used on the meaning of which the century dictionary is silent on one former occasion indeed mr bentley had found moral suasion affection and veneration of no avail and had had to invoke the friendly aid of a park policeman to quell one of these incipient riots to mr bentley baseball was as a sealed book the tall mans justice not always worthy of the traditions of solomon had in it an element of force to be lifted off the ground by strong arms at the moment you are about to dust the home plate with your adversary is humiliating but effective it gradually became apparent that a decision was a decision and one saturday this inexplicable person carried in his hand a mysterious package which when opened revealed two pairs of diminutive boxing gloves they instantly became popular  by the time they had made the accidental and somewhat astounding discovery that he was a parson they were willing to overlook it in view perhaps of his compensating accomplishments instead of advising them to turn the other cheek he taught them uppercuts feints and jabs and on the proof of this unexpected acquaintance with a profession all of them openly admired the last vestige of reserve disappeared he was accepted without qualifications    ii  although the field to which they resorted was not in the most frequented section of the park pedestrians often passed that way and sometimes lingered thus towards the close of a certain saturday in july a young woman walked out of the wood path and stood awhile gazing intently at the active figure striding among the diminutive darting forms presently with an amused expression she turned her head to discover mr bentley who sat on a green bench under a tree his hat and stick on the grass beside him she was unaware that he had been looking at her  arent they having a good time she said and the genuine thrill in her voice betrayed a rare and unmistakable pleasure  ah replied mr bentley smiling back at her you like to see them too most persons do children are not meant for the city my dear young lady their natural home is in the woods and fields and these little fellows are a proof of it when they come out here they run wild you perceive he added with a twinkle as an expletive of unquestionable vigour was hurled across the diamond they are not always so polite as they might be  the young woman smiled again but the look she gave him was a puzzled one and then quite naturally she sank down on the grass on the other side of mr bentleys hat watching the game for a while in silence  what a tyrant she exclaimed another uproar had been quelled and two vigorously protesting runners sent back to their former bases  oh a benevolent tyrant mr bentley corrected her mr hodder has the gift of managing boyshe understands them and they require a strong hand his generation has had the training which mine lacked in my day at college we worked off our surplus energy on the unfortunate professors and we carried away chapel bells and fought with the townspeople  it required some effort she found to imagine this benevolent looking old gentleman assaulting professors  nowadays they play baseball and football and box he pointed to the boxing gloves on the grass mr hodder has taught them to settle their differences in that way it is much more sensible  she picked off the white clovertops  so that is mr hodder of st johns she said  ah you know him then  ive met him she answered quietly are these children connected with his church  they are little waifs from dalton street and that vicinity said mr bentley very few of them i should imagine have ever been inside of a church  she seemed surprised  butis it his habit to bring them out here the old gentleman beamed on her perhaps with the hint of a smile at her curiosity  he has found time for it this summer it is very good of him  she refrained from comment on this remark falling into reflection leaning back with one hand outstretched on the grass the game went on vociferously the shrill lithe voices piercing the silence of the summer afternoon mr bentleys eyes continued to rest on her  tell me he inquired after a while are you not alison parr  she glanced up at him startled yes  i thought so although i have not seen you since you were a little girl i knew your mother very well indeed but it is too much to expect you to remember me after all this time no doubt you have forgotten my name i am mr bentley  mr bentley she cried sitting upright and gazing at him how stupid of me not to have known you you couldnt have been any one else  it was the old gentlemans turn to start she rose impulsively and sat down on the bench beside him and his hand trembled as he laid it in hers  yes my dear i am still alive but surely you cannot remember me alison  the old look of almost stubborn honesty he recalled in the child came into her eyes  i doand i dont she said perplexed it seemed to me as if i ought to have recognized you when i came up and yet i hadnt the slightest notion who you were i knew you were somebody  he shook his head but did not speak  but you have always been a fact in my existencethat is what i want to say she went on it must be possible to remember a person and not recognize him that is what i feel i can remember you coming to our house in ransome street and how i looked forward to your visits and you used to have little candy beans in your pockets she cried have you now  his eyes were a little dimmed as he reached smilingly into the skirts of a somewhat shiny but scrupulously brushed coat and produced a brightly colored handful she took one and put it in her mouth  oh she said how good they wereisnt it strange how a taste brings back events i can remember it all as if it were yesterday and how i used to sit on your knee and mother would tell me not to bother you  and nowyou are grown he said  something more than grown she smiled i was thirtyone in may tell me she asked choosing another of the beans which he still absently held do you get them for these and she nodded toward the dalton street waifs  yes he said they are children too  i can remember she said after a pause i can remember my mother speaking of you to me the year she died i was almost grown then it was after we had moved up to park street and her health had already begun to fail that made an impression on me but i have forgotten what she saidit was apropos of some recollection noit was a photographshe was going over some old things alison ceased speaking abruptly for the pain in mr bentleys remarkable grey eyes had not escaped her what was it about him why could she not recall longforgotten shadowy episodes of the past tormented her flitted provokingly through her mindungrasped words dropped in her presence which had made their impression but the gist of which was gone why had mr bentley ceased coming to the house so strongly did she feel his presence now that the thought occurred to herperhaps her mother had not wished her to forget him  i did not suspect she heard him saying that you would go out into the world and create the beautiful gardens of which i have heard but you had no lack of spirit in those days too  i was a most disagreeable child perversecantankerousi can hear my mother saying it as for the gardensthey have given me something to do they have kept me out of mischief i suppose i ought to be thankful but i still have the rebellious streak when i see what others have done what others are doing and i sometimes wonder what right i ever had to think that i might create something worth while  he glanced at her quickly as she sat with bent head  others put a higher value on what you have done  oh they dont know she exclaimed  if something were revealed to him by her tone he did not betray it but went on cheerfully  you have been away a long time alison it must interest you to come back and see the changes in our western civilization we are moving very rapidlyin certain directions he corrected himself  she appraised his qualification  in certain directionsyes but they are little better in the east i have scarcely been back she added since i went to paris to study i have often thought i should like to return and stay awhile onlyi never seemed to get time now i am going over a garden for my father which was one of my first efforts and which has always reproached me  and you do not mind the heat he asked those who go east to live return to find our summers oppressive  oh im a salamander i think alison laughed  thus they sat chatting interrupted once or twice by urchins too small to join in the game who came running to mr bentley and stood staring at alison as at a being beyond the borders of experience and she would smile at them quite as shylychildren being beyond her own her imagination was as keen as unspoiled as a childs and was stimulated by a sense of adventure of the mystery which hung about this fine old gentleman who betrayed such sentiment for a mother whom she had loved and admired and still secretly mourned here if there had been no other was a compelling bond of sympathy  the shadows grew longer the game broke up and hodder surrounded by an argumentative group keeping pace with him came toward them from the field alison watched him curiously as he turned this way and that to answer the insistent questions with which he was pelted and once she saw him stride rapidly after a dodging delinquent and seize him by the collar amidst piercing yells of approval and derision for the rebel  its remarkable how he gets along with them said mr bentley smiling at the scene most of them have never known what discipline is  the chorus approached and hodder recognizing her dropped the collar he held a young woman conversing with mr bentleywas no unusual sighthe had made no speculations as to this ones identity he left the boys and drew near  you know miss parr i believe the old gentleman said  hodder took her hand he had often tried to imagine his feelings if he should meet her again what he should do and saywhat would be their footing and now he had no time to prepare  it is so strange she said with that note of wonder at life in her voice which he recalled so well that i should have come across mr bentley here after so many years how many years mr bentley  ah my dear he protested my measurements would not be yours  it is better for both of us not to say alison declared laughingly  you knew mr bentley asked hodder astonished  he was a very dear friend of my mothers although i used to appropriate him when he came to our house it was when we lived in ransome street ages ago but i dont think mr bentley has grown a bit older  he is one of the few who have found the secret of youth said the rector  but the old gentleman had moved off into the path or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he was carried off by the swarm which clustered around him two smaller ones tugging at his hand and all intent upon arriving at the sodawater pavilion near the entrance they had followed him with their eyes and they saw him turn around and smile at them helplessly alison presented a perplexed face to hodder  does he bring them hereor you she asked  i he hesitated mr bentley has done this every saturday afternoon for years he said i am merely one of them  she looked at him quickly they had started to follow in the cool path beneath the forest trees restraint fell upon them brought about by the memory of the intimacy of their former meeting further complicated on hodders part by his new attitude toward her father and his finding her in the company of all persons of mr bentley unuttered queries pressed on the minds of both  tell me about mr bentley she said  hodder hesitated  i scarcely know where to begin he replied yet smiling at the characteristic abruptness of her question the modulations of her voice revealed again the searching inquisitive spirit within her and his responded to the intensity of the interest in mr bentley  begin anywhere  anywhere he repeated seeking to gain time  yesanywhere she said impatiently  well he lives in dalton street if you recall what kind of a place that is she nodded and he is known from one end of it to the other  i see what he ishe is the most extraordinary person i have ever known just to talk to him gives one such a queer feeling ofof dissatisfaction with ones self and seeing him once more seems to have half revived in me a whole series of dead memories and i have been trying to think but it is all so tantalizing there is some mystery about him she insisted he disappeared suddenly and my mother never mentioned him but once afterward but other persons have spoken of him sincei forget who he was so well known and he used to go to st johns  yes he used to go to st johns  what happened to himdo you know the reason he stopped coming to our house was some misunderstanding with my father of course i am positive my mother never changed her feelings toward him  i can only tell you what he has told me which is all i knowauthoritatively hodder replied how could he say to her that her father had ruined mr bentley indeed with a woman of her fearlessness and honestyand above all her intuitionhe felt the cruelty of his position keenly hodder did not relish half truths and he felt that however scant his intercourse in the future might be with alison parr he would have liked to have kept it on that basis of frankness in which it had begun but the exact stage of disillusionment she had reached in regard to eldon parr was unknown to him and he feared that a further revelation might possibly sever the already precarious tie between father and daughter  he recounted therefore that mr bentley had failed and how he had before that given much of his estate away in charity how he had been unable to keep his pew in st johns and had retired to the house in dalton street  for some moments after he had finished alison did not reply  what is his number in dalton street she asked  hodder informed her  he could not read in her face whether she suspected that he could have told her more and in spite of an inordinate human joy in being again in her presence his desire to hide from her that which had taken place within him and the inability he felt to read his future were instinctive the more so because of the very spontaneity they had achieved at their first meeting as a man he shrank from confessing to her however indirectly the fact that she herself was so vital an element in his disillusionment for the conversation in the garden had been the immediate cause of the inner ferment ending in his resolution to go away and had directed him by logical steps to the encounter in the church with mrs garvin  you have not yet finished the garden he asked i imagined you back in the east by this time  oh i am procrastinating she replied it is a fit of sheer laziness i ought to be elsewhere but i was born without a conscience if i had one i should try to quiet it by reminding it that i am fulfilling a longdelayed promisei am making a garden for mrs larrabbee you know her of course since she is a member of your congregation  yes i know her he assented and his mind was suddenly filled with vivid colourcobalt seas and arsenicgreen spruces with purple cones cardinalstriped awnings that rattled in the salt breeze and he saw once more the panorama of the life which had passed from him and the woman in the midst of it and his overwhelming thought was of relief that he had somehow escaped in spite of his unhappiness now he would not have gone back he realized for the first time that he had been nearer annihilation then than today  grace isnt here to bother me with the ideas she has picked up in europe and catalogued alison continued  catalogued hodder exclaimed struck by the pertinency of the word  yes did you ever know anybody who had succeeded half so well in piecing together and absorbing into a harmonized whole all the divergent artificial elements that enter into the conventional world today her character might be called a triumph of synthesis for she has actually achieved an individualitythat is what always surprises me when i think of her she has put the puzzle picture together she has become a person  he remembered with a start that this was the exact word mrs larrabbee had used about alison parr if he had searched the world he could not have found a greater contrast than that between these two women and when she spoke again he was to be further struck by her power of logical insight  grace wants me because she thinks i have become the fashionfor the same reason that charlotte plimpton wants me only there is this differencegrace will know the exact value of what i shall have done not that she thinks me a le notrealison laughedwhat i mean is she sees behind she sees why it is fashionable to have a garden since she has worked out the values of that existence but there alison added with a provocative touch that did not escape him i am picking your parishioners to pieces again  you have more right than i he replied they have been your friends since childhood  i thought you had gone away she said  why he demanded had she been to church again  my father told me before he left that you were to take a cruise with him on the yacht he has chartered  he wrote me from new yorki was unable to go hodder said slowly  he felt her gaze upon him but resolutely refused to meet it they walked on in silence until they came to the more open spaces near the edge of the park thronged that saturday evening by crowds which had sought the citys breathing space perfect trees cast long fantastic shadows across the lawns fountains flung up rainbows from the midst of lakes children of the tenements darted hither and thither rolled and romped on the grass family parties picnicked everywhere and a very babel of tongues greeted the earthe languages of europe from sweden to italy  suddenly an exclamation from her aroused and thrilled him  isnt it wonderful how happy they are and with what simple pleasures they are satisfied i often come over here on saturdays and sundays just to talk to them  talk to them he echoed stupidly in their own languages  oh i know a little german and italian though i cant lay claim to czech she answered gayly why are you so surprised that i should possess such modest accomplishments  its not the accomplishments he hesitated  no you are surprised that i should be interested in humanity she stood facing him well i am she said half humorously half defiantly i believe i am more interested in human beings than in anything else in the worldwhen they are natural as these people are and when they will tell one their joys and their troubles and their opinions  enthusiasm selfassertion had as usual transformed her and he saw the colour glowing under her olive skin was she accusing him of a lack of frankness  and why he asked collecting himself did you think he got no further  its because you have an idea that im a selfish epicurean if that isnt tautologybecause im interested in a form of art the rest of the world can go hang you have a prejudice against artists i wish i really were one but im not  this speech contained so many surprises for him that he scarcely knew how to answer it  give me a little time he begged and perhaps ill get over my prejudices the worst of them at any rate you are helping me to do so he tried to speak lightly but his tone was more serious in the next sentence it seems to me personally that you have proved your concern for your fellowcreatures  her colour grew deeper her manner changed  that gives me the opportunity to say something i have hoped to say ever since i saw you i hoped i should see you again  you are not going away soon he exclaimed  the words were spoken before he grasped their significance  not at once i dont know how long i shall stay she answered hurriedly intent upon what was in her mind i have thought a great deal about what i said to you that afternoon and i find it more than ever difficult to excuse myself i shant attempt to i merely mean to ask you to forgive me  there is nothing to forgive he assured her under the influence of the feeling she had aroused  its nice of you to say so and to take it as you didnicer than i can express i am afraid i shall never learn to appreciate that there may be other points of view toward life than my own and i should have realized and sympathized with the difficulties of your position and that you were doing the best under the circumstances  no he exclaimed dont say that your other instinct was the truer one if indeed you have really changed iti dont believe you have he smiled at her again you didnt hurt my feelings you did me a service i told you so at the time and i meant it and more than that i understood  you understood  you were not criticizing me you werewhat shall i saymerely trying to iron out some of the inconsistencies of life well you helped me to iron out some of the inconsistencies of my own i am profoundly grateful  she gazed at him puzzled but he did not he could not enlighten her some day she would discover what he meant  if so i am glad she said in a low voice  they were standing in the midst of the crowd that thronged around the pavilion an urchin caught hold of the rectors coat  here he is say mr hodder aint you going to have any sody  certainly we are he replied returning alisons faint smile in the confusion that followed he caught a glimpse of her talking to mr bentley and later after he had taken her hand his eyes followed her figure wending its way in the evening light through the groups toward park street and he saw above the treetops the red tiled roof of the great house in which she was living alone     chapter xv the crucible   i  for better or worse john hodder had flung his treasured beliefs into the crucible and one by one he watched them crumble and consume away none but his own soul knew what it cost him to make the test and some times in the early stages of it he would cast down his book under the lamp and walk for hours in the night curiosity and the despair of one who is lost impelled him to persist  it had been said of him that he had a talent for the law and he now discovered that his mind once freed weighed the evidence with a pitiless logic paid its own tributedespite the anguish of the heartto the pioneers of truth whose trail it followed into the unknown who had held no mystery more sacred than truth itself who had dared to venture into the nothingness between the whirling worlds  he considered them those whirling worlds at night once they had been the candles of jehovah to light the path of his chosen nation to herald the birth of his son and now how many billions of blind struggling creatures clung to them where now was this pinpoint of humanity in the midst of an appalling spectacle of a grinding remorseless nature  and that obscure event on which he had staked his hopes was he as john had written the first born of the universe the word incarnate of a system that defied time and space the logos of an outworn philosophy was that universe conscious as berkeley had declared or the blind monster of substance alone or energy as some modern scientists brutally and triumphantly maintained where was the spirit that breathed in it of hope  such were some of the questions that thronged for solution what was mind what spirit an attenuated vapour of the allpervading substance  he could not permit himself to dwell on these thoughtsmadness lay that way madness and a watching demon that whispered of substance and sought to guide his wanderings in the night hodder clung to the shell of reality to the tiny panorama of the visible and the finite to the infinitesimal gropings that lay recorded before him on the printed page let him examine these first let him discoverdespite the pricewhat warrant the mind of man the only light now vouchsafed to him in his darkness gave him to speculate and to hope concerning the existence of a higher truer reality than that which now tossed and wounded him it were better to know  scarcely had the body been lifted from the tree than the disputes commenced the adulterations crept in the spontaneity the fire and zeal of the selfsacrificing itinerant preachers gave place to the paralyzing logic then pervading the roman empire and which had sent its curse down the ages to the modern sermon the geometrical rules of euclid were made to solve the secrets of the universe the simple faith of the cross which had inspired the martyr along the bloody way from ephesus to the circus at rome was formalized by degrees into philosophy the faith of future ages was settled by compromises by manipulation by bribery in councils of the church which resembled modern political conventions and in which pagan emperors did not hesitate to exert their influence over the metaphysical bishops of the factions recriminations executions murdersso the chronicles ran  the prophet the idealist disappeared the priest with his rites and ceremonies and sacrifices his power to save and damn was once more in possession of the world  the son of man was degraded into an infant in his mothers arms an unhealthy degenerating asceticism drawn from pagan sources began with the monks and anchorites of egypt and culminated in the spectacle of simeons pillar the mysteries of eleusis of attis mithras magna mater and isis developed into christian sacramentsthe symbol became the thing itself baptism the confession of the new life following the customs of these cults became initiation and from the same superstitious origins the repellent materialistic belief that to eat of the flesh and drink of the blood of a god was to gain immortality immortality of the body of course   ah when the superstitions of remote peoples the fables and myths were taken away when the manufactured history and determinism of the israelites from the fall of man to the coming of that messiah whom the jews crucified because he failed to bring them their material kingdom were discredited when the polemic and literal interpretations of evangelists had been rejected and the pious frauds of tampering monks when the ascetic buddhism was removed the cults and mysteries the dogmas of an ancient naive philosophy discarded the crude science of a ptolemy who conceived the earth as a flat terrestrial expanse and hell as a smoking pit beneath proved false the revelation of a holy city of jasper and gold and crystal the hierarchy with its divine franchise to save and rule and conquerwhen all these and more were eliminated from christianity what was left  hodder surveyed the ruins and his mind recalled that sunday of rain in new york which had been the turningpoint in his life when he had listened to the preacher when he had walked the streets unmindful of the wet led on by visions racked by fears and the same terror returned to him now after all the years of respite tenfold increased of falling in the sight of man from the topmost tower  what was to become of him now that the very driving power of life was gone where would he go to what might he turn his hand since all were vanity and illusion careers meant nothing had any indeed been possible to a man forty left staring at stark reality after the rainbow had vanished nineveh had mocked and conquered him who had thought himself a conqueror self flew back and swung on its central pivot and took command his future his fate what was to become of him who else now was to be considered and what was to restrain him from reaching out his hand to pluck the fruit which he desired    ii  what control from the unknown is this which now depresses and now releases the sensitive thing called the soul of man and sends it upward again until the green light of hope shines through the surface water he might have grown accustomed holder thought to the obscurity of the deeps in which after a while the sharp agony of existence became dulled the pressure benumbing he was conscious himself at such times of no inner recuperation something drew him up and he would find himself living again at length to recognize the hand if not to comprehend the power  the hand was horace bentleys  what was the source of that serenity which shone on the face of his friend was it the light of faith faith inwhat humanity mr bentley had told him on that first evening when they had met faith in a world filled with cruelties disillusionments lies and cheats on what authority was it based holder never asked and no word of theology ever crossed mr bentleys lips not by so much as a sign did he betray any knowledge he may have had of the drama taking place in holders soul no comment escaped him on the amazing anomalies of the life the rector was leading in the church but not of it  it was only by degrees holder came to understand that no question would be asked and the frequency of his visits to dalton street increased he directed his steps thither sometimes hurriedly as though pursued as to a haven from a storm and a haven it was indeed at all hours of the day he came and oftener in the night in those first weeks and if mr bentley were not at home the very sight of the hospitable old darky brought surging up within him a sense of security of relief the library itself was filled with the peace of its owner how many others had brought their troubles here had been lightened on the very threshold of this sanctuary  gradually hodder began to realize something of their numbers gradually as he was drawn more and more into the network of the relationships of this extraordinary mannay as he inevitably became a part of that networka period of bewilderment ensued he found himself involved and quite naturally in unpremeditated activities running errands forming human ties on a human basis no question was asked no credentials demanded or rejected who he was made no differencehe was a friend of horace bentleys he had less time to read less time to think to scan the veil of his future  he had run through a score of volumes critical philosophical scientific absorbing their contents eagerly anticipating their conclusions filled once he had begun with a mania to destroy a savage determination to leave nothingto level all  and now save for the less frequent relapsing moods he had grown strangely unconcerned about his future content to live in the presence of this man to ignore completely the aspects of a life incomprehensible to the few besides mr bentley who observed it  what he now mostly felt was relief if not a faint selfcongratulation that he had had the courage to go through with it to know the worst and he was conscious even at times of a faint reviving sense of freedom he had not known since the days at bremerton if the old dogmas were false why should he regret them he began to see that once he had suspected their falsity not to have investigated were to invite decay and he pictured himself growing more unctuous apologetic plausible he had at any rate escaped the more despicable fate and if he went to pieces now it would be as a man looking the facts in the facenot as a coward and a hypocrite  late one afternoon when he dropped in at mr bentleys house he was informed by sam that a lady was awaiting mr bentley in the library as hodder opened the door he saw a tall slim figure of a woman with her back toward him she was looking at the photographs on the mantel  it was alison parr  he remembered now that she had asked for mr bentleys number but it had never occurred to him that he might one day find her here and as she turned he surprised in her eyes a shyness he had never seen in them before thus they stood gazing at each other a moment before either spoke  oh i thought you were mr bentley she said  have you been waiting long he asked  three quarters of an hour but i havent minded it this is such an interesting room with its pictures and relics and books it has a soothing effect hasnt it to come here is like stepping out of the turmoil of the modern world into a peaceful past  he was struck by the felicity of her description  you have been here before he asked  yes she settled herself in the armchair and hodder accepting the situation took the seat beside her of course i came after i had found out who mr bentley was the opportunity to know him againwas not to be missed  i can understand that he assented  that is if a child can even be said to know such a person as mr bentley naturally i didnt appreciate him in those dayschildren merely accept without analyzing and i have not yet been able to analyzei can only speculate and consider  her enthusiasm never failed to stir and excite hodder nor would he have thought it possible that a new value could be added to mr bentley in his eyes yet so it was  he felt within him as she spoke the quickening of a stimulus  when i came in a little while ago alison continued i found a woman in black with such a sweet sad face we began a conversation she had been through a frightful experience her husband had committed suicide her child had been on the point of death and she says that she lies awake nights now thinking in terror of what might have happened to her if you and mr bentley hadnt helped her shes learning to be a stenographer do you remember herher name is garvin  did she sayanything more hodder anxiously demanded  no said alison surprised by his manner except that mr bentley had found her a place to live near the hospital with a widow who was a friend of his and that the child was well and she could look life in the face again oh it is terrible to think that people all around us are getting into such straits and that we are so indifferent to it  hodder did not speak at once he was wondering now that she had renewed her friendship with mr bentley whether certain revelations on her part were not inevitable  she was regarding him and he was aware that her curiosity was aflame again he wondered whether it were curiosity orinterest  you did not tell me when we met in the park that you were no longer at st johns  did mr bentley tell you  no he merely said he saw a great deal of you martha preston told me she is still here and goes to church occasionally she was much surprised to learn that you were in the city  i am still living in the parish house he said i amtaking my vacation  with mr bentley her eyes were still on his face  with mr bentley he replied  he had spoken without bitterness although there had indeed been bitterness in his soul it passed away in the atmosphere of mr bentleys house the process now taking place in him was the same complication of negative and positive currents he had felt in her presence before he was surprised to find that his old antipathy to agnosticism held over in her case to discover now that he was by no means as yet in view of the existence of horace bentley to go the full length of unbelief on the other hand he saw that she had divined much of what had happened to him and he felt radiating from her a sympathetic understanding which seemed almost a claim she had a claim although he could not have said of what it was constituted their personal relationship bore responsibilities it suddenly came over him in fact that the two persons who in all the world were nearest him were herself and mr bentley he responded scarce knowing why he did so to the positive current  with mr bentley he repeated smiling and meeting her eyes i have been learning something about the actual conditions of life in a modern city  she bent a little toward him in one of those spontaneous movements that characterized her  tell mewhat is his life she asked i have seen so little of it and he has told me nothing himself at first in the park i saw only a kindly old gentleman with a wonderful restful personality who had been a dear friend of my mothers i didnt connect those boys with him but since thensince i have been here twice i have seen other things which make me wonder how far his influence extends she paused  i too have wondered said the rector thoughtfully when i met him i supposed he were merely living in simple relationships with his neighbours here in dalton street but by degrees i have discovered that his relationships are as wide as the city itself and they have grown naturallyby radiation as it were one incident has led to another one act of kindness to another until now there seems literally no end to the men and women with whom he is in personal touch who are ready to do anything in their power for him at any time it is an institution in fact wholly unorganized which in the final analysis is one man and there is in it absolutely nothing of that element which has come to be known as charity  alison listened with parted lips  to give you an example he went on gradually be coming fired by his subject by her absorption since you have mentioned mrs garvin i will tell you what happened in that case it is typical of many it was a question of taking care of this woman who was worn out and crushed until she should recover sufficiently to take care of herself mr bentley did not need any assistance from me to get the boy into the hospitaldr jarvis worships him but the mother i might possibly have got her into an institutional homemr bentley did better than that far better on the day of the funeral we went directly from the cemetery to the house of a widow who owns a little fruit farm beyond the park her name is bledsoe and it is not an exaggeration to say that her house small as it is contains an endowed room always at mr bentleys disposal  mrs garvin is there now she was received as a friend as a guestnot as an inmate a recipient of charity i shall never forget how that woman ran out in the sun when she saw us coming how proud she was to be able to do this thing how she ushered us into the little parlour that was all swept and polished and how naturally and warmly she welcomed the other woman dazed and exhausted and took her hat and veil and almost carried her up the stairs and later on i found out from miss grower who lives here mrs bledsoes history eight or nine years ago her husband was sent to prison for forgery and she was left with four small children on the verge of a fate too terrible to mention she was brought to mr bentleys attention and he started her in life  and now mrs garvin forms another link to that chain which goes on growing in a month she will be earning her own living as stenographer for a grain merchant whom mr bentley set on his feet several years ago one thing has led to the next andi doubt if any neighbourhood could be mentioned north or south or west or even in the business portion of the city itself where men and women are not to be found ready and eager to do anything in their power for him of course there have been exceptions what might be called failures in the ordinary terminology of charity but there are not many  when he had finished she sat quite still musing over what he had told her her eyes alight  yes it is wonderful she said at length in a low voice oh i can believe in that making the world a better place to live in making people happier of course every one cannot be like mr bentley but all may do their share in their own way if only we could get rid of this senseless system of government that puts a premium on the acquisition of property as it is we have to depend on individual initiative even the good mr bentley does is a drop in the ocean compared to what might be done if all this machinerywhich has been invented if all these discoveries of science by which the forces of an indifferent nature have been harnessed could be turned to the service of all mankind think of how many mrs garvins of how many dalton streets there are in the world how many stunted children working in factories or growing up into criminals in the slums i was reading a book just the other day on the effect of the lack of nutrition on character we are breeding a million degenerate citizens by starving them to say nothing of the effect of disease and bad air of the constant fear of poverty that haunts the great majority of homes there is no reason why that fear should not be removed why the latest discoveries in medicine and science should not be at the disposal of all  the genuineness of her passion was unmistakable his whole being responded to it  have you always felt like this he asked  like what  indignantthat so many people were suffering  his question threw her into reflection  why no she answered at length i never thoughti see what you mean four or five years ago when i was going to socialist lectures my sense of all thisinequality injustice was intellectual i didnt get indignant over it as i do now when i think of it  and why do you get indignant now  you mean she asked that i have no right to be indignant since i do nothing to attempt to better conditions  not at all hodder disavowed perhaps my question is too personal but i didnt intend it to be i was merely wondering whether any event or series of events had transformed a mere knowledge of these conditions into feeling  oh she exclaimed but not in offence once more she relapsed into thought and as he watched her in silence the colour that flowed and ebbed in her cheeks registered the coming and going of memories of incidents in her life hidden from him arousing in the man the torture of jealousy but his faculties keenly alert grasped the entire field marked once more the empirical trait in her that he loved her unflinching willingness to submit herself to an experiment  i suppose so she replied at length her thoughts naturally assuming speech yes i can see that it is so yet my experience has not been with these conditions with which mr bentley with which you have been brought in contact but with the other sidewith luxury oh i am sick of luxury i love it i am not at all sure that i could do without it but i hate it too i rebel against it you cant understand that  i think i can he answered her  when i see the creatures it makes she cried i hate it my profession has brought me in such close contact with it that i rebelled at last and came out here very suddenly just to get away from it in the mass to renew my youth if i could the gardens were only an excuse i had come to a point where i wanted to be quiet to be alone to think and i knew my father would be going away so much of my girlhood was spent in that park that i know every corner of it and iobeyed the impulse i wanted to test it  yes he said absorbed  i might have gone to the mountains or the sea but some one would have come and found me and i should have been bound againon the wheel i shouldnt have had the strength to resist but herehave you ever felt she demanded that you craved a particular locality at a certain time  he followed her still  that is how i felt these associations that park the thought of my girlhood of my mother who understood me as no one else has since assumed a certain value new york became unbearable it is just there in the very centre of our modern civilization that one sees the crudest passions oh i have often wondered whether a man however disillusioned could see new york as a woman sees it when the glamour is gone we are the natural prey of the conqueror still we dream of independence  she broke off abruptly  this confession with the sudden glimpse it gave him of the fires within her that would not die down but burned now more fiercely than ever sent the blood to his head his face his temples were hot with the fierceness of his joy in his conviction that she had revealed herself to him why she had done so he could not say this was the woman whom the world thought composed who had triumphed over its opposition compelled it to bow before her who presented to it that selfpossessed unified personality by which he had been struck at their first meeting yet paradoxically the personality remainedwas more elusive than before a thousand revelations he felt would not disclose it  he was no nearer to solving it now yet the fires burned she too like himself was aflame and unsatisfied she too had tasted success and had revolted  but i dont get anywhere she said wearily at times i feel this ferment this anger that things are as they are only to realize what helpless anger it is why not take the world as it appears and live and feel instead of beating against the currents  but isnt that inconsistent with what you said awhile ago as to a new civilization hodder asked  oh that utopia has no reality for me i think it has at moments but it fades and i dont pretend to be consistent mr bentley lives in a world of his own i envy him with all my heart i love and admire him he cheers and soothes me when i am with him but i cant seewhatever he sees i am only aware of a remorseless universe grinding out its destinies we anglosaxons are fond of deceiving ourselves about life of dressing it up in beautiful colours of making believe that it actually contains happiness all our fiction reflects thisthat is why i never cared to read english or american novels the continental school the russians the frenchmen refuse to be deluded they are honest  realism naturalism he mused recalling a course in philosophy one would expect the russian in the conditions under which he lives possessing an artistic temperament combined with a paralysis of the initiative and a sense of fate to write in that way and the frenchmen renan zola and the others who have followed are equally deterministic but viewing the human body as a highly organized machine with which we may amuse ourselves by registering its sensations these literatures are true in so far as they reflect the characteristics of the nations from which they spring that is not to say that the philosophies of which they are the expressions are true nor is it to admit that such a literature is characteristic of the spirit of america and can be applied without change to our life and atmosphere we have yet i believe to develop our own literature which will come gradually as we find ourselves  find ourselves she repeated  yes isnt that what we are trying to do we are not determinists or fatalists and to condemn us to such a philosophy would be to destroy us we live on hope in spite of our apparent materialism we are idealists and is it not possible to regard nature as governed by lawsremorseless if you like the wordand yet believe with kant and goethe that there is an inner realm you yourself struggleyou cling to ideals  ideals she echoed ideals are useless unless one is able to see to feel something beyond this ruthless mechanism by which we are surrounded and hemmed in to have some perception of another scheme why struggle unless we struggle for something definite oh i dont mean heavenly rewards nothing could be more insipid and senseless than the orthodox view of the hereafter i am talking about a scheme of life here and now  so am i answered hodder but may there not be a meaning in this very desire we have to struggle against the order of things as it appears to us  a meaning  a little while ago you spoke of your indignation at the inequalities and injustices of the world and when i asked you if you had always felt this you replied that this feeling had grown upon you my question is this whether that indignation would be present at all if it were not meant to be turned into action  you believe that an influence is at work an influence that impels us against our reason  i should like to think so he said why should so many persons be experiencing such a feeling today persons who like yourself are the beneficiaries of our present system of privilege why should you who have every reason to be satisfied materially with things as they are be troubling yourself with thoughts of others who are lessfortunate and why should we have the spectacle today of men and women all over this country in social work in science and medicine and politics striving to better conditions while most of them might be much more comfortable and luxurious letting well enough alone  but its human to care she objected  ahhuman he said and was silent what do we mean by human unless it is the distinguishing mark of something within us that the natural world doesnt possess unless it is the desire and willingness to strive for a larger interest than the individual interest work and suffer for others and you spoke of making people happier what do you mean by happiness not merely the possession of material comforts surely i grant you that those who are overworked and underfed who are burning with the consciousness of wrongs who have no outlook ahead are essentially hopeless and miserable but by happiness you mean something more than the complacency and contentment which clothing and food might bring and the removal of the economic fearand even the restoration of selfrespect  that their lives should be fuller she exclaimed  that drudgery and despair should be replaced by interest and hope he went on slavery by freedom in other words that the whole attitude toward life should be changed that life should appear a bright thing rather than a dark thing that labour should be willing vicarious instead of forced and personal otherwise any happiness worth having is out of the question  she was listening now with parted lips apparently unconscious of the fixity of her gaze  you mean it is a choice between that or nothing she said in a low voice that there is no use in lifting people out of the treadmilland removing the terror of poverty unless you can give them something morethan i have got  and something morethan i have gothe was suddenly moved to reply  presently while the silence still held between them the door opened and startled them into reality mr bentley came in  the old gentleman gave no sign as they rose to meet him of a sense of tension in the atmosphere he had enteredyet each feltsomehow that he knew the tension was released the same thought occurred to both as they beheld the peaceful welcome shining in his face here is what we are seeking why try to define it  to think that i have been gossiping with mrs meyer while you were waiting for me he said she keeps the little florists shop at the corner of tower street and she gave me these i little guessed what good use i should have for them my dear  he held out to her three fragrant crimson roses that matched the responsive colour in her cheeks as she thanked him and pinned them on her gown he regarded her an instant  but im sure mr hodder has entertained you mr bentley turned and laid his hand on the rectors shoulder  most successfully said alison cutting short his protest and she smiled at hodder faintly      chapter xvi amid the encircling gloom   i  hodder in spite of a pressing invitation to remain for supper had left them together he turned his face westward in the opposite direction from the parish house still under the spell of that moment of communion which had lastedhe knew not how long a moment of silent revelation to them both she too was stormtossed she too who had fared forth so gallantly into life had conquered only to be beaten downto lose her way  this discovery strained the very fibres of his being so close he had been to herso close that each had felt simultaneously complete comprehension of the other comprehension that defied words overbore disagreements he knew that she had felt it he walked on at first in a bewildered ecstasy careless of aught else save that in a moment they two had reached out in the darkness and touched hands never had his experience known such communion never had a woman meant what this woman meant and yet he could not define that meaning what need of religion of faith in an unseen order when this existed to have this woman in the midst of chaos would be enough  faith in an unseen order as he walked his mind returned to the argument by which he had sought to combat her doubtsand his own whence had the argument come it was new to himhe had never formulated it beforethat pity and longing and striving were a justification and a proof had she herself inspired by some unknown psychological law this first attempt of his to reform the universe this theory which he had rather spoken than thought or had it been the knowledge of her own longing and his desire to assuage it as twilight fell as his spirits ebbed he could not apply it nowit meant nothing to him evaded him there was in it no solace to regain his footing once more to climb again without this woman whom he needed and might not have better to fall to be engulfed the vision of her tall and straight with the roses on her breast tortured him  thus ecstasy ebbed to despondency he looked around him in the fading day to find himself opposite the closed gates of the botanical gardens in the southwestern portion of the city an hour later he had made his way back to dalton street with its sputtering blue lights and gliding figures and paused for a moment on the far sidewalk to gaze at mr bentleys gleaming windows should he go in had that personality suddenly lost its power over him how strange that now he could see nothing glowing nothing inspiring within that houseonly a kindly old man reading a newspaper  he walked on slowly to feel stealing on him that desperate longing for adventure which he had known so well in his younger days and he did not resist the terror with which it had once inspired him was gone or lingered only in the form of a delicious sense of uncertainty and anticipation anything might happen to himanything would be grateful the thought of his study in the parish house was unbearable the dalton street which had mocked and repelled him suddenly became alluring with its champaigns of light and inviting stretches of darkness in the block ahead rising out of the night like a tower blazing with a hundred beacons hodder saw a hotel heard the faint yet eager throbbing of music beheld silhouetted figures flitting from automobiles and carriages across the white glare of the pavementfigures of men and women  he hastened his steps the music grew louder and louder in his ears he gained the ornamental posts crowned by their incandescent globes made his way through the loiterers descended the stone steps of the restaurant and stood staring into it as at a blurred picture the band crashed a popular twostep above the mingled voices and laughter he sat down at a vacant table near the door and presently became aware that a waiter had been for some time at his elbow  what will you have sir  then he remembered that he had not eaten discovered that he was hungry and ordered some sandwiches and beer still staring the figures began to differentiate themselves although they all appeared somehow in perpetual motion hurrying though seated it was like gazing at a quivering cinematograph here and there ribbons of smoke curled upward adding volume to the blue cloud that hung over the tables which in turn was dissipated in spots by the industrious electric fans everywhere he looked he met the glances of women even at the table next him they were not so absorbed in their escorts as to be able to resist flinging him covert stares between the shrieks of laughter in which they intermittently indulged the cumulative effect of all these faces was intoxicating and for a long time he was unable to examine closely any one group what he saw was a composite woman with flushed cheeks and soliciting eyes becomingly gowned and hattedto the masculine judgment on the walls heavily frescoed in the german style he read in gothic letters            wer liebt nicht wein weib and gesang           er bleibt ein narr sein leben lang  the waiter brought the sandwiches and beer yet he did not eat in the middle distance certain figures began insistently to stand outfigures of women sitting alone wherever he looked he met a provoking gaze one woman a little farther away than the rest seemed determinedly bent on getting a nod of recognition and it was gradually borne in upon hodders consciousness that her features were familiar in avoiding her eyes he studied the men at the next tableor rather one of them who loudly ordered the waiters about who told brief anecdotes that were uproariously applauded whose pudgy bejewelled fingers were continually feeling for the bottle in the ice beside his chair or nudging his companions with easy familiarity whose little eyes set in a heavy face lighted now and again with a certain expression  suddenly hodder pushed back his chair and got to his feet overcome by a choking sensation like that of being asphyxiated by foul gases he must get out at once or faint what he had seen in the mans eyes had aroused in him sheer terror for it was the image of something in his own soul which had summarily gained supremacy and led him hither unresisting to its own abidingplace in vain he groped to reconstruct the process by which that other spiritwhich he would fain have believed his true spirithad been drugged and deadened in its very flight  he was aware as he still stood uncertainly beside the table of the whiteaproned waiter looking at him and of some one elsethe woman whose eyes had been fastened on him so persistently she was close beside him speaking to him  seems to me weve met before  he looked at her at first uncomprehendingly then with a dawning realization of her identity even her name came to him unexpectedlykate marcythe woman in the flat  aint you going to invite me to have some supper she whispered eagerly furtively as one accustomed to be rebuffed yet bold in spite of it theyll throw me out if they think im accosting you  how was it that a moment ago she had appeared to him mysterious inviting at this range he could only see the paint on her cheeks the shadows under her burning eyes the shabby finery of her gown her wonderful bronze hair only made the contrast more pitiful he acted automatically drawing out for her the chair opposite his own and sat down again  say but im hungry she exclaimed pulling off her gloves she smiled at him wanly yet with a brazen coquettishness become habit  hungry he repeated idly  i guess youd be if youd only had a fried egg and a cup of coffee today and nothing last night  he pushed over to her hastily with a kind of horror the plate of sandwiches she began eating them ravenously but presently paused and thrust them back toward him he shook his head  whats the matter with you she demanded  nothing he replied  you ordered them didnt you aint you eating anything  im not hungry he said  she continued eating awhile without comment and he watched her as one fascinated oblivious to his surroundings in a turmoil of thought and emotion  im dry she announced meaningly  he hesitated a moment and then gave her the bottle of beer she made a wry face as she poured it out  have they run out of champagne she inquired  this time he did not hesitate the women of his acquaintance at the dinner parties he attended drank champagne why should he refuse it to this woman a longnosed mediaevallooking waiter was hovering about one of those bizarre battered creatures who have long exhausted the surprises of life presiding over this amazing situation with all the sang froid of a family butler hodder told him to bring champagne  what kind sir he asked holding out a card  the best you have  the woman stared at him in wonder  youre what an english johnny i know would call a little bit of all right she declared with enthusiastic approval  since you are hungry he went on suppose you have something more substantial than sandwiches what would you like  she did not answer at once amazement grew in her eyes amazement and a kind of fear  quit joshing she implored him and he found it difficult to cope with her style of conversation for a while she gazed helplessly at the bill of fare  i guess youll think its funny she said hesitatingly but i feel just like a good beefsteak and potatoes bring a thick one walter  the waiter sauntered off  why should i think it strange hodder asked  well if you knew how many evenings ive sat up there in my room and thought what id order if i ever again got hold of some rich guy whod loosen up there aint any use trying to put up a bluff with you nothing was too good for me once caviar pate de foie gras her pronunciation is not to be imitated chicken casserole peach melba filet of beef with mushroomsive had em all and i used to sit up and say id hand out an order like that you never do what you think youre going to do in this life  the truth of this remark struck him with a force she did not suspect stung him as it were into a sense of reality  and now she added pathetically all t want is a beefsteak dont that beat you  she appeared so genuinely surprised at this somewhat contemptible trick fate had played her that hodder smiled in spite of himself  i didnt recognize you at first in that getup she observed looking at his blue serge suit so youve dropped the preacher business have you youre wise all right  why do you say that he asked  didnt i tell you when you came round that time that you werent like the rest of em youre too human  once more the word and on her lips startled him  some of the best men i have ever known the broadest and most understanding men have been clergymen he found himself protesting  well they havent dropped in on me the only one i ever saw that measured up to something like that was you and now youve chucked it  had he as she expressed the matter chucked it her remark brought him reluctantly fearfully remorselesslyagitated and unprepared as he wasface to face with his future  you were too good for the job she declared what is there in it there aint nobody converted these days that i can see and whats the use of gettin up and preach into a lot of sapheads that dont know what religion is sure they dont  do you he asked  youve called my bluff she laughed say do you if there was anything in it youd have kept on preachin to that bunch and made some of em believe they was headed for hell youd have made one of em that owns the flat house i live in who gets fancy rents out of us poor girls give it up thats a nice kind of business for a church member aint it  owns the house in which you live  sure she smiled at him compassionately pitying his innocence and ignorance now i come to think of it i guess he dont go to your churchits the big baptist church on the boulevard but whats the difference  none said hodder despondently  she regarded him curiously  you remember when you dropped in that night when the kid was sick  he nodded  well now you aint in the business any more i may as well tell you you kind of got in on me i was sorry for youhonest i was i couldnt believe at first you was on the level but it didnt take me long to see that they had goldbricked you too i saw you werent wise to what they were  you thought he began and paused dumfounded  why not she retorted it looked easy to meyour line how was i to know at first that they had you fooled how was i to know you wasnt in the game  the game  say what else is it but a game you must be on now aint you why do they put up to keep the churches going there aint any coupons coming out of em  maybe some of these millionaires think they can play all the horses and winget into heaven and sell gold bricks on the side but i guess most of em dont think about heaven they just use the church for a front and take in strangers in the back alleydowntown  hodder was silent overwhelmed by the brutal aptness of her figures nor did he take the trouble of a defence of pointing out that hers was not the whole truth what really matteredhe sawwas what she and those like her thought such minds were not to be disabused by argument and indeed he had little inclination for it then  theres nothing in it  by this expression he gathered she meant life and some hidden impulse bade him smile at her  there is this he answered  she opened her mouth closed it and stared at him struck by his expression striving uneasily to fathom hidden depths in his remark  i dont get on to you she said lamely i didnt that other time i never ran across anybody like you  he tried to smile again  you mustnt mind me he answered  they fell into an oasis of silence surrounded by mad music and laughter then came the longnosed waiter carrying the beefsteak aloft followed by a lad with a bucket of ice from which protruded the green and gold neck of a bottle the plates were put down the beefsteak carved the champagne opened and poured out with a flourish the woman raised her glass  heres how she said with an attempt at gayety and she drank to him its funny how i ran across you again aint it she threw back her head and laughed  he raised his glass tasted the wine and put it down again a sheet of fire swept through him  whats the matter with it is it corked she demanded it goes to the right spot with me  it seems very good he said trying to smile and turning to the food on his plate the very idea of eating revolted himand yet he made the attempt he had a feeling ill defined that consequences of vital importance depended upon this attempt on his natural acceptance of the situation and while he strove to reduce the contents of his plate he racked his brain for some subject of conversation the flamboyant walls of the room pressed in on every side comment of that which lay within their limits was impossiblebut he could not somehow get beyond them was there in the whole range of life one easy topic which they might share in common yet a bond existed between this woman and himselfa bond of which he now became aware and which seemed strangely to grow stronger as the minutes passed and no words were spoken why was it that she too to whom speech came so easily had fallen dumb he began to long for some remark however disconcerting the tension increased  she put down her knife and fork tears sprang into her eyestears of anger he thought  say its no use trying to put up a bluff with me she cried  why do you say that he asked  you know what i mean all right what did you come in here for anyway  i dont knowi couldnt tell you he answered  the very honesty of his words seemed for an instant to disconcert her and she produced a torn lace handkerchief which she thrust in her eyes  why cant you leave me alone she demanded im all right  if he did not at once reply it was because of some inner change which had taken place in himself and he seemed to see things suddenly in their true proportions he no longer feared a scene and its consequences by virtue of something he had cast off or taken on he was aware of a newly acquired mastery of the situation and by a hidden and unconscious process he had managed to get at the real woman behind the paint had beaten down as it were without a siege her defences and he was incomparably awed by the sight of her quivering frightened self  her weeping grew more violent he saw the people at the next table turn and stare heard the men laughing harshly for the spectacle was evidently not an uncommon one here she pushed away her unfinished glass gathered up her velvet bag and rose abruptly  i guess i aint hungry after all she said and started toward the door he turned to the waiter who regarded him unmoved and asked for a check  ill get it he said  hodder drew out a ten dollar bill and told him to keep the change the waiter looked at him some impulse moved him to remark as he picked up the rectors hat  dont let her put it over you sir  hodder scarcely heard him he hurried up the steps and gained the pavement and somewhere in the black shadows beyond the arclights he saw her disappearing down the street careless of all comment he hastened on overtook her and they walked rapidly side by side now and again he heard a sob but she said nothing thus they came to the house where the garvins had lived and passed it and stopped in front of the dimly lighted vestibule of the flats next door in drawing the key from her bag she dropped it he picked it up and put it in the lock himself she led the way without comment up the darkened stairs and on the landing produced another key opened the door of her rooms fumbled for the electric button and suddenly the place was flooded with light he glanced in and recoiled    ii  oddly enough the first thing he noticed in the confusion that reigned was the absence of the piano two chairs were overturned and one of them was broken a siphon of vichy lay on the floor beside a crushed glass and two or three of the cheap ornaments that had been swept off the mantel and broken on the gaudy tiles of the hearth he glanced at the woman who had ceased crying and stood surveying the wreckage with the calmness the philosophic nonchalance of a class that comes to look upon misfortune as inevitable  they didnt do a thing to this place did they was her comment there was two guys in here tonight who got a notion they were funny  hodder had thought to have fathomed all the horrors of her existence but it was not until he looked into this room that the bottomless depths of it were brought home to him could it be possible that the civilization in which he lived left any human being so defenceless as to be at the mercy of the ghouls who had been here the very stale odours of the spilled whiskey seemed the material expression of the essence of degraded souls for a moment it overpowered him then came the imperative need of action and he began to right one of the chairs she darted forward  cut it out she cried what business have you got coming in here and straightening up i was a fool to bring you anyway  it was in her eyes that he read her meaning and yet could not credit it he was abashedashamed nay he could not define the feeling in his breast he knew that what he read was the true interpretation of her speech for in some mannerhe guessed not howshe had begun to idealize him to feel that the touch of these things defiled him  i believe i invited myself he answered with attempted cheerfulness then it struck him in his predicament that this was precisely what others had done  when you asked me a little while ago whether i had left the church i let you think i had i am still connected with st johns but i do not know how long i shall continue to be  she was on her knees with dustpan and whiskbroom cleaning up the fragments of glass on the stained carpet and she glanced up at him swiftly diviningly  sayyoure in trouble yourself aint you  she got up impulsively spilling some of the contents of the pan a subtle change had come in her and under the gallantly drooping feathers of her hat he caught her eyethe human eye that so marvellously reflects the phases of the human soul the eye which so short a time before hardily and brazenly had flashed forth its invitation now actually shone with fellowship and sympathy and for a moment this look was more startling more appalling than the other he shrank from it resented it even more was it true that they had something in common and if so was it sin or sorrow or both  i might have known she said staring at him in spite of his gesture of dissent he saw that she was going over the events of the evening from her new point of view  i might have known when we were sitting there in harrods that you were up against it too but i couldnt think of anything but the way i was fixed the agents been here twice this week for the rent and i was kind of desperate for a square meal  hodder took the dustpan from her hand and flung its contents into the fireplace  then we are both fortunate he said to have met each other  i dont see where you come in she told him  he turned and smiled at her  do you remember when i was here that evening about two months ago i said i should like to be your friend well i meant it and i have often hoped since then that some circumstance might bring us together again you seemed to think that no friendship was possible between us but i have tried to make myself believe that you said so because you didnt know me  honest to god she asked is that on the level  i only ask for an opportunity to prove it he replied striving to speak naturally he stooped and laid the dustpan on the hearth there now lets sit down  she sank on the sofa her breast rising and falling her gaze dumbly fixed on him as one under hypnosis he took the rocker  i have wanted to tell you how grateful mrs garvin the boys motherwas for the roses you brought she doesnt know who sent them but i intend to tell her and she will thank you herself she is living out in the country and the boyyou would scarcely recognize him  i couldnt play the piano for a week afterthat thing happened she glanced at the space where the instrument had stood  you taught yourself to play he asked  i had music lessons  music lessons  not herebefore i left homeup the state in a little country townmadison it seems like a long time ago but its only seven years in september mother and father wanted all of us children to know a little more than they did and i guess they pinched a good deal to give us a chance i went a year to the high school and then i was all for coming to the cityi couldnt stand madison there wasnt anything going on mother was against itsaid i was too goodlooking to leave home i wish i never had you wouldnt believe i was goodlooking once would you  she spoke dispassionately not seeming to expect assent but hodder glanced involuntarily at her wonderful crown of hair she had taken off her hat he was thinking of the typical crime of american parentsand suddenly it struck him that her speech had changed that she had dropped the suggestive slang of the surroundings in which she now lived  i was a fool to come but i couldnt see it then all i could think of was to get away to a place where something was happening i wanted to get into fergusonseverybody in madison knew about fergusons what a grand store it wasbut i couldnt and after a while i got a place at the embroidery counter at pratts thats a department store too you know it looked fine but it wasnt long before i fell wise to a few things she relapsed into slang occasionally have you ever tried to stand on your feet for nine hours where you couldnt sit down for a minute say when florry kinsley and meshe was the girl i roomed withwould get home at night often wed just lie down and laugh and cry we were so tired and our feet hurt so we were too used up sometimes to get up and cook supper on the little stove we had and sitting around a back bedroom all evening was worse than madison wed go out tired as we were and walk the streets  he nodded impressed by the fact that she did not seem to be appealing to his sympathy nor indeed did she appearin thus picking up the threads of her pastto be consciously accounting for her present she recognized no causation there  say did you ever get to a place where you just had to have something happen when you couldnt stand bein lonely night after night when you went out on the streets and saw everybody on the way to a good time but you we used to look in the newspapers for notices of the big balls and wed take the cars to the west end and stand outside the awnings watching the carriages driving up and the people coming in and the same with the weddings we got to know a good many of the swells by sight there was mrs larrabbeea certain awe crept into her voiceand miss fergusonshes sweetand a lot more some of the girls used to copy their clothes and hats but florry and me tried to live honest it was funny she added irrelevantly but the more worn out we were at night the more wed want a little excitement and we used to go to the dancehalls and keep going until we were ready to drop  she laughed at the recollection  there was a floorwalker who never let me alone the whole time i was at prattshe put me in mind of a pallbearer his name was selkirk and he had a family in westerly out on the grade suburban some of the girls never came back at all except to swagger in and buy expensive things and tell us we were fools to work and after a while i noticed florry was getting discouraged we never had so much as a nickel left over on saturdays and they made us sign a paper when they hired us that we lived at home it was their excuse for paying us six dollars a week they do it at fergusons too they say they can get plenty of girls who do live at home i made up my mind id go back to madison but i kept putting it off and then father died and i couldnt  and then one day florry left she took her things from the room when i was at the store and i never saw her again i got another roommate i couldnt afford to pay for the room alone you wouldnt believe i kept straight would you she demanded with a touch of her former defiance i had plenty of chances better than that floorwalker but i knew i was good looking and i thought if i could only hold out i might get married to some fellow who was well fixed whats the matter  hodders exclamation had been involuntary for in these last words she had unconsciously brought home to him the relentless predicament in the lives of these women she had been saving herselffor what a more advantageous sale  its always been my luck she went on reflectingly that when what i wanted to happen did happen i never could take advantage of it it was just like that tonight when you handed me out the bill of fare and i ordered beefsteak and it was like that whenwhen he came alongi didnt do what i thought i was going to do its terrible to fall in love isnt it i mean the real thing ive read in books that it only comes once and i guess its so  fortunately she seemed to expect no answer to this query she was staring at the wall with unseeing eyes  i never thought of marrying him from the first he could have done anything with mehe was so good and generousand it was him i was thinking about thats love isnt it maybe you dont believe a woman like me knows what love is youve got a notion that goin downhill as ive been doing kills it havent you i wish to god it didbut it dont the aches there and sometimes it comes in the daytime and sometimes at night and i think ill go crazy when a woman like me is in love there isnt anything more terrible on earth i tell you if a girls respectable and good its bad enough god knows if she cant have the man she wants but when shes like meits hell thats the only way i can describe it she feels there is nothing about her thats clean that he wouldnt despise theres many a night i wished i could have done what garvin did but i didnt have the nerve  dont say that he commanded sharply  why not its the best way out  i can see how one might believe it to be he answered indeed it seemed that his vision had been infinitely extended that he had suddenly come into possession of the solution of all the bewildered despairing gropings of the human soul only awhile ago for instance the mood of selfdestruction had been beyond his imagination tonight he understood it though he still looked upon it with horror and he saw that his understanding of heror of any human beingcould never be of the intellect he had entered into one of those astounding yet simple relationships wherein truth and truth alone is possible he knew that such women lied deceived themselves he could well conceive that the image of this first lover might have become idealized in her vicissitudes that the memories of the creaturecomforts of first passion might have enhanced as the victim sank it was not only because she did not attempt to palliate that he believed her  i remember the time i met himit was only four years ago last spring but it seems like a lifetime it was decoration day and it was so beautiful i went out with another girl to the park and we sat on the grass and looked at the sky and wished we lived in the country he was in an automobile i never did know exactly how it happenedwe looked at each other and he slowed up and came back and asked us to take a ride i had never been in one of those thingsbut that wasnt why i went i guess well the rest was easy he lost his head and i was just as bad you wouldnt believe me if i told you how rich he was it scared me when i found out about him and he was so handsome and full of fun and spirits and generous i never knew anybody like him honest i never expected hed want to marry me he didnt at firstit was only after a while i never asked him to and when he began to talk about it i told him it would cut him off from his swell friends and i knew his father might turn him loose oh it wasnt the money well hed get mad all through and say he never got along with the old man and that his friends would have to take me and he couldnt live without me he said he would have me educated and bought me books and i tried to read them id have done anything for him hed knocked around a good deal since hed been to harvard collegehe wasnt what youd call a saint but his heart was all right and he changed too i could see it he said he was going to make something out of himself  i didnt think it was possible to be so happy but i had a feeling all along inside of me that it couldnt come off i had a little flat in rutger street over on the south side and everything in the world i wanted well one day sure enough the bell rang and i opened the door and there stood a man with side whiskers staring at me and staring until i was frightened to death i never saw such eyes as he had and all of a sudden i knew it was his father  is this miss marcy he said  i couldnt say anything at all but he handed me his card and smiled ill never forget how he smiledand came right in and sat down id heard of that man all my life and how much money hed made and all that why up in madison folks used to talk about him she checked herself suddenly and stared at hodder in consternation maybe you know him she exclaimed i never thought  maybe i do he assented wearily in the past few moments suspicion had become conviction  wellwhat difference does it makenow its all over and im not going to bother him i made up my mind i wouldnt on account of him you understand i never fell that lowthank god  hodder nodded he could not speak the woman seemed to be living over again that scene in her imagination  i just couldnt realize who it was sitting there beside me but if i hadnt known it wouldnt have made any difference he could have done anything with me anyway and he knew how to get at me he said now that hed seen me that he was sure i was a good girl at the bottom and loved his son and that i wouldnt want to ruin the boy when he had such a big future ahead of him i wouldnt have thought to look at the man that he could have been so gentle i made a fool of myself and cried and told him id go away and never see his son any morethat id always been against marrying him well he almost had tears in his eyes when he thanked me and said id never regret it and he pulled an envelope out of his pocket i said i wouldnt take any money and gave it back to him ive always been sorry since that i didnt make him take it backit never did anything but harm to me but he had his way he laid it on the table and said he wouldnt feel right and took my handand i just didnt care  well what do you think i did after hed gone i went and played a piece on the pianoand i never can bear to hear that ragtime to this day i couldnt seem to feel anything and after a while i got up and opened the envelopeit was full of crackly new hundred dollar billsthirty of em and as i sat there staring at em the pain came on like a toothache in throbs getting worse all the time until i just couldnt stand it i had a notion of sending the money back even then but i didnt i didnt know how to do itand as i told you i wasnt able to care much then i remembered id promised to go away and i had to have some money for that and if i didnt leave right off i wouldnt have the strength to do it i hadnt even thought where to go i couldnt think so i got dressed and went down to the depot anyway it was one of those bright bitter cold winter days after a thaw when the icicles are hanging everywhere i went inside and walked up and down that long platform under the glass roof my it was cold in there i looked over all the signs and made up my mind id go to chicago  i meant to work i never meant to spend the money but to send it back id put it asideand then id go and take a little say it was easy not to workand i didnt care what happened to me as long as i wasnt going to see him again well im not trying to smooth it over i suppose there was something crooked about me from the start but i just went clean to hell with that money and when i heard hed gone away i came back here  something crooked the words rang in hodders ears in his very soul how was he or any man to estimate to unravel the justice from the injustice to pass upon the merit of this womans punishment here again in this vitiated life was only to be seen the remorseless working of lawcause and effect crooked had not the tree been crooked from the beginningincapable of being straightened she had herself naively confessed it was not the twist ingrained and if so where was the salvation he had preached there was good in her stillbut what was good he took no account of his profound compassion  what comfort could he give her what hope could he hold out that the twist now gnarled and knotted might be removed that she might gain peace of soul and body and the happiness of which he had talked with alison parr he raised his eyes to discover that the womans were fixed upon him questioningly  i suppose i was a fool to tell you she said with a shade of her old bitterness it cant do any good her next remark was startlingly astute youve found out for yourself i guess that all this talk about heaven and hell and repentance dont amount to anything hell couldnt be any worse than ive been through no matter how hot it is and heaven she laughed burst into tears and quickly dried them you know the man ive been talking about that bought me off i didnt intend to tell you but i see you cant help knowingeldon parr i dont say he didnt do right from his way of looking at thingsbut say it wasnt exactly christian was it  no he said it wasnt he bowed his head and presently when he raised it again he caught something in her look that puzzled and disturbed himan element of adoration  youre white through and through she said slowly and distinctly  and he knew not how to protest  ill tell you something she went on as one who has made a discovery i liked you the first time you came in herethat nightwhen you wanted me to be friends well there was something that seemed to make it impossible then i felt it if you didnt she groped for words i cant explain what it was but now its gone youre different i think a lot more of you maybe its because of what you did at harrods sitting down with me and giving me supper when i was so hungry and the champagne you werent ashamed of me  good god why should i have been he exclaimed  you why shouldnt you she cried fiercely  theres hardly a man in that place that wouldnt have been they all know me by sightand some of em better you didnt see em grinning when i came up to you but i did my godits awfulits awful i she burst into violent weeping long deferred  he took her hand in his and did not speak waiting for the fit to spend itself and after a while the convulsive shudders that shook her gradually ceased  you must trust me he said the first thing tomorrow im going to make arrangements for you to get out of these rooms you cant stay here any longer  thats sure she answered trying to smile im broke i even owe the cothe policeman  the policeman  he has to turn it in to tom beatty and the politicians  beatty where had he heard the name suddenly it came to him that beatty was the city boss who had been eulogized by mr plimpton  i have some good friends who will be glad to help you to get workand until you do get work you will have to fightbut we all have to fight will you try  sure ill try she answered in a low voice  her very tone of submission troubled him and he had a feeling that if he had demanded she would have acquiesced in anything  well talk it over tomorrow he went on clinging to his note of optimism well find out what you can do easiest to begin with  i might give music lessons she suggested  the remark increased his uneasiness for he recognized in it a sure symptom of diseasea relapse into what might almost have been called levity blindness to the supreme tragedy of her life which but a moment before had shaken and appalled her he shook his head bravely  im afraid that wouldnt doat first  she rose and went into the other room returning in a few moments with a work basket from which she drew a soiled and unfinished piece of embroidery  theres a bureau cover i started when i was at pratts she said as she straightened it over her knees its a copy of an expensive one i never had the patience to finish it but one of the salesladies there who was an expert told me it was pretty good she taught me the stitch and i had a notion at that time i might make a little money for dresses and the theatre i was always clever with my hands  the very thing he said with hopeful emphasis im sure i can get you plenty of it to do and ill come back in the morning  he gave it back to her and as she was folding it his glance fell on a photograph in the basket  i kept it i dont know why he heard her say i didnt have the heart to burn it  he started recovered himself and rose  ill go to see the agent the first thing tomorrow he said and thenyoull be ready for me you trust me  id do anything for you was her tremulous reply  her disquieting submissive smile haunted him as he roped his way down the stairs to the street and then the face in the photograph replaced itthe laughing eyes the wilful pleasureloving mouth he had seen in the school and college pictures of preston parr     volume 5     chapter xvii reconstruction   i  life had indeed become complicated paradoxical he john hodder a clergyman rector of st johns by virtue of not having resigned had entered a restaurant of ill repute had ordered champagne for an abandoned woman and had no sense of sin when he awoke the next morning the devil in the language of orthodox theology had led him there he had fallen under the influence of the tempter of his youth and all in him save the carnal had been blotted out  more paradoxes if the devil had not taken possession of him and led him there it were more than probable that he could never have succeeded in any other way in getting on a footing of friendship with this woman kate marcy her future to be sure was problematical here was no simple sentimental case he might formerly have imagined of trusting innocence betrayed but a mixture of good and evil selfishness and unselfishness and she had in spite of all known the love which effaces self could the disintegration in her case be arrested  gradually hodder was filled with a feeling which may be called amazement because although his brain was no nearer to a solution than before he was not despondent for a month he had not permitted his mind to dwell on the riddle yet this morning he felt stirring within him a new energy for which he could not account a hope unconnected with any mental process he felt in touch once more faintly but perceptibly with something stable in the chaos in bygone years he had not seen the chaos but the illusion of an orderly world a continual succession of sunrises couleur de rose from the heights above bremerton now were the scales fallen from his eyes now he saw the evil the injustice the despair felt in truth the weight of the sorrow of it all and yet that sorrow was unaccountably transmuted as by a chemical process into something which for the first time had a meaninghe could not say what meaning the sting of despair had somehow been taken out of it and it remained poignant  not on the obsession of the night before when he had walked down dalton street and beheld it transformed into a realm of adventure but upon his past life did he look back now with horror upon the even tenor of those days and years in the bright places his had been the highroad of a fancied security from which he had feared to stray to seek his god across the rough face of nature from black forgotten capons to the flying peaks in space he had feared reality he had insisted upon gazing at the universe through the coloured glasses of an outworn theology instead of using his own eyes  so he had left the highroad the beaten way of salvation many others had deserted had flung off his spectacles had plunged into reality to be scratched and battered to lose his way not until now had something of grim zest come to him of an instinct which was the first groping of a vision as to where his own path might lie through what thickets and over what mountains he knew not as yetnor cared to know he felt resistance whereas on the highroad he had felt none on the highroad his cry had gone unheeded and unheard yet by holding out his hand in the wilderness he had helped another bruised and bleeding to her feet salvation let it be what it might be he would go on stumbling and seeking through reality  even this last revelation of eldon parrs agency in another tragedy seemed to have no further power to affect him nor could hodder think of alison as in bloodrelationship to the financier or even to the boy whose open pleasureloving face he had seen in the photograph    ii  a presage of autumn was in the air and a fine misty rain drifted in at his windows as he sat at his breakfast he took deep breaths of the moisture and it seemed to water and revive his parching soul he found himself to his surprise surveying with equanimity the pile of books in the corner which had led him to the conviction of the emptiness of the universebut the universe was no longer empty it was cruel but a warring force was at work in it which was not blind but directed he could not say why this was so but he knew it he felt it sensed its energy within him as he set out for dalton street  he was neither happy nor unhappy but in equilibrium walking with sure steps and the anxiety in which he had fallen asleep the night before was gone anxiety lest the woman should have fled or changed her mind or committed some act of desperation  in dalton street a thin coat of yellow mud glistened on the asphalt but even the dreariness of this neighbourhood seemed transient he rang the bell of the flat the door swung open and in the hall above a woman awaited him she was clad in black  you wouldnt know me would you she inquired say i scarcely know myself i used to wear this dress at pratts with white collars and cuffs andwell i just put it on again i had it in the bottom of my trunk and i guessed youd like it  i didnt know you at first he said and the pleasure in his face was her reward  the transformation indeed was more remarkable than he could have believed possible for respectability itself would seem to have been regained by a costume and the abundance of her remarkable hair was now repressed the absence of paint made her cheeks strangely white the hollows under the eyes darker the eyes themselves alone betrayed the woman of yesterday they still burned  why he exclaimed looking around him you have been busy havent you  ive been up since six she told him proudly the flat had been dismantled of its meagre furniture the rug was rolled up and tied and a trunk strapped with rope was in the middle of the floor her next remark brought home to him the full responsibility of his situation she led him to the window and pointed to a spot among the drenched weeds and rubbish in the yard next door do you see that bottle thats the first thing i didflung it out there it didnt break she added significantly and there are three drinks in it yet  once more he confined his approval to his glance  now you must come and have some breakfast he said briskly if i had thought about it i should have waited to have it with you  im not hungry in the light of his new knowledge he connected her sudden dejection with the sight of the bottle  but you must eat youre exhausted from all this work and a cup of coffee will make all the difference in the world  she yielded pinning on her hat and he led her holding the umbrella over her to a restaurant in tower street where a man in a white cap and apron was baking cakes behind a plateglass window she drank the coffee but in her excitement left the rest of the breakfast almost untasted  say she asked him once why are you doing this  i dont know he answered except that it gives me pleasure  pleasure  yes it makes me feel as if i were of some use  she considered this  well she observed reviled by the coffee youre the queerest minister i ever saw  when they had reached the pavement she asked him where they were going  to see a friend of mine and a friend of yours he told her he does net live far from here  she was silent again acquiescing the rain had stopped the sun was peeping out furtively through the clouds the early loiterers in dalton street stared at them curiously but hodder was thinking of that house whither they were bound with a new gratitude a new wonder that it should exist thus they came to the sheltered vestibule with its glistening white paint its polished name plate and doorknob the grinning hospitable darky appeared in answer to the rectors ring  good morning sam he said is mr bentley in  sam ushered them ceremoniously into the library and gate marcy gazed about her with awe as at something absolutely foreign to her experience the new barrington hotel the latest pride of the city recently erected at the corner of tower and jefferson and furnished in the french style she might partially have understood had she been marvellously and suddenly transported and established there existence might still have evinced a certain continuity but this house  mr bentley rose from the desk in the corner  oh its you hodder he said cheerfully laying his hand on the rectors arm i was just thinking about you  this is miss marcy mr bentley hodder said  mr bentley took her hand and led her to a chair  mr hodder knows how fond i am of young women he said i have six of them upstairsso i am never lonely  mr bentley did not appear to notice that her lips quivered  hodder turned his eyes from her face miss marcy has been lonely he explained and i thought we might get her a room near by where she might see them often she is going to do embroidery  why sally will know of a room mr bentley replied sam he called  yessahyes mistah hoace sam appeared at the door  ask miss sally to come down if shes not busy  kate marcy sat dumbly in her chair her hands convulsively clasping its arms her breast heaving stormily her face becoming intense with the effort of repressing the wild emotion within her emotion that threatened to strangle her if resisted or to sweep her out like a tide and drown her in deep waters emotion that had no one mewing and yet summed up a life mysteriously and overwhelmingly aroused by the sight of a room and of a kindly old gentleman who lived in it  mr bentley took the chair beside her  why i believe its going to clear off after all he exclaimed sam predicted it before breakfast he pretends to be able to tell by the flowers after a while i must show you my flowers miss marcy and what dalton street can do by way of a gardenmr hodder could hardly believe it even when he saw it thus he went on the tips of his fingers pressed together his head bent forward in familiar attitude his face lighted speaking naturally of trivial things that seemed to suggest themselves and careful with exquisite tact that did not betray itself to address both a passing automobile startled her with the blast of its horn im afraid i shall never get accustomed to them he lamented at first i used to be thankful there were no trolley cars on this street but i believe the automobiles are worse  a figure flitted through the hall and into the room which hodder recognized as miss growers she reminded him of a flying shuttle across the warp of mr bentleys threads weaving them together swift sure yet never hurried or flustered one glance at the speechless woman seemed to suffice her for a knowledge of the situation  mr hodder has brought us a new friend and neighbour sallymiss kate marcy she is to have a room near us that we may see her often  hodder watched miss growers procedure with a breathless interest  why mrs mcquillen has a roomacross the street you know mr bentley  sally perched herself on the edge of the armchair and laid her hand lightly on kate marcys  even sally grover was powerless to prevent the inevitable and the touch of her hand seemed the signal for the release of the pentup forces the worn body the worn nerves the weakened will gave way and kate marcy burst into a paroxysm of weeping that gradually became automatic convulsive like a childs there was no damming this torrent once released kindness disinterested friendship was the one unbearable thing  we must bring her upstairs said sally grover quietly shes going to pieces  hodder helping they fairly carried her up the flight and laid her on sally grovers own bed  that afternoon she was taken to mrs mcquillens  the fiends are not easily cheated and during the nights and days that followed even sally grower whose slight frame was tireless whose stoicism was amazing came out of the sick room with a white face and compressed lips tossing on the mattress kate marcy enacted over again incident after incident of her past life events natural to an existence which had been largely devoid of selfpity but which now clearly enough tested the extreme limits of suffering once more in her visions she walked the streets wearily measuring the dark empty blocks footsore into the smaller hours of the night slyly insinuatingly pathetically offering herselfall she possessedto the hovering beasts of prey and even these rejected her with gibes with obscene jests that sprang to her lips and brought a shudder to those who heard  sometimes they beheld flare up fitfully that mysterious thing called the human spirit which all this crushing process had not served to extinguish she seemed to be defending her rights whatever these may have been she expostulated with policemen and once when hodder was present she brought back vividly to his mind that first night he had seen her when she had defied him and sent him away in moments she lived over again the careless reckless days when money and good looks had not been lacking when rich food and wines had been plentiful and there were other events which sally grower and the goodnatured irishwoman mrs mcquillen not holding the key could but dimly comprehend education environment inheritance characterwhat a jumble of causes what judge was to unravel them and assign the exact amount of responsibility  there were other terrible scenes when more than semiconscious she cried out piteously for drink and cursed them for withholding it and it was in the midst of one of these that an incident occurred which made a deep impression upon young dr giddings hesitating with his opiates and assisting the indomitable miss grower to hold his patient in the midst of the paroxysm mr bentley entered and stood over her by the bedside and suddenly her struggles ceased at first she lay intensely still staring at him with wide eyes of fear he sat down and took her hand and spoke to her quietly and naturally and her pupils relaxed she fell into a sleep still clinging to his fingers  it was sally who opposed the doctors wish to send her to a hospital  if its only a question of getting back her health shed better die she declared weve got but one chance with her dr giddings to keep her here when she finds out shes been to a hospital that will be the end of it with her kind well never get hold of her again ill take care of mrs mcquillen  doctor giddings was impressed by this wisdom  you think you have a chance miss grower he asked he had had a hospital experience  miss grower was wont to express optimism in deeds rather than words  if i didnt think so id ask you to put a little more in your hypodermic next time she replied  and the doctor went away wondering  drink convalescence brought little release for the watchers the fiends would retire pretending to have abandoned the field only to swoop down again when least expected there were periods of calm when it seemed as though a new and bewildered personality were emerging amazed to find in life a kindly thing gazing at the world as one newborn and again mrs mcquillen or ella finley might be seen running bareheaded across the street for miss grower physical force was needed as the rector discovered on one occasion physical force and something more a dauntlessness that kept sally grower in the room after the other women had fled in terror then remorse despondency another fear  as the weeks went by the relapses certainly became fewer something was at work as real in its effects as the sunlight but invisible hodder felt it and watched in suspense while it fought the beasts in this woman rending her frame in anguish the frame might succumb the breath might leave it to moulder but the struggle he knew would go until the beasts were conquered whence this knowledgefor it was knowledge  on the quieter days of her convalescence she seemed indeed more madonna than magdalen as she sat against the pillows her redgold hair lying in two heavy plaits across her shoulders her cheeks pale the inner consuming fires that smouldered in her eyes died down at such times her newly awakened innocence if it might be called suchpathetic innocence in truth struck awe into hodder her wonder was matched by his own could there be another meaning in life than the pursuit of pleasure than the weary effort to keep the body alive  such was her query unformulated what animated these persons who had struggled over her so desperately sally grower mr bentley and hodder himself thus her opening mind for she had a mind  mr bentley was the chief topic and little by little he became exalted into a mystery of which she sought the explanation  i never knew anybody like him she would exclaim  why id seen him on dalton street with the children following him and i saw him again that day of the funeral some of the girls i knew used to laugh at him we thought he was queer and then when you brought me to him that morning and he got up and treated me like a lady i just couldnt stand it i never felt so terrible in my life i just wanted to die right then and there something inside of me kept pressing and pressing until i thought i would die i knew what it was to hate myself but i never hated myself as i have since then  he never says anything about god and you dont but when he comes in here he seems like god to me hes so peacefulhe makes me peaceful i remember the minister in madisonhe was a puttyfaced man with indigestionand when he prayed he used to close his eyes and try to look pious but he never fooled me he never made me believe he knew anything about god and dont think for a minute hed have done what you and miss grower and mr bentley did he used to cross the street to get out of the way of drunken menhe wouldnt have one of them in his church and i know of a girl he drove out of town because she had a baby and her sweetheart wouldnt marry her he sent her to hell hells hereisnt it  these sudden remarks of hers surprised and troubled him but they had another effect a constructive effect he was astonished in going over such conversations afterwards to discover that her questions and his efforts to answer them in other than theological terms were both illuminating and stimulating sayings in the gospels leaped out in his mind fired with new meanings so simple once perceived that he was amazed not to have seen them before and then he was conscious of a palpitating joy which left in its wake a profound thankfulness he made no attempt as yet to correlate these increments these glimpses of truth into a system but stored them preciously away  he taxed his heart and intellect to answer her sensible and helpfully and thus found himself avoiding the logic the greek philosophy the outworn and meaningless phrases of speculation found himself employing with extraordinary effect upon them both the simple words from which many of these theories had been derived he that hath seen me hath seen the father what she saw in horace bentley he explained was god god wished us to know how to live in order that we might find happiness and therefore christ taught us that the way to find happiness was to teach others how to liveonce we found out such was the meaning of christs incarnation to teach us how to live in order that we might find god and happiness and hodder translated for her the word incarnation  now he asked how were we to recognize god how might we know how he wished us to live unless we saw him in human beings in the souls into which he had entered in mr bentleys soul was this too deep  she pondered with flushed face  i never had it put to me like that she said presently i never could have known what you meant if i hadnt seen mr bentley  here was a return flash for him thus teaching he taught from this germ he was to evolve for himself the sublime truth that the world grown better not through automatic soulsaving machinery but by personality  on another occasion she inquired about original sina phrase which had stuck in her memory since the stormings of the madison preacher here was a demand to try his mettle  it means he replied after a moment that we are all apt to follow the selfish animal instincts of our matures to get all we can for ourselves without thinking of others to seek animal pleasures and we always suffer for it  sure she agreed thats what happened to me  and unless we see and know some one like mr bentley he went on choosing his words or discover for ourselves what christ was and what he tried to tell us we go on suffering because we dont see any way out we suffer because we feel that we are useless that other persons are doing our work  thats what hell is she was very keen hells here she repeated  hell may begin here and so may heaven he answered  why hes in heaven now she exclaimed its funny i never thought of it before of course she referred to mr bentley  thus by no accountable process of reasoning he stumbled into the path which was to lead him to one of the widest and brightest of his vistas the secret of eternity hidden in the parable of the talents but it will not do to anticipate this matter  the divine in this woman of the streets regenerated by the divine in her fellowcreatures was gasping like a newborn babe for breath and with what anxiety they watched her she grew strong again went with sally drover and the other girls on sunday excursions to the country applied herself to her embroidery with restless zeal for days only to have it drop from her nerveless fingers but her thoughts were uncontrollable she was drawn continually to the edge of that precipice which hung over the waters whence they had dragged her never knowing when the vertigo would seize her and once sally drover on the alert for just such an occurrence pursued her down dalton street and forced her back  justice to miss drover cannot be done in these pages it was she who bore the brunt of the fierce resentment of the reincarnated fiends when the other women shrank back in fear and said nothing to mr bentley or hodder until the incident was past it was terrible indeed to behold this woman revertalmost in the twinkling of an eyeto a vicious wretch crazed for drink to feel that the struggle had to be fought all over again unable to awe sally drovers spirit she would grow piteous  for gods sake let me goi cant stand it let me go to hellthats where i belong what do you bother with me for ive got a right  once the doctor had to be called he shook his head but his eye met miss growers and he said nothing  ill never be able to pull out i havent got the strength she told hodder between sobs you ought to have left me be that was where i belonged i cant stand it i tell you if it wasnt for that woman watching me downstairs and sally grower id have had a drink before this it aint any use ive got so i cant live without iti dont want to live  and then remorse selfreproach despairalmost as terrible to contemplate she swore she would never see mr bentley again she couldnt face him  yet they persisted and gained ground she did see mr bentley but what he said to her or she to him will never be known she didnt speak of it  little by little her interest was aroused her pride in her work stimulated none was more surprised than hodder when sally grower informed him that the embroidery was really good but it was thought best for psychological reasons to discard the old tablecover with its associations and begin a new one on occasional evenings she brought her sewing over to mr bentleys while sally read aloud to him and the young women in the library miss growers taste in fiction was romantic her voice save in the love passages when she forgot herself  singsong but new and unsuspected realms were opened up for kate marcy who would drop her work and gaze wideeyed out of the window into the darkness  and it was sally who must be given credit for the great experiment although she took mr bentley and hodder into her confidence on it they staked all the day came at last when the new tablecover was finished miss grower took it to the womans exchange actually sold it and brought back the money and handed it to her with a smile and left her alone  an hour passed at the end of it kate marcy came out of her room crossed the street and knocked at the door of mr bentleys library hodder happened to be there  come in mr bentley said  she entered breathless pale her eyes which had already lost much of the dissipated look were alight with exaltation her face bore evidence of the severity of the hour of conflict and she was perilously near to tears she handed mr bentley the money  whats this kate he asked in his kindly way  its what i earned sir she faltered miss grower sold the tablecover i thought maybe youd put it aside for me like you do for the others  ill take good care of it he said  oh sir i dont ever expect to repay you and miss grower and mr hodder  why you are repaying us he replied cutting her short you are making us all very happy and sally tells me at the exchange they like your work so well they are asking for more i shouldnt have suspected he added with a humorous glance at the rector that mr hodder knew so much about embroidery  he rose and put the money in his desksuch was his genius for avoiding situations which threatened to become emotional  ive started another one she told them as she departed  a few moments later miss grower appeared  sally said mr bentley youre a wise woman i believe ive made that remark before you have managed that case wonderfully  there was a time replied miss grower thoughtfully when it looked pretty black weve got a chance with her now i think  i hope so i begin to feel so mr bentley declared  if we succeed miss grower went on it will be through the heart and if we lose her again it will be through the heart  hodder started at this proof of insight  you know her history mr hodder she asked  yes he said  well i dont and i dont care to but the way to get at kate marcy light as she is in some respects is through her feelings and shes somehow kept em alive weve got to trust her from now onthats the only way and thats what god does anyhow  this was one of miss grovers rare references to the deity  turning over that phrase in his mind hodder went slowly back towards the parish house god trusted individualseven such as kate marcy what did that mean individual responsibility he repeated it was the world on that principle then it was as though a searchlight were flung ahead of him and he saw dimly a new ordera new order in government and religion and as though spoken by a voice out of the past there sounded in his ears the text of that sermon which had so deeply moved him i will arise and go to my father  the church was still open and under the influence of the same strange excitement which had driven him to walk in the rain so long ago he entered and went slowly up the marble aisle through the gathering gloom he saw the figure on the cross and as he stood gazing at it a message for which he had been waiting blazed up within him  he would not leave the church     chapter xviii the riddle of causation   i  in order to portray this crisis in the life of kate marcy the outcome of which is still uncertain other matters have been ignored  how many persons besides john hodder have seemed to readin crucial periodsa meaning into incidents having all the outward appearance of accidents what is it that leads us to a certain man or woman at a certain time or to open a certain book order and design or influence  the night when he had stumbled into the cafe in dalton street might well have been termed the nadir of hodders experience his faith had been blotted out and with it had suddenly been extinguished all spiritual sense the beast had taken possession and then when it was least expectednay when despaired of had come the glimmer of a light distant yet clear he might have traced the course of his disillusionment perhaps but cause and effect were not discernible here  they soon became so and in the weeks that followed he grew to have the odd sense of a guiding hand on his shouldersuch was his instinctive interpretation of it rather than the materialistic one of things ordained he might turn in obedience to what seemed a whim either to the right or left only to recognize new blazes that led him on with surer step and trivial accidents became events charged with meaning he lived in continual wonder  one broiling morning for instance he gathered up the last of the books whose contents he had a month before so feverishly absorbed and which had purged him of all fallacies at first he had welcomed them with a fierce relief sucked them dry then looked upon them with loathing now he pressed them gratefully almost tenderly as he made his way along the shady side of the street towards the great library set in its little park  he was reminded as he passed from the blinding sunlight into the cool entrance hall with its polished marble stairway and its statuary that eldon parrs munificence had made the building possible that some day mr parrs bust would stand in that vestibule with that of judge henry goodrichphilip goodrichs grandfatherand of other men who had served their city and their commonwealth  upstairs at the desk he was handing in the volumes to the young woman whose duty it was to receive them when he was hailed by a brisk little man in an alpaca coat with a skin like brown parchment  why mr hodder he exclaimed cheerfully with a trace of german accent i had an idea you were somewhere on the cool seas with our friend mr parr he spoke before he left of inviting you  it had been eldon parr indeed who had first brought hodder to the library shortly after the rectors advent and mr engel had accompanied them on a tour of inspection the financier himself had enjoined the librarian to take good care of the clergyman mr waring mr atterbury and mr constable were likewise trustees and since then when talking to him hodder had had a feeling that mr engel was not unconscious of the auraif it may be called suchof his vestry  mr engel picked up one of the books as it lay on the counter and as he read the title his face betrayed a slight surprise  modern criticism he exclaimed  you have found me out the rector acknowledged smiling  came into my room and have a chat said the librarian coaxingly  it was a large chamber at the corner of the building shaded by awnings against which brushed the branches of an elm which had belonged to the original park in the centre of the room was a massive oak desk one whole side of which was piled high with new volumes  look there said the librarian with a quick wave of his hand those are some which came in this week and i had them put here to look over twothirds of em on religion or religious philosophy does that suggest anything to you clergymen  do many persons read them mr engel said the rector at length  read them cried mr engel quizzically we librarians are a sort of weathervanes if people only knew enough to consult us we can hardly get a sufficient number of these new religious books the good ones i meanto supply the demand and the lord knows what trash is devoured from what the booksellers tell me it reminds me of the days when this library was down on fifth street years ago and we couldnt supply enough darwins and huxleys and spencers and popular science generally that was an agnostic age but now youd be surprised to see the different kinds of men and women who come demanding books on religionall sorts and conditions theyre beginning to miss it out of their lives they want to know if my opinions worth anything i should not hesitate to declare that were on the threshold of a greater religious era than the world has ever seen  hodder thrust a book back into the pile and turned abruptly with a manner that surprised the librarian no other clergyman to whom he had spoken on this subject had given evidence of this strong feeling and the rector of st johns was the last man from whom he would have expected it  do you really think so hodder demanded  why yes said mr engel when he had recovered from his astonishment im sure of it i think clergymen especiallyif you will pardon meare apt to forget that this is a reading age that a great many people who used to get what instruction they hadahemfrom churches for instance now get it from books i dont want to say anything to offend you mr hodder  you couldnt interrupted the rector he was equally surprised at the discovery that he had misjudged mr engel and was drawn towards him now with a strong sympathy and curiosity  well replied mr engel im glad to hear you say that he restrained a gasp was this the orthodox mr hodder of st johns  why said hodder sitting down ive learned as you have by experience only my experience hasnt been so hopeful as yoursthat is if you regard yours as hopeful it would be hypocritical of me not to acknowledge that the churches are losing ground and that those who ought to be connected with them are not i am ready to admit that the churches are at fault but what you tell me of people reading these books gives me more courage than i have had forfor some time  is it so ejaculated the little man relapsing into the german idiom of his youth  it is answered the rector with an emphasis not to be denied i wish you would give me your theory about this phenomenon and speak frankly  but i thought the bewildered librarian began i saw you had been reading those books but i thought  naturally you did said holder smiling his personality his ascendency his poise suddenly felt by the other were still more confusing you thought me a narrow complacent fashionable priest who had no concern as to what happened outside the walls of his church who stuck obstinately to dogmas and would give nothing else a hearing well you were right  ah i didnt think all that mr engel protested and his parchment skin actually performed the miracle of flushing i am not so stupid and once long ago when i was young i was going to be a minister myself  what prevented you asked holder interested  you want me to be frankyes well i couldnt take the vows the brown eyes of the quiet humorous selfcontained and driedup custodian of the citys reading flamed up i felt the call he exclaimed you may not credit it to look at me now mr hodder they said to me here is what you must swear to believe before you can make men and women happier and more hopeful rescue them from sin and misery you know what it was  hodder nodded  it was a crime it had nothing to do with religion i thought it over for a yeari couldnt oh i have since been thankful i can see now what would have happened to mei should have had fatty degeneration of the soul  the expression was not merely forcible it was overwhelming it brought up before holders mind with sickening reality the fate he had himself escaped fatty degeneration of the soul  the little man seeing the expression on the rectors face curbed his excitement and feared he had gone too far  you will pardon me he said penitently i forget myself i did not mean all clergymen  i have never heard it put so well holder declared that is exactly what occurs in many cases  yes it is that said engel still puzzled but encouraged eyeing the strong face of the other and they lament that the ministry hasnt more big men sometimes they get one with the doctrinal type of minda newmanbut how often and even a newman would be of little avail today it is eucken who says that the individual once released from external authority can never be turned back to it and they have been released by the hundreds of thousands ever since luthers time are being freed by the hundreds of thousands today democracy learning science are releasing them and no man no matter how great he may be can stem that tide the able men in the churches nowlike your phillips brooks who died too soonare beginning to see this they are those who developed after the vows of the theological schools were behind them remove those vows and you will see the young men come young men are idealists mr hodder and they embrace other professions where the mind is free and which are not one whit better paid than the ministry  and what is the result he cried of the senseless insistence on the letter instead of the spirit of the poetry of religion matthew arnold was a thousand times right when he inferred that jesus christ never spoke literally and yet he is still being taken literally by most churches and all the literal sayings which were put into his mouth are maintained as gospel truth what is the result of proclaiming christianity in terms of an ancient science and theology which awaken no quickening response in the minds and hearts of today that the librarian thrust a yellow hand towards the pile of books the new wine has burst the old skin and is running all over the world ah my friend if you could only see as i do the yearning for a satisfying religion which exists in this big city it is like a vacuum and those books are rushing to supply it i little thought he added dreamily when i renounced the ministry in so much sorrow that one day i should have a church of my own this library is my church and men and women of all creeds come here by the thousands but you must pardon me i have been carried awayi forgot myself  mr engel replied the rector i want you to regard me as one of your parishioners  the librarian looked at him mutely and the practical desiccated little person seemed startlingly transformed into a mediaeval german mystic  you are a great man mr hodder he said i might have guessed it  it was one of the moments when protest would have been trite superfluous and hodder in truth felt something great swelling within him something that was not himself and yet strangely was but just whatin view of his past strict orthodoxy and limited congregationmr engel meant he could not have said had the librarian recognized without confession on his part the change in him divined his future intentions  it is curious that i should have met you this morning mr engel he said i expressed surprise when you declared this was a religious age because you corroborated something i had felt but of which i had no sufficient proof i felt that a great body of unsatisfied men and women existed but that i was powerless to get in touch with them i had discovered that truth as you have so ably pointed out is disguised and distorted by ancient dogmas and that the old authority as you say no longer carries weight  have you found the new one mr engel demanded  i think i have the rector answered calmly it lies in personality i do not know whether you will agree with me that the church at large has a future and i will confess to you that there was a time when i thought she had not i see now that she has once given to her ministers that freedom to develop of which you speak in spite of the fact that truth has gradually been revealed to the world by what may be called an apostolic succession of personalitiesaugustine dante francis of assisi luther shakespeare milton and our own lincoln and phillips brooksto mention only a fewthe church as a whole has been blind to it she has insisted upon putting the individual in a straitjacket she has never recognized that growth is the secret of life that the clothes of one man are binding on another  ah you are righta thousand times right cried the librarian you have read royce perhaps when he says this mortal shall put on individuality  no said the rector outwardly cool but inwardly excited by the coruscation of this magnificent paraphrase of pauls sentence by the extraordinary turn the conversation had taken i am ashamed to own that i have not followed the development of modern philosophy the books i have just returned on historical criticism he went on after a moments hesitation infer what my attitude has been toward modern thought we were made acquainted with historical criticism in the theological seminary but we were also taught to discount it i have discounted it refrained from reading ituntil now and yet i have heard it discussed in conferences glanced over articles in the reviews i had you see closed the door of my mind i was in a state where arguments make no impression  the librarian made a gesture of sympathetic assent which was also a tribute to the clergymans frankness  you will perhaps wonder how i could have lived these years in an atmosphere of modern thought and have remained uninfluenced well i have recently been wonderingmyself hodder smiled the name of royce is by no means unfamiliar to me and he taught at harvard when i was an undergraduate but the prevailing philosophy of that day among the students was naturalism i represent a revolt from it at the seminary i imbibed a certain amount of religious philosophybut i did not continue it as thousands of my more liberal fellowclergymen have done my religion worked during the time at least i remained in my first parish i had no interest in reconciling for instance the doctrine of evolution with the argument for design since i have been here in this city he added simply my days have been filled with a continued perplexitywhen i was not too busy to think yes there was an unacknowledged element of fear in my attitude though i comforted myself with the notion that opinions philosophical and scientific were in a state of flux  yes yes said mr engel i comprehend but from the manner in which you spoke just now i should have inferred that you have been reading modern philosophythat of the last twenty years ah you have something before you mr hodder you will thank god with me for that philosophy it has turned the tide set the current running the other way philosophy is no longer against religion it is with it and if you were to ask me to name one of the greatest religious teachers of our age i should answer william james and there is royce of whom i spokeone of our biggest men the dominant philosophies of our times have grown up since arnold wrote his literature and dogma and they are in harmony with the quickening social spirit of the age which is a religious spirita christian spirit i call it christianity is coming to its own these philosophies which are not so far apart are the flower of the thought of the centuries of modern science of that most extraordinary of discoveries modern psychology and they are far from excluding religion from denying the essential of christs teachings on the other hand they grant that the motivepower of the world is spiritual  and this continued mr engel brings me to another aspect of authority i wonder if it has struck you in mediaeval times when a bishop spoke ex cathedra his authority so far as it carried weight came from two sources first the supposed divine charter of the church to save and damn that authority is being rapidly swept away second he spoke with all the weight of the then accepted science and philosophy but as soon as the new science began to lay hold on peoples minds asfor instancewhen galileo discovered that the earth moved instead of the sun and the pope made him take it back that second authority began to crumble too in the nineteenth century science had grown so strong that the situation looked hopeless religion had apparently irrevocably lost that warrant also and thinking men not spiritually inclined since they had to make a choice between science and religion took science as being the more honest the more certain  and now what has happened the new philosophies have restored your second authority and your first as you properly say is replaced by the conception of personality personality is nothing but the rehabilitation of the prophet the seer get him as hatch says back into your church the priests with their sacrifices and automatic rites the logicians have crowded him out why do we read the old testament at all not for the laws of the levites not for the battles and hangings but for the inspiration of the prophets the authority of the prophet comes through personality the source of which is in what myers calls the infinite spiritual worldin god it was christs own authority  and as for your other authority your ordinary man when he reads modern philosophy says to himself this does not conflict with science but he gets no hint when he goes to most churches that there is between the two no real quarrel and he turns away in despair he may accept the pragmatism of james the idealism of royce or even what is called neo realism in any case he gains the conviction that a force for good is at worn in the world and he has the incentive to become part of it but i have given you a sermon  for which i can never be sufficiently grateful said hodder with an earnestness not to be mistaken  the little mans eyes rested admiringly and not without emotion on the salient features of the tall clergyman and when he spoke again it was in acknowledgment of the fact that he had read hodders purpose  you will have opposition my friend they will fight yousome persons we know they do not wishwhat you and i desire but you will not surrenderi knew it mr engel broke off abruptly and rang a bell on his desk i will make out for you a list i hope you may come in again often we shall have other talksyes i am always here  then it came to pass that hodder carried back with him another armful of books those he had brought back were the levellers of the false these were the builders of the true    ii  hodder had known for many years that the writings of josiah royce and of william james had been in the air so to speak and he had heard them mentioned at dinner parties by his more intellectual parishioners such as mrs constable and martha preston now he was able to smile at his former attitude toward these moderns whose perusal he had deprecated as treason to the saints and he remembered his horror on having listened to a fellowclergyman discuss with calmness the plan of the varieties of religious experiences a sacrilegious dissection of the lives of these very saints the scientific process the theories of modern psychology applied with sangfroid to the workings of god in the human soul science he had regarded as the proclaimed enemy of religion and in these days of the apotheosis of science not even sacred things were spared  now hodder saw what the little librarian had meant by an authority restored the impartial method of modern science had become so firmly established in the mind of mankind by education and reading that the ancient unscientific science of the roman empire in which orthodox christianity was clothed no longer carried authority in so far as modern science had discovered truth religion had no quarrel with it and if theology pretended to be the science of religion surely it must submit to the test of the new science the dogged clinging to the archaic speculations of apologists saints and schoolmen had brought religion to a low ebb indeed  one of the most inspiring books he read was by an english clergyman of his own church whom he had formerly looked upon as a heretic with all that the word had once implied it was a frank yet reverent study of the selfconsciousness of christ submitting the life and teachings of jesus to modern criticism and the scientific method and the saviours divinity rather than being lessened was augmented hodder found it infinitely refreshing that the socalled articles of christian belief instead of being put first and their acceptance insisted upon were made the climax of the investigation  religion he began to perceive was an undertaking are attempt to find unity and harmony of the soul by adopting after mature thought a definite principle in life if harmony resultedif the principle worked it was true hodder kept an open mind but he became a pragmatist so far science on the other hand was in a sphere by herself and need have no conflict with religion science was not an undertaking but an impartial investigation by close observation of facts in nature her object was to discover truths by these methods alone she had her theories indeed but they must be submitted to rigorous tests this from a book by professor perry an advocate of the new realism  on the other hand there were signs that modern science by infinitesimal degrees might be aiding in the solution of the mystery  but religion hodder saw was trusting not credulous silly trusting but thoughtful trusting accepting such facts as were definitely known faith was trusting and faith without works was dead simply because there could be no faith without works there was no such thing as belief that did not result in act  a paragraph which made a profound impression on hodder at that time occurs in jamess essay is life worth living  nowwhat do i mean by i trusting is the word to carry with it license to define in detail an invisible world and to authorize and excommunicate those whose trust is different our faculties of belief were not given us to make orthodoxies and heresies withal they were given us to live by and to trust our religions demands men first of all to live in the light of them and to act as if the invisible world which they suggest were real it is a fact of human nature that man can live and die by the help of a sort of faith that goes without a single dogma and definition  yet it was not these religious philosophies which had saved him though the stimulus of their current had started his mind revolving like a motor their function he perceived now was precisely to compel him to see what had saved him to reenforce it with the intellect with the reason and enable him to save others the current set upby a thousand suggestions of which he made notesa personal construction coordination and he had the exhilaration of feeling within him a creative process all his own behold a mystery a paradoxone of many as his strength grew greater day by day as his vision grew clearer he must exclaim with paul yet not i but the grace of god which was with me  he hodder was but an instrument transmitting power and yetoh paradoxthe instrument continued to improve to grow stronger to develop individuality and personality day by day life present and hereafter was growth development the opportunity for service in a cause to cease growing was to die  he perceived at last the form all religion takes is that of consecration to a causeone of gods many causes the meaning of life is to find ones cause to lose ones self in it his was the liberation of the wordnow vouchsafed to him the freeing of the spark from under the ashes the phrase was alisons to help liberate the church fan into flame the fire which was to consume the injustice the tyranny the selfishness of the world until the garvins the kate marcys the stunted children and anaemic women were no longer possible  it was royce who in one illuminating sentence solved for him the puzzle pointed out whence his salvation had come for your cause can only be revealed to you through some presence that first teaches you to love the unity of the spiritual life you must find it in human shape  horace bentley  he hodder had known this but known it vaguely without sanction the light had shone for him even in the darkness of that night in dalton street when he thought to have lost it forever and he had awakened the next morning safesafe yet bewildered like a half drowned man on warm sands in the sun  the will of the spiritual world the divine will revealed in man what sublime thoughts as old as the cross itself yet continually and eternally new    iii  there was still another whose face was constantly before him and the reflection of her distressed yet undaunted soulalison parr the contemplation of her courage of her determination to abide by nothing save the truth had had a power over him that he might not estimate and he loved her as a man loves a woman for her imperfections and he loved her body and her mind  one morning as he walked back from mrs bledsoes through an unfrequented wooded path of the park he beheld her as he had summoned her in his visions she was sitting motionless gazing before her with clear eyes as at the fates  she started on suddenly perceiving him but it was characteristic of her greeting that she seemed to feel no surprise at the accident which had brought them together  i am afraid he said smiling that i have broken in on some profound reflections  she did not answer at once but looked up at him as he stood over her with one of her strange baffling gazes in which there was the hint of a welcoming smile  reflection seems to be a circular process with me she answered i never get anywherelike you  like me he exclaimed seating himself on the bench apparently their intercourse so long as it should continue was destined to be on the basis of intimacy in which it had begun it was possible at once to be aware of her disturbing presence and yet to feel at home in it  like you yes she said continuing to examine him youve changed remarkably  in his agitation at this discovery of hers he again repeated her words  why you seem happier you look happier it isnt only that i cant explain how you impress me it struck me when you were talking to mr bentley the other day you seem to see something you didnt see when i first met you that you didnt see the first time we were at mr bentleys together your attitude is fixeddirected you have made a decision of some sorta momentous one i rather think  yes he replied you are right its more than remarkable that you should have guessed it  she remained silent  i have decided he found himself saying abruptly to continue in the church  still she was silent until he wondered whether she would answer him he had often speculated to himself how she would take this decision but he could make no surmise from her expression as she stared off into the wood presently she turned her head slowly and looked into his face still she did not speak  you are wondering how i can do it he said  yes she acknowledged in a low voice  i should like you to knowthat is why i spoke of it you have never asked me and i have never told you that the convictions i formerly held i lost and with them for a while went everything at least so i believed  i knew it she answered i could see that too  when i argued with you that afternoonthe last time we talked together alonei was trying to convince myself and you he hesitated that there was something the fact that you could not seem to feel it stimulated me  he read in her eyes that she understood him and he dared not nor did he need to emphasize further his own intense desire that she should find a solution of her own  i wish you to know what i am telling you for two reasons he went on it was you who spoke the words that led to the opening of my eyes to the situation into which i had been drifting for two years who compelled me to look upon the inconsistencies and falsities which had gradually been borne in upon me it was you i think who gave me the courage to face this situation squarely since you possess that kind of courage yourself  oh no she cried you would have done it anyway  he paused a moment to get himself in hand  for this reason i owed it to you to speakto thank you i have realized since that first meeting that you became my friend then and that you spoke as a friend if you had not believed in my sincerity you would not have spoken i wish you to know that i am fully aware and grateful for the honour you did me and that i realize it is not always easy for you to speak soto any one  she did not reply  there is another reason for my telling you now of this decision of mine to remain a clergyman he continued it is because i value your respect and friendship and i hope you will believe that i would not take this course unless i saw my way clear to do it with sincerity  one has only to look at you to see that you are sincere she said gently with a thrill in her voice that almost unmanned him i told you once that i should never have forgiven myself if i had wrecked your life i meant it i am very glad  it was his turn to be silent  just because i cannot see how it would be possible to remain in the church after one had beenemancipated so to speakshe smiled at himis no reason why you may not have solved the problem  such was the superfine quality of her honesty yet she trusted him he was made giddy by a desire which he fought down to justify himself before her his eye beheld her now as the goddess with the scales in her hand weighing and accepting with outward calm the verdict of the balance  outward calm but inner fire  it makes no difference she pursued evenly bent on choosing her words that i cannot personally understand your emancipation that mine is different i can only see the preponderance of evil of deception of injusticeit is that which shuts out everything else and its temperamental i suppose by looking at you as i told you i can see that your emancipation is positive while mine remains negative you have somehow regained a conviction that the good is predominant that there is some purpose in the universe  he assented once more she relapsed into thought while he sat contemplating her profile she turned to him again with a tremulous smile  but isnt a conviction that the good is predominant that there is a purpose in the universe a long way from the positive assertions in the creeds she asked i remember when i went through what you would probably call disintegration and which seemed to me enlightenment that the creeds were my first stumblingblocks it seemed wrong to repeat them  i am glad you spoke of this he replied gravely i have arrived at many answers to that difficultywhich did not give me the trouble i had anticipated in the first place i am convinced that it was much more of a difficulty ten twenty thirty years ago than it is today that which i formerly thought was a radical tendency towards atrophy the drift of the liberal party in my own church and others as well as that which i looked upon with some abhorrence as the freethinking speculation of many modern writers i have now come to see is reconstruction the results of this teaching of religion in modern terms are already becoming apparent and some persons are already beginning to see that the creeds express certain elemental truths in frankly archaic language all this should be explained in the churches and the sunday schoolsis in fact being explained in some and also in books for popular reading by clergymen of my own church both here and in england we have got past the critical age  she followed him closely but did not interrupt  i do not mean to say that the creeds are not the sources of much misunderstanding but in my opinion they do not constitute a sufficient excuse for any clergyman to abandon his church on account of them indeed there are many who interpret them by modern thoughtwhich is closer to the teachings of christ than ancient thoughtwhose honesty cannot be questioned personally i think that the creeds either ought to be taken out of the service or changed or else there should be a note inserted in the service and catechism definitely permitting a liberal interpretation which is exactly what so many clergymen candidly do now  when i was ordained a deacon and then a priest i took vows which would appear to be literally conflicting compelled to choose between these vows i accept that as supreme which i made when i affirmed that i would teach nothing which i should be persuaded might not be concluded and affirmed by the scripture the creeds were derived from the scripturenot the scripture from the creeds as an individual among a body of christians i am powerless to change either the ordinal vows or the creeds i am obliged to wait for the consensus of opinion but if on the whole i can satisfy my conscience in repeating the creeds and reading the service as other honest men are doingif i am convinced that i have an obvious work to do in that church it would be cowardly for me to abandon that work  her eyes lighted up  i see what you mean she said by staying in you can do many things that you could not do you can help to bring about the change by being frank that is your point of view you believe in the future of the church  i believe in an universal christian organization he replied  but while stronger men are honest she objected are not your ancient vows and ancient creeds continually making weaker men casuists  undoubtedly he agreed vigorously and thought involuntarily of mr engels phrased fatty degeneration of the soul yet i can see the signs on all sides of a gradual emancipation of which i might be deemed an example a smile came into his eyes like the sun on a greygreen sea  oh you could never be a casuist she exclaimed with a touch of vehemence you are much too positive it is just that note which is characteristic of so many clergymen that note of smoothingover and apology which you lack i could never feel it even when you were orthodox and now words failed her as she inspected his ruggedness  and now he took her up to cover his emotion now i am not to be classified  still examining him she reflected on this  classified isnt it because youre so much of an individual that one fails to classify you you represent something new to my experience something which seems almost a contradictionan emancipated church  you imagined me out of the churchbut where he demanded  thats just it she wondered intimately where when i try i can see no other place for you your place as in the pulpit  he uttered a sharp exclamation which she did not heed  i cant imagine you doing institutional work as it is calledyoure not fitted for it youd be wasted in it you gain by the historic setting of the church and yet it does not absorb you free to preach your convictions unfettered you will have a power over people that will be tremendous you have a very strong personality  she set his heart his mind to leaping by this unexpected confirmation on her part of his hopes and yet the man in him was intent upon the woman she had now the air of detached judgment while he could not refrain from speculating anxiously on the effect of his future course on her and on their intimate relationship he forbore from thinking now of the looming events which might thrust them apartput a physical distance between themhis anxiety was concerned with the possible snapping of the thread of sympathy which had bound them in this respect he dreaded her own future as much as his own what might she do for he felt in her a potential element of desperation a capacity to commit at any moment an irretrievable act  once you have made your ideas your own she mused you will have the power of convincing people  and yet  and yetshe seized his unfinished sentence you are not at all positive of convincing me ill give you the credit of forbearing to make proselytes she smiled at him  thus she read him again  if you call making proselytes a desire to communicate a view of life which gives satisfaction he began in his serious way  oh i want to be convinced she exclaimed penitently id give anything to feel as you feel theres something lacking in me there must be and i have only seen the disillusionizing side you infer that the issue of the creeds will crumblepreach the new and the old will fall away of itself but what is the new how practically do you deal with the creeds we have got off that subject  you wish to know he asked  yesi wish to know  the test of any doctrine is whether it can be translated into life whether it will make any difference to the individual who accepts it the doctrines expressed in the creeds must stand or fall by the test consider for instance the fundamental doctrine in the creeds that of the trinity which has been much scoffed at a belief in god you will admit has an influence on conduct and the trinity defines the three chief aspects of the god in whom christians believe of what use to quarrel with the word person if god be conscious and the character of god has an influence on conduct the ancients deemed him wrathful jealous arbitrary and hence flung themselves before him and propitiated him if the conscious god of the universe be good he is spoken of as a father he is as once in this belief father and creator and inasmuch as it is known that the divine qualities enter into man and that one man jesus whose composite portraitit is agreedcould not have been factitiously invented was filled with them we speak of god in man as the son and the spirit of god that enters into the soul of man transforming inspiring and driving him is the third person socalled there is no difficulty so far granted the initial belief in a beneficent god  if we agree that life has a meaning and in order to conform to the purpose of the spirit of the universe must be lived in one way we certainly cannot object to calling that right way of living that decree of the spirit the word  the incarnate word therefore is the concrete example of a human being completely filled with the spirit who lives a perfect life according to its decree ancient greek philosophy called this decree this meaning of life the logos and the nicene creed is a confession of faith in that philosophy although this creed is said to have been scandalously forced through the council of nicaea by an emperor who had murdered his wife and children and who himself was unbaptized against a majority of bishops who would if they had dared constantines displeasure have given the conscience freer play today the difficulty has practically disappeared the creed is there in the prayer book and so long as it remains we are at liberty to interpret the ancient philosophy in which it is writtenand which in any event could not have been greatly improved upon at that timein our own modern way as i am trying to explain it to you  christ was identified with the logos or word which must have had a meaning for all time before and after its complete revelation and this is what the nicene creed is trying to express when it says begotten of his father before all worlds in other words the purpose which christ revealed always existed the awkward expression of the ancients declaring that he came down for our salvation enlightenment contains a fact we may prove by experience if we accept the meaning he put upon existence and adopt this meaning as our scheme of life but we must first be quite clear as to this meaning we may and do express all this differently but it has a direct bearing on life it is the doctrine of the incarnation we begins to perceive through it that our own incarnations mean something and that our task is to discover what they do meanwhat part in the world purpose we are designed to play here  incarnate by the holy ghost of the virgin mary is an emphasis on the fact that man born of woman may be divine but the ignorant masses of the people of the roman empire were undoubtedly incapable of grasping a theory of the incarnation put forward in the terms of greek philosophy while it was easy for them with their readiness to believe in nature miracles to accept the explanation of christs unique divinity as due to actual physical generation by the spirit and the wide belief in the empire in gods born in this way aided such a conception many thousands were converted to christianity when a place was found in that religion for a feminine goddess and these abandoned the worship of isis demeter and diana for that of the virgin mary thus began an evolution which is still going on and we see now that it was impossible that the world should understand at once the spiritual meaning of life as christ taught itthat material facts merely symbolize the divine for instance the gospel of john has been called the philosophical or spiritual gospel and in spite of the fact that it has been assailed and historically discredited by modern critics for me it serves to illuminate certain truths of christs message and teaching that the other gospels do not mark the earliest gospel does not refer to the miraculous birth at the commencements of matthew and luke you will read of it and it is to be noted that the rest of these narratives curiously and naively contradict it now why do we find the miraculous birth in these gospels if it had not been inserted in order to prove in a manner acceptable to simple and unlettered minds the theory of the incarnation christs preexistence i do not say the insertion was deliberate and it is difficult for us moderns to realize the polemic spirit in which the gospels were written they were clearly not written as history the concern of the authors i think was to convert their readers to christ  when we turn to john what do we find in the opening verses of this gospel the incarnation is explained not by a virgin birth but in a manner acceptable to the educated and spirituallyminded in terms of the philosophy of the day and yet how simply in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god i prefer johns explanation  it is historically true that in the earlier days when the apostles creed was put forth the phrase born of they virgin mary was inserted for the distinct purpose of laying stress on the humanity of christ and to controvert the assertion of the gnostic sect that he was not born at all but appeared in the world in some miraculous way  thus today by the aid of historical research we are enabled to regard the creeds in the light of their usefulness to life the myth of the virgin birth probably arose through the zeal of some of the writers of the gospels to prove that the prophecy of isaiah predicted the advent of the jewish messiah who should be born of a virgin modern scholars are agreed that the word olmah which isaiah uses does not mean virgin but young woman there is quite a different hebrew word for virgin the jews at the time the gospels were written and before had forgotten their ancient hebrew knowing this mistake and how it arose we may repeat the word virgin mary in the sense used by many early christians as designating the young woman who was the mother of christ  i might mention one or two other phrases archaic and obscure the resurrection of the body may refer to the phenomenon of christs reappearance after death for which modern psychology may or may not account a little reflection however convinces one that the phenomenon did take place in some manner or else i think we should never have heard of christ you will remember that the apostles fled after his death on the cross believing what he had told them was all only a dream they were human literal and cowardly and they still needed some kind of inner energizing conviction that the individuality persisted after death that the solution of human life was victory over it in order to gain the courage to go out and preach the gospel and face death themselves and it was paul who was chiefly instrumental in freeing the message from the narrow bounds of palestine and sending it ringing down the ages to us the miracle doesnt lie in what paul saw but in the whole man transformed made incandescent journeying tirelessly to the end of his days up and down the length and breadth of the empire labouring as he says more abundantly than they all it is idle to say that the thing which can transform a mans entire nature and life is not a reality  she had listened motionless as under the spell of his words selfjustification as he proceeded might easily have fused itself into a desire to convince her of the truth of his beliefs but he was not deceived he knew her well enough to understand to feel the indomitable spirit of resistance in her swayed she could be but she would mot easily surrender  there is another phrase she said after a moment which i have never heard explained descended into hell  it was merely a matter of controverting those who declared christ was taken from the cross before he died in the childish science of the time to say that one descended into hell was to affirm that he was actually dead since the souls of the departed were supposed to go at once to hell hell and heaven were definite places to say that christ ascended to heaven and sat on the right hand of the father is to declare ones faith that his responsible work in the spiritual realm continues  and the atonement doesnt that imply a sacrifice of propitiation  atonement may be pronounced atonement hodder replied the old idea illustrated by a reference to the sacrifice of the ancients fails to convey the truth to modern minds and moreover as i have inferred these matters had to be conveyed in symbols until mankind were prepared to grasp the underlying spiritual truths which christ sought to convey orthodox christianity has been so profoundly affected by the ancient jewish religion that the conception of god as wrathful and jealousa god wholly outsidehas persisted to our times the atonement means union with the spirit of the universe through vicarious suffering and experience teaches us that our own sufferings are of no account unless they be for a cause for the furtherance of the design of the beneficent spirit which is continually at work christ may be said to have died for humanity because he had to suffer death itself in order to reveal the complete meaning of life you once spoke to me about the sense of sinof being unable to feel it  she glanced at him quickly but did not speak  there is a theory concerning this he continued which has undoubtedly helped many people and which may be found in the writings of certain modern psychologists it is that we have a conscious or lower human self and a subconscious or better self this subconscious self stretches down as it were into the depths of the universe and taps the source of spiritual power and it is through the subconscious self that every man is potentially divine potentially because the conscious self has to reach out by an effort of the will to effect this union with the spiritual in the subconscious and when it is effected it comes from the response of the subconscious apparently from without as a gift and therefore in theological language it is called grace this is what is meant by being born again the incarnation of the spirit in the conscious or human the two selves are no longer divided and the higher self assumes controltakes the reins so to speak  it is interesting as a theory and the fact that it has been seriously combated by writers who deny such a function of the subconscious does not at all affect the reality of the experience  once we have had a vision of the true meaning of life a vision which stirs the energies of our being what is called a sense of sin inevitably follows it is the discontent the regret in the light of a higher knowledge for the lost opportunities for a past life which has been uncontrolled by any unifying purpose misspent in futile undertakings wasted perhaps in follies and selfish caprices which have not only harmed ourselves but others although we struggle yet by habit by selfindulgence by lack of a sustained purpose we have formed a character from which escape seems hopeless and we realize that in order to change ourselves an actual regeneration of the will is necessary for awhile perchance we despair of this the effort to get out of the rut we have made for ourselves seems of no avail and it is not indeed until we arrive gradually or otherwise and through a proper interpretation of the life of christ at the conviction that we may even never become useful in the divine scheme that we have a sense of what is called the forgiveness of sins this conviction this grace this faith to embark on the experiment accomplishes of itself the revival of the will the rebirth which we had thought impossible we discover our task high or humbleour cause we grow marvellously at one with gods purpose and we feel that our will is acting in the same direction as his and through our own atonement we see the meaning of that other atonement which led christ to the cross we see that our conviction our grace has come through him and how he died for our sins  its quite wonderful how logical and simple you make it how thoroughly you have gone into it you have solved it for yourselfand you will solve it for others many others  she rose and he too got to his feet with a medley of feelings the path along which they walked was already littered with green acorns a gray squirrel darted ahead of them gained a walnut and paused quivering halfway up the trunk to gaze back at them and the glance she presently gave him seemed to partake of the shyness of the wild thing  thank you for explaining it to me she said  i hope you dont think he began  oh it isnt that she cried with unmistakable reproach i asked youi made you tell me it hasnt seemed at all likethe confessional she added and smiled and blushed at the word you have put it so nicely so naturally and you have given me so much to think about but it all dependsdoesnt itupon whether one can feel the underlying truth of which you spoke in the first place it rests upon a sense of the prevailing goodness of things it seems to me cruel that what is called salvation the solution of the problem of life should depend upon an accidental discovery we are all turned loose with our animal passions and instincts of selfpreservation by an indifferent creator in a wilderness and left to find our way out as best we can you answer that christ showed us the way there are elements in his teaching i cannot acceptperhaps because i have been given a wrong interpretation of them i shall ask you more questions some day  but even then she continued granted that christ brought the complete solution as you say why should so many millions have lived and died before and after his coming who had suffered so and who had never heard of him that is the way my reason works and i cant help it i would help it if i could  isnt it enough he asked to know that a force is at work combating evileven if you are not yet convinced that it is a prevailing force can you not trust that it will be a prevailing force if your sympathies are with it without demanding a revelation of the entire scheme of the universe of what use is it to doubt the eternal justice  oh use she cried i grant you its uselessness doubt seems an ingrained quality i cant help being a fatalist  and yet you have taken your life in your own hands he reminded her gently  only to be convinced of its futility she replied  again momentarily thrust back into himself he wondered jealously once more what the disillusionments had been of that experience from before which she seemed at times ready to draw back a little the veil  a sense of futility is a sense of incompleteness he said and generally precedes a sense of power  ah you have gained that yet it must always have been latent in youyou make one feel it but now she exclaimed as though the discovery had just dawned on her now you will need power now you will have to fight as you have never fought in your life  he found her enthusiasm as difficult to withstand as her stoicism  yes i shall have to fight he admitted her partisanship was sweet  when you tell them what you have told me she continued as though working it out in her own mind they will never submit to it if they can help it my father will never submit to it they will try to put you out as a hereticwont they  i have an idea that they will he conceded with a smile  and wont they succeed havent they the power  it dependsin the first place on whether the bishop thinks me a heretic  have you asked him  no  but cant they make you resign  they can deprive me of my salary  she did not press this  you mustnt think me a martyr he pleaded in a lighter tone  she paid no heed to this protest but continued to regard him with a face lighted by enthusiasm  oh thats splendid of you she cried you are going to speak the truth as you see it and let them do their worst of course fundamentally it isnt merely because theyre orthodox that they wont like it although theyll say so and perhaps think so it will be because if you have really found the truththey will instinctively fear its release for it has a social bearing toohasnt italthough you havent explained that part of it  it has a distinct social bearing he replied amazed at the way her mind flew forward and grasped the entire issue in spite of the fact that her honesty still refused to concede his premises such were the contradictions in her that he loved and though she did not suspect it she had in her the crusaders spirit i have always remembered what you once said that many who believed themselves christians had an instinctive feeling that there is a spark in christianity which if allowed to fly would start a conflagration beyond their control and that they had covered the spark with ashes i too he added whimsically was buried under the ashes  and the spark she demanded is not socialismtheir nightmare  the spark is christianity itselfbut i am afraid they will not be able to distinguish it from socialism the central paradox in christianity consists in the harmonizing of the individual and socialistic spirit and this removes it as far from the present political doctrine of socialism as it is possible to be christianity looked at from a certain viewpointand i think the proper viewpointis the most individualistic of religions since its basic principle is the development of the individual into an autonomous being  they stood facing each other on an open stretch of lawn the place was deserted through the trees in the near distance the sightless front of the ferguson mansion blazed under the september sun  individualistic she repeated as though dazed by the word applied to the religion she had discarded i cant understand do you think i ever can understand she asked him simply  it seems to me you understand more than you are willing to give yourself credit for he answered seriously you dont take into account your attitude  i see what you meana willingness to take the right road if i can find it i am not at all sure that i want to take it but you must tell me moremore of what you have discovered will you  he just hesitated she herself appeared to acknowledge no bar to their further intimacywhy should he  i will tell you all i know he said  suddenly as if by a transference of thought she voiced what he had in mind  you are going to tell them the truth about themselves she exclaimed that they are not christians  his silence was an admission  you must see he told her after the moment they had looked into each others faces that this is the main reason why i must stay at st johns in the church if i conscientiously can  i see the easier course would be to resign to have scruples and you believe there is a future for the church  i believe it he assented  she still held his eyes  yes it is worth doing if you see it that way it is more worth doing than anything else please dont think she said that i dont appreciate why you have told me all this why you have given me your reasons i know it hasnt been easy its because you wish me to have faith in you for my own sake not for yours and i am grateful  and if that faith is justified as you will help to justify it that it may be transferred to a larger sphere he answered  she gave him her hand but did not reply     chapter xix mr goodrich becomes a partisan    i  in these days of his preparation she haunted him continually in her he saw typified all those who possessed the divine discontent the yearning unsatisfiedthe fatalists and the dreamers and yet she seemed to have risen through instinct to share the fire of his vision of religion revealed to the countless ranks of strugglers as the hidden motivepower of the world the impetus of scientist statesman artist and philanthropist they had stood together on the heights of the larger view whence the whole of the battleline lay disclosed  at other and more poignant moments he saw her as waving him bravely on while he steamed out through towering seas to safety the impression was that of smiling at her destiny had she fixed upon it and did she linger now only that she might inspire him in his charge she was capable he knew of taking calmly the irrevocable step of accepting the decree as she read it the thought tortured the desire to save her from herself obsessed him with true clairvoyance she had divined him aright when she had said that he wished her to have faith in him for her own sake could he save her in spite of herself and how he could not see her except by chance was she waiting until he should have crossed the bar before she should pay some inexorable penalty of which he knew nothing  thus he speculated suffered was at once cast down and lifted up by the thought of her to him at least she was one of those rare and dauntless women the red stars of history by whom the dantes and leonardos are fired to express the inexpressible and common clay is fused and made mad one of those women who the more they reveal become the more inscrutable divinely inarticulate he called her arousing the passion of the man yet stirring the sublimer efforts of the god  what her feelings toward him whether she loved him as a woman loves a man he could not say no man being a judge in the supreme instance she beheld him emancipated perhaps from what she might have called the fetters of an orthodoxy for which she felt an instinctive antagonism but whether though proclaiming himself free the fact of his continuation in the ministry would not of itself set up in her a reaction he was unable to predict her antipathy to forms he saw was inherent her interesther fascinated absorption it might be calledin his struggle was spiritual indeed but it also had mixed in it the individualistic zeal of the nonconformist she resented the trammels of society though she suffered from her efforts to transcend them the course he had determined upon appeared to her as a rebellion not only against a cutanddried state of mind but also against vested privilege yet she had in her as she confessed the craving for what privilege brings in the way of harmonious surroundings he loved her for her contradictions  thus he was utterly unable to see what the future held for him in the way of continued communion with her to evolve any satisfactory theory as to why she remained in the city she had told him that the gardens were an excuse she had come by her own intimation to reflect to decide some momentous question marriage he found this too agitating to dwell upon summoning as it did conjectures of the men she might have known and it was perhaps natural in view of her attitude that he could only think of such a decision on her part as surrender  that he had caught and held her attention although by no conscious effort of his own was clear to him but had he not merely arrested her would she not presently disappear leaving only in his life the scarlet thread which she had woven into it for all time would he not fail to change permanently the texture of hers  such were his hopes and fears concerning her and they were mingled inextricably with other hopes and fears which had to do with the great venture of his life he dwelt in a realm of paradoxes discovered that exaltation was not incompatible with anxiety and dread he had no thought of wavering he had achieved to an extent he would not have believed possible the sense of consecration which brings with it indifference to personal fortunes and the revelation of the inner world and yet he shrank from the wounds he was about to receiveand give outwardly controlled he lived in the state of intense excitement of the leader waiting for the time to charge    ii  the moment was at hand september had waned the nights were cooling his parishioners were returning from the east one of these was eleanor goodrich whom he met on a corner tanned and revived from her long summer in massachusetts she had inherited the kindly shrewdness of glance characteristic of gentlefolk the glance that seeks to penetrate externals in its concern for the wellbeing of those whom it scrutinizes and he was subtly aware though she greeted him cordially that she felt a change in him without being able to account for it  i hear you have been here all summer she said reproachfully mother and father and all of us were much disappointed that you did not come to us on the cape  i should have come if it had been possible he replied it seems to have done you a world of good  oh i she seemed slightly embarrassed puzzled and did not look at him i am burned as disgracefully as evelyn phil came on for a month  he tells me he hasnt seen you but that isnt surprising for he hasnt been to church since juneand hes a vestryman now too  she was in mourning for her fatherinlaw who had died in the spring phil goodrich had taken his place eleanor found the conversation somehow drifting out of her control it was not at all what she would have desired to say her colour heightened  i have not been conducting the services but i resume them next sunday said the rector i ought to tell you he went on regarding her in view of the conversation we have had that i have changed my mind concerning a great many things we have talked aboutalthough i have not spoken of this as yet to any of the members of the congregation  she was speechless and could only stare at him blankly  i mean he continued with a calmness that astonished her afterwards that i have changed my whole conception as to the functions and future of the church that i have come to your position that we must make up our minds for ourselves and not have them made up for us and that we must examine into the truth of all statements and be governed accordingly  her attitude was one of mingled admiration concern and awe and he saw that she had grasped something of the complications which his course was likely to bring about  but you are not going to leave us she managed to exclaim  not if it is possible to remain he said smiling  i am so glad she was still overpowered by the disclosure it is good of you to tell me do you mind my telling phil  not at all he assured her  will you forgive me she asked after a slight pause during which she had somewhat regained her composure if i say that i always thought or rather hoped you would change that your former beliefs seemed sounlike you  he continued to smile at her as she stepped forward to take the car  ill have to forgive you he answered because you were right  she was still in such a state of excitement when she arrived down town that she went direct to her husbands law office  i like this he exclaimed as unannounced she opened the door of his sanctuary you might have caught me with one of those goodlooking clients of mine  oh phil she cried ive got such a piece of news i couldnt resist coming to tell you i met mr hodderand hes changed  changed phil repeated looking up at her flushed face beside him instead of a lawbook he flung down a time table in which he had been investigating the trains to a quail shooting club in the southern part of the state the transition to mr hodder was therefore somewhat abrupt why nell to look at you i thought it could be nothing else than my somewhat belated appointment to the united states supreme court how has hodder changed i always thought him pretty decent  dont laugh at me she begged its really seriousand no one knows it yet he said i might tell you do you remember that talk we had at fathers when he first came and we likened him to a modern savonarola  and george bridges took the floor and shocked mother and lucy and laureston supplied phil  i dont believe mother really was as much shocked as she appeared to be said eleanor at any rate the thing that had struck usyou and mewas that mr hodder looked as though he could say something helpful if he only would and then i went to see him afterwards in the parish houseyou rememberafter we had been reading modern criticism together and he told me that the faith which had come down from the fathers was like an egg it couldnt be chipped i was awfully disappointedand yet i couldnt help liking him he was so honest and the theological books he gave me to readwhich were so mediaeval and absurd well he has come around to our point of view he told me so himself  but what is our point of view nell her husband asked with a smile isnt it a good deal like professor bridges only were not quite so learned were just ordinary heathens as far as i can make out if hodder has our point of view he ought to go into the law or a trust company  oh phil she protested and youre on the vestry i do believe in something and so do you  something he observed is hardly a concrete and complete theology  why do you make me laugh she reproached him when the matter is so serious what im trying to tell you is that im sure mr hodder has worked it out hes too sincere to remain in the church and not have something constructive and satisfying ive always said that he seemed to have a truth shut up inside of him which he could not communicate well now he looks as though he were about to communicate it as though he had discovered it i suppose you think me silly but youll grant whatever mr hodder may be he isnt silly and women can feel these things you know im not given to sentimentality but i was never so impressed by the growth in any personality as i was this morning by his he seems to have become himself as i always imagined him and phil he was so fine hes absolutely incapable of posing as youll admit and he stood right up and acknowledged that hed been wrong in our argument he hasnt had the services all summer and when he resumes them next sunday i gathered that he intends to make his new position clear  mr goodrich thrust his hands in his pockets and gave a low whistle  i guess i wont go shooting saturday after all he declared i wouldnt miss hodders sermon for all the quail in harrington county  its high time you did go to church remarked eleanor contemplating not without pride her husbands closecropped pugnacious head  your judgments are pretty sound nell ill do you that credit and ive always owned up that hodder would be a fighter if he ever got started its written all over him whats more ive a notion that some of our friends are already a little suspicious of him  you mean mr parr she asked anxiously  no wallis plimpton  oh she exclaimed with disdain in her voice  mr parr only got back yesterday and wallis told me that hodder had refused to go on a yachting trip with him not only foolishness but high treason phil smiled plimptons the weathervane the barometer of that crowdhe feels a disturbance long before it turns uphes as sensitive as the stock market  he is the stock market said eleanor  its been my opinion phil went on reflectively that theyve all had just a trace of uneasiness about hodder all along an idea that nelson langmaid slipped up for the first time in his life when he got him to come oh the feelings been dormant but it existed and theyve been just a little afraid that they couldnt handle him if the time ever came hes not their type when i saw plimpton at the country club the other day he wondered in that genial offhand manner of his whether hodder would continue to be satisfied with st johns plimpton said he might be offered a missionary diocese oh well have a fine old row  i believe said eleanor that thats the only thing that interests you  well it does please me he admitted when i think of gordon atterbury and everett constable and a few otherseldon parrwho believe that religion ought to be kept archaic and innocuous served in a form that wont bother anybody by the way nell do you remember the verse the professor quoted about the pharisees and cleansing the outside of the cup and platter  yes she answered why  wellhodder didnt give you any intimation as to what he intended to do about that sort of thing did he  what sort of thing  about the inside of eldon parrs cupso to speak and the inside of wallis plimptons cup and everett constables cup and fergusons cup and langmaids did it ever strike you that in st johns we have the sublime spectacle of eldon parr the pharisee in chief conducting the church of christ who uttered that denunciation thats what george bridges meant theres something rather ironical in such a situation to say the least  i see said eleanor thoughtfully  and whats more its typical continued phil energetically the big baptist church on the boulevard is run by old sedges as canny a rascal as you could find in the state the inside of has cup has never been touched though he was once immersed in the mississippi they say and swallowed a lot of water  oh phil  hodders been pretty intimate with eldon parrthat always puzzled me phil went on and yet im like you i never doubted hodders honesty ive always been curious to know what would happen when he found out the kind of thing eldon parr is doing every day in his life making people stand and deliver in the interest of what he would call national prosperity why that fellow funk they sent to the penitentiary the other day for breaking into the addicks house isnt a circumstance to eldon parr hes robbed his tens of thousands and goes on robbing them right along by the way mr parr took most of addicks money before funk got his silver  phil you have such a ridiculous way of putting things but i suppose its true  true i should say it was there was mr bentleythat was mild and there never was a holdup of a western express that could compare to the consolidated tractions some of these big fellows have the same kind of brain as the professional thieves well they are professional thieveswhats the use of mincing matters they never try the same game twice mr parrs getting ready to make another big haul right now i know because plimpton said as much although he didnt confide in me what this particular piece of rascality is he knows better phil goodrich looked grim  but the law exclaimed his wife  there never was a law that nelson langmaid couldnt drive a horse and carriage through  and mr langmaids one of the nicest men i know  what i wonder mused phil is whether this is a mere doctrinal revolt on hodders part or whether he has found out a few things there are so many parsons in these days who dont seem to see any inconsistency in robbing several thousand people to build settlement houses and carved marble altars and who wouldnt accept a christmas box from a highwayman but ill do hodder the justice to say he doesnt strike me as that kind and i have an idea that eldon parr and wallis plimpton and the rest know he isnt know that hed be a tartar if he ever get started and thats what makes them uneasy  then it isnt his change of religious opinions they would care about said eleanor  oh i dont say that eldon parr wont try to throw him out if he questions the faith as delivered by the saints  phil what a way of putting it  any indication of independence any approach to truth would be regarded as dangerous phil continued and of course gordon atterbury and others we could mention who think they believe in the unchipped egg theory will be outraged but its deeper than that eldon parr will give orders that hodders to go  give orders  certainly that vestry so far as mr parr is concerned is a mere dummy board of directors hes made langmaid and plimpton and even everett constable whos the son of an honourable gentleman and ought to know better and he can ruin them by snapping his fingers he can even make the financial world too hot for ferguson ill say this for gordon atterbury that mr parr cant control him but hes got a majority without him and gordon wont vote for a heretic who are left except fatherinlaw waring and myself  he cant control either of you said eleanor proudly  when it comes to that nellwell move into canada and buy a farm  but can he hurt you phileither of you she asked after a moment  id like to see him try it phil goodrich declared  and his wife thought as she looked at him that she would like to see mr parr try it too    iii  phil goodrich had once said that mr plimptons translation of the national motto e pluribus unum was get together and it was true that not the least of mr plimptons many gifts was that of peace making such was his genius that he scented trouble before it became manifest to the world and he stoutly declared that no difference of opinion ever existed between reasonable men that might not be patched up before the breach became too wideprovided that a third reasonable man contributed his services the qualifying word reasonable is to be noted when mr bedloe hubbell had undertaken in the name of reform to make a witchs cauldron of the citys politics which mr beatty had hitherto conducted so smoothly from the back room of his saloon mr plimpton had unselfishly offered his services bedloe hubbell although he had been a playmate of mr plimptons wifes had not proved reasonable and had rejected with a scorn only to be deemed fanatical the suggestion that mr hubbells interests and mr beattys interests need not clash since mr hubbell might go to congress and mr plimpton was the more hurt since the happy suggestion was his own and he had had no little difficulty in getting mr beatty to agree to it  yet mr plimptons career in the ennobling role of peacemaker had on the whole been crowned with such success as to warrant his belief in the principle mr parr for instancein whose service as in that of any other friend mr plimpton was always ready to acthad had misunderstandings with eminent financiers and sometimes with united states senators mr plimpton had made many trips to the capitol at washington sometimes in company with mr langmaid sometimes not and on one memorable occasion had come away smiling from an interview with the occupant of the white house himself  lest mr plimptons powers of premonition seem supernatural it may be well to reveal the comparative simplicity of his methods genius analyzed is often disappointing mr plimptons was selective and synthetic to illustrate in a particular case he had met mr parr in new york and had learned that the reverend mr hodder had not only declined to accompany the banker on a yachting trip but had elected to remain in the city all summer in his rooms in the parish house while conducting no services mr parr had thought this peculiar on his return home mr plimpton had one day dropped in to see a mr gaines the real estate agent for some of his property and mr plimpton being halefellowwellmet mr gaines had warned him jestingly that he would better not let his parson know that he owned a half interest in a certain hotel in dalton street which was leased at a profitable rate  if mr plimpton felt any uneasiness he did not betray it and he managed to elicit from the agent in an entirely casual and jovial manner the fact that mr hodder a month or so before had settled the rent of a woman for a dalton street flat and had been curious to discover the name of the owner mr gaines whose business it was to recognize everybody was sure of mr hodder although he had not worn clerical clothes  mr plimpton became very thoughtful when he had left the office he visited nelson langmaid in the parr building and the result of the conference was to cause mr langmaid to recall with a twinge of uneasiness a certain autumn morning in a room beside bremerton lake when he had been faintly yet distinctly conscious of the admonitory whisperings of that sixth sense which had saved him on other occasions  dash it he said to himself after mr plimpton had departed and he stood in the window and gazed across at the flag on the roof of fergusons it would serve me right for meddling in this parson business why did i take him away from jerry whitely anyhow  it added to nelson langmaids discomfort that he had a genuine affection even an admiration for the parson in question he might have known by looking at the man that he would wake up some daysuch was the burden of his lament and there came to him ironically out of the past the very words of mr parrs speech to the vestry after dr gilmans death that succinct list of qualifications for a new rector which he himself nelson langmaid had humorously and even more succinctly epitomized their responsibility to the parish to the city and to god had been to find a rector neither too old nor too young who would preach the faith as we received it who was not sensational and who did not mistake socialism for christianity at the socialism a certain sickly feeling possessed the lawyer and he wiped beads of perspiration from his domelike forehead  he didnt pretend to be versed in theologyso he had declaredand at the memory of these words of his the epithet ass self applied passed his lips you want a parson who will stick to his last not too high or too low or too broad or too narrow who has intellect without too much initiative and will not get the church uncomfortably full of strangers and run you out of your pews thus he had capped the financier well if they had caught a tartar it served him nelson langmaid right he recalled his talk with gerald whitely and how his brotherinlaw had lost his temper when they had got on the subject of personality  perhaps wallis plimpton could do something langmaids hopes of this were not high it may have been that he had suspicions of what mr plimpton would have called hodders reasonableness one thing was clearthat mr plimpton was frightened in the sanctuaries the private confessionals of high finance and nelson langmaids office may be called so the more primitive emotions are sometimes exhibited  i dont see what business it is of a clergyman or of any one else whether i own property in dalton street mr plimpton had said as he sat on the edge of the lawyers polished mahogany desk what does he expect us to doallow our real estate to remain unproductive merely for sentimental reasons thats like a parson most of em havent got any more common sense than that what right has he got to go nosing around dalton street why doesnt he stick to his church  i thought you fellows were to build him a settlement house there langmaid observed  on the condition that he wouldnt turn socialist  youd better have stipulated it in the bond said the lawyer who could not refrain even at this solemn moment from the temptation of playing upon mr plimptons apprehensions im afraid hell make it his business wallis to find out whether you own anything in dalton street ill bet hes got a list of dalton street property in his pocket right now  mr plimpton groaned  thank god i dont own any of it said langmaid  what the deuce does he intend to do the other demanded  read it out in church langmaid suggested it wouldnt sound pretty wallis to be advertised in the post on monday morning as owning that kind of a hotel  oh hes a gentleman said mr plimpton he wouldnt do anything as low as that  but if hes become a socialist objected langmaid  he wouldnt do it his friend reiterated none too confidently i shouldnt be surprised if he made me resign from the vestry and forced me to sell my interest it nets me five thousand a year  what is the place langmaid asked sympathetically harrods  mr plimpton nodded  not that i am a patron the lawyer explained somewhat hastily but ive seen the building going home  it looks to me as if it would burn down some day wallis  i wish it would said mr plimpton  if its any comfort to youto us langmaid went on after a moment eldon parr owns the whole block above thirteenth on the south sidebought it three years ago he thinks the business section will grow that way  i know said mr plimpton and they looked at each other  the name predominant in both minds had been mentioned  i wonder if hodder really knows what hes up against mr plimpton sometimes took refuge in slang  well after all were not sure yet that hes up against anything replied langmaid who thought the time had come for comfort it may all be a false alarm theres no reason after all why a christian clergyman shouldnt rescue women in dalton street and remain in the city to study the conditions of the neighbourhood where his settlement house is to be and just because you or i would not be able to resist an invitation to go yachting with eldon parr a man might be imagined who had that amount of moral courage  thats just it hodder seems to me now i come to think of it just the kind of john brown type who wouldnt hesitate to get into a row with eldon parr if he thought it was right and pull down any amount of disagreeable stuff about our ears  youre mixing your heroes wallis said langmaid  i cant help it youd catch it too nelson what in the name of sense possessed you to get such a man  this being a question the lawyer was unable to answer the conversation came to another pause and it was then that mr plimptons natural optimism reasserted itself  it isnt donethe thing were afraid of thats all he proclaimed after a turn or two about the room hodders a gentleman as i said and if he feels as we suspect he does hell resign like a gentleman and a christian ill have a talk with himoh you can trust me ive got an idea gordon atterbury told me the other day there is a vacancy in a missionary diocese out west and that hodders name had been mentioned among others to the bishops for the place hed make a rattling missionary bishop you know holding services in saloons and knocking mens heads together for profanity and he boxes like a professional now a word from eldon parr might turn the trick every parson wants to be a bishop  langmaid shook his head  youre getting out of your depths my friend the church isnt wall street and missionary bishops arent chosen to make convenient vacancies  i dont mean anything crude mr plimpton protested but a word from the chief layman of a diocese like this a man who never misses a general convention and does everything handsomely might countparticularly if theyre already thinking of hodder the bishops would never suspect we wanted to get rid of him  well said langmaid i advise you to go easy all along the line  oh ill go easy enough mr plimpton assented smiling do you remember how i pulled off old senator matthews when everybody swore he was dead set on voting for an investigation in the matter of those coal lands mr parr got hold of in his state  matthews isnt hodder by a long shat said langmaid if you ask me my opinion ill tell you frankly that if hodder has made up his mind to stay in st johns a ton of dynamite and all the eldon parrs in the nation cant get him out  cant the vestry make him resign asked mr plimpton uncomfortably  youd better go home and study your canons my friend nothing short of conviction for heresy can do it if he doesnt want to go  you wouldnt exactly call him a heretic mr plimpton said ruefully  would you know a heretic if you saw one demanded langmaid  no but my wife would and gordon atterbury and constable would and eldon parr but dont lets get nervous  well thats sensible at any rate said langmaid  so mr plimpton had gone off optimistic and felt even more so the next morning after he had had his breakfast in the pleasant dining room of the gore mansion of which he was now master as he looked out through the open window at the sunshine in the foliage of waverley place the prospect of his being removed from that position of dignity and influence on the vestry of st johns which he had achieved with others after so much walking around the walls seemed remote and he reflected with satisfaction upon the fact that his wife who was his prime minister would be home from the east that day two heads were better than one especially if one of the two were charlotte gores and mr plimpton had often reflected upon the loss to the world and the gain to himself that she was a woman  it would not be gallant to suggest that his swans were geese    iv  the successful navigation of lower tower street at noonday required presence of mind on the part of the pedestrian there were currents and countercurrents eddies and backwaters and at the corner of vine a veritable maelstrom through which two lines of electric cars pushed their way east and weft north and south with incessant clanging of bells followed by automobiles with resounding horns trucks and delivery wagons with wheels reverberating on the granite a giant irish policeman who seemed in continual danger of a violent death and wholly indifferent to it stood between the car tracks and halted the rush from time to time driving the people like sheep from one side to the other through the doors of fergusons poured two conflicting streams of humanity and wistful groups of young women on the way from hasty lunches blocked the pavements and stared at the finery behind the plateglass windows  the rector slowly making his way westward permitted himself to be thrust hither and thither halted and shoved on again as he studied the faces of the throng and presently he found himself pocketed before one of the exhibits of feminine interest momentarily helpless listening to the admiring and envious chorus of a bevy of diminutive shopgirls on the merits of a paris gown it was at this moment that he perceived pushing towards him with an air of rescue the figure of his vestryman mr wallis plimpton  well well well he cried as he seized hodder by the arm and pulled him towards the curb what are you doing herein the marts of trade come right along with me to the eyrie and well have something to eat  the eyrie was a famous lunch club of limited membership at the top of the parr building where financial affairs of the first importance were discussed and settled  hodder explained that he had lunched at halfpast twelve  well step into my office a minute it does me good to see you again upon my word and i cant let you get by without a little powwow  mr plimptons trust company in vine street resembled a greek temple massive but graceful granite columns adorned its front while within it was partitioned off with polished marble and ornamental grills in the rear guarded by the desks and flanked by the compartments of various subordinates was the presidents private sanctum and into this holy of holies mr plimpton led the way with the simple unassuming genial air of the high priest of modern finance who understands men the room was eloquent almost to affectation of the system and order of great business inasmuch as it betrayed not the least sign of a workshop on the dark oak desk were two leatherbound books and a polished telephone the walls were panelled there was a stone fireplace with andirons set a deep carpet spread over the tessellated floor and three leatherpadded armchairs one of which mr plimpton hospitably drew forward for the rector he then produced a box of cigars  you dont smoke mr hodder i always forget thats the way you manage to keep yourself in such good shape he drew out a gold match box and seated himself with an air of gusto opposite his guest and you havent had a vacation they tell me  on the contrary said the rector mccrae has taken the services all summer  but youve been in the city mr plimpton exclaimed puffing at his cigar  yes ive been in the city  well well ill bet you havent been idle just between us as friends mr hodder ive often wondered if you didnt work too hardtheres such a thing as being too conscientious you know and ive an idea that the rest of the vestry think so mr parr for instance we know when weve got a good thing and we dont want to wear you out oh we can appreciate your point of view and admire it but a little relaxationeh its too bad that you couldnt have seen your way to take that cruisemr parr was all cut up about it i guess youre the only man among all of us fairly close to him who really knows him well said mr plimpton admiringly he thinks a great deal of you mr hodder by the way have you seen him since he got back  no hodder answered   the trip did him good i thought he was a little seedy in the springdidnt you wonderful man and when i think how hes slandered and abused it makes me hot and he never says anything never complains lives up there all alone and takes his medicine thats real patriotism according to my view he could retire tomorrowbut he keeps onwhy because he feels the weight of a tremendous responsibility on his shoulders because he knows if it werent for him and men like him upon whom the prosperity of this nation depends wed have famine and anarchy on our hands in no time and look what hes done for the city without ostentation mind you he never blows his own hornnever makes a speech and for the church but i neednt tell you when this settlement house and chapel are finished theyll be coming out here from new york to get points by the way i meant to have written you have our revised plans come yet we ought to break ground in november oughtnt we  i intend to lay my views on that matter before the vestry at the next meeting the rector said  well declared mr plimpton after a scarcely perceptible pause ive no doubt theyll be worth listening to if i were to make a guess he continued with a contemplative smile blowing a thin stream of smoke towards the distant ceiling i should bet that you have spent your summer looking over the ground i dont say that you have missed your vocation mr hodder but i dont mind telling you that for a clergyman for a man absorbed in spiritual matters a man who can preach the sermons you preach youve got more commonsense and business thoroughness than any one i have ever run across in your profession  looking over the ground hodder repeated ignoring the compliment  sure said mr plimpton smiling more benignly than ever you mustnt be modest about it dalton street and when that settlement house is built ill guarantee it will be run on a business basis no nonsense  what do you mean by nonsense hodder asked he did not make the question abrupt and there was even the hint of a smile in his eyes which mr plimpton found the more disquieting  why thats only a form of speech i mean youll be practical efficient that youll get hold of the people of that neighbourhood and make em see that the world isnt such a bad place after all make em realize that we in st johns want to help em out that you wont make them more foolishly discontented than they are and go preaching socialism to them  i have no intention of preaching socialism said hodder but he laid a slight emphasis on the word which sent a cold shiver down mr plimptons spine and made him wonder whether there might not be something worse than socialism  i knew you wouldnt he declared with all the heartiness he could throw into his voice i repeat youre a practical sensible man ill yield to none in my belief in the church as a moral uplifting necessary spiritual force in our civilization in my recognition of her high ideals but we business men mr hodderasi am sure you must agreehave got to live i am sorry to say on a lower plane weve got to deal with the world as we find it and do our little best to help things along we cant take the gospel literally or we should all be ruined in a day and swamp everybody else you understand me  i understand you said the rector  mr plimptons cigar had gone out in spite of himself he had slipped from the easygoing casual tone into one that was becoming persuasive apologetic strenuous although the day was not particularly warm he began to perspire a little and he repeated the words over to himself i understand you what the deuce did the rector know he had somehow the air of knowing everythingmore than mr plimpton did and mr plimpton was beginning to have the unusual and most disagreeable feeling of having been weighed in the balance and found wanting he glanced at his guest who sat quite still the head bent a trifle the disturbing gray eyes fixed contemplatively an himaccusingly and yet the accusation did not seem personal with the clergyman whose eyes were nearly the medium the channels of a greater an impersonal ice it was true that the man had changed he was wholly baffling to mr plimpton whose sense of alarm increased momentarily into an almost panicky feeling as he remembered what langmaid had said was this inscrutable rector of st johns gazing knowingly at the half owner of harrods hotel in dalton street who couldnt take the gospel literally there was evidently no way to find out at once and suspense would be unbearable in vain he told himself that these thoughts were nonsense the discomfort persisted and he had visions of that career in which he had become one of the first citizens and the respected husband of charlotte gore clashing down about his ears why because a clergyman should choose to be quixotic fanatical he did not took quixotic fanatical mr plimpton had to admitbut a good deal saner than he mr plimpton must have appeared at that moment his throat was dry and he didnt dare to make the attempt to relight his cigar  theres nothing like getting togetherkeeping in touch with people mr hodder he managed to say ive been out of town a good deal this summerputting on a little flesh im sorry to admit but ive been meaning to drop into the parish house and talk over those revised plans with you i will drop inin a day or two im interested in the work intensely interested and so is mrs plimpton shell help you im sorry you cant lunch with me  he had the air now of the man who finds himself disagreeably and unexpectedly closeted with a lunatic and his language although he sought to control it became even a trifle less coherent  you must make allowances for us business men mr hodder i mean of course were sometimes a little lax in our dutiesin the summer that is dont shoot the pianist hes doing hisahem you know the story  by the way i hear great things of you im told its on the cards that youre to be made a bishop  oh answered the rector there are better men mentioned than i  i want you to know this said his vestryman as he seized hodders hand much as we value you here bitterly as we should hate to lose you none of us i am sure would stand in the way of such a deserved advancement  thank you mr plimpton said the rector  mr plimpton watched the vigorous form striding through the great chamber until it disappeared then he seized his hat and made his way as rapidly as possible through the crowds to the parr building at the entrance of the openair roof garden of the eyrie he ran into nelson langmaid  youre the very man im after said mr plimpton breathlessly i stopped in your office and they said youd gone up  whats the matter wallis inquired the lawyer tranquilly you look as if youd lost a couple of bonds  ive just seen hodder and he is going to do it  do what  sit down here at this table in the corner and ill tell you  for a practical man it must be admitted that mr plimpton had very little of the concrete to relate and it appeared on crossexamination by mr langmaid who ate his cold meat and salad with an exasperating and undiminished appetitethat the only definite thing the rector had said was that he didnt intend to preach socialism this was reassuring  reassuring exclaimed mr plimpton whose customary noonday hunger was lacking i wish you could have heard him say it  the wicked remarked the lawyer flee when no man pursueth dont shoot the pianist langmaid set down his beer and threw back his head and laughed if i were the reverend mr hodder after such an exhibition as you gave i should immediately have suspected the pianist of something and i should have gone off by myself and racked my brains and tried to discover what it was hes a clever man and if he hasnt got a list of dalton street property now hell have one by tomorrow and the story of some of your transactions with tom beatty and the city council  i believe youd joke in the electric chair said mr a plimpton resentfully ill tell you thisand my experience backs me upif you cant get next to a man by a little plain talk he isnt safe i havent got the market sense for nothing and ill give you this tip nelsonits time to stand from under didnt i warn you fellows that bedloe hubbell meant business long before he started in and this parson can give hubbell cards and spades hodder cant see this thing as it is hes been thinking this summer and a man of that kind is downright dangerous when he begins to think hes found out things and hes put two and two together and hes the uncompromising type he has a notion that the gospel can be taken literally and i could feel all the time i was talking to him he thought i was a crook  perhaps he was right observed the lawyer  that comes well from you mr plimpton retorted  oh im a crook too said langmaid i discovered it some time ago the difference between you and me wallis is that i am willing to acknowledge it and youre not the whole business world as we know it is crooked and if we dont cut other peoples throats theyll cut ours  and if we let go what would happen to the country his companion demanded  langmaid began to shake with silent laughter  your solicitude about the country wallis is touching i was brought up to believe that patriotism had an element of sacrifice in it but i cant see ours and i cant imagine myself somehow as a hercules bearing the burden of our constitution from mr hodders point of view perhapsand im not sure it isnt the right one the pianist is doing his damnedest to the tune ofdalton street we might as well look this thing in the face my friend you and i really dont believe in another world or we shouldnt be taking so much trouble to make this one as wed like to have it  i never expected to hear you talk this way said mr plimpton  well its somewhat of a surprise to me the lawyer admitted  and i dont think you put it fairly his friend contended i never can tell when you are serious but this is damned serious in business we have to deal with crooks who hold us up right and left and if we stood back you know as well as i do that everything would go to pot and if we let the reformers have their way the country would be bedlam wed have anarchy and bloodshed revolution and the people would be calling us the strong men back in no time you cant change human nature and we have a sense of responsibilitywe support law and order and the church and found institutions and give millions away in charity  the big lawyer listened to this somewhat fervent defence of his order with an amused smile nodding his head slightly from side to side  if you dont believe in it demanded mr plimpton why the deuce dont you drop it  its because of my loyalty said langmaid i wouldnt desert my pals i couldnt bear wallis to see you go to the guillotine without me  mr plimpton became unpleasantly silent  well you may think its a joke he resumed after a moment but there will be a guillotine if we dont look out that confounded parson is getting ready to spring something and im going to give mr parr a tip hell know how to handle him he doesnt talk much but ive got an idea from one or two things he let drop that hes a little suspicious of a change in hodder but he ought to be waived  youre in no condition to talk to mr parr or to anyone else except your wife walks langmaid said youd better go home and let me see mr parr im responsible for mr hodder anyway  all right mr plimpton agreed as though he had gained some shred of comfort from this thought i guess youre in worse than any of us     volume 6     chapter xx the arraignment   i  looking backward hodder perceived that he had really come to the momentous decision of remaining at st johns in the twilight of an evening when on returning home from seeing kate marcy at mr bentleys he had entered the darkening church it was then that his mission had appeared to him as a vision every day afterward his sense and knowledge of this mission had grown stronger  to his mind not the least of the trials it was to impose upon him and one which would have to be dealt with shortly was a necessary talk with his assistant mccrae if their relationship had from the beginning been unusual and unsatisfactory adjectives would seem to defy what it had become during the summer what did mccrae think of him for hodder had it will be recalled bidden his assistant goodbyand then had remained at another brief interview during which mccrae had betrayed no surprise uttered no censure or comment hodder had announced his determination to remain in the city and to take no part in the services an announcement sufficiently astounding during the months that followed they had met at rare intervals exchanged casual greetings and passed on and yet hodder had the feeling more firmly planted than ever that mccrae was awaiting with an interest which might be called suspense the culmination of the process going on within him  well now that he had worked it out now that he had reached his decision it was incumbent upon him to tell his assistant what that decision was hodder shrank from it as from an ordeal his affection for the man his admiration for mccraes faithful untiring and unrecognized services had deepened he had a theory that mccrae really liked himwould even sympathize with his solution yet he procrastinated he was afraid to put his theory to the test it was not that hodder feared that his own solution was not the right one but that mccrae might not find it so he was intensely concerned that it should also be mccraes solutionthe answer if one liked to mccraes mute and eternal questionings he wished to have it a fruition for mccrae as well as for himself since theoretically at least he had pierced the hard crust of his assistants exterior and conceived him beneath to be all suppressed fire in short hodder wished to go into battle side by side with mccrae therein lay his anxiety  another consideration troubled himmccraes family dependent on a rather meagre salary his assistant in sustaining him in the struggle he meant to enter would be making even a greater sacrifice than himself for hodder had no illusions and knew that the odds against him were incalculable whatever if defeated his own future might be mccraes was still more problematical and tragic  the situation when it came was even more difficult than hodder had imagined it since mccrae was not a man to oil the wheels of conversation in silence he followed the rector up the stairs and into his study in silence he took the seat at the opposite side of the table and hodder as he hesitated over his opening contemplated in no little perplexity and travail the gaunt and noncommittal face before him  mccrae he began at length you must have thought my conduct this summer most peculiar i wish to thank you first of all for the consideration you have shown me and to tell you how deeply i appreciate your taking the entire burden of the work of the parish  mccrae shook his head vigorously but did not speak  i owe it to you to give you some clew to what happened to me the rector continued although i have an idea that you do not need much enlightenment on this matter i have a feeling that you have somehow been aware of my discouragement during the past year or so and of the causes of it you yourself hold ideals concerning the church which you have not confided to me of this i am sure i came here to st johns full of hope and confidence gradually to lose both gradually to realise that there was something wrong with me that in spite of all my efforts i was unable to make any headway in the right direction i became perplexed dissatisfiedthe results were so meagre so out of proportion to the labour and the very fact that those who may be called our chief parishioners had no complaint merely added to my uneasiness that kind of success didnt satisfy me and i venture to assume it didnt satisfy you  still mccrae made no sign  finally i came to what may be termed a double conclusion in the first place i began to see more and more clearly that our modern civilization is at fault to perceive how completely it is conducted on the materialistic theory of the survival of the fittest rather than that of the brotherhood of man and that those who mainly support this church are consciously or not using it as a bulwark for the privilege they have gained at the expense of their fellowcitizens and my conclusion was that christianity must contain some vital germ which i had somehow missed and which i must find if i could and preach and release it that it was the release of this germ these people feared unconsciously i say to you at the risk of the accusation of conceit that i believed myself to have a power in the pulpit if i could only discover the truth  hodder thought he detected as he spoke these words a certain relaxation of the tension  for a while as the result of discouragement of cowardice i may say of the tearingdown process of the theological structurebuilt of debris from many ruins on which my conception of christianity rested i lost all faith for many weeks i did not enter the church as you yourself must know then when i had given up all hope through certain incidents and certain persona a process of reconstruction began in short through no virtue which i can claim as my own i believe i have arrived at the threshold of an understanding of christianity as our lord taught it and lived it and i intend to take the pulpit and begin to preach it  i am deeply concerned in regard to yourself as to what effect my course may have on you and i am not you to listen to me with a view that you should see your way clear to support me mccrae but rather that you should be fully apprised of my new belief and intentions i owe this to you for your loyal support in the pest i shall go over with you later if you care to listen my whole position it may be called the extreme protestant position and i use protestant for want of a better word to express what i believe is pauls true as distinguished from the false of his two inconsistent theologies it was this doctrine of pauls of redemption by faith of reacting grace by an inevitable spiritual lawof rebirth if you willthat luther and the protestant reformers revived and recognized rightly as the vital element of christs teachings although they did not succeed in separating it wholly from the dross which clung to it it is the leaven which has changed governments and which in the end i am firmly convinced will make true democracy inevitable and those who oppose democracy inherently dread its workings  i do not know your views but it is only fair to add at this time that i no longer believe in the external and imposed authority of the church in the sense in which i formerly accepted it nor in the virgin birth nor in certain other dogmas in which i once acquiesced other clergymen of our communion have proclaimed in speech and writing their disbelief in these things i have satisfied my conscience as they have and i mean to make no secret of my change i am convinced that not one man or woman in ten thousand today who has rejected christianity ever knew what christianity is the science and archaic philosophy in which christianity has been swaddled and hampered is discredited and the conclusion is drawn that christianity itself must be discredited  yere going to preach all this mccrae demanded almost fiercely  yes hodder replied still uncertain as to his assistants attitude and more i have fully reflected and i am willing to accept all the consequences i understand perfectly mccrae that the promulgation alone of the liberal orthodoxy of which i have spoken will bring me into conflict with the majority of the vestry and the congregation and that the bishop will be appealed to they will say in effect that i have cheated them that they hired one man and that another has turned up whom they never would have hired but that wont be the whole story if it were merely a question of doctrine i should resign its deeper than that more sinister hodder doubled up his hand and laid it on the table its a matter he said looking into mccraes eyes of freeing this church from those who now hold it in chains and the two questions i see clearly now the doctrinal and the economic are so interwoven as to be inseparable my former ancient presentation of christianity left men and women cold it did not draw them into this church and send them out again fired with the determination to bring religion into everyday life resolved to do their part in the removal of the injustices and cruelties with which we are surrounded to bring christianity into government where it belongs dont misunderstand me im not going to preach politics but religion  i dont misunderstand ye answered mccrae he leaned a little forward staring at the rector from behind his steel spectacles with a glance which had become piercing  and i am going to discourage a charity which is a mockery of christianity hodder went on the spectacle of which turns thousands of men and women in sickening revolt against the church of christ today i have discovered at last how some of these persons have made their money and are making it and i am going to let them know since they have repudiated god in their own souls since they have denied the christian principle of individual responsibility that i as the vicar of god will not be a party to the transaction of using the church as a means of doling out illgotten gains to the poor  mr parr mccrae exclaimed  yes said the rector slowly and with a touch of sadness since you have mentioned him mr parr but i need not say that this must go no farther i am in possession of definite facts in regard to mr parr which i shall present to him when he returns  yell tell him to his face  it is the only way  mccrae had risen a remarkable transformation had come over the manhe was reminiscent at that moment of some covenanter ancestor going into battle and his voice shook with excitement  ye may count on me mr hodder he cried these many years ive waited these many years ive seen what ye see now but i was not the man aye ive watched ye since the day ye first set foot in this church i knew what was going on inside of ye because it was just that i felt myself i hopedi prayed ye might come to it  the sight of this taciturn scotchman moved in this way had an extraordinary effect on hodder himself and his own emotion was so inexpressibly stirred that he kept silence a moment to control it this proof of the truth of his theory in regard to mccrae he found overwhelming  but you said nothing mccrae he began presently i felt all along that you knew what was wrongif you had only spoken  i could not said mccrae i give ye my word i tried but i just could not manys the time i wanted tobut i said to myself when i looked at you wait it will come much better than ye can say it and ye have made me see more than i saw mr hodderalready ye have yeve got the whole thing in yere eye and i only had a part of it its because yere the bigger man of the two  you thought id come to it demanded hodder as though the full force of this insight had just struck him  well said mccrae i hoped it seemed to look at ye yer true naturewhat was by rights inside of ye thats the best explaining i can do and i call to mind that time ye spoke about not making the men in the classes christiansthat was what started me to thinking  and you asked me returned the rector how welcome some of them would be in mr parrs pew  ah it worried me declared the assistant with characteristic frankness to see how deep ye were getting in with him  hodder did not reply to this he had himself risen and stood looking at mccrae filled with a new thought  there is one thing i should like to say to youwhich is very difficult mccrae but i have no doubt you see the matter as clearly as i do in making this fight i have no one but myself to consider i am a single man  yell not need to go on answered mccrae with an odd mixture of sternness and gentleness in his voice ill stand and fall with ye mr hodder before i ever thought of the church i learned a trade as a boy in scotland im not a bad carpenter and if worse comes to worse ive an idea i can make as much with my hands as i make in the ministry  the smile they exchanged across the table sealed the compact between them    ii  the electric car which carried him to his appointment with the financier shot westward like a meteor through the night and now that the hour was actually at hand it seemed to hodder that he was absurdly unprepared to meet it new and formidable aspects hitherto unthought of rose in his mind and the figure of eldon parr loomed to brobdingnagian proportions as he approached it in spite of his determination the lifeblood of his confidence ebbed a sense of the power and might of the man who had now become his adversary increased and that apprehension of the impact of the great bankers personality the cutting edge with the vast achievements wedged in behind it each adding weight and impetus to its momentum the apprehension he had felt in less degree on the day of the first meeting and which had almost immediately evaporatedsurged up in him now his fear was lest the charged atmosphere of the bankers presence might deflect his own hitherto clear perception of true worth he dreaded once in the midst of those disturbing currents a bungling presentation of the cause which inspired him and which he knew to be righteousness itself  suddenly his mood shifted betraying still another weakness and he saw eldon parr suddenly vividlymore vividly indeed than ever beforein the shades of the hell of his loneliness and pity welled up drowning the image of incarnate greed and selfishness and lust for wealth and power the unique pathos of his former relationship with the man reasserted itself and hodder was conscious once more of the dependence which eldon parr had had on his friendship during that friendship he hodder had never lost the sense of being the stronger of the two of being leaned upon leaned upon by a man whom the world feared and hated and whom he had been enable to regard with anything but compassion and the unquestionable affection which sprang from it appalled by this transition he alighted from the car and stood for a moment alone in the darkness gazing at the great white houses that rose above the dusky outline of shrubbery and trees  at any rate he wouldnt find that sense of dependence tonight and it steeled him somewhat to think as he resumed his steps that he would meet now the other side the hard side hitherto always turned away had he needed no other warning of this the answer to his note asking for an appointment would have been enougha brief and formal communication signed by the bankers secretary  mr parr is engaged just at present sir said the servant who opened the door would you be good enough to step into the library  hardly had he entered the room when he heard a sound behind him and turned to confront alison the thought of her too had complicated infinitely his emotions concerning the interview before him and the sight of her now of her mature beauty displayed in evening dress of her white throat gleaming whiter against the severe black of her gown made him literally speechless never had he accused her of boldness and now least of all it was the quality of her splendid courage that was borne in upon him once more above the host of other feelings and impressions for he read in her eyes a knowledge of the meaning of his visit  they stood facing each other an appreciable moment  mr langmaid is with him now she said in a low voice  yes he answered  her eyes still rested on his face questioningly appraisingly as though she were seeking to estimate his preparedness for the ordeal before him his ability to go through with it successfully triumphantly and in her mention of langmaid he recognized that she had meant to sound a note of warning she had intimated a consultation of the captains a council of war and yet he had never spoken to her of this visit this proof of her partisanship that she had come to him at the crucial instant overwhelmed him  you know why i am here he managed to say it had to do with the extent of her knowledge  oh why shouldnt i she cried after what you have told me and could you think i didnt understand from the beginning that it meant this  his agitation still hampered him he made a gesture of assent  it was inevitable he said  yes it was inevitable she assented and walked slowly to the mantel resting her hand on it and bending her head i felt that you would not shirk it and yet i realize how painful it must be to you  and to you he replied quickly  yes and to me i do not know what you know specificallyi have never sought to find out things in detail that would be horrid but i understandin generali have understood for many years she raised her head and flashed him a glance that was between a quivering smile and tears and i know that you have certain specific information  he could only wonder at her intuition  so far as i am concerned it is not for the world he answered  oh i appreciate that in you she exclaimed i wished you to know it i wished you to know she added a little unsteadily how much i admire you for what you are doing they are afraid of youthey will crush you if they can  he did not reply  but you are going to speak the truth she continued her voice low and vibrating that is splendid it must have its effect no matter what happens  do you feel that he asked taking a step toward her  yes when i see you i feel it i think  whatever answer he might have made to this was frustrated by the appearance of the figure of nelson langmaid in the doorway he seemed to survey them benevolently through his spectacles  how are you hodder well alison i have to leave without seeing anything of youyou must induce your father not to bring his business home with him just a word he added to the rector before you go up  hodder turned to alison good night he said  the gentle but unmistakable pressure of her hand he interpreted as the pinning on him of the badge of her faith he was to go into battle wearing her colours their eyes met  good night she answered  in the hall the lawyer took his arm  whats the trouble hodder he asked sympathetically  hodder although on his guard was somewhat taken aback by the directness of the onslaught  im afraid mr langmaid the rector replied that it would take me longer to tell you than the time at your disposal  dear me said the lawyer this is too bad why didnt you come to me i am a good friend of yours hodder and there is an additional bond between us on my sisters account she is extremely fond of you you know and i have a certain feeling of responsibility for youi brought you here  you have always been very kind and i appreciate it hodder replied i should be sorry to cause you any worry or annoyance but you must understand that i cannot share the responsibility of my acts with any one  a little advice from an old legal head is sometimes not out of place even dr gilman used to consult me i hope you will bear in mind how remarkably well you have been getting along at st johns and what a success youve made  success echoed the rector  either mr langmaid read nothing in his face or was determined to read nothing  assuredly he answered benignly you have managed to please everybody mr parr includedand some of us are not easy to please i thought id tell you this as a friend as your first friend in the parish your achievement has been all the more remarkable following as you did dr gilman now it would greatly distress me to see that state of things disturbed both for your sake and others i thought i would just give you a hint as you are going to see mr parr that he is in rather a nervous state these socalled political reformers have upset the market and started a lot of legal complications thats why im here tonight go easy with him i know you wont do anything foolish  the lawyer accompanied this statement with a pat but this time he did not succeed in concealing his concern  that depends on ones point of view hodder returned with a smile i do not know how you have come to suspect that i am going to disturb mr parr but what i have to say to him is between him and me  langmaid took up his hat from the table and sighed  drop in on me sometime he said id like to talk to youhodder heard a voice behind him and turned a servant was standing there  mr parr is ready to see you sir he said  the rector followed him up the stairs to the room on the second floor half office half study where the capitalist transacted his business when at home    iii  eldon parr was huddled over his desk reading a typewritten document but he rose and held out his hand which hodder took  how are you mr hodder im sorry to have kept you waiting but matters of some legal importance have arisen on which i was obliged to make a decision youre well i hope he shot a glance at the rector and sat down again still holding the sheets if you will excuse me a moment longer ill finish this  certainly hodder replied  take a chair said mr parr youll find the evening paper beside you  hodder sat down and the banker resumed his perusal of the document his eye running rapidly over the pages pausing once in a while to scratch out a word or to make a note on the margin in the concentration of the man on the task before him the rector read a design an implication that the affairs of the church were of a minor importance sensed indeed the new attitude of hostility gazed upon the undiscovered side the dangerous side before which other men had quailed alisons words recurred to him they are afraid of you they will crush you if they can eldon parr betrayed at any rate no sign of fear if his mental posture were further analyzed it might be made out to contain an intimation that the rector by some act had forfeited the right to the unique privilege of the old relationship  well the fact that the banker had in some apparently occult manner been warned would make hodders task easieror rather less difficult his feelings were even more complicated than he had anticipated the moments of suspense were trying to his nerves and he had a shrewd notion that this making men wait was a favourite manoeuvre of eldon parrs nor had he underrated the benumbing force of that personality it was evident that the financier intended him to open the battle and he wasas he had expectedfinding it difficult to marshal the regiments of his arguments in vain he thought of the tragedy of garvin the thing was more complicated and behind this redoubtable and sinister eldon parr he saw as it were the wraith of that other who had once confessed the misery of his loneliness  at last the banker rang sharply the bell on his desk a secretary entered to whom he dictated a telegram which contained these words langmaid has discovered a way out it was to be sent to an address in texas then he turned in his chair and crossed his knees his hand fondling an ivory papercutter he smiled a little  well mr hodder he said  the rector intensely on his guard merely inclined his head in recognition that his turn had come  i was sorry the banker continued after a perceptible pausethat you could not see your way clear to have come with me on the cruise  i must thank you again hodder answered but i feltas i wrote youthat certain matters made it impossible for me to go  i suppose you had your reasons but i think you would have enjoyed the trip i had a good seaworthy boati chartered her from mr lieber the president of the continental zinc you know i went as far as labrador a wonderful coast mr hodder  it must be agreed the rector it was clear that mr parr intended to throw upon him the onus of the first move there was a silence brief indeed but long enough for hodder to feel more and more distinctly the granite hardness which the other had become to experience a rising reenforcing anger he went forward steadily but resolutely on the crest of it i have remained in the city he continued and i have had the opportunity to discover certain facts of which i have hitherto been ignorant and which in my opinion profoundly affect the welfare of the church it is of these i wished to speak to you  mr parr waited  it is not much of an exaggeration to say that ever since i came here i have been aware that st johns considering the long standing of the parish the situation of the church in a thickly populated district is not fulfilling its mission but i have failed until now to perceive the causes of that inefficiency  inefficiency the banker repeated the word  inefficiency said hodder the reproach the responsibility is largely mine as the rector the spiritual head of the parish i believe i am right when i say that the reason for the decision some twenty years ago to leave the church where it is instead of selling the property and building in the west end was that it might minister to the poor in the neighbourhood to bring religion and hope into their lives and to exert its influence towards eradicating the vice and misery which surround it  but i thought you had agreed said mr parr coldly that we were to provide for that in the new chapel and settlement house  for reasons which i hope to make plain to you mr parr hodder replied those people can never be reached as they ought to be reached by building that settlement house the principle is wrong the day is past when such things can be donein that way he laid an emphasis on these words it is good i grant you to care for the babies and children of the poor it is good to get young women and men out of the dancehalls to provide innocent amusement distraction instruction but it is not enough it leaves the great transforming thing in the lives of these people untouched and it will forever remain untouched so long as a sense of wrong a continually deepening impression of an unchristian civilization upheld by the church herself exists such an undertaking as that settlement housei see clearly nowis a palliation a poultice applied to one of many sores a compromise unworthy of the high mission of the church she should go to the root of the disease it is her first business to make christians who by amending their own lives by going out individually and collectively into the life of the nation will gradually remove these conditions  mr parr sat drumming on the table hodder met his look  so you too have come to it he said  have come to what  socialism  hodder in the state of clairvoyance in which he now surprisingly found himself accurately summed up the value and meaning of the bankers sigh  say rather he replied that i have come to christianity we shall never have what is called socialism until there is no longer any necessity for it until men of their owe free will are ready to renounce selfish personal ambition and power and work for humanity for the state  mr parrs gesture implied that he cared not by what name the thing was called but he still appeared strangely astonishingly calmhodder with all his faculties acute apprehended that he was dangerously calm the man who had formerly been his friend was now completely obliterated and he had the feeling almost of being about to grapple in mortal combat with some unknown monster whose tactics and resources were infinite whose victims had never escaped the monster was in eldon parrthat is how it came to him the waxy relentless demon was aroused it behooved him hodder to step carefully  that is all very fine mr hodder very altruistic very christian ive no doubtbut the world doesnt work that way these were the words borne in on hodders consciousness what drives the world is the motive furnished by the right of acquiring and holding property if we had a division today the able men would come out on top next year  the rector shook his head he remembered at that moment horace bentley  what drives the world is a far higher motive mr parr the motive with which have been fired the great lights of history the motive of renunciation and service which is transforming governments which is gradually making the world a better place in which to live and we are seeing men and women imbued with it rising in ever increasing numbers on every side today  service eldon parr had seized upon the word as it passed and held it what do you think my life has been i suppose he said with a touch of intense bitterness that you too who six months ago seemed as reasonable a man as i ever met have joined in the chorus of denunciators it has become the fashion today thanks to your socialists reformers and agitators to decry a man because he is rich to take it for granted that he is a thief and a scoundrel that he has no sense of responsibility for his country and his fellowmen the glory the true democracy of this nation lies in its equal opportunity for all they take no account of that of the fact that each has had the same chance as his fellows no but they cry out that the man who by the sweat of his brow has earned wealth ought to divide it up with the lazy and the selfindulgent and the shiftless  take my case for instanceit is typical of thousands i came to this city as a boy in my teens with eight dollars in my pocket which i had earned on a farm i swept the floor cleaned the steps moved boxes and ran errands in gabriel parkers store on third street i was industrious sober willing to do anything i fought i tell you every inch of my way as soon as i saved a little money i learned to use every ounce of brain i possessed to hold on to it i trusted a man once and i had to begin all over again and i discovered once for all if a man doesnt look out for himself no one will  i dont pretend that i am any better than any one else i have had to take life as i found it and make the best of it i conformed to the rules of the game i soon had sense enough knocked into me to understand that the conditions were not of my making but ill say this for myself eldon parr leaned forward over the blotter i had standards and i stuck by them i wanted to be a decent citizen to bring up my children in the right way i didnt squander my money when i got it on wine and women i respected other mens wives i supported the church and the institutions of the city i too even i had my ambitions my idealsand they were not entirely worldly ones you would probably accuse me of wishing to acquire only the position of power which i hold if you had accepted my invitation to go aboard the yacht this summer it was my intention to unfold to you a scheme of charities which has long been forming in my mind and which i think would be of no small benefit to the city where i have made my fortune i merely mention this to prove to you that i am not unmindful in spite of the circumstances of my own life of the unfortunates whose mental equipment is not equal to my own  by this poor boy argument whichif hodder had knownmr parr had used at banquets with telling effect the banker seemed to regain perspective and equilibrium to plant his feet once more on the rock of the justification of his life and from which by a somewhat extraordinary process he had not quite understood he had been partially shaken off as he had proceeded with his personal history his manner had gradually become one of the finality of experience over theory of the forbearance of the practical man with the visionary like most successful citizens of his type he possessed in a high degree the faculty of creating sympathy of compelling others to accepttemporarily at leasthis point of view it was this faculty hodder perceived which had heretofore laid an enchantment upon him and it was not without a certain wonder that he now felt himself to be released from the spell  the perceptions of the banker were as keen and his sense of security was brief somehow as he met the searching eye of the rector he was unable to see the man as a visionary but beheldand to do him justicefelt a twinge of respect for an adversary worthy of his steel  he who was accustomed to prepare for clouds when they were mere specks on his horizon paused even now to marvel why he had not dealt with this here was a mana fanatic if he likedbut still a man who positively did not fear him to whom his wrath and power were as nothing a new and startling and complicated sensationbut eldon parr was no coward if he had consciously or unconsciously formerly looked upon the clergyman as a dependent hodder appeared to be one no more the very ruggedness of the man had enhanced expandedas it wereuntil it filled the room and hodder had with an audacity unparalleled in the bankers experience arraigned by implication his whole life managed to put him on the defensive  but if that be your experience the rector said and it has become your philosophy what is it in you that impels you to give these large sums for the public good  i should suppose that you as a clergyman might understand that my motive is a christian one  hodder sat very still but a higher light came into his eyes  mr parr he replied i have been a friend of yours and i am a friend still and what i am going to tell you is not only in the hope that others may benefit but that your own soul may be saved i mean that literallyyour own soul you are under the impression that you are a christian but you are not and never have been one and you will not be one until your whole life is transformed until you become a different man if you do not change it is my duty to warn you that the sorrow and suffering the uneasiness which you now know and which drive you on in search of distraction to adding useless sums of money to your fortunethis suffering i say will become intensified you will die in the knowledge of it and live on after in the knowledge of it  in spite of himself the financier drew back before this unexpected blast the very intensity of which had struck a chill of terror in his inmost being he had been taken off his guardfor he had supposed the day long pastif it had ever existedwhen a spiritual rebuke would upset him the day long past when a minister could pronounce one with any force that the church should ever again presume to take herself seriously had never occurred to him and yetthe man had denounced him in a moment of depression of nervous irritation and exasperation against a government which had begun to interfere with the sacred liberty of its citizens against political agitators who had spurred that government on the world was mad no element it seemed was now content to remain in its proper place his voice as he answered shook with rageall the greater because the undaunted sternness by which it was confronted seemed to reduce it to futility  take care he cried take care you nor any other man clergyman or no clergyman have any right to be the judge of my conduct  on the contrary said holder if your conduct affects the welfare the progress the reputation of the church of which i am rector i have the right and i intend to exercise it it becomes my duty however painful to tell you as a member of the church wherein you have wronged the church and wronged yourself  he didnt raise his tone and there was in it more of sorrow than of indignation the banker turned an ashen gray a moment elapsed before he spoke a transforming moment he suddenly became ice  very well he said i cant pretend to account for these astounding views you have acquiredand i am using a mild term let me say this he leaned forward a little across the desk i demand that you be specific i am a busy man i have little time to waste i have certain mattersbefore me which must be attended to tonight i warn you that i will not listen any longer to vague accusations  it was holders turn to marvel did eldon purr after all have no sense of guilt instantaneously automatically his own anger rose  you may be sure mr parr that i should not be here unless i were prepared to be specific and what i am going to say to you i have reserved for your ear alone in the hope that you will take it to heart while it is not yet too late said amend your life accordingly  eldon parr shifted slightly his look became inscrutable was riveted on the rector  i shall call your attention first to a man of whom you have probably never heard he is dead nowhe threw himself into the river this summer with a curse on his lipsi am afraida curse against you a few years ago he lived happily with his wife and child in a little house on the grade suburban and he had several thousand dollars as a result of careful saving and systematic selfdenial  perhaps you have never thought of the responsibilities of a great name this man like thousands of others in the city idealized you he looked up to you as the soul of honour as a selfmade man who by his own unaided effortsas you yourself have just pointed outrose from a poor boy to a position of power and trust in the community he saw you a prominent layman in the church of god he was dazzled by the brilliancy of your success inspired by a civilization whichgave such opportunities he recognized that he himself had not the brains for such an achievementhis hope and love and ambition were centred in his boy  at the word eldon parrs glance was suddenly dulled by pain he tightened his lips  that boy was then of a happy merry disposition so the mother says and every summer night as she cooked supper she used to hear him laughing as he romped in the yard with his father when i first saw him this summer it was two days before his father committed suicide the child was lying stifled with the heat in the back room of one of those desolate lodging houses in dalton street and his little body had almost wasted away  while i was there the father came in and when he saw me he was filled with fury he despised the church and st johns above all churches because you were of it because you who had given so generously to it had wrecked his life you had shattered his faith in humanity his ideal from a normal contented man he had deteriorated into a monomaniac whom no one would hire a physical and mental wreck who needed care and nursing he said he hoped the boy would die  and what had happened the man had bought with all the money he had in the world consolidated tractions he had bought it solely because of his admiration for your ability his faith in your name it was inconceivable to him that a man of your standing a public benefactor a supporter of church and charities would permit your name to be connected with any enterprise that was not sound and just thousands like garvin lost all they had while you are still a rich man it is further asserted that you sold out all your stock at a high price with the exception of that in the leased lines which are guaranteed heavy dividends  have you finished demanded eldon parr  not quite on this subject replied the rector two nights after that the man threw himself in the river his body was pulled out by men on a tugboat and his worthless stock certificate was in his pocket it is now in the possession of mr horace bentley thanks to mr bentley the widow found a temporary home and the child has almost recovered  hodder paused his interest had suddenly become concentrated upon the bankers new demeanour and he would not have thought it within the range of possibility that a man could listen to such a revelation concerning himself without the betrayal of some feeling but so it waseldon parr had been coldly attentive save for the one scarcely perceptible tremor when the boy was mentioned his interrogatory gesture gave the very touch of perfection to this attitude since it proclaimed him to have listened patiently to a charge so preposterous that a less reasonable man would have cut it short  and what leads you to suppose he inquired that i am responsible in this matter what leads you to infer that the consolidated tractions company was not organized in good faith do you think that business men are always infallible the streetcar lines of this city were at sixes and sevens fighting each other money was being wasted by poor management the idea behind the company was a publicspirited one to give the citizens cheaper and better service by a more modern equipment by a wider system of transfer it seems to me mr hodder that you put yourself in a more quixotic position than the socalled reformers when you assume that the men who organize a company in good faith are personally responsible for every share of stock that is sold and for the welfare of every individual who may buy the stock we force no one to buy it they do so at their own risk i myself have thousands of dollars of worthless stock in my safe i have never complained  the full force of hodders indignation went into his reply  i am not talking about the imperfect code of human justice under which we live mr parr he cried this is not a case in which a court of law may exonerate you it is between you and your god but i have taken the trouble to find out from unquestioned sources the truth about the consolidated tractions companyi shall not go into the details at lengththey are doubtless familiar to you i know that the legal genius of mr langmaid one of my vestry made possible the organization of the company and thereby evaded the plain spirit of the law of the state i know that one branch line was bought for two hundred and fifty thousand dollars and capitalized for three millions and that most of the others were scandalously overcapitalized i know that while the coming transaction was still a secret you and other gentlemen connected with the matter bought up large interests in other lines which you proceeded to lease to yourselves at guaranteed dividends which these lines do not earn i know that the first large dividend was paid out of capital and the stock which you sold to poor garvin was so hopelessly watered that it never could have been anything but worthless if in spite of these facts you do not deem yourself responsible for the misery which has been caused if your conscience is now clear it is my duty to tell you that there is a higher bar of justice  the intensity of the fire of the denunciation had indeed a momentary yet visible effect in the bankers expression whatever the emotions thus lashed to selfbetrayal anger hatredfear perhaps hodder could not detect a trace of penitence and he was aware on the part of the other of a supreme almost spasmodic effort for selfcontrol the constitutional reluctance of eldon parr to fight openly could not have been more clearly demonstrated  because you are a clergyman mr hodder he began because you are the rector of st johns i have allowed you to say things to me which i would not have permitted from any other man i have tried to take into account your point of view which is naturally restricted your pardonable ignorance of what business men who wish to do their duty by church and state have to contend with when you came to this parish you seemed to have a sensible a proportional view of things you were content to confine your activities to your own sphere content not to meddle with politics and business which you could at first hand know nothing about the modern desire of clergymen to interfere in these matters has ruined the usefulness of many of them  i repeat i have tried to be patient i venture to hope still that this extraordinary change in you may not be permanent but merely the result of a natural sympathy with the weak and unwise and unfortunate who are always to be found in a complex civilization i can even conceive how such a discovery must have shocked you temporarily aroused your indignation as a clergyman against the world as it isand i may add as it has always been my personal friendship for you and my interest in your future welfare impel me to make a final appeal to you not to ruin a career which is full of promise  the rector did not take advantage of the pause a purely psychological curiosity hypnotized him to see how far the banker would go in his apparent generosity  i once heard you say i believe in a sermon that the christian religion is a leaven it is the leaven that softens and ameliorates the hard conditions of life that makes our relations with our fellowmen bearable but life is a contest it is war it always has been and always will be business is war commerce is war both among nations and individuals you cannot get around it if a man does not exterminate his rivals they will exterminate him in other days churches were built and endowed with the spoils of war and did not disdain the money today they cheerfully accept the support and gifts of business men i do not accuse them of hypocrisy it is a recognition on their part that business men in spite of hard facts are not unmindful of the spiritual side of life and are not deaf to the injunction to help others and when let me ask you could you find in the worlds history more splendid charities than are around us today institutions endowed for medical research for the conquest of deadly diseases libraries hospitals schoolsmen giving their fortunes for these things the fruits of a lifes work so laboriously acquired who can say that the modern capitalist is not liberal is not a public benefactor  i dislike being personal but you have forced it upon me i dislike to refer to what i have already done in the matter of charities but i hinted to you awhile ago of a project i have conceived and almost perfected of gifts on a much larger scale than i have ever attempted the financier stared at him meaningly and i had you in mind as one of the three men whom i should consult whom i should associate with myself in the matter we cannot change human nature but we can better conditions by wise giving i do not refer now to the settle ment house which i am ready to help make and maintain as the best in the country but i have in mind a system to be carried out with the consent and aid of the municipal government of playgrounds baths parks places of recreation and hospitals for the benefit of the people which will put our city in the very forefront of progress and i believe as a practical man i can convince you that the betterment which you and i so earnestly desire can be brought about in no other way agitation can only result in anarchy and misery for all  hodders wrath as he rose from his chair was of the sort that appears incredibly to add to the physical staturethe bewildering spiritual wrath which is rare indeed and carries all before it  dont tempt me mr parr he said now that i know the truth i tell you frankly i would face poverty and persecution rather than consent to your offer and i warn you once more not to flatter yourself that existence ends here that you will not be called to answer for every wrong act you have committed in accumulating your fortune that what you call business is an affair of which god takes no account what i say may seem foolishness to you but i tell you in the words of that foolishness that it will not profit you to gain the whole world and lose your own soul you remind me that the church in old time accepted gifts from the spoils of war and i will add of rapine and murder and the church today to repeat your own parallel grows rich with money wrongfully got legally ah yes legally perhaps but that will not avail you and the kind of church you speak ofto which i to my shame once consentedour lord repudiates it is none of his i warn you mr parr in his name first to make your peace with your brothers before you presume to lay another gift on the altar  during this withering condemnation of himself eldon parr sat motionless his face grown livid an expression on it that continued to haunt hodder long afterwards an expression indeed which made the banker almost unrecognizable  go he whispered his hand trembling visibly as he pointed towards the door goi have had enough of this  not until i have said one thing more replied the rector undaunted i have found the woman whose marriage with your son you prevented whom you bought off and started on the road to hell without any sense of responsibility you have made of her a prostitute and a drunkard whether she can be rescued or not is problematical she too is in mr bentleys care a man upon whom you once showed no mercy i leave garvin who has gone to his death and kate marcy and horace bentley to your conscience mr parr that they are representative of many others i do not doubt i tell you solemnly that the whole meaning of life is service to others and i warn you before it is too late to repent and make amends gifts will not help you and charities are of no avail  at the reference to kate marcy eldon parrs hand dropped to his side he seemed to have physical difficulty in speaking  ah you have found that woman he leaned an elbow on the desk he seemed suddenly to have become weary spent old and hodder as he watched him perceivedthat his haggard look was directed towards a photograph in a silver frame on the tablea photograph of preston parr at length he broke the silence  what would you have had me do he asked permit my son to marry a woman of the streets i suppose that would have been christianity according to your notion come now what world you have done if your son had been in question  a wave of pity swept over the rector  why he said why did you have nothing but cruelty in your heart and contempt for her when you saw that she was willing for the love of the son whom you loved to give up all that life meant to her how could you destroy her without a qualm the crime you committed was that you refused to see god in that womans soul when he had revealed himself to you you looked for wile for cunning for selfseekingand they were not there love had obliterated them when you saw how meekly she obeyed you and agreed to go away why did you not have pity if you had listened to your conscience you would have known what to do  i do not say that you should not have opposed the marriagethen marriage is not to be lightly entered into from the moment you went to see her you became responsible for her you hurled her into the abyss and she has come back to haunt you you should have had her educated and cared forshe would have submitted to any plan you proposed and if after a sensible separation you became satisfied as to her character and development and your son still wished to marry her you should have withdrawn your objections  as it is and in consequence of your act you have lost your son he left you then and you have no more control over him  stop cried eldon parr for gods sake stop i wont stand any more of this i will not listen to criticism of my life to strictures on my conduct from you or any other man he reached for a book on the corner of his deska cheque bookyoull want money for these people i suppose he added brutally i will give it but it must be understood that i do not recognize any right of theirs to demand it  for a moment holder did not trust himself to reply he looked down across the desk at the financier who was fumbling with the leaves  they do not demand it mr parr he answered gently and i have tried to make it plain to you that you have lost the right to give it i expected to fail in this i have failed  what do you mean eldon parr let the cheque book close  i mean what i said the rector replied that if you would save your soul you must put an end tomorrow to the acquisition of money and devote the rest of your life to an earnest and sincere attempt to make just restitution to those you have wronged and you must ask the forgiveness of god for your sins until you do that your charities are abominations in his sight i will not trouble you any longer except to say that i shall be ready to come to you at any time my presence may be of any help to you  the banker did not speak with a single glance towards the library holder left the house but paused for a moment outside to gaze back at it as it loomed in the darkness against the stars     chapter xxi alison goes to church   i  on the following sunday morning the early light filtered into alisons room and she opened her strong eyes presently she sprang from her bed and drew back the curtains of the windows gazing rapturously into the crystal day the verdure of the park was freshened to an incredible brilliancy by the dew a thin white veil of mist was spread over the mirror of the waters the trees flung long shadows across the turf  a few minutes later she was out thrilled by the silence drawing in deep breaths of the morning air lingering by still lakes catching the blue of the skya blue that left its stain upon the soul as the sun mounted she wandered farther losing herself in the wilderness of the forest  at eight oclock when she returned there were signs that the city had awakened a mounted policeman trotted past her as she crossed a gravel drive and on the treeflecked stretches which lately had been empty as eden human figures were scattered a child with a sailboat that languished for lack of wind stared at her first with fascination and wonder in his eyes and then smiled at her tentatively she returned the smile with a start  children had stared at her like that before now and for the first time in her life she asked herself what the look might mean she had never really been fond of them she had never indeed been brought much in contact with them but now without warning a sudden fierce yearning took possession of her surprised and almost frightened she stopped irresistibly and looked back at the thin little figure crouched beside the water to discover that his widened eyes were still upon her her own lingered on him shyly and thus for a moment she hung in doubt whether to flee or stay her heart throbbing as though she were on the brink of some unknown and momentous adventure she took a timid step  whats your name she asked  the boy told her  whats yours he ventured still under the charm  alison  he had never heard of that name and said so they deplored the lack of wind and presently still mystified but gathering courage he asked her why she blushed at which her colour deepened  i cant help it she told him  i like it the boy said  though the grass was still wet she got down on her knees in her white skirt the better to push the boat along the shore once it drifted beyond their reach and was only rescued by a fallen branch discovered with difficulty  the arrival of the boys father an anaemiclooking little man put an end to their play he deplored the condition of the ladys dress  it doesnt matter in the least she assured him and fled in a mood she did not attempt to analyze hurrying homeward she regained her room bathed and at half past eight appeared in the big formal diningroom from which the glare of the morning light was carefully screened her father insisted on breakfasting here and she found him now seated before the white tablecloth reading a newspaper he glanced up at her critically  so youve decided to honour me this morning he said  ive been out in the park she replied taking the chair opposite him he resumed his reading but presently as she was pouring out the coffee he lowered the paper again  whats the occasion today he asked  the occasion she repeated without acknowledging that she had instantly grasped his implication his eyes were on her gown  you are not accustomed as a rule to pay much deference to sunday  doesnt the bible say somewhere she inquired that the sabbath was made for man perhaps that may be broadened after a while to include woman  but you have never been an advocate so far as i know of women taking advantage of their opportunity by going to church  whats the use demanded alison of the thousands of working women spending the best part of the day in the ordinary church when their feet and hands and heads are aching unless some fire is kindled in their souls it is hopeless for them to try to obtain any benefit from religionsocalledas it is preached to them in most churches  fire in their souls exclaimed the banker  yes if the churches offered those who might be leaders among their fellows a practical solution of existence kindled their selfrespect replaced a life of drudgery by one of inspirationthat would be worth while but you will never get such a condition as that unless your pulpits are filled by personalities instead of puppets who are all cast in one mould and who profess to be there by divine right  i am glad to see at least that you are taking an interest in religious matters her father observed meaningly  alison coloured but she retorted with spirit  that is true of a great many persons today who are thinking on the subject if christianity is a solution of life people are demanding of the churches that they shall perform their function and show us how and why or else cease to encumber the world  eldon parr folded up his newspaper  so you are going to church this morning he said  yes at what time will you be ready  at quarter to eleven but if you are going to st john you will have to start earlier ill order a car at half past ten  where are you going she held her breath unconsciously for the answer  to calvary he replied coldly as he rose to leave the room but i hesitate to ask you to comei am afraid you will not find a religion there that suits you  for a moment she could not trust herself to speak the secret which ever since friday evening she had been burning to learn was disclosed  her father had broken with mr hodder  please dont order the motor for me she said id rather go in the street cars  she sat very still in the empty room her face burning  characteristically her father had not once mentioned the rector of st johns yet had contrived to imply that her interest in hodder was greater than her interest in religion and she was forced to admit with her customary honesty that the implication was true   the numbers who knew alison parr casually thought her cold they admired a certain quality in her work but they did not suspect that that quality was the incomplete expression of an innate idealism capable of being fanned into flamefor she was subject to rare but ardent enthusiasms which kindled and transformed her incredibly in the eyes of the few to whom the process had been revealed she had had even a longer list of suitors than any one guessed men whousually by accidenthad touched the hidden spring and suddenly beholding an unimagined woman had consequently lost their heads the mistake most of them had made for subtlety in such affairs is not a masculine trait was the failure to recognize and continue to present the quality in them which had awakened her she had invariably discovered the feet of clay  thus disillusion had been her misfortuneperhaps it would be more accurate to say her fortune she had built up after each invasion her defences more carefully and solidly than before only to be again astonished and dismayed by the next onslaught until at length the question had become insistentthe question of an alliance for purposes of greater security she had returned to her childhood home to consider it frankly recognizing it as a compromise a fall  and here in this sanctuary of her reflection and out of a quarter on which she had set no watch out of a wilderness which she had believed to hold nothing save the ruined splendours of the past had come one who like the traditional figures of the wilderness had attracted her by his very uncouthness and latent power and the anomaly he presented in what might be called the vehemence of his advocacy of an outworn orthodoxy in his occupation of the pulpit of st johns had quickened at once her curiosity and antagonism it had been her sudden discovery or rather her instinctive suspicion of the inner conflict in him which had set her standard fluttering in response once more for the last timesomething whisperednow she had become the lady of the lists she sat on her walls watching with beating heart and straining eyes the closed helm of her champion ready to fling down the revived remnant of her faith as prize or forfeit she had staked all on the hope that he would not lower his lance  saturday had passed in suspense and now was flooding in on her the certainty that he had not failed her that he had with a sublime indifference to a worldly future and success defied the powers with indifference too to her she knew of course that he loved her a man with less of greatness would have sought a middle way  when at half past ten she fared forth into the sunlight she was filled with anticipation excitement concern feelings enhanced and not soothed by the pulsing vibrations of the church bells in the softening air the swift motion of the electric car was grateful but at length the sight of familiar landmarks oldfashioned dwellings crowded in between the stores and factories of lower tower street brought back recollections of the days when she had come this way other sunday mornings and in a more leisurely public vehicle with her mother was it possible that she alison parr were going to church now her excitement deepened and she found it difficult to bring herself to the realization that her destination was a churchthe church of her childhood at this moment she could only think of st johns as the setting of the supreme drama  when she alighted at the corner of burton street there was the wellremembered shifting group on the pavement in front of the church porch how many times in the summer and winter in fair weather and cloudy in rain and sleet and snow had she approached that group as she approached it now here were the people still in the midst of whom her earliest associations had been formed changed indeedbut yet the same no the change was in her and the very vastness of that change came as a shock these had stood still anchored to their traditions while shehad she grown or merely wandered she had searched at least and seen she had once accepted themif indeed as a child it could have been said of her that she accepted anything she had been unable then at any rate to bring forward any comparisons  now she beheld them collectively in their complacent finery as representing a force a section of the army blocking the heads of the passes of the worlds progress resting on their arms but ready at the least uneasy movement from below to man the breastworks to fling down the traitor from above to fight fiercely for the solidarity of their order and alison even believed herself to detect by something indefinable in their attitudes as they stood momentarily conversing in lowered voices an aroused suspicion an uneasy anticipation her imagination went so far as to apprehend as they greeted her unwonted appearance that they read in it an addition to other vague and disturbing phenomena her colour was high  why my dear said mrs atterbury i thought you had gone back to new york long ago  beside his mother stood gordonmore dried up it seemed than ever alison recalled him as on this very spot a thin pale boy in short trousers and mrs atterbury a beautiful and controlled young matron associated with st johns and with childrens parties she was wonderful yet with her white hair and straight nose her erect figure still slight alison knew that mrs atterbury had never forgiven her for rejecting her sonor rather for being the kind of woman who could reject him  surely you havent been here all summer  alison admitted it characteristically without explanations  it seems so natural to see you here at the old church after all these years the lady went on and alison was aware that mrs atterbury questionedor rather was at a loss for the motives which had led such an apostate back to the fold we must thank mr hodder i suppose hes very remarkable i hear he is resuming the services today for the first time since june  alison was inclined to read a significance into mrs atterburys glance at her son who was clearing his throat  butwhere is mr parr he asked i understand he has come back from his cruise  yes he is back i came withouthimas you see  she found a certain satisfaction in adding to the mystification to the disquietude he betrayed by fidgeting more than usual  buthe always comes when he is in town businessi supposeahem  no replied alison dropping her bomb with cruel precision he has gone to calvary  the agitation was instantaneous  to calvary exclaimed mother and son in one breath  why it was gordon who demanded aa special occasion therea bishop or something  im afraid you must ask him she said  she was delayed on the steps first by nan ferguson then by the laureston greys and her news outdistanced her to the porch charlotte plimpton looking very red and solid her eyes glittering with excitement blocked her way  alison she cried in the slightly nasal voice that was a gore inheritance im told your fathers gone to calvary has mr hodder offended him i heard rumourswallis seems to be afraid that something has happened  he hasnt said anything about it to me charlotte said alison in quiet amusement but then he wouldnt you know i dont live here any longer and he has no reason to think that i would be interested in church matters  butwhy did you come charlotte demanded with gore naivete  alison smiled  you meanwhat was my motive  charlotte actually performed the miracle of getting redder she was afraid of alisonmuch more afraid since she had known of her vogue in the east when alison had put into execution the astounding folly to the gore mind of rejecting the inheritance of millions to espouse a profession it had been charlotte plimpton who led the chorus of ridicule and disapproval but success to the charlotte plimptons is its own justification and now her ambition which had ramifications was to have alison do her a garden incidentally the question had flashed through her mind as to how much alisons good looks had helped towards her triumph in certain shining circles  oh of course i didnt mean that she hastened to deny although it was exactly what she had meant her curiosity unsatisfiedand not likely to be satisfied at once she shifted abruptly to the other burning subject i was so glad when i learned you hadnt gone grace larrabbees garden is a dream my dear wallis and i stopped there the other day and the caretaker showed it to us cant you make a plan for me so that i may begin next spring and theres something else i wanted to ask you wallis and i are going to new york the end of the month shall you be there  i dont know said alison cautiously  we want so much to see one or two of your gardens on long island and especially the sibleys on the hudson i know it will be late in the seasonbut dont you think you could take us alison and i intend to give you a dinner ill write you a note heres wallis  well well well said mr plimpton shaking alisons hand wheres father i hear hes gone to calvary  alison made her escape inside the silent church eleanor goodrich gave her a smile and a pressure of welcome beside her standing behind the rear pew were asa waring andmr bentley mr bentley returned to st johns  you have come alison whispered  he understood her he took her hand in his and looked down into her upturned face  yes my dear he said and my girls have come sally grover and the others and some friends from dalton street and elsewhere  the news the sound of this old gentlemans voice and the touch of his hand suddenly filled her with a strange yet sober happiness asa waring though he had not overheard smiled at her too as in sympathy his austere face was curiously illuminated and she knew instinctively that in some way he shared her happiness mr bentley had come back yes it was an augury from childhood she had always admired asa waring and now she felt a closer tie  she reached the pew hesitated an instant and slipped forward on her knees years had gone by since she had prayed and even now she made no attempt to translate into words the intensity of her yearningfor what hodders success for one thingand by success she meant that he might pursue an unfaltering course true to her temperament she did not look for the downfall of the forces opposed to him she beheld him persecuted yet unyielding and was thus lifted to an exaltation that amazed if he could do it such a struggle must sorely have an ultimate meaning thus she found herself trembling on the borderland of faith  she arose bewildered her pulses beating and presently glancing about she took in that the church was fuller than she ever remembered having seen it and the palpitating suspense she felt seemed to pervade as it were the very silence with startling abruptness the silence was broken by the tones of the great organ that rolled and reverberated among the arches distant voices took up the processional the white choir filed pastfirst the treble voices of the boys then the deeper notes of thementurned and mounted the chancel steps and then she saw hodder her pew being among the first he passed very near her did he know she would be there the sternness of his profile told her nothing he seemed at that moment removed set apart consecratedthis was the word that came to her and yet she was keenly conscious of his presence  tingling she found herself repeating inwardly two lines of the hymn            lay hold on life and it shall be           thy joy and crown eternally  lay hold on life  the service beganthe wellremembered beautiful appeal and prayers which she could still repeat after a lapse of time almost by heart and their music and rhythm the simple yet magnificent language in which they were clothedher own languageawoke this morning a racial instinct strong in hershe had not known how strong or was it something in hodders voice that seemed to illumine the ancient words with a new meaning raising her eyes to the chancel she studied his head and found in it still another expression of that race the history of which had been one of protest of development of its own character and personality her mind went back to her first talk with him in the garden and she saw how her intuition had recognized in him then the spirit of a people striving to assert itself  she stood with tightened lips during the apostles creed listening to his voice as it rose strong and unfaltering above the murmur of the congregation  at last she saw him swiftly crossing the chancel mounting the pulpit steps and he towered above her a dominant figure his white surplice sharply outlined against the dark stone of the pillar the hymn died away the congregation sat down there was a sound in the church expectant presaging like the stirring of leaves at the first breath of wind and then all was silent    ii  he had preached for an hourlonger perhaps alison could not have said how long she had lost all sense of time  no sooner had the text been spoken except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god than she seemed to catch a fleeting glimpse of an hitherto unimagined personality hundreds of times she had heard those words and they had been as meaningless to her as to nicodemus but nownow something was brought home to her of the magnificent certainty with which they must first have been spoken of the tone and bearing and authority of him who had uttered them was christ like that and could it be a truth after all a truth only to be grasped by one who had experienced it  it was in vain that man had tried to evade this the supreme revelation of jesus christ had sought to substitute ceremonies and sacrifices for spiritual rebirth it was in vain that the church herself had from time to time been inclined to compromise st paul once the strict pharisee who had laboured for the religion of works himself had been reborn into the religion of the spirit it was paul who had liberated that message of rebirth which the world has been so long in grasping from the narrow bounds of palestine and sent it ringing down the ages to the democracies of the twentieth century  and even paul though not consciously inconsistent could not rid himself completely of that ancient automatic conception of religion which the master condemned but had on occasions attempted fruitlessly to unite the new with the old and thus for a long time christianity had been wrongly conceived as history beginning with what to paul and the jews was an historical event the allegory of the garden of eden the fall of adam and ending with the jewish conception of the atonement this was a rationalistic and not a spiritual religion  the miracle was not the vision whatever its nature which saul beheld on the road to damascus the miracle was the result of that vision the man reborn saul the persecutor of christians become paul who spent the rest of his days in spite of persecution and bodily infirmities journeying tirelessly up and down the roman empire preaching the risen christ and labouring more abundantly than they all there was no miracle in the new testament more wonderful than this  the risen christ let us not trouble ourselves about the psychological problems involved problems which the first century interpreted in its own simple way modern science has taught us this much at least that we have by no means fathomed the limits even of a transcendent personality if proofs of the resurrection and ascension were demanded let them be spiritual proofs and there could be none more convincing than the life of the transformed saul who had given to the modern western world the message of salvation  that afternoon as alison sat motionless on a distant hillside of the park gazing across the treedotted rolling country to the westward she recalled the breathless silence in the church when he had reached this point and paused looking down at the congregation by the subtle transmission of thought of feeling which is characteristic at dramatic moments of bodies of people she knew that he had already contrived to stir them to the quick it was not so much that these opening words might have been startling to the strictly orthodox but the added fact that hodder had uttered them the sensation in the pews as alison interpreted it and exulted over it was one of bewildered amazement that this was their rector the same man who had preached to them in june like paul of whom he spoke he too was transformed had come to his own radiating a new power that seemed to shine in his face  still agitated she considered that discourse now in her solitude what it meant for him for her for the church and civilization that a clergyman should have had the courage to preach it he himself had seemed unconscious of any courage had never onceshe recalledbeen sensational he had spoken simply even in the intensest moments of denunciation and she wondered now how he had managed without stripping himself without baring the intimate sacred experiences of his own soul to convey to them so nobly the change which had taken place in him  he began by referring to the hope with which he had come to st johns and the gradual realization that the church was a failurea dismal failure when compared to the high ideal of her master by her fruits she should be known and judged from the first he had contemplated with a heavy heart the sin and misery at their very gates not three blocks distant children were learning vice in the streets little boys of seven and eight underfed and anaemic were driven out before dawn to sell newspapers little girls thrust forth to haunt the saloons and beg while their own children were warmed and fed while their own daughters were guarded young women in dayton street were forced to sell themselves into a life which meant slow torture inevitable early death hopeless husbands and wives were cast up like driftwood by the cruel resistless flood of modern civilizationthe very civilization which yielded their wealth and luxury the civilization which professed the spirit of christ and yet was pitiless  he confessed to them that for a long time he had been blind to the truth had taken the inherited unchristian view that the disease which caused vice and poverty might not be cured though its ulcers might be alleviated he had not indeed clearly perceived and recognized the disease he had regarded dalton street in a very special sense as a reproach to st johns but now he saw that all such neighbourhoods were in reality a reproach to the city to the state to the nation true christianity and democracy were identical and the congregation of st johns as professed christians and citizens were doubly responsible inasmuch as they not only made no protest or attempt to change a government which permitted the dalton streets to exist but inasmuch also asdirectly or indirectlythey derived a profit from conditions which were an abomination to god it would be but an idle mockery for them to go and build a settlement house if they did not first reform their lives  here there had been a decided stir among the pews hodder had not seemed to notice it  when he their rector had gone to dalton street to invite the poor and wretched into gods church he was met by the scornful question are the christians of the churches any better than we christians own the grim tenements in which we live the saloons and brothels by which we are surrounded which devour our children christians own the establishments which pay us starvation wages profit by politics and take toll from our very vice evade the laws and reap millions while we are sent to jail is their god a god who will lift us out of our misery and distress are their churches for the poor are not the very pews in which they sit as closed to us as their houses  i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou wert cold or hot  one inevitable conclusion of such a revelation was that he had not preached to them the vital element of christianity and the very fact that his presentation of religion had left many indifferent or dissatisfied was proofpositive that he had dwelt upon nonessentials laid emphasis upon the mistaken interpretations of past ages there were those within the church who were content with this wholike the pharisees of oldwelcomed a religion which did not interfere with their complacency with their pursuit of pleasure and wealth with their special privileges welcomed a church which didnt raise her voice against the manner of their livesagainst the order the golden calf which they had set up which did not accuse them of deliberately retarding the coming of the kingdom of god  ah that religion was not religion for religion was a spiritual not a material affair in that religion vainly designed by man as a compromise between god and mammon there was none of the divine discontent of the true religion of the spirit no need of the rebirth of the soul and those who held it might well demand with nicodemus and the rulers of the earth how can these things be  and there were others who still lingered in the church perplexed and wistful who had come to him and confessed that the socalled catholic acceptance of divine truths on which he had hitherto dwelt meant nothing to them to these in particular he owed a special reparation and he took this occasion to announce a series of sunday evening sermons on the creeds so long as the creeds remained in the prayer book it was his duty to interpret them in terms not only of modern thought but in harmony with the real significance of the person and message of jesus christ those who had come to him questioning he declared were a thousand times right in refusing to accept the interpretations of other men the consensus of opinion of more ignorant ages expressed in an ancient science and an archaic philosophy  and what should be said of the vast and ever increasing numbers of those not connected with the church who had left it or were leaving it and of the less fortunate to whose bodily wants they had been ministering in the parish house for whom it had no spiritual message and who never entered its doors the necessity of religion of getting in touch with of dependence on the spirit of the universe was inherent in man and yet there were thousandsnay millions in the nation today in whose hearts was an intense and unsatisfied yearning who perceived no meaning in life no cause for which to work who did not know what christianity was who had never known what it was who wist not where to turn to find out education had brought many of them to discern in the churchs teachings an anachronistic medley of myths and legends of theories of schoolmen and theologians of surviving pagan superstitions which could not be translated into life they saw in christianity only the adulterations of the centuries if any one needed a proof of the yearning people felt let him go to the bookshops or read in the publishers lists today the announcements of books on religion there was no supply where there was no demand  truth might no longer be identified with tradition and the day was past when councils and synods might determine it for all mankind the era of forced acceptance of philosophical doctrines and dogmas was past and that of freedom of spiritual rebirth of vicarious suffering of willing sacrifice and service for a cause was upon them that cause was democracy christ was uniquely the son of god because he had lived and suffered and died in order to reveal to the world the meaning of this life and of the hereafterthe meaning not only for the individual but for society as well nothing might be added to or subtracted from that messageit was complete  true faith was simply trustingtrusting that christ gave to the world the revelation of gods plan and the saviour himself had pointed out the proof if any man do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak for myself christ had repeatedly rebuked those literal minds which had demanded material evidence true faith spurned it just as true friendship true love between man and man true trust scorned a written bond to paraphrase st jamess words faith without trust is deadbecause faith without trust is impossible god is a spirit only to be recognized in the spirit and every one of the saviours utterances werenot of the flesh of the manbut of the spirit within him he that hath seen me hath seen the father and why callest thou me good none is good save one that is god the spirit the universal meaning of life incarnate in the human jesus  to be born again was to overcome our spiritual blindness and then and then only we might behold the spirit shining in the soul of christ that proof had sufficed for mark had sufficed for the writer of the sublime fourth gospel had sufficed for paul let us lift this wondrous fact once and for all out of the ecclesiastical setting and incorporate it into our lives nor need the hearts of those who seek the truth who fear not to face it be troubled if they be satisfied from the gospels that the birth of jesus was not miraculous the physical never could prove the spiritual which was the real and everlasting which no discovery in science or history can take from us the godship of christ rested upon no dogma it was a conviction born into us with the new birth and it becomes an integral part of our personality our very being  the secret then lay in a presentation of the divine message which would convince and transform and electrify those who heard it to actiona presentation of the message in terms which the age could grasp that is what paul had done he had drawn his figures boldly from the customs of the life of his day but a more or less intimate knowledge of these ancient customs were necessary before modern men and women could understand those figures and parallels and the church must awake to her opportunities to her perception of the cause  what then was the function the mission of the church universal once she had laid claim to temporal power believed herself to be the sole agency of god on earth had spoken ex cathedra on philosophy history theology and science had undertaken to confer eternal bliss and to damn forever her members and even her priests had gone from murder to mass and from mass to murder and she had engaged in cruel wars and persecutions to curtail the liberties of mankind under that conception religion was a form of insurance of the soul perhaps a common universal belief had been necessary in the dark ages before the sublime idea of education for the masses had come but the church herselfthrough ignorancehad opposed the growth of education had set her face sternly against the development of the individual which christ had taught the privilege of man to use the faculties of the intellect which god had bestowed upon him he himself their rector had advocated a catholic acceptance though much modified from the mediaeval acceptanceone that professed to go behind it to an earlier age yes he must admit with shame that he had been afraid to trust where god trusted had feared to confide the working out of the ultimate truth of the minds of the millions  the church had been monarchical in form and some strove stubbornly and blindly to keep her monarchical democracy in government was outstripping her let them look around today and see what was happening in the united states of america a great movement was going on to transfer actual participation in government from the few to the manya movement towards true democracy and that was precisely what was about to happen in the church her condition at present was one of uncertainty transitionshe feared to let go wholly of the old she feared to embark upon the new just as the conservatives and politicians feared to give up the representative system the convention so was she afraid to abandon the synod the council and trust to man  the light was coming slowly the change the rebirth of the church by gradual evolution by the grace of god those who had laid the foundations of the church in which he stood of all protestantism had built for the future the racial instinct in them had asserted itself had warned them that to suppress freedom in religion were to suppress it in life to paralyze that individual initiative which was the secret of their advancement  the new church universal then would be the militant aggressive body of the reborn whose mission it was to send out into the life of the nation transformed men and women who would labour unremittingly for the kingdom of god unity would comebut unity in freedom true catholicity the truth would gradually pervade the massesbe wrought out by them even the great evolutionary forces of the age such as economic necessity were acting to drive divided christianity into consolidation and the starving churches of country villages were now beginning to combine  no man might venture to predict the details of the future organization of the united church although st paul himself had sketched it in broad outline every worker lay and clerical labouring according to his gift teachers executives ministers visitors missionaries healers of sick and despondent souls but the supreme function of the church was to inspireto inspire individuals to willing service for the cause the cause of democracy the fellowship of mankind if she failed to inspire the church would wither and perish and therefore she must revive again the race of inspirers prophets modern apostles to whom this gift was given going on their rounds awaking cities and arousing whole countrysides  but whenceit might be demanded by the cynical were the prophets to come prophets could not be produced by training and education prophets must be born rebornthat was the word let the church have faith once her cause were perceived once her whole energy were directed towards its fulfilment the prophets would arise out of the east and out of the west to stir mankind to higher effort to denounce fearlessly the shortcomings and evils of the age they had not failed in past ages when the world had fallen into hopelessness indifference and darkness and they would not fail now  prophets were personalities and phillips brooks himself a prophethad defined personality as a conscious relationship with god all truth he had said comes to the world through personality and down the ages had come an apostolic succession of personalities paul augustine francis dante luther miltonyes and abraham lincoln and phillips brooks whose authority was that of the spirit whose light had so shone before men that they had glorified the father which was in heaven the current of whose power had so radiated in ever widening circles as to make incandescent countless other souls  and which among them would declare that abraham lincoln like stephen had not seen his master in the sky  the true prophet the true apostle then was one inspired and directed by the spirit the laying on of hands was but a symbolthe symbol of the sublime truth that one personality caught fire from another let the church hold fast to that symbol as an acknowledgment a reminder of a supreme mystery tradition had its value when it did not deteriorate into superstition into the mechanical automatic transmission characteristic of the mediaeval church for the very suggestion of which peter had rebuked simon in samaria for it would be remembered that simon had said give me also this power that on whomsoever i lay hands he may receive the holy ghost  the true successor to the apostles must be an apostle himself  jesus had seldom spoken literally and the truths he sought to impress upon the world had of necessity been clothed in figures and symbolsfor spiritual truths might be conveyed in no other way the supreme proof of his godship of his complete knowledge of the meaning of life was to be found in his parables to the literal material mind for example the parable of the talents was merely an unintelligible case of injustice what was meant by the talents they were opportunities for service experience taught us that when we embraced one opportunity one responsibility the acceptance of it invariably led to another and so the servant who had five talents five opportunities gained ten the servant who had two gained two more but the servant of whom only one little service was asked refused that and was cast into outer darkness to witness another performing the task which should have been his hell here and hereafter was the spectacle of wasted opportunity and there is no suffering to compare to it  the crime the cardinal sin was with those who refused to serve who shut their eyes to the ideal their lord had held up who strove to compromise with jesus christ himself to twist and torture his message to suit their own notions as to how life should be led to please god and mammon at the same time to bind christs church for their comfort and selfish convenience of them it was written that they shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for they neither go in themselves neither suffer them that are entering to go in were these any better than the people who had crucified the lord for his idealism and because he had not brought them the material kingdom for which they longed  that servant who had feared to act who had hid his talent in the ground who had said unto his lord i knew thee that thou art an hard man reaping where thou hadst not sown was the man without faith the atheist who sees only cruelty and indifference in the order of things who has no spiritual sight but to the other servants it was said thou halt been faithful over a few things i will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord  the meaning of life then was service and by life our lord did not mean mere human existence which is only a part of life the kingdom of heaven is a state and may begin here and that which we saw around us was only one expression of that eternal lifea medium to work through towards god all was service both here and hereafter and he that had not discovered that the joy of service was the only happiness worth living for could have no conception of the kingdom to those who knew there was no happiness like being able to say i have found my place in gods plan i am of use such was salvation  and in the parable of the prodigal son may be read the history of what are known as the protestant nations what happens logically when the individual is suddenly freed from the restraint of external authority occurred when martin luther released the vital spark of christianity which he got from paul and from christ himselfthe revelation of individual responsibility that god the spirit would dwell by grace in the individual soul ah we had paid a terrible yet necessary price for freedom we had wandered far from the father we had been reduced to the very husks of individualism become as swine we beheld around us today selfishness ruthless competition as great contrasts between misery and luxury as in the days of the roman empire but should we for that reason return to the leadingstrings of authority could we if we would a little thought ought to convince us that the liberation of the individual could not be revoked that it had forever destroyed the power of authority to carry conviction to go back to the middle ages would be to deteriorate and degenerate no we must go on  luthers movement in religion had been the logical forerunner of democracy of universal suffrage in government the deathknell of that misinterpretation of christianity as the bulwark of monarchy and hierarchy had been sounded when he said ich kann nicht anders the new republic founded on the western continent had announced to the world the initiation of the transfer of authority to the individual soul god the counterpart of the king the ruler in a high heaven of a flat terrestrial expanse outside of the world was now become the spirit of a million spheres the indwelling spirit in man democracy and the religion of jesus christ both consisted in trusting the manyes and the womanwhom god trusts christianity was individualism carried beyond philosophy into religion and the christian the ideal citizen of the democracy was free since he served not because he had to but because he desired to of his own will which paradoxically is gods will god was in politics to the confusion of politicians god in government and in some greater and higher sense than we had yet perceived the saying vox populi vox dei was eternally true he entered into the hearts of people and moved them and so the world progressed it was the function of the church to make christians untilwhen the kingdom of god should comethe blending should be complete then church and state would be identical since all the members of the one would be the citizens of the other  i will arise and go to my father rebirth a sense of responsibility of consecration so we had come painfully through our materialistic individualism through our selfish protestantism to a glimpse of the true protestantismdemocracy  our spiritual vision was glowing clearer we were beginning to perceive that charity did not consist in dispensing largesse after making a fortune at the expense of ones fellowmen that there was something still wrong in a government that permits it it was gradually becoming plain to us after two thousand years that human bodies and souls rotting in tenements were more valuable than all the forests on all the hills that government christian government had something to do with these  we should embody in government those sublime words of the master suffer little children to come unto me and the government of the future would care for the little children we were beginning to do it here as elsewhere christianity and reason went hand in hand for the child became the man who either preyed on humanity and filled the prisons and robbed his fellows or else grew into a useful healthy citizen it was nothing less than sheer folly as well as inhuman cruelty to let the children sleep in crowded hot rooms reeking with diseases and run wild throughout the long summer learning vice in the city streets and we still had slaveryeconomic slaveryyes and the more horrible slavery of women and young girls in viceas much a concern of government as the problem which had confronted it in 1861 we were learning that there was something infinitely more sacred than property  and now alison recalled only to be thrilled again by an electric sensation she had never before experienced with such intensity the look of inspiration on the preachers face as he closed the very mists of the future seemed to break before his importuning gaze and his eyes seemed indeed to behold against the whitening dawn of the spiritual age he predicted the slender spires of a new church sprung from the foundations of the old a church truly catholic tolerant whose portals were wide in welcome to all mankind the creative impulse he had declared was invariably religious the highest art but the expression of the mute yearnings of a people of a race thus had once arisen all over europe those wonderful cathedrals which still cast their spell upon the world and art today would respondwas respondingto the unutterable cravings of mankind would strive once more to express in stone and glass and pigment what nations felt generation after generation would labour with unflagging zeal until the art sculptured fragment of the new cathedralthe new cathedral of democracypointed upward toward the blue vault of heaven such was his visiongod the spirit through man reborn carrying out his great design     chapter xxii which say to the seers see not   i  as alison arose from her knees and made her way out of the pew it was the expression on charlotte plimptons face which brought her back once more to a sense of her surroundings struck her indeed like a physical blow the expression was a scandalized one mrs plimpton had moved towards her as if to speak but alison hurried past her exaltation suddenly shattered replaced by a rising tide of resentment of angry amazement against a materialism so solid as to remain unshaken by the words which had so uplifted her eddies were forming in the aisle as the people streamed slowly out of the church and snatches of their conversation in undertones reached her ears  i should never have believed it  mr hodder of all men  the bishop  outside the swinging doors in the vestibule the voices were raised a little and she found her path blocked  its incredible she heard gordon atterbury saying to little everett constable who was listening gloomily  sheer unitarianism socialism heresy  his attention was forcibly arrested by alison in whose cheeks bright spots of colour burned he stepped aside involuntarily apologetically as though he had instinctively read in her attitude an unaccountable disdain everett constable bowed uncertainly for alison scarcely noticed them  ahem said gordon nervously abandoning his former companion and joining her i was just saying its incredible  she turned on him  it is incredible she cried that persons who call themselves christians cannot recognize their religion when they hear it preached  he gave back before her visibly in an astonishment which would have been ludicrous but for her anger he had never understood hersuch had been for him her greatest fascinationand now she was less comprehensible than ever the time had been when he would cheerfully have given over his hope of salvation to have been able to stir her he had never seen her stirred and the sight of her even now in this condition was uncomfortably agitating of all things an heretical sermon would appear to have accomplished this miracle  christianity he stammered  yes christianity her voice tingled i dont pretend to know much about it but mr hodder has at least made it plain that it is something more than dead dogmas ceremonies and superstitions  he would have said something but her one thought was to escape to be alone these friends of her childhood were at that moment so distasteful as to have become hateful some one laid a hand upon her arm  cant we take you home alison i dont see your motor  it was mrs constable  no thanksim going to walk alison answered yet something in mrs constables face in mrs constables voice made her pause something new something oddly sympathetic their eyes met and alison saw that the other womans were tired almost haggardyet understanding  mr hodder was righta thousand times right my dear she said  alison could only stare at her and the crimson in the bright spots of her cheeks spread over her face why had mrs constable supposed that she would care to hear the sermon praised but a second glance put her in possession of the extraordinary fact that mrs constable herself was profoundly moved  i knew he would change she went on i have seen for some time that he was too big a man not to change but i had no conception that he would have such power and such courage as he has shown this morning it is not only that he dared to tell us what we weresmaller men might have done that and it is comparatively easy to denounce but he has the vision to construct he is a seer himselfhe has really made me see what christianity is and as long as i live i shall never forget those closing sentences  and now asked alison and now what will happen  mrs constable changed colour her tact on which she prided herself had deserted her in a moment of unlookedfor emotion  oh i know that my father and the others will try to put him outbut can they alison asked  it was mrs constables turn to stare the head she suddenly and impulsively put forth trembled on alisons wrist  i dont know alisonim afraid they can it is too terrible to think about and they cantthey wont believe that many changes are coming that this is but one of many signs do come and see me  alison left her marvelling at the passage between them and that of all persons in the congregation of st johns the lightning should have struck mrs constable  turning to the right on burton street she soon found herself walking rapidly westward through deserted streets lined by factories and warehouses and silent in the sabbath calm she thought of hodder she would have liked to go to him in that hour  in park street luncheon was half over and nelson langmaid was at the table with her father the lawyer glanced at her curiously as she entered the room and his usual word of banter she thought was rather lame the two went on for some time discussing a railroad suit in texas and alison as she hurried through her meal leaving the dishes almost untouched scarcely heard them once in her reverie her thoughts reverted to another sunday when hodder had sat an honoured guest in the chair which mr langmaid now occupied  it was not until they got up from the table that her father turned to her  did you have a good sermon he asked  it was the underlying note of challenge to which she responded  the only good sermon i have ever heard  their eyes met langmaid looked down at the tip of his cigar  mr hodder said eldon parr is to be congratulated    ii  hodder when the service was over had sought the familiar recess in the robingroom the words which he himself had spoken still ringing in his ears and then he recalled the desperate prayer with which he had entered the pulpit that it might be given him in that hour what to say the vivid memories of the passions and miseries in dalton street the sudden hot response of indignation at the complacency confronting him his voice had trembled with anger he remembered as he had paused in his denunciation of these who had eyes and saw not meeting the upturned look of alison parr and his anger had turned to pity for their blindnesswhich once had been his own and he had gone on and on striving to interpret for them his new revelation of the message of the saviour to impress upon them the dreadful yet sublime meaning of life eternal and it was in that moment the vision of the meaning of the evolution of his race of the prodigal turning to responsibilityof which he once had had a glimpsehad risen before his eyes in its completenessthe guiding hand of god in history the spirit in these complacent souls as yet unstirred  so complete now was his forgetfulness of self of his future of the irrevocable consequences of the step he had taken that it was only gradually he became aware that some one was standing near him and with a start he recognized mccrae  there are some waiting to speak to ye his assistant said  oh hodder exclaimed he began mechanically to divest himself of his surplice mccrae stood by  id like to say a word firstif ye dont mind he began  the rector looked at him quickly  id like just to thank ye for that sermoni can say no more now said mccrae he turned away and left the room abruptly  this characteristic tribute from the inarticulate loyal scotchman left him tingling he made his way to the door and saw the people in the choir room standing silently in groups looking toward him some one spoke to him and he recognized eleanor goodrich  we couldnt help coming mr hodderjust to tell you how much we admire you it was wonderful what you said  he grew hot with gratitude with thankfulness that there were some who understoodand that this woman was among them and her husband phil goodrich took him by the hand  i can understand that kind of religion he said and if necessary i can fight for it i have come to enlist  and i can understand it too added the sunburned evelyn i hope you will let me help  that was all they said but hodder understood eleanor goodrichs eyes were dimmed as she smiled an her sister and her husbanda smile that bespoke the purest quality of pride and it was then as they made way for others that the full value of their allegiance was borne in upon him and he grasped the fact that the intangible barrier which had separated him from them had at last been broken down his look followed the square shoulders and aggressive closecropped head of phil goodrich the firm athletic figure of evelyn who had represented to him an entire class of modern young women vigorous athletic with a scorn of cant in which he secretly sympathized hitherto frankly untouched by spiritual interests of any sort she had indeed once bluntly told him that church meant nothing to her  in that little company gathered in the choir room were certain members of his congregation whom had he taken thought he would least have expected to see there were mr and mrs bradley an elderly couple who had attended st johns for thirty years and others of the same unpretentious element of his parish who were finding in modern life an increasingly difficult and bewildering problem there was little miss tallant an assiduous guild worker whom he had thought the most orthodox of persons miss ramsay who taught the children of the italian mothers mr carton the organist a professed freethinker with whom hodder had had many a futile argument and martha preston who told him that he had made her think about religion seriously for the first time in her life  and there were others types equally diverse young men of the choir and others whom he had never seen who informed him shyly that they would come again and bring their friends  and all the while in the background hodder had been aware of a familiar facehorace bentleys beside him when at length he drew near was his friend asa waringa strangely contrasted type the uncompromising eyes of a born leader of men flashed from beneath the heavy white eyebrows the button of the legion of honour gleaming in his wellkept coat seemed emblematic of the fire which in his youth had driven him forth to fight for the honour of his countrya fire still undimmed it was he who spoke first  this is a day i never expected to see mr hodder he said for it has brought back to this church the man to whom it owes its existence mr bentley did more by his labour and generosity his true christianity his charity and his wisdom for st johns than any other individual it is you who have brought him back and i wish personally to express my gratitude  mr bentley in mild reproof laid his hand upon the t shoulder of his old friend  ah asa he protested you shouldnt say such things  had it not been for mr bentley hodder explained i should not be here today  asa waring pierced the rector with his eye appreciating the genuine feeling with which these words were spoken and yet his look contained a question  mr bentley hodder added has been my teacher this summer  the old gentlemans hand trembled a little on the goldheaded stick  it is a matter of more pride to me than i can express sir that you are the rector of this church with which my most cherished memories are associated he said but i cannot take any part of the credit you give me for the splendid vision which you have raised up before us today for your inspired interpretation of history of the meaning of our own times you have moved me you have given me more hope and courage than i have had for many a long yearand i thank you mr hodder i am sure that god will prosper and guide you in what you have so nobly undertaken  mr bentley turned away walking towards the end of the room asa waring broke the silence  i didnt know that you knew him that you had seen what he is doingwhat he has done in this city i cannot trust myself mr hodder to speak of horace bentleys life i feel too strongly on the subject i have watched year by year this detestable spirit of greed this lust for money and power creeping over our country corrupting our people and institutions and finally tainting the church itself you have raised your voice against it and i respect and honour and thank you for it the more because you have done it without resorting to sensation and apparently with no thought of yourself and incidentally you have explained the christian religion to me as i have never had it explained in my life  i need not tell you you have made enemiespowerful ones i can see that you are a man and that you are prepared for them they will leave no stone unturned will neglect no means to put you out and disgrace you they will be about your ears tomorrowthis afternoon perhaps i need not remind you that the outcome is doubtful but i came here to assure you of my friendship and support in all you hope to accomplish in making the church what it should be in any event what you have done today will be productive of everlasting good  in a corner still lingered the group which mr bentley had joined and hodder as he made his way towards it recognized the faces of some of those who composed it sally grower was there and the young women who lived in mr bentleys house and others whose acquaintance he had made during the summer mrs garvin had brought little dicky incredibly changed from the wan little figure he had first beheld in the stifling back room in dalton street not yet robust but freckled and tanned by the country sun and wind the child whom he had seen constantly in the interval ran forward joyfully and hodder bent down to take his hand  these were his friends emblematic of the new relationship in which he stood to mankind and he owed them to horace bentley he wondered as he greeted them whether they knew what their allegiance meant to him in this hour but it sufficed that they claimed him as their own  behind them all stood kate marcy and it struck him for the first time as he gazed at her earnestly how her appearance had changed she gave him a frightened bewildered look as though she were unable to identify him now with the man she had known in the dalton street flat in the restaurant she was still struggling groping wondering striving to accustom herself to the higher light of another world  i wanted to come she faltered sally grower brought me  hodder went back with them to dalton street his new ministry had begun and on this the first day of it it was fitting that he should sit at the table of horace bentley even as on that other sunday two years agone he had gone to the home of the first layman of the diocese eldon parr    iii  the peace of god passes understanding because sorrow and joy are mingled therein sorrow and joy and striving and thus the joy of emancipation may be accompanied by a heavy heart the next morning when hodder entered his study he sighed as his eye fell upon the unusual pile of letters on his desk for their writers had once been his friends the inevitable breach had come at last  most of the letters as he had anticipated were painful reading and the silver papercutter with which he opened the first had been a christmas present from mrs burlingame who had penned it a lady of signal devotion to the church who for many years had made it her task to supply and arrange the flowers on the altar he had amazed and wounded hershe declaredinexpressibly and she could no longer remain at st johnsfor the present at least a significant addition he dropped the letter and sat staring out of the window presently arousing himself setting himself resolutely to the task of reading the rest  in the mood in which he found himself he did not atop to philosophize on the rigid yet sincere attitude of the orthodox his affection for many of them curiously remained though it was with some difficulty he strove to reconstruct a state of mind with which he had once agreed if christianity were to sweep on these few unbending but faithful ones must be sacrificed such was the law many while repudiating his new beliefsor unbeliefsadded to their regrets of the change in him protestations of a continued friendship a conviction of his sincerity others like mrs atterbury were frankly outraged and bitter the contents of one lilacbordered envelope brought to his eyes a faint smile did he knowasked the sender of thiscould he know the consternation he had caused in so many persons including herself what was she to believe and wouldnt he lunch with her on thursday  mrs fergusons letter brought another smilemore thoughtful her incoherent phrases had sprung from the heart and the picture rose before him of the stout but frightened goodnatured lady who had never accustomed herself to the enjoyment of wealth and luxury mr ferguson was in such a state and he must please not tell her husband that she had written yet much in his sermon had struck her as so true it seemed wrong to her to have so much and others so little and he had made her remember many things in her early life she had forgotten she hoped he would see mr ferguson and talk to him  then there was mrs constables short note that troubled and puzzled him this too had in it an undercurrent of fear and the memory came to him of the harrowing afternoon he had once spent with her when she would have seemed to have predicted the very thing which had now happened to him and yet not that thing he divined instinctively that a maturer thought on the subject of his sermon had brought on an uneasiness as the full consequences of this new teaching had dawned upon her consequences which she had not foreseen when she had foretold the change and he seemed to read between the lines that the renunciation he demanded was too great would he not let her come and talk to him  miss brewer a lady of no inconsiderable property was among those who told him plainly that if he remained they would have to give up their pews three or four communications were even more threatening mr alpheus gore mrs plimptons brother who at five and forty had managed to triple his share of the gore inheritance wrote that it would be his regretful duty to send to the bishop an information on the subject of mr hodders sermon  there were indeed a few letters which he laid thankfully in a pile by themselves these were mostly from certain humble members of his parish who had not followed their impulses to go to him after the service or from strangers who had chanced to drop into the church some were autobiographical such as those of a trained nurse a stenographer a hardware clerk who had sat up late sunday night to summarize what that sermon had meant to him how a gray and hopeless existence had taken on a new colour next sunday he would bring a friend who lived in the same boarding house hodder read every word of these and all were in the same strain at last they could perceive a meaning to religion an application of it to such plodding lives as theirs  one or two had not understood but had been stirred and were coming to talk to him another was filled with a venomous class hatred  the first intimation he had of the writer of another letter seemed from the senses rather than the intellect a warm glow suffused him mounted to his temples as he stared at the words turned over the sheet and read at the bottom the not very legible signature the handwriting by no means classic became then and there indelibly photographed on his brain and summed up for him the characteristics the warring elements in alison parr all afternoon she wrote i have been thinking of your sermon it was to me very wonderfulit lifted me out of myself and oh i want so much to believe unreservedly what you expressed so finely that religion is democracy or the motive power behind democracythe service of humanity by the reborn i understand it intellectually i am willing to work for such a cause but there is something in me so hard that i wonder if it can dissolve and then i am still unable to identify that cause with the church as at present constituted with the dogmas and ceremonies that still exist i am too thorough a radical to have your patience and i am filled with ragei can think of no milder wordon coming in contact with the living embodiments of that old creed who hold its dogmas so precious which say to the seers see not and to the prophets prophesy not unto us right things speak unto us smooth things prophesy deceits  you see i have been reading isaiah and when i came to that paragraph it seemed so appropriate these people have always existed and will they not always continue to exist i wish i could believe wholly and unreservedly that this class always preponderant in the world could be changed diminisheddone away with in a brighter future i can at least sympathize with isaiahs wrath  what you said of the longing the yearning which exists today amongst the inarticulate millions moved me mostand of the place of art in religion to express that yearning religion the motive power of art and art too service consider the lilies of the field you have made it at least allcomprehensive have given me a new point of view for which i can never be sufficiently gratefuland at a time when i needed it desperately that you have dared to do what you have done has been and will be an inspiration not only to myself but to many others this is a longer letter i believe than i have ever written in my life but i wanted you to know  he reread it twice pondering over its phrases a new point of view at a time when i needed it desperately it was not until then that he realized the full intensity of his desire for some expression from her since the moment he had caught sight of her in the church but he had not been prepared for the unreserve the impulsiveness with which she had actually written such was his agitation that he did not heed at first a knock on the door which was repeated he thrust the letter inside his coat as the janitor of the parish house appeared  there is a gentleman to see you sir in the office he said  hodder went down the stairs and he anticipated from the light yet nervous pacing that he heard on the bare floor that the visitor was none other than his vestryman mr gordon atterbury the sight of the gentlemans spruce figure confirmed the guess  good morning mr atterbury he said as he entered  mr atterbury stopped in his steps as if he had heard a shot  ahgood morning mr hodder i stopped in on my way to the office  sit down said the rector  mr atterbury sat down but with the air of a man who does so under protest who had not intended to he was visibly filled and almost quivering with an excitement which seemed to demand active expression and which the tall clergymans physical calm and selfpossession seemed to augment for a moment mr atterbury stared at the rector as he sat behind his desk then he cleared his throat  i thought of writing to you mr hodder my mother i believe has done so but it seemed to me on second thought better to come to you direct  the rector nodded without venturing to remark on the wisdom of the course  it occurred to me mr atterbury went on that possibly some things i wish to discuss mightahem be dispelled in a conversation that i might conceivably have misunderstood certain statements in your sermon of yesterday  i tried said the rector to be as clear as possible  i thought you might not fully have realized the effect of what you said i ought to tell you i think that as soon as i reached home i wrote out as accurately as i could from memory the gist of your remarks and i must say frankly although i try to put it mildly that they appear to contradict and controvert the doctrines of the church  which doctrines hodder asked  gordon atterbury sputtered  which doctrines he repeated can it be possible that you misunderstand me i might refer you to those which you yourself preached as late as last june in a sermon which was one of the finest and most scholarly efforts i ever heard  it was on that day mr atterbury replied the rector with a touch of sadness in his voice i made the discovery that fine and scholarly efforts were not christianity  what do you mean mr atterbury demanded  i mean that they do not succeed in making christians  and by that you imply that the members of your congregation those who have been brought up and baptized and confirmed in this church are not christians  i am sorry to say a great many of them are not said the rector  in other words you affirm that the sacrament of baptism is of no account  i affirm that baptism with water is not sufficient  im afraid that this is very grave mr hodder  i quite agree with you replied the rector looking straight at his vestryman  and i understood the other went on clearing his throat once more i think i have it correctly stated in my notes but i wish to be quite clear that you denied the doctrine of the virgin birth  hodder made a strong effort to control himself  what i have said i have said he answered and i have said it in the hope that it might make some impression upon the lives of those to whom i spoke you were one of them mr atterbury and if i repeat and amplify my meaning now it must be understood that i have no other object except that of putting you in the way of seeing that the religion of christ is unique in that it is dependent upon no doctrine or dogma upon no external or material sign or proof or authority whatever i am utterly indifferent to any action you may contemplate taking concerning me read your four gospels carefully if we do not arrive through contemplation of our lords sojourn on this earth of his triumph over death of his messagewhich illuminates the meaning of our lives hereat that inner spiritual conversion of which he continually speaks and which alone will give us charity we are not christians  but the doctrines of the church which we were taught from childhood to believe the doctrines which you once professed and of which you have now made such an unlookedfor repudiation  yes i have changed said the rector gazing seriously at the twitching figure of his vestryman i was bound body and soul by those very doctrines he roused himself but on what grounds do you declare mr atterbury he demanded somewhat sternly that this church is fettered by an ancient and dogmatic conception of christianity where are you to find what are called the doctrines of the church what may be heresy in one diocese is not so in another and i can refer to you volumes written by ministers of this church in good standing whose published opinions are the same as those i expressed in my sermon of yesterday the very cornerstone of the church is freedom but many have yet to discover this and we have held in our communion men of such divergent views as dr pusey and phillips brooks mr newman in his tract ninety which was sincerely written showed that the thirtynine articles were capable of almost any theological interpretation from what authoritative source are we to draw our doctrines in the baptismal service the articles of belief are stated to be in the apostles creed but nowherein this church is it defined how their ancient language is to be interpreted that is wisely left to the individual shall we interpret the gospels by the creeds which in turn purport to be interpretations of the gospels or shall we draw our conclusions as to what the creeds may mean to us by pondering on the life of christ and striving to do his will the letter killeth but the spirit maketh alive  hodder rose and stood facing his visitor squarely he spoke slowly and the fact that he made no gesture gave all the more force to his words  hereafter mr atterbury he added so long as i am rector of this church i am going to do my best to carry out the spirit of christs teachingto make christians and there shall be no more compromise so far as i can help it  gordon atterbury had grown very pale he too got to his feet  ii cannot trust myself to discuss this matter with you any further mr hodder i feel too deeplytoo strongly on the subject i do not pretend to account for this astonishing transformation in your opinions up to the present i have deemed st johns fortunatepeculiarly fortunate in having you for its rector i am bound to say i think you have not considered in this change of attitude on your part those who have made st johns what it is who through long and familiar association are bound to it by a thousand tiesthose who like myself have what may be called a family interest in this church my father and mother were married here i was baptized here i think i may go so far as to add mr hodder that this is our church the church which a certain group of people have built in which to worship god as was their right nor do i believe we can be reproached with a lack of hospitality or charity we maintain this parish house with its clubs and at no small inconvenience to ourselves we have permitted the church to remain in this district there is no better church music in this city and we have a beautiful service in the evening at which all pews are free it is not unreasonable that we should have something to say concerning the doctrine to be preached here that we should insist that that doctrine be in accordance with what we have always believed was the true doctrine as received by this church  up to this point mr atterbury had had a feeling that he had not carried out with much distinction the programme which he had so carefully rehearsed on the way to the parish house hodders poise had amazed and baffled himhe had expected to find the rector on the defensive but now burning anew with a sense of injustice he had a sense at last of putting his case strongly  the feeling of triumph however was short lived hodder did not reply at once so many seconds indeed went by that mr atterbury began once more to grow slightly nervous under the strange gaze to which he was subjected and when the clergyman spoke there was no anger in his voice but a qualitya feeling which was disturbing and difficult to define  you are dealing now mr atterbury he said with the things of caesar not of god this church belongs to godnot to you but you have consecrated it to him his truth as christ taught it must not be preached to suit any mans convenience when you were young you were not taught the truthneither was i it was mixed with adulterations which obscured and almost neutralized it but i intend to face it now and to preach it and not the comfortable compromise which gives us the illusion that we are christians because we subscribe to certain tenets and permits us to neglect our christian duties  and since you have spoken of charity let me assure you that there is no such thing as charity without the transforming personal touch it isnt the bread or instruction or amusement we give people vicariously but the effect of our gifteven if that gift be only a cup of cold waterin illuminating and changing their lives and it will avail any church little to have a dozen settlement houses while her members acquiesce in a state which refuses to relieve her citizens from sickness and poverty charity bends down only to lift others up and with all our works our expenditure and toil how many have we lifted up  gordon atterburys indignation got the better of him for he was the last man to behold with patience the shattering of his idols  i think you have cast an unwarranted reflection on those who have built and made this church what it is mr hodder he exclaimed and that you will find there are in it manya great many earnest christians who were greatly shocked by the words you spoke yesterday who will not tolerate any interference with their faith i feel it my duty to speak frankly mr hodder disagreeable though it be in view of our former relations i must tell you that i am not alone in the opinion that you should resign it is the least you can do in justice to us in justice to yourself there are other bodiesi cannot call them churcheswhich doubtless would welcome your liberal and i must add atrophying interpretation of christianity and i trust that reflection will convince you of the folly of pushing this matter to the extreme we should greatly deplore the sensational spectacle of st johns being involved in an ecclesiastical trial the unpleasant notoriety into which it would bring a church hitherto untouched by that sort of thing and i ought to tell you that i among others am about to send an information to the bishop  gordon atterbury hesitated a moment but getting no reply save an inclination of the head took up his hat  ahemi think that is all i have to say mr hodder good morning  even then hodder did not answer but rose and held open the door as he made his exit under the strange scrutiny of the clergymans gaze the little vestryman was plainly uncomfortable he cleared his throat once more halted and then precipitately departed  hodder went to the window and thoughtfully watched the hurrying figure of mr atterbury until it disappeared almost skipping around the corner  the germ of truth throughout the centuries had lost nothing of its dynamic potentialities if released and proclaimed it was still powerful enough to drive the world to insensate anger and opposition  as he stood there lost in reflection a shining automobile drew up at the curb and from it descended a firm lady in a tightfitting suit whom he recognized as mrs wallis plimpton a moment later she had invaded the officefor no less a word may be employed to express her physical aggressiveness the glowing health which she radiated  good morning mr hodder she said seating herself in one of the straightbacked chairs i have been so troubled since you preached that sermon yesterday i could scarcely sleep and i made up my mind id come to you the first thing this morning mr plimpton and i have been discussing it in fact people are talking of nothing else we dined with the laureston greys last night and they too were full of it charlotte plimpton looked at him and the flow of her words suddenly diminished and she added a little lamely for her spiritual matters in these days are so difficult arent they  spiritual matters always were difficult mrs plimpton he said  i suppose so she assented hurriedly with what was intended for a smile but what i came to ask you is thiswhat are we to teach our children  teach them the truth the rector replied  one of the things which troubled me most was your reference to modern criticism she went on recovering her facility i was brought up to believe that the bible was true the governessmiss standish you know such a fine type of englishwomanreads the children bible stories every sunday evening they adore them and little wallis can repeat them almost by heartthe pillar of cloud by day daniel in the lions den and the wise men from the east if they arent true some one ought to have told us before now  a note of injury had crept into her voice  how do you feel about these things yourself holder inquired  how do i feel why i have never thought about them very muchthey were there in the bible  you were taught to believe them  of course she exclaimed resenting what seemed a reflection on the gore orthodoxy  do they in any manner affect your conduct  my conduct she repeated i dont know what you mean i was brought up in the church and mr plimpton has always gone and we are bringing up the children to go is that what you mean  no hodder answered patiently that is not what i mean i ask whether these stories in any way enter into your life become part of you and tend to make you a more useful woman  welli have never considered them in that way she replied a little perplexed  do you believe in them yourself  whyi dont knowive never thought i dont suppose i do absolutelynot in those i have mentioned  and you think it right to teach things to your children which you do not yourself believe  how am i to decide she demanded  first by finding out yourself what you do believe he replied with a touch of severity  mr hodder she cried in a scandalized voice do you mean to say that i who have been brought up in this church do not know what christianity is  he looked at her and shook his head  you must begin by being honest with yourself he went on not heeding her shocked expression if you are really in earnest in this matter i should be glad to help you all i can but i warn you there is no achievement in the world more difficult than that of becoming a christian it means a conversion of your whole being something which you cannot now even imagine it means a consuming desire whichi fearin consideration of your present mode of life will be difficult to acquire  my present mode of life she gasped  precisely said the rector he was silent regarding her there was discernible not the slightest crack of crevice in the enamel of this womans worldly armour  for the moment her outraged feelings were forgotten the man had fascinated her to be told in this authoritative manner that she was wicked was a new and delightful experience it brought back to her the real motive of her visit which had in reality been inspired not only by the sermon of the day before but by sheer curiosity  what would you have me do she demanded  find yourself  do you mean to say that i am notmyself she asked now completely bewildered  i mean to say that you are nobody until you achieve conviction  for charlotte plimpton nee gore to be told in her own city by the rector of her own church that she was nobody was an event hitherto inconceivable it was perhaps as extraordinary that she did not resent it curiosity still led her on  conviction she repeated but i have conviction mr hodder i believe in the doctrines of the church  belief he exclaimed and checked himself strongly conviction through feeling not until then will you find what you were put in the world for  but my husbandmy children i try to do my duty  you must get a larger conception of it hodder replied  i suppose you mean she declared that i am to spend the rest of my life in charity  how you would spend the rest of your life would be revealed to you said the rector  it was the weariness in his tone that piqued her now the intimation that he did not believe in her sincerityhad not believed in it from the first the lifelong vanity of a woman used to be treated with consideration to be taken seriously was aroused this extraordinary man had refused to enter into the details which she inquisitively craved  charlotte plimpton rose  i shall not bother you any longer at present mr hodder she said sweetly i know you must have this morning especially a great deal to trouble you  he met her scrutiny calmly  it is only the things we permit to trouble us that do so mrs plimpton he replied my own troubles have arisen largely from a lack of faith on the part of those whom i feel it is my duty to influence  it was then she delivered her parting shot which she repeated with much satisfaction to her husband that evening she had reached the door was there a special service at calvary yesterday she asked innocently turning back  not that i know of  i wondered mr parr was there im toldand hes never been known to desert st johns except on the rarest occasions but oh mr hodder i must congratulate you on your influence with alison when she has been out here before she never used to come to church at all     volume 7     chapter xxiii the choice   i  pondering over alisons note he suddenly recalled and verified some phrases which had struck him that summer on reading harnacks celebrated history of dogma and around these he framed his reply to act as if faith in eternal life and in the living christ was the simplest thing in the world or a dogma to which one has to submit is irreligious it is christian to pray that god would give the spirit to make us strong to overcome the feelings and the doubts of nature where this faith obtained in this way exists it has always been supported by the conviction that the man lives who brought life and immortality to light to hold fast this faith is the goal of life for only what we consciously strive for is in this matter our own what we think we possess is very soon lost  the feelings and the doubts of nature the divine discontent the striving against the doubt that every honest soul experiences and admits thus the contrast between her and these others who accepted and went their several ways was brought home to him  he longed to talk to her but his days were full yet the very thought of her helped to bear him up as his trials his problems accumulated nor would he at any time have exchanged them for the former false peace which had been bought he perceived more and more clearly at the price of compromise  the worst of these trials perhaps was a conspicuous article in a newspaper containing a garbled account of his sermon and of the sensation it had produced amongst his fashionable parishioners he had refused to see the reporter but he had been made out a hero a socialistic champion of the poor the black headlines were nauseating and beside them in juxtaposition were pen portraits of himself and of eldon parr there were rumours that the banker had left the church until the recalcitrant rector should be driven out of it the usual long list of mr parrs benefactions was included and certain veiled paragraphs concerning his financial operations mr ferguson mr plimpton mr constable did not escapealthough they too had refused to be interviewed  the article brought to the parish house a bevy of reporters who had to be fought off and another batch of letters many of them from ministers in approval or condemnation  his fellowclergymen called some to express sympathy and encouragement more of them to voice in person indignant and horrified protests dr annesley of calvarya counterpart of whose rubicund face might have been found in the council of trent or in mediaeval fishmarketspronounced his anathemas with his hands folded comfortably over his stomach but eventually threw to the winds every vestige of his ecclesiastical dignity  then there came a note from the old bishop who was traveling a kindly note withal if noncommittalto the effect that he had received certain communications but that his physician would not permit him to return for another ten days or so he would then be glad to see mr holder and talk with him  what would the bishop do holders relations with him had been more than friendly but whether the bishops views were sufficiently liberal to support him in the extreme stand he had taken he could not surmise for it meant that the bishop too must enter into a conflict with the first layman of his diocese of whose hospitality he had so often partaken whose contributions had been on so lordly a scale the bishop was in his seventieth year and had hitherto successfully fought any attempt to supply him with an assistantcoadjutor or suffragan  at such times the fear grew upon hodder that he might be recommended for trial forced to abandon his fight to free the church from the fetters that bound her that the implacable hostility of his enemies would rob him of his opportunity  thus ties were broken many hard things were said and brought to his ears there were vacancies in the classes and guilds absences that pained him silences that wrung him  of all the conversations he held that with mrs constable was perhaps the most illuminating and distressing as on that other occasion when he had gone to her this visit was under the seal of confession unknown to her husband and hodder had been taken aback on seeing her enter his office by the very tragedy in her facethe tragedy he had momentarily beheld once before he drew up a chair for her and when she had sat down she gazed at him some moments without speaking  i had to come she said there are some things i feel i must ask you for i have been very miserable since i heard you on sunday  he nodded gently  i knew that you would change your viewsbecome broader greater you may remember that i predicted it  yes he said  i thought you would grow more liberal less bigoted if you will allow me to say so but i didnt anticipate she hesitated and looked up at him again  that i would take the extreme position i have taken he assisted her  oh mr hodder she cried impulsively was it necessary to go so far and all at once i am here not only because i am miserable but i am concerned on your account you hurt me very much that day you came to me but you made me your friend and i wonder if you really understand the terrible bitter feeling you have aroused the powerful enemies you have made by speaking soso unreservedly  i was prepared for it he answered surely mrs constable once i have arrived at what i believe to be the truth you would not have me temporize  she gave him a wan smile  in one respect at least you have not changed she told him i am afraid you are not the temporizing kind but wasnt theremaynt there still be a way to deal with this fearful situation you have made it very hard for usfor them you have given them no loophole of escape and there are many like me who do not wish to see your career ruined mr hodder  would you prefer he asked to see my soul destroyed and your own  her lips twitched  isnt there any other way but that cant this transformation which you say is necessary and vital come gradually you carried me away as i listened to you i was not myself when i came out of the church but i have been thinking ever since consider my husband mr hodder her voice faltered i shall not mince matters with youi know you will not pretend to misunderstand me i have never seen him so upset since since that time gertrude was married he is in a most cruel position i confessed to you once that mr parr had made for us all the money we possess everett is fond of you but if he espouses your cause on the vestry we shall be ruined  hodder was greatly moved  it is not my cause mrs constable he said  surely christianity is not so harsh and uncompromising as that and do you quite do justice toto some of these men there was no one to tell them the wrongs they were committingif they were indeed wrongs our civilization is far from perfect  the church may have been remiss mistaken the rector replied but the christianity she has taught adulterated though it were has never condoned the acts which have become commonplace in modern finance there must have been a time in the life of every one of these men when they had to take that first step against which their consciences revolted when they realized that fraud and taking advantage of the ignorant and weak were wrong they have deliberately preferred gratification in this life to spiritual developmentif indeed they believe in any future whatsoever for whosoever will save his life shall lose it is as true today as it ever was they have had their choicethey still have it  i am to blame she cried i drove my husband to it i made him think of riches it was i who cultivated mr parr and oh i suppose i am justly punished i have never been happy for one instant since that day  he watched her pityingly as she wept but presently she raised her face wonderingly  you do believe in the future life afterafter what you have been through  i do he answered simply  yesi am sure you do it is that what you are convinces me you do even the remarkable and sensible explanation you gave of it when you interpreted the parable of the talents is not so powerful as the impression that you yourself believe after thinking it out for yourselfnot accepting the old explanations and then she added with a note as of surprise you are willing to sacrifice everything for it  and you he asked cannot you too believe to that extent  everything she repeated it would meanpoverty nogod help mei cannot face it i have become too hard i cannot do without the world and even if i could oh you cannot know what you ask everett my husbandi must say it you make me tell you everythingis not free he is little better than a slave to eldon parr i hate eldon parr she added with startling inconsequence  if i had only known what it would lead to when i made everett what he is but i knew nothing of business and i wanted money position to satisfy my craving at the loss ofthat other thing and now i couldnt change my husband if i would he hasnt the courage he hasnt the vision what there was of him long ago has been killedand i killed it he isntanybody now  she relapsed again into weeping  and then it might not mean only povertyit might mean disgrace  disgrace the rector involuntarily took up the word  there are some things he has done she said in a low voice which he thought he was obliged to do which eldon parr made him do  but mr parr too hodder began  oh it was to shield eldon parr they could never be traced to him and if they ever came out it would kill my husband tell me she implored what can i do what shall i do you are responsible you have made me more bitterly unhappy than ever  are you willing he asked after a moment to make the supreme renunciation to face poverty and perhaps disgrace to save your soul and others  andothers  yes your sacrifice would not could not be in vain otherwise i should be merely urging on you the individualism which you once advocated with me  renunciation she pronounced the word questioningly can christianity really mean thatrenunciation of the world must we take it in the drastic sense of the church of the early centuriesthe church of the martyrs  christianity demands all of us or nothing he replied but the false interpretation of renunciation of the early church has cast its blight on christianity even to our day oriental asceticism stoicism philo and other influences distorted christs meaning renunciation does not mean asceticism retirement from the world a denial of life and the early christian since he was not a citizen since he took the view that this mortal existence was essentially bad and kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on another was the victim at once of false philosophies and of the literal messianic prophecies of the jews which were taken over with christianity the earthly kingdom which was to come was to be the result of some kind of a cataclysm personally i believe our lord merely used the messianic literature as a convenient framework for his spiritual kingdom of heaven and that the gospels misinterpret his meaning on this point  renunciation is not the withdrawal from the denial of life but the fulfilment of life the submission to the divine will and guidance in order that our work may be shown us renunciation is the assumption at once of heavenly and earthly citizenship of responsibility for ourselves and our fellowmen it is the realization that the other world the inner spiritual world is here now and that the soul may dwell in it before death while the body and mind work for the coming of what may be called the collective kingdom life looked upon in that way is not bad but goodnot meaningless but luminous  she had listened hungrily her eyes fixed upon his face  and for me she questioned  for you he answered leaning forward and speaking with a conviction that shook her profoundly if you make the sacrifice of your present unhappiness of your misery all will be revealed the labour which you have shirked which is now hidden from you will be disclosed you will justify your existence by taking your place as an element of the community you will be able to say of yourself at last i am of use  you meansocial work  the likeness of this to mrs plimptons question struck him she had called it charity how far had they wandered in their teaching from the revelation of the master since it was as new and incomprehensible to these socalled christians as to nicodemus himself  all christian work is social mrs constable but it is founded on love thou shaft love thy neighbour as thyself you hold your own soul precious since it is the shrine of god and for that reason you hold equally precious your neighbours soul love comes first as revelation as imparted knowledge as the divine gist of autonomyselfgovernment and then one cannot help working socially at the task for which we are made by nature most efficient and in order to discover what that task is we must wait  why did not some one tell me this when i was young she askednot speaking to him it seems so simple  it is simple the difficult thing is to put it into practicethe most difficult thing in the world both courage and faith are required faith that is content to trust as to the nature of the reward it is the wisdom of foolishness have you the courage  she pressed her hands together  aloneperhaps i should have i dont know but my husband i was able to influence him to his destruction and now i am powerless darkness has closed around me he would nothe will not listen to me  you have tried  i have attempted to talk to him but the whole of my life contradicts my words he cannot see me except as the woman who drove him into making money sometimes i think he hates me  hodder recalled as his eyes rested on her compassionately the sufferings of that other woman in dalton street  would you have me desert himafter all these years she whispered i often think he would be happier even now  i would have you do nothing save that which god himself will reveal to you go home go into the church and praypray for knowledge i think you will find that you are held responsible for your husband pray that that which you have broken you may mend again  do you think there is a chance  hodder made a gesture  god alone can judge as to the extent of his punishments  she got to her feet wearily  i feel no hopei feel no courage buti will try i see what you meanthat my punishment is my powerlessness  he bent his head  you are so strongperhaps you can help me  i shall always be ready he replied  he escorted her down the steps to the dark blue brougham with upstanding chestnut horses which was waiting at the curb but mrs constable turned to the footman who held open the door  you may stay here awhile she said to him and gave hodder her hand  she went into the church    ii  asa waring and his soninlaw phil goodrich had been to see hodder on the subject of the approaching vestry meeting and both had gone away not a little astonished and impressed by the calmness with which the rector looked forward to the conflict others of his parishioners some of whom were more discreet in their expressions of sympathy were no less surprised by his attitude and even his theological adversaries such as gordon atterbury paid him a reluctant tribute thanks perhaps to the newspaper comments as much as to any other factor in the minds of those of all shades of opinion in the parish the issue had crystallized into a duel between the rector and eldon parr bitterly as they resented the glare of publicity into which st johns had been dragged the first layman of the diocese was not beloved and the fairerminded of hodders opponents though appalled were forced to admit in their hearts that the methods by which mr parr had made his fortune and gained his ascendency would not bear scrutiny some of them were disturbed indeed by the discovery that there had come about in them by imperceptible degrees in the last few years a new and critical attitude towards the ways of modern finance moat of them had an uncomfortable feeling that hodder was somehow righta feeling which they sought to stifle when they reflected upon the consequences of facing it for this would mean a disagreeable shaking up of their own lives few of them were in a position whence they might cast stones at eldon parr  what these did not grasp was the fact that that which they felt stirring within them was the new and spiritual product of the dawning twentieth centurythe social conscience they wished heartily that the new rector who had developed this disquieting personality would peacefully resign and leave them to the former even tenor of their lives they did not for one moment doubt the outcome of his struggle with eldon parr the great banker was known to be relentless his name was synonymous with victory and yet paradoxically hodder compelled their inner sympathy and admiration  some of them who did not attempt peremptorily to choke the a processes made the startling discovery that they were not after all so shocked by his doctrines as they had at first supposed the trouble was that they could not continue to listen to him as formerly with comfort one thing was certain that they had never expected to look forward to a vestry meeting with such breathless interest and anxiety this clergyman had suddenly accomplished the surprising feat of reviving the church as a burning vital factor in the life of the community he had discerned her enemy and defied his power  as for hodder so absorbed had he been by his experiences so wrung by the human contacts the personal problems which he had sought to enter that he had actually given no thought to the battle before him until the autumn afternoon heavy with smoke had settled down into darkness the weather was damp and cold and he sat musing on the ordeal now abruptly confronting him before his study fire when he heard a step behind him he turned to recognize by the glow of the embers the heavy figure of nelson langmaid  i hope im not disturbing you hodder he said the janitor said you were in and your door is open  not at all replied the rector rising as he stood for a moment facing the lawyer the thought of their friendship and how it had begun in the little rectory overlooking the lake at bremerton was uppermost in his mindyes and the memory of many friendly literary discussions in the same room where they now stood of pleasant dinners at langmaids house in the west end when the two of them had often sat talking until late into the nights  i must seem very inhospitable said hodder ill light the lampits pleasanter than the electric light  the added illumination at first revealed the lawyer in his familiar aspect the broad shoulders the big reddish beard the domelike headthe generous person that seemed to radiate scholarly benignity peace and goodwill but almost instantly the rector became aware of a new and troubled puzzled glance from behind the round spectacles  i thought id drop in a moment on my way up town he began and the note of uncertainty in his voice too was new hodder drew towards the fire the big chair in which it had been langmaids wont to sit and perhaps it was the sight of this operation that loosed the lawyers tongue  confound it hodder he exclaimed i like youi always have liked you and youve got a hundred times the ability of the average clergyman why in the world did you have to go and make all this trouble  by so characteristic a remark hodder was both amused and moved it revealed so perfectly the point of view and predicament of the lawyer and it was also an expression of an affection which the rector cordially returned before answering he placed his visitor in the chair and the deliberation of the act was a revelation of the unconscious poise of the clergyman the spectacle of this selfcommand on the brink of such a crucial event as the vestry meeting had taken langmaid aback more than he cared to show he had lost the old sense of comradeship of easy equality and he had the odd feeling of dealing with a new man at once familiar and unfamiliar who had somehow lifted himself out of the everyday element in which they heretofore had met the clergyman had contrived to step out of his langmaids experience had actually set himwho all his life had known no difficulty in dealing with mento groping for a medium of communication  hodder sat down on the other side of the fireplace he too seemed to be striving for a common footing  it was a question of proclaiming the truth when at last i came to see it langmaid i could not help doing what i did matters of policy of a false consideration for individuals could not enter into it if this were not so i should gladly admit that you had a just grievance a peculiar right to demand why i had not remained the strictly orthodox person whom you induced to come here you had every reason to congratulate yourself that you were getting what you doubtless would call a safe man  ill admit i had a twinge of uneasiness after i came home langmaid confessed  hodder smiled at his frankness  but that disappeared  yes it disappeared you seemed to suit em so perfectly ill own up hodder that i was a little hurt that you did not come and talk to me just before you took the extraordinarybefore you changed your opinions  would it have done any good asked the rector gently would you have agreed with me any better than you do now i am perfectly willing if you wish to discuss with you any views of mine which you may not indorse and it would make me very happy i assure you if i could bring you to look upon the matter as i do  this was a poser and whether it were ingenuous or had in it an element of the scriptural wisdom of the serpent langmaid could not have said as a lawyer he admired it  i wasnt in church as usuali didnt hear the sermon he replied and i never could make head or tail of theologyi always told you that what i deplore hodder is that youve contrived to make a hornets nest out of the most peaceful and contented congregation in america couldnt you have managed to stick to religion instead of getting mixed up with socialism  so you have been given the idea that my sermon was socialistic the rector said  socialistic and hereticalit seems of course im not much of an authority on heresy but they claim that you went out of your way to knock some of their most cherished and sacred beliefs in the head  but suppose i have come to the honest conclusion that in the first place these socalled cherished beliefs have no foundation in fact and no influence on the lives of the persons who cherished them no real connection with christianity what would you have me do as a man continue to preach them for the sake of the lethargic peace of which you speak leave the church paralyzed as i found it  paralyzed youve got the most influential people in the city  hodder regarded him for a while without replying  so has the willesden club he said  langmaid laughed a little uncomfortably  if christianity as one of the ancient popes is said to have remarked were merely a profitable fable the rector continued there might be something in your contention that st johns as a church had reached the pinnacle of success but let us ignore the spiritual side of this matter as nonvital and consider it from the practical side we have the most influential people in the city but we have not their children that does not promise well for the future the children get more profit out of the country clubs and then there is another question is it going to continue to be profitable is it as profitable now as it was say twenty years ago  youve got out of my depth said nelson langmaid  ill try to explain as a man of affairs i think you will admit if you reflect that the return of st johns considering the large amount of money invested is scarcely worth considering and i am surprised that as astute a man as mr pair has not been able to see this long ago if we clear all the cobwebs away what is the real function of this church as at present constituted why this heavy expenditure to maintain religious services for a handful of people is it not when we come down to facts an increasingly futile effort to bring the influences of religionof superstition if you willto bear on the socalled lower classes in order that they may remain contented with their lot with that station and condition in the world whereit is arguedit has pleased god to call them if that were not so in my opinion there are very few of the privileged classes who would invest a dollar in the church and the proof of it is that the moment a clergyman raises his voice to proclaim the true message of christianity they are up in arms with the cry of socialism they have the sense to see that their privileges are immediately threatened  looking at it from the financial side it would be cheaper for them to close up their churches it is a mere waste of time and money because the influence on their less fortunate brethren in a worldly sense has dwindled to nothing few of the poor come near their churches in these days the profitable fable is almost played out  hodder had spoken without bitterness yet his irony was by no means lost on the lawyer langmaid if the truth be told found himself for the moment in the unusual predicament of being at a loss for the rector had put forward with more or less precision the very cynical view which he himself had been clever enough to evolve  havent they the right he asked somewhat lamely to demand the kind of religion they pay for  provided you dont call it religion said the rector  langmaid smiled in spite of himself  see here hodder he said ive always confessed frankly that i knew little or nothing about religion ive come here this evening as your friend without authority from anybody he added significantly to see if this thing couldnt somehow be adjusted peaceably for your sake as well as others come you must admit theres a grain of justice in the contention against you when i went on to bremerton to get you i had no real reason for supposing that these views would develop i made a contract with you in all good faith  and i with you answered the rector perhaps you do not realize langmaid what has been the chief factor in developing these views  the lawyer was silent from caution  i must be frank with you it was the discovery that mr parr and others of my chief parishioners were so far from being christians as to indulge while they supported the church of christ in operations like that of the consolidated tractions company wronging their fellowmen and condemning them to misery and hate and that you as a lawyer used your talents to make that operation possible  hold on cried langmaid now plainly agitated you have no rightyou can know nothing of that affair you do not understand business  im afraid replied the rector sadly that i understand one side of it only too well  the church has no right to meddle outside of her sphere to dictate to politics and business  her sphere said holder is the world if she does not change the world by sending out christians into it she would better close her doors  well i dont intend to quarrel with you holder i suppose it cant be helped that we look at these things differently and i dont intend to enter into a defence of business it would take too long and it wouldnt help any he got to his feet whatever happens it wont interfere with our personal friendship even if you think me a highwayman and i think you a  a fanatic holder supplied he had risen too and stood with a smile on his face gazing at the lawyer with an odd scrutiny  an idealist i was going to say langmaid answered returning the smile ill admit that we need them in the world its only when one of them gets in the gearbox  the rector laughed and thus they stood facing each other  langmaid holder asked dont you ever get tired and disgusted with the juggernaut car  the big lawyer continued to smile but a sheepish almost boyish expression came over his face he had not credited the clergyman with so much astuteness  business nowadays isbusiness holder the juggernaut car claims us all it has becomeif you will permit me to continue to put my similes into slangthe modern band wagon and we lawyers have to get on it or fall by the wayside  holder stared into the fire  i appreciate your motive in coming here he said at length and i do you the justice of believing it was friendly that the fact that you are in a way responsible for me toto the congregation of st johns did not enter into it i realize that i have made matters particularly awkward for you you have given them in me and in good faith something they didnt bargain for you havent said so but you want me to resign on the one hand you dont care to see me tilting at the windmills or better drawing down on my head the thunderbolts of your gods on the other hand you are just a little afraid for your gods if the question in dispute were merely an academic one id accommodate you at once but i cant ive thought it all out and i have made up my mind that it is my clear duty to remain here and if i am strong enough wrest this church from the grip of eldon parr and the men whom he controls  i am speaking plainly and i understand the situation thoroughly you will probably tell me as others have done that no one has ever opposed eldon parr who has not been crushed i go in with my eyes open i am willing to be crushed if necessary you have come here to warn me and i appreciate your motive now i am going to warn you in all sincerity and friendship i may be beaten i may be driven out but the victory will be mine nevertheless eldon parr and the men who stand with him in the struggle will never recover from the blow i shall give them i shall leave them crippled because i have the truth on my side and the truth is irresistible and they shall not be able to injure me permanently and you i regret deeply to say will be hurt too i beg you for no selfish reason to consider again the part you intend to play in this affair  such was the conviction such the unlookedfor fire with which the rector spoke that langmaid was visibly shaken and taken aback in spite of himself  do you mean he demanded when he had caught his breath that you intend to attack us publicly  is that the only punishment you can conceive of the rector asked the reproach in his voice was in itself a denial  i beg your pardon hodder said the lawyer quickly and i am sure you honestly believe what you say but  in your heart you too believe it langmaid the retribution has already begun nevertheless you will go onfor a while he held out his hand which langmaid took mechanically i bear you no illwill i am sorry that you cannot yet see with sufficient clearness to save yourself  langmaid turned and picked up his hat and stick and left the room without another word the bewildered wistful look which had replaced the ordinarily benign and cheerful expression haunted hodder long after the lawyer had gone it was the look of a man who has somehow lost his consciousness of power     chapter xxiv the vestry meets  at nine oclock that evening hodder stood alone in the arched vestry room and the sight of the heavy gothic chairs ranged about the long table brought up memories of comfortable genial meetings prolonged by chat and banter the noise of feet of subdued voices beside the coat room in the corridor aroused him all of the vestry would seem to have arrived at once  he regarded them with a detached curiosity as they entered reading them with a new insight the trace of offhandedness in mr plimptons former cordiality was not lost upon himan intimation that his star had set mr plimpton had seen many breaches healedhad healed many himself but he had never been known as a champion of lost causes  well here we are mr hodder on the stroke he remarked as a vestry i think were entitled to the first prize for promptness how about it everett  everett constable was silent  good evening mr hodder he said he did not offer to shake hands as mr plimpton had done but sat down at the far end of the table he looked tired and worn sick the rector thought and felt a sudden swelling of compassion for the pompous little man whose fibre was not as tough as that of these other condottieri as francis fergusons for instance although his soft hand and pink and white face framed in the black whiskers would seem to belie any fibre whatever  gordon atterbury hemmed and hawedah mr hodder and seated himself beside mr constable in a chair designed to accommodate a portly bishop both of them started nervously as asa waring holding his head high as a man should who has kept his birthright went directly to the rector  im glad to see you mr hodder he said and turning defiantly surveyed the room there was an awkward silence mr plimpton edged a little nearer the decree might have gone forth for mr hodders destruction but asa waring was a man whose displeasure was not to be lightly incurred  whats this i hear about your moving out of hamilton place mr waring youd better come up and take the spaulding lot in waverley across from us  i am an old man mr plimpton asa waring replied i do not move as easily as some other people in these days  everett constable produced his handkerchief and rubbed his nose violently but mr plimpton was apparently undaunted  i have always said he observed that there was something very fine in your sticking to that neighbourhood after your friends had gone heres phil  phil goodrich looked positively belligerent and as he took his stand on the other side of hodder his fatherinlaw smiled at him grimly mr goodrich took hold of the rectors arm  i missed one or two meetings last spring mr hodder he said but im going to be on hand after this my father i believe never missed a vestry meeting in his life perhaps that was because they used to hold most of em at his house  and serve port and cigars im told mr plimpton put in  that was an inducement wallis ill admit answered phil but there are even greater inducements now  in view of phil goodrichs wellknown liking for a fight this was too pointed to admit of a reply but mr plimpton was spared the attempt by the entrance of nelson langmaid the lawyer as he greeted them seemed to be preoccupied nor did he seek to relieve the tension with his customary joke a few moments of silence followed when eldon parr was seen to be standing in the doorway surveying them  good evening gentlemen he said coldly and without more ado went to his customary chair and sat down in it immediately followed a scraping of other chairs there was a dominating quality about the man not to be gainsaid  the rector called the meeting to order  during the routine business none of the little asides occurred which produce laughter every man in the room was aware of the intensity of eldon parrs animosity and yet he betrayed it neither by voice look or gesture there was something uncanny in this selfcontrol this sang froid with which he was wont to sit at boards waiting unmoved for the time when he should draw his net about his enemies and strangle them without pity it got on langmaids nerveshardened as he was to it he had seen many men in that net some had struggled some had taken their annihilation stoically honest merchants freebooters and brigands most of them had gone out with their families into that precarious borderland of existence in which the tomorrows are ever dreaded  yet here somehow was a different case langmaid found himself going back to the days when his mother had taken him to church and he could not bear to look at hodder since six oclock that afternoonhad his companions but known ithe had passed through one of the worst periods of his existence  after the regular business had been disposed of a brief interval was allowed for the sake of decency to ensue that eldon parr would not lead the charge in person was a foregone conclusion whom then would he put forward for obvious reasons not wallis plimpton or langmaid nor francis ferguson hodder found his glance unconsciously fixed upon everett constable who moved nervously and slowly pushed back his chair he was called upon in this hour and in the church his father had helped to found to make the supreme payment for the years of financial prosperity although a little man with his shoulders thrown back and his head high he generally looked impressive when he spoke and his fine features and clearcut english contributed to the effect but now his face was strained and his voice seemed to lack command as he bowed and mentioned the rectors name eldon parr sat back  gentlemen mr constable began i feel it my duty to say something this evening something that distresses me like some of you who are here present i have been on this vestry for many years and my father was on it before me i was brought up under dr gilman of whom i need not speak all here except our present rector knew him this church st johns has been a partalarge partof my life and anything that seems to touch its welfare touches me  when dr gilman died after so many years of faithful service we faced a grave problemthat of obtaining a young man of ability an active man who would be able to assume the responsibilities of a large and growing parish and at the same time carry on its traditions precious to us all one who believed in and preached i need scarcely add the accepted doctrines of the church which we have been taught to think are sacred and necessary to salvation and in the discovery of the reverend mr hodder we had reason to congratulate ourselves and the parish he was all that we had hoped for and more his sermons were at once a pleasure and an instruction  i wish to make it clear he continued that in spite of the pain mr hodders words of last sunday have given me i respect and honour him still and wish him every success but gentlemen i think it is plain to all of you that he has changed his religious convictions as to the causes through which that change has come about i do not pretend to know to say the least the transition is a startling one one for which some of us were totally unprepared to speak restrainedly it was a shocka shock which i shall remember as long as i live  i need not go into the doctrinal question here except to express my opinion that the fundamental facts of our religion were contradicted and we have also to consider the effect of this preaching on coming generations for whom we are responsible there are no doubt other fields for mr hodders usefulness but i think it may safely be taken as a principle that this parish has the right to demand from the pulpit that orthodox teaching which suits it and to which it has been accustomed and i venture further to give it as my opinionto put it mildly that others have been as disturbed and shocked as i i have seen many talked with many since sunday for these reasons with much sorrow and regret i venture to suggest to the vestry that mr hodder resign as our rector and i may add what i believe to be the feeling of all present that we have nothing but good will for him although we think we might have been informed of what he intended to do  and that in requesting him to resign we are acting for his own good as well as our own and are thus avoiding a situation which threatens to become impossibleone which would bring serious reflection on him and calamity on the church we already in certain articles in the newspapers have had an indication of the intolerable notoriety we may expect although i hold mr hodder innocent in regard to those articles i am sure he will have the good sense to see this situation as i see it as the majority of the parish see it  mr constable sat down breathing hard he had not looked at the rector during the whole of his speech nor at eldon parr there was a heavy silence and then philip goodrich rose square cleancut aggressive  i too gentlemen have had lifelong association with this church he began deliberately and for mr hodders sake i am going to give you a little of my personal history because i think it typical of thousands of men of my age all over this country it was nobodys fault perhaps that i was taught that the christian religion depended on a certain series of nature miracles and a chain of historical events and when i went east to school i had more of this same sort of instruction i have never perhaps been overburdened with intellect but the time arrived nevertheless when i began to think for myself some of the older boys went once i remember to the rector of the schoola dear old manand frankly stated our troubles to use a modern expression he stood pat on everything i do not say it was a consciously criminal act he probably saw no way out himself at any rate he made us all agnostics at one stroke  what i learned in college of science and history and philosophy merely confirmed me in my agnosticism as a complete system for the making of atheists and materialists i commend the education which i received if there is any man here who believes religion to be an essential factor in life i ask him to think of his children or grandchildren before he comes forward to the support of mr constable  in that sermon which he preached last sunday mr hodder for the first time in my life made christianity intelligible to me i want him to know it and there are other men and women in that congregation who feel as i do gentlemen there is nothing i would not give to have had christianity put before me in that simple and inspiring way when i was a boy and in my opinion st johns is more fortunate today than it ever has been in its existence mr hodder should have an unanimous testimonial of appreciation from this vestry for his courage and if the vote requesting him to resign prevails i venture to predict that there is not a man on this vestry who will not live to regret it  phil goodrich glared at eldon parr who remained unmoved  permit me to add he said that this controversy in other respects than doctrine is more befitting to the middle ages than to the twentieth century when this church and other denominations are passing resolutions in their national conventions with a view to unity and freedom of belief  mr langmaid mr plimpton and mr constable sat still mr ferguson made no move it was gordon atterbury who rushed into the breach and proved that the extremists are allies of doubtful value  he had apparently not been idle since sunday and was armed capa pie with timeworn arguments that need not be set down all of which went to show that mr goodrich had not referred to the middle ages in vain for gordon atterbury was a born schoolman but he finished by declaring at the end of twenty minutes much as he regretted the necessity of saying it that mr hodders continuance as rector would mean the ruin of the church in which all present took such a pride that the great majority of its members would never submit to what was so plainly heresy  it was then that mr plimpton gathered courage to pour oil on the waters there was nothing in his opinion he remarked smilingly in his function as peacemaker to warrant anything but the most friendly interchange of views he was second to none in his regard for mr hodder in his admiration for a man who had the courage of his convictions he had not the least doubt that mr hodder did not desire to remain in the parish when it was so apparent that the doctrines which he now preached were not acceptable to most of those who supported the church and he added with sublime magnanimity that he wished mr hodder the success which he was sure he deserved and gave him every assurance of his friendship  asa waring was about to rise when he perceived that hodder himself was on his feet and the eyes of every man save one were fixed on him irresistibly the rector seemed unaware of it it was philip goodrich who remarked to his fatherinlaw as they walked home afterwards of the sense he had had at that moment that there were just two men in the roomhodder and eldon parr all the rest were ciphers all had lost momentarily their feelings of partisanship and were conscious only of these two intense radiating opposing centres of force and no man oddly enough could say which was the stronger they seemingly met on equal terms there could not be the slightest doubt that the rector did not mean to yield and yet they might have been puzzled if they had asked themselves how they had read the fact in his face or manner for he betrayed neither anger nor impatience  no more did the financier reveal his own feelings he still sat back in his chair unmoved in apparent contemplation the posture was familiar to langmaid  would he destroy too this clergyman for the first time in his life and as he looked at hodder the lawyer wondered hodder did not defend himself made no apologies christianity was not a collection of doctrines he reminded thembut a mode of life if anything were clear to him it was that the present situation was not with the majority of them a matter of doctrines but of unwillingness to accept the message and precept of jesus christ and lead christian lives they had made use of the doctrines as a stalkinghorse  there was a stir at this and hodder paused a moment and glanced around the table but no one interrupted  he was fully aware of his rights and he had no intention of resigning to resign would be to abandon the work for which he was responsible not to them but to god and he was perfectly willingnay eager to defend his christianity before any ecclesiastical court should the bishop decide that a court was necessary the day of freedom of a truer vision was at hand the day of christian unity on the vital truths and no better proof of it could be brought forward than the change in him in his ignorance and blindness he had hitherto permitted compromise but he would no longer allow those who made only an outward pretence of being christians to direct the spiritual affairs of st johns to say what should and what should not be preached this was to continue to paralyze the usefulness of the church to set at naught her mission to alienate those who most had need of her who hungered and thirsted after righteousness and went away unsatisfied  he had hardly resumed his seat when everett constable got up again he remarked somewhat unsteadily that to prolong the controversy would be useless and painful to all concerned and he infinitely regretted the necessity of putting his suggestion that the rector resign in the form of a resolution the vote was taken six men raised their hands in favour of his resignationnelson langmaid among them two asa waring and philip goodrich were against it after announcing the result hodder rose  for the reason i have stated gentlemen i decline to resign he said i stand upon my canonical rights  francis ferguson arose his voice actually trembling with anger there is something uncanny in the passion of a man whose life has been ordered by the inexorable rules of commerce who has been wont to decide all questions from the standpoint of dollars and cents if one of his own wax models had suddenly become animated the effect could not have been more startling  in the course of this discussion he declared mr hodder had seen fit to make grave and in his opinion unwarranted charges concerning the lives of some if not all of the gentlemen who sat here it surprised him that these remarks had not been resented but he praised a christian forbearance on the part of his colleagues which he was unable to achieve he had no doubt that their object had been to spare mr hodders feelings as much as possible but mr hodder had shown no disposition to spare their own he had outraged them mr ferguson thoughtwantonly so he had made these preposterous and unchristian charges an excuse for his determination to remain in a position where his usefulness had ceased  no one unfortunately was perfect in this lifenot even mr hodder he francis ferguson was far from claiming to be so but he believed that this arraignment of the men who stood highest in the city for decency law and order who supported the church who revered its doctrines who tried to live christian lives who gave their time and their money freely to it and to charities that this arraignment was an arrogant accusation and affront to be repudiated he demanded that mr hodder be definite if he had any charges to make let him make them here and now  the consternation the horror which succeeded such a stupid and unexpected tactical blunder on the part of the usually astute mr ferguson were felt rather than visually discerned the atmosphere might have been described as panicky asa waring and phil goodrich smiled as wallis plimpton after a moments hush scrambled to his feet his face pale his customary easiness and nonchalance now the result of an obvious effort he too tried to smile but swallowed instead as he remembered his property in dalton street nelson langmaid smiled in spite of himself mr plimpton implored his fellowmembers not to bring personalities into the debate and he was aware all the while of the curious pitying expression of the rector he breathed a sigh of relief at the opening words of hodder who followed him  gentlemen he said i have no intention of being personal even by unanimous consent but if mr ferguson will come to me after this meeting i shall have not the least objection to discussing this matter with him in so far as he himself is concerned i can only assure you now that i have not spoken without warrant  there was oddly enough no acceptance of this offer by mr ferguson another silence ensued broken at last by a voice for which they had all been unconsciously waiting a voice which though unemotional cold and matteroffact was nevertheless commanding and long accustomed to speak with an overwhelming authority eldon parr did not rise  mr hodder he said in one respect seems to be under the delusion that we are still in the middle ages instead of the twentieth century since he assumes the right to meddle with the lives of his parishioners to be the sole judge of their actions that assumption will not be tolerated by free men i for one gentlemen do not propose to have a socialist for the rector of the church which i attend and support and i maintain the privilege of an american citizen to set my own standards within the law and to be the sole arbitrar of those standards  good muttered gordon atterbury langmaid moved uncomfortably  i shall not waste words the financier continued there is in my mind no question that we are justified in demanding from our rector the christian doctrines to which we have given our assent and which are stated in the creeds that they shall be subject to the whims of the rector is beyond argument i do not pretend to understand either gentlemen the nature of the extraordinary change that has taken place in the rector of st johns i am not well versed m psychology i am incapable of flights myself one effect of this change is an attitude on which reasonable considerations would seem to have no effect  our resources fortunately are not yet at an end it has been my hope on account of my former friendship with mr hodder that an ecclesiastical trial might not be necessary it now seems inevitable in the meantime since mr hodder has seen fit to remain in spite of our protest i do not intend to enter this church i was prepared gentlemen as some of you no doubt know to spend a considerable sum in adding to the beauty of st johns and to the charitable activities of the parish mr hodder has not disapproved of my gifts in the past but owing to his present scruples concerning my worthiness i naturally hesitate to press the matter now mr parr indulged in the semblance of a smile i fear that he must take the responsibility of delaying this benefit with the other responsibilities he has assumed  his voice changed it became sharper  in short i propose to withhold all contributions for whatever purpose from this church while mr hodder is rector and i advise those of you who have voted for his resignation to do the same in the meantime i shall give my money to calvary and attend its services and i shall offer further a resolutionwhich i am informed is within our rightto discontinue mr hodders salary  there was that in the unparalleled audacity of eldon parr that compelled hodders unwilling admiration he sat gazing at the financier during this speech speculating curiously on the inner consciousness of the man who could utter it was it possible that he had no sense of guilt even so he had shown a remarkable astuteness in relying on the conviction that he hodder would not betray what he knew  he was suddenly aware that asa waring was standing beside him  gentlemen said mr waring i have listened to this discussion as long as i can bear it with patience had i been told of it i should have thought it incredible that the methods of the money changers should be applied to the direction and control of the house of god in my opinion there is but one word which is suitable for what has passed here tonight and the word is persecution perhaps i have lived too long i have lived to see honourable upright men deprived of what was rightfully theirs driven from their livelihood by the rapacity of those who strive to concentrate the wealth and power of the nation into their hands i have seen this power gathering strength stretching its arm little by little over the institutions i fought to preserve and which i cherish over our politics over our government yes and even over our courts i have seen it poisoning the business honour in which we formerly took such a pride i have seen it reestablishing a slavery more pernicious than that which millions died to efface i have seen it compel a subservience which makes me ashamed as an american to witness  his glance a withering moral scorn darted from under the grizzled eyebrows and alighted on one man after another and none met it everett constable coughed wallis plimpton shifted his position the others sat like stones asa waring was giving vent at last to the pentup feelings of many years  and now that power which respects nothing has crept into the sanctuary of the church our rector recognizes it i recognize itthere is not a man here who in his heart misunderstands me and when a man is found who has the courage to stand up against it i honour him with all my soul and a hope that was almost dead revives in me for there is one force and one force alone able to overcome the power of which i speakthe spirit of christ and the mission of the church is to disseminate that spirit the church is the champion on which we have to rely or give up all hope of victory the church must train the recruits and if the church herself is betrayed into the hands of the enemy the battle is lost  if mr hodder is forced out of this church it would be better to lock the doors st johns will be held up and rightfully to the scorn of the city all the money in the world will not save her though crippled she has survived one disgrace when she would not give free shelter to the man who above all others expressed her true spirit when she drove horace bentley from her doors after he had been deprived of the fortune which he was spending for his fellowmen she will not survive another  i have no doubt mr parrs motion to take from mr hodder his living will go through and still i urge him not to resign i am not a rich man even when such property as i have is compared to moderate fortunes of these days but i would pay his salary willingly out of my own pocket rather than see him go  i call the attention of the chairman said eldon parr after a certain interval in which no one had ventured to speak to the motion before the vestry relating to the discontinuance of mr hodders salary  it was then that the unexpected happened gordon atterbury redeemed himself his respect for mr waring he said made him hesitate to take issue with him  he could speak for himself and for a number of people in the congregation when he reiterated his opinion that they were honestly shocked at what mr hodder had preached and that this was his sole motive in requesting mr hodder to resign he thought under the circumstances that this was a matter which might safely be left with the bishop he would not vote to deprive mr hodder of his salary  the motion was carried by a vote of five to three for eldon parr well knew that his will needed no reenforcement by argument and this much was to be said for him that after he had entered a battle he never hesitated never under any circumstances reconsidered the probable effect of his course  as for the others those who had supported him they were cast in a less heroic mould even francis ferguson as between the devil and the deep sea he was compelled with as good a grace as possible to choose the devil he was utterly unable to contemplate the disaster which might ensue if certain financial ties which were thicker than cables were snapped but his affection for the devil was not increased by thus being led into a charge from which he would willingly have drawn back asa waring might mean nothing to eldon parr but he meant a great deal to francis ferguson who had by no means forgotten his sensations of satisfaction when mrs waring had made her first call in park street on francis fergusons wife he left the room in such a state of absentmindedness as actually to pass mr parr in the corridor without speaking to him  the case of wallis plimpton was even worse he had married the gores but he had sought to bind himself with hoops of steel to the warings he had always secretly admired that old roman quality which the goodrichestheir connectionsshared of holding fast to their course unmindful and rather scornful of influence which swayed their neighbours the clan was sufficient unto itself satisfied with a moderate prosperity and a continually increasing number of descendants the name was unstained such are the strange incongruities in the hearts of men that few realized the extent to which wallis plimpton had partaken of the general heroworship of phil goodrich he had assiduously cultivated his regard at times discreetly boasted of it and yet had never been sure of it and now fate in the form of his master eldon parr had ironically compelled him at one stroke to undo the work of years as soon as the meeting broke up he crossed the room  i cant tell you how much i regret this phil he said charlotte has very strong convictions you know and so have i you can understand i am sure how certain articles of belief might be necessary to one person and not to another  yes said phil i can understand we neednt mention the articles wallis and he turned his back  he never knew the pain he inflicted wallis plimpton looked at the rector who stood talking to mr waring and for the first time in his life recoiled from an overture  something in the faces of both men warned him away  even everett constable as they went home in the cars together was brief with him and passed no comments when mr plimpton recovered sufficiently to elaborate on the justification of their act and upon the extraordinary stand taken by phil goodrich and mr waring  they might have told us what they were going to do  everett constable eyed him  would it have made any difference plimpton he demanded  after that they rode in silence until they came to a certain west end corner where they both descended little mr constables sensations were if anything less enviable and he had not mr plimptons recuperative powers he had sold that night for a mess of pottage the friendship and respect of three generations and he had fought for pay against his own people  and lastly there was langmaid whose feelings almost defy analysis he chose to walk through the still night the four milesthat separated him from his home and he went back over the years of his life until he found in the rubbish of the past a forgotten and tarnished jewel the discovery pained him for that jewel was the ideal he had carried away as a youth from the old law school at the bottom of hamilton placea gift from no less a man than the great lawyer and publicspirited citizen judge henry goodrichphilip goodrichs grandfather whose seated statue marked the entrance of the library he nelson langmaidhad gone forth from that school resolved to follow in the footsteps of that manbut somehow he missed the path somehow the jewel had lost its fire there had come a tempting offer and a strugglejust one a readjustment on the plea that the world had changed since the days of judge goodrich whose uncompromising figure had begun to fade an exciting discovery that he nelson langmaid possessed the gift of drawing up agreements which had the faculty of passing magically through the meshes of the statutes affluence had followed and fame and even that high office which the judge himself had held the presidency of the state bar association in all that time one remark which he had tried to forget had cut him to the quick bedloe hubbell had said on the political platform that langmaid got one hundred thousand dollars a year for keeping eldon parr out of jail  once he stopped in the street his mind suddenly going back to the action of the financier at the vestry meeting  confound him he said aloud he has been a fool for once i told him not to do it  he stood at last in the ample vestibule of his house singling out his latchkey when suddenly the door opened and his daughter helen appeared  oh dad she cried why are you solate ive been watching for you i know youve let mr hodder stay  she gazed at him with widened eyes  dont tell me that youve made him resign i canti wont believe it  he isnt going to resign helen langmaid replied in an odd voice  hehe refused to     chapter xxv rise crowned with light   i  the church of st johns after a peaceful existence of so many years had suddenly become the stage on which rapid and bewildering dramas were played the stormcentre of chaotic forces hitherto unperceived drawn from the atmosphere around her for there had been more publicity more advertising the rector of st johns will not talksuch had been one headline neither would the vestry talk and yet despite all this secrecy the whole story of the suspension of hodders salary was in print and an editorial which was sent to him from a popular and sensational journal on tainted money in which hodder was held up to the public as a martyr because he refused any longer to accept for the church illgotten gains from consolidated tractions and the like  this had opened again the floodgates of the mails and it seemed as though every person who had a real or fancied grievance against eldon parr had written him nor did others of his congregation escape the press of visitors at the parish house suddenly increased once more men and women came to pour into his ears an appalling aeries of confessions wrongs which like garvins had engendered bitter hatreds woes temptations bewilderments hodder strove to keep his feet sought wisdom to deal patiently with all though at times he was tried to the uttermost and he held steadfastly before his mind the great thing that they did come it was what he had longed for prayed for despaired of he was no longer crying in the empty wilderness but at last in touchin natural touch with life with life in all its sorrow its crudity and horror he had contrived by the grace of god to make the connection for his church  that church might have been likened to a ship sailing out of the snug harbour in which she had lain so long to range herself gallantly beside those whom she had formerly beheld with complacent cowardice fighting her fight young men and women enlisted under other banners than her own doing their part in the battle of the twentieth century for humanity her rector was her captain it was he who had cut her cables quelled for a time at least her mutineers and sought to hearten those of her little crew who wavered who shrank back appalled as they realized something of the immensity of the conflict in which her destiny was to be wrought out  to carry on the figure philip goodrich might have been deemed her first officer he at least was not appalled but grimly conscious of the greatness of the task to which they had set their hands the sudden transformation of conservative st johns was no more amazing than that of the son of a family which had never been without influence in the community but that influence had always been conservative and phil goodrich had hitherto taken but a listless interest in the church of his fathers fortune had smiled upon him trusts had come to him unsought he had inherited the family talent for the law the freedom to practise when and where he chose his love of active sport had led him into many vacations when he tramped through marsh and thicket after game and at five and forty there was not an ounce of superfluous flesh on his hard body in spite of his plain speaking an overwhelming popularity at college had followed him to his native place and no organization sporting or serious was formed in the city that the question was not asked what does goodrich think about it  his wholesouled enlistment in the cause of what was regarded as radical religion became therefore the subject of amazed comment in the many clubs he now neglected the squabble in st johns as it was generally referred to had been aired in the press but such was the magic in a name made without conscious effort that phil goodrichs participation in the struggle had a palpably disarming effect and there were not a few men who commonly spent their sunday mornings behind plateglass windows surrounded by newspapers as well as some in the athletic club whose contests mr goodrich sometimes refereed who went to st johns out of curiosity and who waited afterwards for an interview with phil or the rector the remark of one of these was typical of others he had never taken much stock in religion but if goodrich went in for it he thought hed go and look it over  scarcely a day passed that phil did not drop in at the parish house and he set himself with all the vigour of an unsquandered manhood to help hodder to solve the multitude of new problems by which they were beset  a free church was a magnificent ideal but how was it to be carried on without an eldon parr a ferguson a constable a mrs larrabbee or a gore who would make up the deficit at the end of the year could weekly contributions on the envelope system be relied upon provided the people continued to come and fill the pews of absent and outraged parishioners the music was the most expensive in the city although mr taylor the organist had come to the rector and offered to cut his salary in half and to leave that in abeyance until the finances could be adjusted and his example had been followed by some of the highpaid men in the choir others had offered to sing without pay and there were the expenses of the parish house an alarming sum now eldon parr had withdrawn the salaries of the assistants hodder who had saved a certain sum in past years would take nothing for the present asa waring and phil goodrich borrowed on their own responsibility    ii  something of the overwhelming nature of the forces hodder had summoned was visibly apparent on that first sunday after what many had called his apostasy instead of the orderly sprucelydressed groups of people which were wont to linger in greetings before the doors of st johns a motley crowd thronged the pavement and streamed into the church pressing up the aisles and invading the sacred precincts where decorous parishioners had for so many years knelt in comfort and seclusion the familiar figure of gordon atterbury was nowhere to be seen and the atterbury pew was occupied by shopgirls in gaudy hats eldon parrs pew was filled everett constables wallis plimptons and the ushers who had hastily been mustered were awestricken and powerless such a resistless invasion by the hordes of the unknown might well have struck with terror some of those who hitherto had had the courage to standup loyally in the rectors support it had a distinct flavour of revolution contained for some a grim suggestion of a time when that vague irresponsible and restless monster the mob would rise in its might and brutally and inexorably take possession of all property  alison had met eleanor goodrich in burton street and as the two made their way into the crowded vestibule they encountered martha preston whose husband was alisons cousin in the act of flight  youre not going in she exclaimed  of course we are  mrs preston stared at alison in amazement  i didnt know you were still here she said irrelevantly im pretty liberal my dear as you knowbut this is more than i can stand look at them she drew up her skirts as a woman brushed against her i believe in the poor coming to church and all that but this is mere vulgar curiosity the result of all that odious advertising in the newspapers my pew is filled with them if i had stayed i should have fainted i dont know what to think of mr hodder  mr hodder is not to blame for the newspapers replied alison warmly she glanced around her at the people pushing past her eyes shining her colour high and there was the ring of passion in her voice which had do martha preston a peculiarly disquieting effect i think its splendid that they are here at all i dont care what brought them  mrs preston stared again she was a pretty intelligent woman at whose dinner table one was sure to hear the discussion of some modern problem she believed herself to be a socialist her eyes sought eleanor goodrichs who stood by alight with excitement  but surely you eleanoryoure not going in youll never be able to stand it even if you find a seat the few people we know whove come are leaving i just saw the allan pendletons  have you seen phil eleanor asked  oh yes hes in there and even hes helpless and as i came out poor mr bradley was jammed up against the wall he seemed perfectly stunned  at this moment they were thrust apart eleanor quivered as she was carried through the swinging doors into the church  i think youre right she whispered to alison it is splendid theres something about it that takes hold of me that carries one away it makes me wonder how it can be guidedwhat will come of it  they caught sight of phil pushing his way towards them and his face bore the set look of belligerency which eleanor knew so well but he returned her smile alisons heart warmed towards him  what do you think of this he demanded most of our respectable friends who dared to come have left in a towering rageto institute lawsuits probably at tiny rate strangers are not being made to wait until ten minutes after the service begins thats one barbarous custom abolished  strangers seem to have taken matters in their own hands for once eleanor smiled weve made up our minds to stay phil even if we have to stand  thats the right spirit declared her husband glancing at alison who had remained silent with approval and by no means a concealed surprise i think i know of a place where i can squeeze you in near professor bridges and sally on the side aisle  are george and sally here eleanor exclaimed  hodder said phil is converting the heathen you couldnt have kept george away and it was george who made sally stay  presently they found themselves established between a rawboned young workingman who smelled strongly of soap whose hair was plastered tightly against his forehead and a young woman who leaned against the wall the black in which she was dressed enhanced the whiteness and weariness of her face and she sat gazing ahead of her apparently unconscious of those who surrounded her her hands tightly folded in her lap in their immediate vicinity indeed might have been found all the variety of type seen in the ordinary street car and in truth there were some who seemed scarcely to realize they were not in a public vehicle an elaborately dressed female in front of them whose expansive hat brushed her neighbours made audible comments to a stout man with a red neck which was set in a crease above his low collar  they tell me eldon parrs pew has a gold plate on it i wish i knew which it was it aint this one anyway ill bet  say they march in in this kind of a church dont they some one said behind them  eleanor with her lips tightly pressed opened her prayer book alisons lips were slightly parted as she gazed about her across the aisle her experience of the sunday before deep and tense as it had been seemed as nothing compared to this the presence of all these people stimulated her inexpressibly fired her and she felt the blood pulsing through her body as she contrasted this gathering with the dignified scattered congregation she had known she scarcely recognized the church itself  she speculated on the homes from which these had come and the motives which had brought them  for a second the perfume of the woman in front mingling with other less definable odours almost sickened her evoking suggestions of tawdry trivial vulgar lives fed on sensation and excitement but the feeling was almost immediately swept away by a renewed sense of the bigness of the thing which she beheldof which indeed she was a part and her thoughts turned more definitely to the man who had brought it all about could he control it subdue it here was opportunity suddenly upon him like a huge curving ponderous wave could he ride it or would it crush him remorselessly  sensitive alert quickened as she was she began to be aware of other values of the intense spiritual hunger in the eyes of the woman in black the yearning of barren hopeless existences and here and there alisons look fell upon more prosperous individuals whose expressions proclaimed incredulity a certain cynical amusement at the spectacle others seemed uneasy as having got more than they had bargained for deliberating whether to flee and then just as her suspense was becoming almost unbearable the service began  how it had been accomplished the thing she later felt was beyond the range of intellectual analysis nor could she have told how much later since the passage of time had gone unnoticed curiosities doubts passions longings antagonismsall these seemedas the most natural thing in the worldto have been fused into one common but ineffable emotion such at least was the impression to which alison startlingly awoke all the while she had been conscious of hodder from the moment she had heard his voice in the chancel but somehow this consciousness of him had melted imperceptibly into that of the great congregation once divided against itself which had now achieved unity of soul  the mystery as to how this had been effected was the more elusive when she considered the absence of all methods which might have been deemed revivalistic few of those around her evinced a familiarity with the historic service and then occurred to her his explanation of personality as the medium by which all truth is revealed by which the current of religion the motive power in all history is transmitted surely this was the explanation if it might be called one that tingling sense of a pervading spirit which was hisand yet not his he was the incandescent medium and yet paradoxically gained in identity and individuality and was inseparable from the thing itself  she could not see him a pillar hid the chancel from her view  the service to which she had objected as archaic became subordinate spiritualized dominated by the personality hodder had departed from the usual custom by giving out the page of the psalter and the verses the throbbing responses which arose from every corner of the church assumed a new significance the vision of the ancient seer revived one verse he read resounded with prophecy  thou shalt deliver me from the strivings of the people and thou shalt make me the head of the heathen  and the reply  a people whom i have not known shall serve me  the workingman next to alison had no prayerbook she thrust her own into his hand and they read from it together  when they came to the second hymn the woman in front of her had wonderfully shed her vulgarity her voicea really good onepoured itself out         see a long race thy spacious courts adorn         see future sons and daughters yet unborn         in crowding ranks on every side arise         demanding life impatient for the skies  once alison would have been critical of the words she was beyond that now what did it matter if the essential thing were present  the sermon was a surprise and those who had come for excitement for the sensation of hearing a denunciation of a class they envied and therefore hated and nevertheless strove to imitate were themselves rebuked were not their standards the same and if the standard were false it followed inevitably that the life was false also  hodder fairly startled these out of their preconceived notions of christianity let them shake out of their minds everything they had thought it to mean churchgoing acceptance of creed and dogma contributive charity withdrawal from the world rites and ceremonies it was none of these  the motive in the world today was the acquisition of property the motive of christianity was absolutely and uncompromisingly opposed to this shock their practical sense as it might christianity looked forward with steadfast faith to a time when the incentive to amass property would be done away with since it was a source of evil and a curse to mankind if they would be christians let them face that let them enter into life into the struggles going on around them today against greed corruption slavery poverty vice and crime let them protest let them fight even as jesus christ had fought and protested for as sure as they sat there the day would come when they would be called to account would be asked the questionwhat had they done to make the united states of america a better place to live in  there were in the apostolic writings and tradition misinterpretations of life which had done much harm early christianity had kept its eyes fixed on another world and had ignored this had overlooked the fact that every man and woman was put here to do a particular work in the first epistle of peter the advice was given submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lords sake but christ had preached democracy responsibility had foreseen a millennium the fulfilment of his kingdom when all men inspired by the spirit would make and keep in spirit the ordinances of god  before they could do gods work and mans work they must first be awakened filled with desire desire was power and he prayed that some of them on this day would receive that desire that power which nothing could resist the desire which would lead each and every one to the gates of the inner world which was limitless and eternal filled with dazzling light  let them have faith then not credulity in a vague god they could not imagine but faith in the spirit of the universe humanity in jesus christ who had been the complete human revelation of that spirit who had suffered and died that man might not live in ignorance of it to doubt humanitysuch was the great refusal the sin against the holy ghost the repudiation of the only true god  after a pause he spoke simply of his hope for st johns if he remained here his ambition was that it would be the free temple of humanity of jesus christ supported not by a few but by alleach in accordance with his means of those who could afford nothing nothing would be required perhaps this did not sound practical nor would it be so if the transforming inspiration failed he could only trust and try hold up to them the vision of the church as a community of willing workers for the kingdom    iii  after the service was over the people lingered in the church standing in the pews and aisles as though loath to leave the woman with the perfume and the elaborate hat was heard to utter a succinct remark  say charlie i guess hes all right i never had it put like that  the thicknecked mans reply was inaudible  eleanor goodrich was silent and a little pale as she pressed close to alison her imagination had been stretched as it were and she was still held in awe by the vastness of what she had heard and seen vaster even than everso it appeared nowdemanding greater sacrifices than she had dreamed of she looked back upon the old as at receding shores  alison with absorbed fascination watched the people encountered here and there recognitions from men and women with whom she had once danced and dined in what now seemed a previous existence why had they come and how had they received the message she ran into a little man a dealer in artists supplies who once had sold her paints and brushes who stared and bowed uncertainly she surprised him by taking his hand  did you like it she asked impulsively  its what ive been thinking for years miss parr he responded thinking and feeling but i never knew it was christianity and i never thought he stopped and looked at her alarmed  oh she said i believe in it tooor try to  she left him mentally gasping without on the sidewalk eleanor goodrich was engaged in conversation with a stockily built man inclined to stoutness he had a brown face and a clipped bristly mustache alison paused involuntarily and saw him start and hesitate as his clear direct gaze met her own  bedloe hubbell was one of those who had once sought to marry her she recalled him as an amiable and aimless boy and after she had gone east she had received with incredulity and then with amusement the news of his venture into altruistic politics it was his efficiency she had doubted not his sincerity later tidings contemptuous and eventually irritable utterances of her own father together with accounts in the new york newspapers of his campaign had convinced her in spite of herself that bedloe hubbell had actually shaken the seats of power and somehow as she now took him in he looked it  his transformation was one of the signs one of the mysteries of the times the ridicule and abuse of the press the opposition and enmity of his childhood friends had developed the man of force she now beheld and who came forward to greet her  alison he exclaimed he had changed in one sense and not in another her colour deepened as the sound of his voice brought back the lapsed memories of the old intimacy for she had been kind to him kinder than to any other and the news of his marriageto a woman from the pacific coasthad actually induced in her certain longings and regrets when the cards had reached her new york and the excitement of the life into which she had been weakly if somewhat unwittingly drawn had already begun to pall  im so glad to see you she told him ive heardso many things and im very much in sympathy with what youre doing  they crossed the street and walked away from the church together she had surprised him and made him uncomfortable  youve been away so long he managed to say perhaps you do not realize  oh yes i do she interrupted i am on the other side on your side i thought of writing you when you nearly won last autumn  you see it too he exclaimed  yes ive changed too not so much as you she added shyly i always had a certain sympathy you know with the robin hoods  he laughed at her designation both pleased and taken aback by her praise but he wondered if she knew the extent of his criticism of her father  that rector is a wonderful man he broke out irrelevantly i cant get over himi cant quite grasp the fact that he exists that he has dared to do what he has done  this brought her colour back but she faced him bravely you think he is wonderful then  dont you he demanded  she assented but i am curious to know why you do somehow i never thought ofyou  as religious he supplied and you if i remember rightly  yes she interrupted i revolted too but mr hodder puts it soit makes one wonder  he has not only made me wonder declared bedloe hubbell emphatically i never knew what religion was until i heard this man last sunday  last sunday  until then i hadnt been inside of a church for fifteen yearsexcept to get married my wife takes the children occasionally to a presbyterian church near us  and why did you go then she asked  i am a little ashamed of my motive he confessed there were rumoursi dont pretend to know how they got about he hesitated once more aware of delicate ground wallis plimpton said something to a man who told me i believe i went out of sheer curiosity to hear what hodder would have to say and then i had been reading wondering whether there were anything in christianity after all  yes she said careless now as to what cause he might attribute her eagerness and he gave you something  it was then she grasped the truth that this sudden renewed intimacy was the result of the impression hodder had left upon the minds of both  he gave me everything bedloe hubbell replied i am willing to acknowledge it freely in his explanation of the parable of the prodigal son he gave me the clew to our modern times what was for me an inextricable puzzle has become clear as day he has made me understand at last the force which stirred me which goaded me until i was fairly compelled to embark in the movement which the majority of our citizens still continue to regard as quixotic i did not identify that force with religion then and when i looked back on the first crazy campaign we embarked upon with the whole city laughing at me and at the obscure and impractical personnel we had there were moments when it seemed incomprehensible folly i had nothing to gain and everything to lose by such a venture i was lazy and easygoing as you know i belonged to the privileged class i had sufficient money to live in comparative luxury all my days i had no grudge against these men whom i had known all my life  but it must have had some beginning said alison  i was urged to run for the city council by these very men bedloe hubbell smiled at the recollection they accuse me now of having indulged once in the same practice for which i am condemning them our company did accept rebates and we sought favours from the city government i have confessed it freely on the platform even during my first few months in the council what may be called the old political practices seemed natural to me but gradually the iniquity of it all began to dawn on me and then i couldnt rest until i had done something towards stopping it  at length i began to see he continued that education of the masses was to be our only preserver that we should have to sink or swim by that i began to see dimly that this was true for other movements going on today now comes hodder with what i sincerely believe is the key he compels men like me to recognize that our movements are not merely moral but religious religion as yet unidentified is the force behind these portentous stirrings of politics in our country from sea to sea he aims not to bring the church into politics but to make her the feeder of these movements men join them today from all motives but the religious is the only one to which they may safely be trusted he has rescued the jewel from the dustheap of tradition and holds it up shining before our eyes  alison looked at her companion  that she said is a very beautiful phrase  bedloe hubbell smiled queerly  i dont know why im telling you all this i cant usually talk about it but the sight of that congregation this morning mixed as it was and the way he managed to weld it together  ah you noticed that she exclaimed sharply  noticed it  i know it was a question of feeling it  there was a silence  will he succeed she asked presently  ah said bedloe hubbell how is it possible to predict it the forces against him are tremendous and it is usually the pioneer who suffers i agree absolutely with his definition of faith i have it and the work he has done already can never be undone the time is ripe and it is something that he has men like phil goodrich behind him and mr waring im going to enlist and from now on i intend to get every man and woman upon whom i have any influence whatever to go to that church a little later alison marvelling left him     chapter xxvi the current of life   i  the year when hodder had gone eastto bremerton and bar harbor he had read in the train a magazine article which had set fire to his imagination it had to do with the lives of the men the engineers who dared to deal with the wild and terrible power of the western hills who harnessed and conquered roaring rivers and sent the power hundreds of miles over the wilderness by flimsy wires to turn the wheels of industry and light the dark places of the cities and like all men who came into touch with elemental mysteries they had their moments of pure ecstasy gaining a tingling intenser life from the contact with dynamic things and other moments when in their struggle for mastery they were buffeted about scorched and almost overwhelmed  in these days the remembrance of that article came back to hodder it was as though he too were seeking to deflect and guide a forcethe force of forces he too was buffeted scorched and bruised at periods scarce given time to recover himself in the onward rush he himself had started and which he sought to control problems arose which demanded the quick thinking of emergency he too had his moments of reward the reward of the man who is in touch with reality  he lived from day to day in a bewildering succession of encouragements and trials all unprecedented if he remained at st johns an entire new organization would be necessary he did not as yet see it clearly and in the meantime with his vestry alienated awaiting the bishops decision he could make no definite plans even if he had had the leisure wholesale desertions had occurred in the guilds and societies the activities of which had almost ceased little tomkinson the second assistant had resigned and mccrae who worked harder than ever before was already marked hodder knew for dismissal if he himself were defeated  and then there was the ever present question of money it remained to be seen whether a system of voluntary offerings were practicable for hodder had made some inquiries into the socalled free churches only to discover that there were benefactors behind them benefactors the christianity of whose lives was often doubtful  one morning he received in the mail the longexpected note from the bishop making an appointment for the next day hodder as he read it over again smiled to himself he could gather nothing of the mind of the writer from the contents  the piece of news which came to him on the same morning swept completely the contemplations of the approaching interview from his mind sally grover stopped in at the parish house on her way to business  kate marcys gone she announced in her abrupt fashion  gone he exclaimed and stared at her in dismay gone where  thats just it said miss grover i wish i knew i reckon wed got into the habit of trusting her too much but it seemed the only way she wasnt in her room last night but ella finley didnt find it out until this morning and she ran over scared to death to tell us about it  involuntarily the rector reached for his hat  ive sent out word among our friends in dalton street sally continued an earthquake could not have disturbed her outer matteroffact calmness but hodder was not deceived he knew that she was as profoundly grieved and discouraged as himself and ive got old gratz the cabinetmaker on the job if shes in dalton street hell find her  but what hodder began  sally threw up her hands  you never can tell with that kind but it sticks in my mind shes done something foolish  foolish  sally twitched nervously  somehow i dont think its a spreebut as i say you cant tell shes full of impulses you remember how she frightened us once before when she went off and stayed all night with the woman she used to know in the flat house when she heard she was sick  hodder nodded  youve inquired there  that woman went to the hospital you know she may be with another one if she is gratz ought to find her you know there was a time mr hodder when i didnt have much hope that wed pull her through but we got hold of her through her feelings shed do anything for mr bentleyshed do anything for you and the way she stuck to that embroidery was fine i dont say she was cured but whenever shed feel one of those fits coming on shed let us know about it and wed watch her and i never saw one of that kind change so why she must be almost as good looking now as she ever was  you dont think she has done anythingdesperate asked hodder slowly  sally comprehended  wellsomehow i dont she used to say if she ever got drunk again shed never come back but she didnt have any moneyshes given mr bentley every cent of it and we didnt have any warning she was as cheerful as could be yesterday morning mrs mcquillen says  it might not do any harm to notify the police replied hodder rising ill go around to headquarters now  he was glad of the excuse for action he could not have sat still and as he walked rapidly across burton street he realized with a pang how much his heart had been set on kate marcys redemption in spite of the fact that every moment of his time during the past fortnight had been absorbed by the cares responsibilities and trials thrust upon him he reproached himself for not having gone oftener to dalton street and yet if mr bentley and sally grower had been unable to foresee and prevent this what could he have done  at police headquarters he got no news the chief received him deferentially sympathetically took down kate marcys description went so far as to remark sagely that too much mustnt be expected of these women and said he would notify the rector if she were found the chief knew and admired mr bentley and declared he was glad to meet mr hodder hodder left too preoccupied to draw any significance from the nature of his welcome he went at once to mr bentleys  the old gentleman was inclined to be hopeful to take sally growers view of the matter he trusted he said sallys instinct and hodder came away less uneasy not a little comforted by a communion which never failed to fortify him to make him marvel at the calmness of that world in which his friend lived a calmness from which no vicarious sorrow was excluded and before hodder left mr bentley had drawn from him some account of the more recent complexities at the church the very pressure of his hand seemed to impart courage  you wont stay and have dinner with me  the rector regretfully declined  i hear the bishop has returned said mr bentley smiling  hodder was surprised he had never heard mr bentley speak of the bishop of course he must know him  i have my talk with him tomorrow  mr bentley said nothing but pressed his hand again  on tower street from the direction of the church he beheld a young man and a young woman approaching him absorbed in conversation even at a distance both seemed familiar and presently he identified the lithe and dainty figure in the blue dress as that of the daughter of his vestryman francis ferguson presently she turned her face alight with animation from her companion and recognized him  its mr hodder she exclaimed and was suddenly overtaken with a crimson shyness the young man seemed equally embarrassed as they stood facing the rector  im afraid you dont remember me mr hodder he said i met you at mr fergusons last spring  then it came to him this was the young man who had made the faux pas which had caused mrs ferguson so much consternation and who had so manfully apologized afterwards his puzzled expression relaxed into a smile and he took the young mans hand  i was going to write to you said nan as she looked up at the rector from under the wide brim of her hat our engagement is to be announced wednesday  hodder congratulated them there was a brief silence when nan said tremulously  were coming to st johns  im very glad hodder replied gravely it was one of those compensating moments for him when his tribulations vanished and the tributes of the younger generation were those to which his heart most freely responded but the situation in view of the attitude of francis ferguson was too delicate to be dwelt upon  i came to hear you last sunday mr hodder the young man volunteered with that mixture of awkwardness and straightforwardness which often characterize his sex and age in referring to such matters and i had an idea of writing you too to tell you how much i liked what you said but i know you must have had many letters youve made me think  he flushed but met the rectors eye nan stood regarding him with pride  youve made me think too she added and we intend to pitch in and help you if we can be of any use  he parted from them wondering and it was not until he had reached the parish house that it occurred to him that he was as yet unenlightened as to the young mans name  his second reflection brought back to his mind kate mercy for it was with a portion of nan fergusons generous check that her board had been paid and he recalled the girls hope as she had given it to him that he would find some one in dalton street to help    ii  there might to the mundane eye have been an element of the ridiculous in the spectacle of the rector of st johns counting his gains since he had chosenwith every indication of insanityto bring the pillars of his career crashing down on his own head by no means the least however of the treasures flung into his lap was the tie which now bound him to the philip goodriches which otherwise would never have been possible and as he made his way thither on this particular evening a renewed sense came upon him of his emancipation from the dreary useless hours he had been wont to spend at other dinner tables that existence appeared to him now as the glittering feverish unreality of a nightmare filled with restless women and tired men who drank champagne thus gradually achievingby the time cigars were reachedan artificial vivacity the caprice and superficiality of the one sex the inability to dwell upon or even penetrate a serious subject the blindness to what was going on around them the materialism the money standard of both were nauseating in the retrospect  how indeed had life once appeared so distorted to him a professed servant of humanity as to lead him in the name of duty into that galley  such was the burden of his thought when the homelike front of the goodrich house greeted him in the darkness its enshrouded windows gleaming with friendly light as the door opened the merry sound of childrens laughter floated down the stairs and it seemed to hodder as though a curse had been lifted the lintel of this house had been marked for salvation the scourge had passed it by the scourge of social striving which lay like a blight on a free people  within the note of gentility of that instinctive good taste to which many greater mansions aspired in vain was sustained the furniture the pictures the walls and carpets were true expressions of the individuality of master and mistress of the unity of the life lived together and the rector smiled as he detected in a corner of the hall a sturdy but diminutive hobbyhorsehere the final harmonious touch there was the sound of a scuffle treble shrieks of ecstasy from above and eleanor goodrich came out to welcome him  its phil she told him in laughing despair he upsets all my discipline and gets them so excited they dont go to sleep for hours  seated in front of the fire in the drawingroom he found alison parr her coolness her radiancy her complete acceptance of the situation all this and more he felt from the moment he touched her hand and looked into her face and never had she so distinctly represented to him the mysterious essence of fate why she should have made the fourth at this intimate gathering and whether or not she was or had been an especial friend of eleanor goodrich he did not know there was no explanation  a bowl of superb chrysanthemums occupied the centre of the table eleanor lifted them off and placed them on the sideboard  ive got used to looking at phil she explained and craning is so painful  the effect at first was to increase the intensity of the intimacy there was no reasonhe told himselfwhy alisons selfpossession should have been disturbed and as he glanced at her from time to time he perceived that it was not so completely was she mistress of herself that presently he felt a certain faint resentment rising within himyet he asked himself why she should not have been it was curious that his imagination would not rise now to a realization of that intercourse on which at times his fancy had dwelt with such vividness the very interest the eagerness with which she took part in their discussions seemed to him in the nature of an emphatic repudiation of any ties to him which might have been binding  all this was only on hodders part to be aware of the startling discovery as to how strong his sense of possession had been and how irrational how unwarranted  for he had believed himself as regarding her to have made the supreme renunciation of his life and the very fact that he had not consulted could not consult her feelings and her attitude made that renunciation no less difficult all effort all attempt at achievement of the only woman for whom he had ever felt the sublime harmony of desirethe harmony of the mind and the fleshwas cut off  to be here facing her again in such close proximity was at once a pleasure and a torture and gradually he found himself yielding to the pleasure to the illusion of permanency created by her presence and when all was said he had as much to be grateful for as he could reasonably have wished yes and more the bond there was a bond after all which united them was unbreakable they had forged it together the future would take care of itself  the range of the conversation upon which they at length embarked was a tacit acknowledgment of a relationship which now united four persons who six months before would have believed themselves to have had nothing in common and it was characteristic of the new interest that it transcended the limits of the parish of st johns touched upon the greater affairs to which that parishif their protest prevailedwould now be dedicated not that the church was at once mentioned but subtly implied as now enlistedand emancipated henceforth from all ecclesiastical narrowness the amazing thing by which hodder was suddenly struck was the naturalness with which alison seemed to fit into the new scheme it was as though she intended to remain there and had abandoned all intention of returning to the life which apparently she had once permanently and definitely chosen  bedloe hubbells campaign was another topic and phil had observed with the earnestness which marked his more serious statements that it wouldnt surprise him if young carter hubbells candidate for mayor overturned that autumn the beatty machine  oh do you think so alison exclaimed with exhilaration  theyre frightened and out of breath said phil they had no idea that bedloe would stick after they had licked him in three campaigns two years ago they tried to buy him off by offering to send him to the senate and wallis plimpton has never got through his head to this why he refused  plimptons head eleanor declared dryly was impervious to a certain kind of idea  i wonder if you know mr hodder what an admirer mr hubbell is of yours alison asked he is most anxious to have a talk with you  hodder did not know  well said phil enthusiastically to the rector thats the best tribute youve had yet i cant say that bedloe was a more unregenerate heathen than i was but he was pretty bad  this led them all save hodder into comments on the character of the congregation the sunday before in the midst of which the rector was called away to the telephone sally grover had promised to let him know whether or not they had found kate marcy and his face was grave when he returned he was still preoccupied an hour later when alison arose to go  but your carriage isnt here said phil going to the window  oh i preferred to walk she told him it isnt far    iii  a bloodred october moon shed the fulness of its light on the silent houses and the trees still clinging to leaf cast black shadows across the lawns and deserted streets the very echoes of their footsteps on the pavement seemed to enhance the unreality of their surroundings some of the residences were already closed for the night although the hour was not late and the glow behind the blinds of the others was nullified by the radiancy from above to hodder the sense of their isolation had never been more complete  alison while repudiating the notion that an escort were needed in a neighbourhood of such propriety and peace had not refused his offer to accompany her and hodder felt instinctively as he took his place beside her a sense of climax this situation like those of the past was not of his own making it was here confronting him and a certain inevitable intoxication at being once more alone with her prevented him from forming any policy with which to deal with it he might either trust himself or else he might not and as she said the distance was not great but he could not help wondering during those first moments of silence whether she comprehended the strength of the temptation to which she subjected him  the night was warm she wore a coat which was open and from time to time he caught the gleam of the moonlight on the knotted pearls at her throat over her head she had flung mantillalike a black lace scarf the effect of which was in the soft luminosity encircling her to add to the quality of mystery never exhausted if by acquiescing in his company she had owned to a tie between them the lace shawl falling over the tails of her dark hair and framing in its folds her face had somehow made her once more a stranger nor was it until she presently looked up into his face with a smile that this impression was if not at once wholly dissipated at least contradicted  her question indeed was intimate  why did you come with me  why he repeated taken aback  yes im sure you have something you wish to do something which particularly worries you  no he answered appraising her intuition of him there is nothing i can do tonight a young woman in whom mr bentley is interested in whom i am interested has disappeared but we have taken all the steps possible towards finding her  it was nothingmore serious then that of course is serious enough nothing i mean directly affecting your prospects of remainingwhere you are  no he answered he rejoiced fiercely that she should have asked him the question was not bold but a natural resumption of the old footing not that i mean to imply he added returning her smile that those prospects are in any way improved  are they any worse she said  i see the bishop tomorrow i have no idea what position he will take but even if he should decide not to recommend me for trial many difficult problems still remain to be solved  i know its fine she continued after a moment the way you are going ahead as if there were no question of your not remaining and getting all those people into the church and influencing them as you did when they had come for all sorts of reasons do you remember the first time i met you i told you i could not think of you as a clergyman i cannot nowless than ever  what do you think of me as he asked  i dont know she considered you are unlike any person i have ever known it is curious that i cannot now even think of st johns as a church you have transformed it into something that seems new im afraid i cant describe what i mean but you have opened it up let in the fresh air rid it of the musty and deadening atmosphere which i have always associated with churches i wanted to see you before i went away she went on steadily and when eleanor mentioned that you were coming to her house tonight i asked her to invite me do you think me shameless  the emphasis of his gesture was sufficient he could not trust himself to speak  writing seemed so unsatisfactory after what you had done for me and i never can express myself in writing i seem to congeal  after what i have done for you he exclaimed what can i have done  you have done more than you know she answered in a low voice more i think than i know how are such things to be measured put into words you have effected some change in me which defies analysis a change of attitudeto attempt to dogmatize it would ruin it i prefer to leave it undefinednot even to call it an acquisition of faith i have faith she said simply in what you have become and which has made you dare superbly to cast everything away it is that more than anything you have said what you are  for the instant he lost control of himself  what you are he replied do you realizecan you ever realize what your faith in me has been to me  she appeared to ignore this  i did not mean to say that you have not made many things clear which once were obscure as i wrote you you have convinced me that true belief for instance is the hardest thing in the world the denial of practically all these people who profess to believe represent the majority of them insist that humanity is not to be trusted  they had reached in an incredibly brief time the corner of park street  when are you leaving he asked in a voice that sounded harsh in his own ears  come she said gently im not going in yet for a while  the park lay before them an empty garden filled with checquered light and shadows under the moon he followed her across the gravel glistening with dew past the statue of the mute statesman with arm upraised into pastoral stretchesa delectable country which was theirs alone he did not take it in save as one expression of the breathing woman at his side he was but partly conscious of a direction he had not chosen his blood throbbed violently and a feeling of actual physical faintness was upon him he was being led helplessly all volition gone and the very idea of resistance became chimerical  there was a seat under a tree beside a still lake burnished by the moon it seemed as though he could not bear the current of her touch and yet the thought of its removal were less bearable for she had put her own hand out not shyly but with a movement so fraught with grace so natural that it was but the crowning bestowal  alison he cried i cant ask it of you i have no right  youre not asking it she answered it is i who am asking it  but i have no futurei may be an outcast tomorrow i have nothing to offer you he spoke more firmly now more commandingly  dont you see dear that it is just because your future as obscure that i can do this you never would have done it i knowand i couldnt face that dont you understand that i am demanding the great sacrifice  sacrifice he repeated his fingers turned and closed convulsively on hers  yes sacrifice she said gently isnt it the braver thing  still he failed to catch her meaning  braver she explained with her wonderful courage braver if i love you if i need you if i cannot do without you  he took her in his arms crushing her to him in his strength in one ineffable brief moment finding her lips inhaling the faint perfume of her smooth akin her lithe figure lay passively against him in marvellous unbelievable surrender  i see what you mean he said at length i should have been a coward but i could not be sure that you loved me  so near was her face that he could detect even under the obscurity of the branches a smile  and so i was reduced to this i threw my pride to the winds she whispered but i dont care i was determined selfishly to take happiness  and to give it he added bending down to her the supreme quality of its essence was still to be doubted a bright stardust which dazzled him to evaporate before his waking eyes and try as he would he could not realize to the full depth the boy of contact with a being whom by discipline he had trained his mind to look upon as the unattainable they had spoken of the future yet in these moments any consideration of it was blotted out it was only by degrees that he collected himself sufficiently to be able to return to it alison took up the thread  surely she said sacrifice is useless unless it means something unless it be a realization it must be discriminating and we should both of us have remained incomplete if we had not takenthis you would always i think have been the one man for mebut we should have lost touch he felt her tremble and i needed you i have needed you all my lifeone in whom h might have absolute faith that is my faith of which i could not tell you awhile ago is itsacrilegious  she looked up at him he shook his head thinking of his own it seemed the very distillation of the divine all my life she went on i have been waiting for the one who would risk everything oh if you had faltered the least little bit i dont know what i should have done that would have destroyed what was left of me put out i think the flickering fire that remained instead of fanning it into flame you cannot know how i watched you how i prayed i think it was prayeri am sure it was and it was because you did not falter because you risked all that you gained me you have gained only what you yourself made more than i ever was more than i ever expected to be  alison he remonstrated you mustnt say that  she straightened up and gazed at him taking one of his hands in her lithe fingers  oh but i must it is the truth i felt that you caredwomen are surer in such matters than men i must conceal nothing from younothing of my craftiness women are crafty you know and suppose you fail ah i do not mean failureyou cannot fail now you have put yourself forever beyond failure but what i mean is suppose you were compelled to leave st johns and i came to you then as i have come now and begged to take my place beside you i was afraid to risk it i was afraid you would not take me even now tonight do you realize how austere you are at times how you have frightened me  that i should ever have done that he said  when i looked at you in the pulpit you seemed so far from me i could scarcely bear it as if i had no share in you as if you had already gone to a place beyond where i could not go where i never could oh you will take me with you nowyou wont leave me behind  to this cry every fibre of his soul responded he had thought himself in these minutes to have known all feelings all thrills but now as he gathered her to him again he was to know still another the most exquisite of all that it was conferred upon him to give this woman protection to shield and lift her inspire her as she inspired himthis consciousness was the most exquisite of all transcending all conception of the love of woman and the very fulness of her was beyond him a lifetime were insufficient to exhaust her  i wanted to come to you now john i want to share your failure if it comesall your failures because they will be victoriesdont you see i have never been able to achieve that kind of victoryreal victory by myself i have always succumbed taken the baser the easier thing her cheek was wet i wasnt strong enough by myself and i never knew the stronger one  see what my trust in you has been i knew that you would not refuse me in spite of the fact that the world may misunderstand may sneer at your taking me i knew that you were big enough even for that when you understood it coming from me i wanted to be with you now that we might fight it out together  what have i done to deserve so priceless a thing he asked  she smiled at him again her lip trembling  oh im not priceless im only real im only humanhuman and tired you are so strong you cant know how tired have you any idea why i came out here this summer it was because i was desperatebecause i had almost decided to marry some one else  she felt him start  i was afraid of it he said  were you did you think did you wonder a little about me there was a vibrant note of triumph to which he reacted she drew away from him a little perhaps when you know how sordid my life has been you wont want me  isis that your faith alison he demanded god forbid you have come to a man who also has confessions to make  oh i am glad i want to know all of youall do you understand that will bring us even closer together and it was one thing i felt about you in the beginning that day in the garden that you had had much to conquermore than most men it was a part of your force and of your knowledge of life you were not a sexless ascetic who preached a mere neutral goodness does that shock you  he smiled in turn  i went away from here as i once told you full of a high resolution not to trail the honour of my artif i achieved artin the dust but i have not only trailed my arti trailed myself in new york i became contaminatedthe poison of the place of the people with whom i came in contact got into my blood little by little i yieldedi wanted so to succeed to be able to confound those who had doubted and ridiculed me i wasnt content to wait to deny myself for the ideal success was in the air that was the poison and i only began to realize it after it was too late  please dont think i am asking pityi feel that you must know from the very first my successwhich was really failurebegan to come in the wrong way as my fathers daughter i could not be obscure i was sought out i was what was called picturesque i suppose the women petted me although some of them hated me and i had a fascination for a certain kind of menthe wrong kind i began going to dinners house parties to recognize that advantages came that way it seemed quite natural it was what many others of my profession tried to do and they envied me my opportunities  i ought to say in justice to myself that i was not in the least cynical about it i believed i was clinging to the ideal of art and that all i wanted was a chance and the people i went with had the same characteristics only intensified as those i had known here of course i was actually no better than the women who were striving frivolously to get away from themselves and the men who were fighting to get money only i didnt know it  well my chance came at last i had done several little things when an elderly man who is tremendously rich whose name you would recognize if i mentioned it gave me an order for weeks nearly every day he came to my studio for tea to talk over the plans i was really unsophisticated thenbut i can see nowwell that the garden was a secondary consideration and the fact that i did it for him gave me a standing i should not otherwise have had oh it is sickening to look back upon to think what an idiot i was in how little i saw  that garden launched me and i began to have more work than i could do i was conscientious about it triedtried to make every garden better than the last but i was a young woman unconventionally living alone and by degrees the handicap of my sex was brought home to me i did not feel the pressure at first and theni am ashamed to sayit had in it an element of excitement a sense of power the poison was at work i was amused i thought i could carry it through that the world had advanced sufficiently for a woman to do anything if she only had the courage and i believed i possessed a true broadness of view and could impress it so far as i was concerned on others  as i look back upon it all i believe my reputation for coldness saved me yet it was that very reputation which increased the pressure and sometimes i was fairly driven into a corner it seemed to madden some menand the disillusionments began to come of course it was my faulti dont pretend to say it wasnt there were many whom instinctively i was on my guard against but some i thought really nice whom i trusted revealed a side i had not suspected that was the terrible thing and yet i held to my ideal tattered as it was  alison was silent a moment still clinging to his hand and when she spoke again it was with a tremor of agitation  it is hard to tell you this but i wish you to know at last i met a man comparatively young who was making his own way in new york achieving a reputation as a lawyer shall i tell you that i fell in love with him he seemed to bring a new freshness into my life when i was beginning to feel the staleness of it not that i surrendered at once but the reservations of which i was conscious at the first gradually disappearedor rather i ignored them he had charm a magnificent selfconfidence but i think the liberality of the opinions he expressed in regard to women most appealed to me i was weak on that side and i have often wondered whether he knew it i believed him incapable of a great refusal  he agreed if i consented to marry him that i should have my freedomfreedom to live in my own life and to carry on my profession fortunately the engagement was never announced never even suspected one day he hinted that i should return to my father for a month or two before the wedding the manner in which he said it suddenly turned me cold oh alison exclaimed i was quite willing to go back to pay my father a visit as i had done nearly every year buthow can i tell youhe could not believe that i had definitely given upmy fathers money  i sat still and looked at him i felt as if i were frozen turned to stone and after a long while since i would not speak to him he went out three months later he came back and said that i had misunderstood him that he couldnt live without me i sent him away only the other day he married amy grant one of my friends  well after that i was tiredso tired everything seemed to go out of life it wasnt that i loved him any longerall had been crushed but the illusion was gone and i saw myself as i was and for the first time in my life i felt defenceless helpless i wanted refuge did you ever hear of jennings howe  the architect  alison nodded of course you must havehe is so well known he has been a widower for several years he liked my work saw its defects and was always frank about them and i designed a good many gardens in connection with his houses he himself is above all things an artist and he fell into the habit of coming to my studio and giving me friendly advice in the nicest way he seemed to understand that i was going through some sort of a crisis he called it too much society and then without any warning he asked me to marry him  that is why i came out hereto think it over i didnt love him and i told him so but i respected him  he never compromised in his art and i have known him over and over to refuse houses because certain conditions were stipulated to marry him was an acknowledgment of defeat i realized that but i had come to the extremity where i wanted peacepeace and protection i wanted to put myself irrevocably beyond the old life which simply could not have gone on and i saw myself in the advancing years becoming tawdry and worn losing little by little what i had gained at a price  so i came hereto reflect to see as it were if i could find something left in me to take hold of to build upon to begin over again perhaps by going back to the old associations i could think of no better place and i knew that my father would be going away after a few weeks and that i should be lone yet with an atmosphere back of memy old atmosphere that was why i went to church the first sunday in order to feel more definitely that atmosphere to summon up more completely the image of my mother more and more as the years have passed i have thought of her in moments of trouble i have recovered her as i never had hoped to do in mr bentley isnt it strange she exclaimed wonderingly that he should have come into both our lives with such an influence at this time  and then i met you talked to you that afternoon in the garden shall i make a complete confession i wrote to jennings howe that very week that i could not marry him  you knew hodder exclaimed you knew then  ah i cant tell what i knewor when i knew after i had seen you that i couldnt marry him isnt that enough  he drew in his breath deeply  i should be less than a man if i refused to take you alison andno matter what happens i can and will find some honest work to support you but oh my dear when i think of it the nobility and generosity of what you have done appalls me  no no she protested you mustnt say that i needed you more than you need me and havent we both discovered the world and renounced it i can at least go so far as to say that with all my heart and isnt marriage truer and higher when man and wife start with difficulties and problems to solve together it is that thought that brings me the greatest joy that i may be able to help you didnt you need me just a little  now that i have you i am unable to think of the emptiness which might have been you came to me like beatrice when i had lost my way in the darkness of the wood and like beatrice you showed me the path and hell and heaven  oh you would have found the path without me i cannot claim that i saw from the first that you were destined to find it and unlike beatrice i too was lost and it was you who lifted me up you mustnt idealize me she stood up come she said he too stood gazing at her and she lifted her hands to his shoulders they moved out from under the tree and walked for a while in silence across the dewdrenched grass towards park street the moon which had ridden over a great space in the sky hung red above the blackness of the forest to the west  do you remember when we were here together the day i met mr bentley and you never would have spoken  how could i alison he asked  no you couldnt and yetyou would have let me go  he put his arm in hers and drew her towards him  i must talk to your father he said some daysoon i ought to tell himof our intentions we cannot go on like this  no she agreed i realize it and i cannot stay much longer in park street i must go back to new york until you send for me dear and there are things i must do do you know even though i antagonize him somy father i meaneven though he suspects and bitterly resents any interest in you my affection for you and that i have lingered because of you i believe in his way he has liked to have me here  i can understand it hodder said  its because you are bigger than i although he has quarrelled with you so bitterly i dont know what definite wrongs he has done to other persons i dont wish to know i dont ask you to tell me what passed between you that night once you said that you had an affection for himthat he was lonely he is lonely in these last weeks in spite of his anger i can see that he suffers terribly it is a tragedy because he will never give in  it is a tragedy hodders tone was agitated  i wonder if he realizes a little she began and paused now that preston has come home  your brother hodder exclaimed  yes i forgot to tell you i dont know why he came she faltered i suppose he has got into some new trouble he seems changed i cant describe it now but i will tell you about it its the first time weve all three been together since my mother died for preston wasnt back from college when i went to paris to study  they stood together on the pavement before the massive house fraught with so many and varied associations for hodder and as he looked up at it his eye involuntarily rested upon the windows of the boys room where eldon parr had made his confession alison startled him by pronouncing his name which came with such unaccustomed sweetness from her lips you will write me tomorrow she said after you have seen the bishop  yes at once you mustnt let it worry you  i feel as if i had cast off that kind of worry forever it is onlythe other worries from which we do not escape from which we do not wish to escape  with a wonderful smile she had dropped his hands and gone in at the entrance when a sound made them turn the humming of a motor and even as they looked it swung into park street  its a taxicab she said as she spoke it drew up almost beside them instead of turning in at the driveway the door opened and a man alighted  preston alison exclaimed  he started turning from the driver whom he was about to pay as for hodder he was not only undergoing a certain shock through the sudden contact at such a moment with alisons brother there was an additional shock that this was alisons brother and eldon parrs son not that his appearance was shocking although the wellclad athletic figure was growing a trifle heavy and the light from the side lamps of the car revealed dissipation in a still handsome face the effect was a subtler one not to be analyzed and due to a multitude of preconceptions  alison came forward  this is mr hodder preston she said simply  for a moment preston continued to stare at the rector without speaking suddenly he put out his hand  mr hodder of st johns he demanded  yes answered hodder his surprise deepened to perplexity at the warmth of the handclasp that followed  a smile that brought back vividly to hodder the sunny expression of the schoolboy in the picture lightened the features of the man  im very glad to see you he said in a tone that left no doubt of its genuine quality  thank you hodder replied meeting his eye with kindness yet with a scrutiny that sought to penetrate the secret of an unexpected cordiality i too have hoped to see you  alison who stood by wondering felt a meaning behind the rectors words she pressed his hand as he bade her once more good night  wont you take my taxicab asked preston it is going down town anyway  i think id better stick to the street cars hodder said his refusal was not ungraceful but firm preston did not insist  in spite of the events of that evening which he went over again and again as the midnight car carried him eastward in spite of a newborn happiness the actuality of which was still difficult to grasp hodder was vaguely troubled when he thought of preston parr     volume 8     chapter xxvii retribution   i  the bishops house was a comfortable double dwelling of a smooth bright red brick and large plateglass windows situated in a plot at the western end of waverley place it had been bought by the diocese in the nineties and was representative of that transitional period in american architecture when the mansard roof had been repudiated when as yet no definite types had emerged to take its place the house had pointed gables and a tiny and utterly useless porch that served only to darken the front door made of heavy pieces of wood fantastically curved  it was precisely ten oclock in the morning when hodder rang the bell and was shown into the ample study which he had entered on other and less vital occasions he found difficulty in realizing that this pleasant room lined with wellworn books and overlooking a back lawn where the clothes of the episcopal family hung in the yellow autumn sun was to be his judgment seat whence he might be committed to trial for heresy  and this was the twentieth century the full force of the preposterous fact smote him and a consciousness of the distance he himself had travelled since the comparatively recent days of his own orthodoxy and suddenly he was full again of a resentful impatience not only that he should be called away from his labours his cares the strangers who were craving his help to answer charges of such an absurd triviality but that the performance of the great task to which he had set his hand with gods help should depend upon it would his enemies be permitted to drive him out thus easily  the old bishop came in walking by the aid of a cane he smiled at hodder who greeted him respectfully and bidding him sit down took a chair himself behind his writing table from whence he gazed awhile earnestly and contemplatively at the rugged features and strong shoulders of the rector of st johns the effect of the look was that of a visual effort to harmonize the man with the deed he had done the stir he had created in the city and the diocese to readjust impressions  a hint of humour crept into the bishops blue eyes which were watery yet strong with heavy creases in the corners he indicated by a little gesture three bundles of envelopes bound by rubber bands on the corner of his blotter  hodder he said see what a lot of trouble you have made for me in my old age all those are about you  the rectors expression could not have been deemed stern but it had met the bishops look unflinchingly now it relaxed into a responding smile which was not without seriousness  i am sorry sir hodder answered to have caused you any worryor inconvenience  perhaps said the bishop i have had too much smooth sailing for a servant of christ indeed i have come to that conclusion  hodder did not reply he was moved even more by the bishops manner and voice than his words and the opening to their conversation was unexpected the old man put on his spectacles and drew from the top of one of the bundles a letter  this is from one of your vestrymen mr gordon atterbury he said and proceeded to read it slowly when he had finished he laid it down  is that according to your recollection mr hodder a fairly accurate summary of the sermon you gave when you resumed the pulpit at the end of the summer  yes sir answered the rector it is surprisingly accurate with the exception of two or three inferences which i shall explain at the proper moment  mr atterbury is to be congratulated on his memory the bishop observed a little dryly and he has saved me the trouble of reading more now what are the inferences to which you object  hodder stated them the most serious one he added is that which he draws from my attitude on the virgin birth mr atterbury insists like others who cling to that dogma that i have become what he vaguely calls an unitarian he seems incapable of grasping my meaning that the only true god the age knows the world has ever known is the god in christ is the spirit in christ and is there not by any material proof but because we recognize it spiritually and that doctrine and dogma ancient speculations as to how definitely that spirit came to be in christ are fruitless and mischievous today mr atterbury and others seem actually to resent my identification of our lords spirit with the social conscience as well as the individual conscience of our time  the bishop nodded  hodder he demanded abruptly leaning forward over his desk how did this thing happen  you mean sir  there was in the bishops voice a note almost pathetic oh i do not mean to ask you anything you may deem too personal and god forbid as i look at you as i have known you that i should doubt your sincerity i am not your inquisitor but your bishop and your friend and i am asking for your confidence six months ago you were apparently one of the most orthodox rectors in the diocese i recognize that you are not an impulsive sensational man and i am all the more anxious to learn from your own lips something of the influences of the processes which have changed you which have been strong enough to impel you to risk the position you have achieved  by this unlookedfor appeal hodder was not only disarmed but smitten with selfreproach at the thought of his former misjudgment and underestimation of the man in whose presence he sat and it came over him not only the extent to which formerly he had regarded the bishop as too tolerant and easygoing but the fact that he had arrived here today prepared to find in his superior anything but the attitude he was showing considering the bishops age hodder had been ready for a lack of understanding of the step he had taken even for querulous reproaches and rebuke  he had therefore to pull himself together to adjust himself to the unexpected greatness of soul with which he was being received before he began to sketch the misgivings he had felt from the early days of his rectorship of st johns the helplessness and failure which by degrees had come over him he related how it had become apparent to him that by far the greater part of his rich and fashionable congregation were christians only in name who kept their religion in a small and impervious compartment where it did not interfere with their lives he pictured the yearning and perplexity of those who had come to him for help who could not accept the old explanations and had gone away empty and he had not been able to make christians of the poor who attended the parish house finally trusting in the bishops discretion he spoke of the revelations he had unearthed in dalton street and how these had completely destroyed his confidence in the christianity he had preached and how he had put his old faith to the test of unprejudiced modern criticism philosophy and science  the bishop listened intently his head bent his eyes on he rector  and you have come outconvinced he asked tremulously yes yes i see you have it is enough  he relapsed into thought his wrinkled hand lying idly on the table  i need not tell you my friend he resumed at length that a great deal of pressure has been brought to bear upon me in this matter more than i have ever before experienced you have mortally offended among others the most powerful layman in the diocese mr parr who complains that you have presumed to take him to task concerning his private affairs  i told him answered holder that so long as he continued to live the life he leads i could not accept his contributions to st johns  i am an old man said the bishop and whatever usefulness i have had is almost finished but if i were young today i should pray god for the courage and insight you have shown and i am thankful to have lived long enough to have known you it has at least been given one to realize that times have changed that we are on the verge of a mighty future i will be frank to say that ten years ago if this had happened i should have recommended you for trial now i can only wish you godspeed i too can see the light my friend i can see i think though dimly the beginnings of a blending of all sects of all religions in the increasing vision of the truth revealed in jesus christ stripped as you say of dogma of fruitless attempts at rational explanation in japan and china in india and persia as well as in christian countries it is coming coming by some working of the spirit the mystery of which is beyond us and nations and men who even yet know nothing of the gospels are showing a willingness to adopt what is christs and the god of christ  holder was silent from sheer inability to speak  if you had needed an advocate with me the bishop continued you could not have had one to whose counsel i would more willingly have listened than that of horace bentley he wrote asking to come and see me but i went to him in dalton street the day i returned and it gives me satisfaction mr holder to confess to you freely that he has taught me by his life more of true christianity than i have learned in all my experience elsewhere  i had thought exclaimed the rector wonderingly that i owed him more than any other man  there are many who think thathundreds i should say the bishop replied eldon parr ruined him drove him from the church it is strange how outside of the church his influence has silently and continuously grown until it has borne fruit inthis even now he added after a pause the cautiousness the dread of change which comes with old age might i think lead me to be afraid of it if ididnt perceive behind it the spirit of horace bentley  it struck holder suddenly what an unconscious but real source of confidence this thought had likewise been to him he spoke of it  it is not that i wouldnt trust you the bishop went on i have watched you i have talked to asa waring i have read the newspapers in spite of it all you have kept your head you have not compromised the dignity of the church but oh my friend i beg you to bear in mind that you are launched upon deep waters that you have raised up many enemiesenemies of christwho seek to destroy you you are still young and the uncompromising experiment to which you are pledged of freeing your church of placing her in the position of power and influence in the community which is rightfully hers is as yet untried and no stone will be left unturned to discourage and overcome you you have faithyou have made me feel it as you sat herea faith which will save you from bitterness in personal defeat you may not reap the victory or even see it in your lifetime but of this i am sure that you will be able to say with paul i have planted apollos watered but god gave the increase whatever happens you may count upon my confidence and support i can only wish that i were younger that my arm were stronger and that i had always perceived the truth as clearly as i see it now  holder had risen involuntarily while these words were being spoken they were indeed a benediction and the intensity of his feeling warned him of the inadequacy of any reply they were pronounced in sorrow yet in hope and they brought home to him sharply the nobility of the bishops own sacrifice  and you sir he asked  ah answered the bishop with this i shall have had my life i am content  you will come to me again hodder some other day he said after an interval that we may talk over the new problems they are constructive creative and i am anxious to hear how you propose to meet them for one thing to find a new basis for the support of such a parish i understand they have deprived you of your salary  i have enough to live on for a year or so replied the rector quickly perhaps more  im afraid said the bishop with a smile in his old eyes that you will need it my friend but who can say you have strength you have confidence and god is with you    ii  life as hodder now grasped it was a rapidly whirling wheel which gave him no chance to catch up with the impressions and experiences through which it was dragging him here for instance were two farreaching and momentous events one crowding upon the other and not an hour for reflection realization or adjustment he had indeed after his return from the bishops snatched a few minutes to write alison the unexpected result of that interview but even as he wrote and rang for a messenger to carry the note to park street he was conscious of an effort to seize upon and hold the fact that the woman he had so intensely desired was now his helpmate and had of her own freewill united herself with him a strong sense of the dignity of their relationship alone prevented his calling her on the telephoneas it doubtless had prevented her while she remained in her fathers house he could not  in the little room next to the office several persons were waiting to see him but as he went downstairs he halted on the landing his hand going to his forehead a reflex movement significant of a final attempt to achieve the hitherto unattainable feat of imagining her as his wife if he might only speak to her againnow this morning and yet he knew that he needed no confirmation the reality was there in the background and though refusing to come forward to be touched it had already grafted itself as an actual and vital part of his being never to be eliminated  characteristically perfecting his own ideal she had come to him in the hour when his horizon had been most obscure and he experienced now an exultation though solemn and sacred that her faith had so far been rewarded in the tidings he now confided to the messenger he was not as yet to be driven out from the task to be deprived of the talent the opportunity intrusted to him by lordthe emancipation of the parish of st johns  the first to greet him when he entered his office was one who unknown to himself had been fighting the battle of the god in christ and who now thanks to john hodder had identified the spirit as the transforming force bedloe hubbell had come to offer his services to the church the tender was unqualified  i should even be willing mr hodder he said with a smile to venture occasionally into a pulpit you have not only changed my conception of religion but you have made it for me something which i can now speak about naturally  hodder was struck by the suggestion  ah we shall need the laymen in the pulpits mr hubbell he said quickly a great spiritual movement must be primarily a lay movement and i promise you you shall not lack for opportunity    iii  at nine oclock that evening when a reprieve came hodder went out anxiety on the score of kate marcy as well as a desire to see mr bentley and tell him of the conversation with the bishop directed his steps toward dalton street and hodder had indeed an intention of confiding to his friend as one eminently entitled to it the news of his engagement to alison parr  nothing however had been heard of kate she was not in dalton street mr bentley feared the search of gratz the cabinetmaker had been fruitless and sally grover had even gone to see the woman in the hospital whom kate had befriended in the hope of getting a possible clew they sat close together before the fire in mr bentleys comfortable library debating upon the possibility of other methods of procedure when a carriage was heard rattling over the pitted asphalt without as it pulled up at the curb a silence fell between them the doorbell rang  holder found himself sitting erect rigidly attentive listening to the muffled sound of a womans voice in the entry a few moments later came a knock at the library door and sam entered the old darky was plainly frightened  its miss kate marse hoace who you bin tryin to fin he stammered  holder sprang to his feet and made his way rapidly around the table where he stood confronting the woman in the doorway there she was perceptibly swaying as though the floor under her were rocked by an earthquake her handsome face was white as chalk her pupils widened in terror it was curious at such an instant that he should have taken in her costumeyet it was part of the mystery she wore a new closefitting patently expensive suit of dark blue cloth and a small hat which were literally transforming in their effect demanding a palpable initial effort of identification  he seized her by the arm  what is it he demanded  oh my god she cried hehes out therein the carriage  she leaned heavily against the doorpost shivering holder saw sally grover coming down the stairs  take her he said and went out of the front door which sam had left open mr bentley was behind him  the driver had descended from the box and was peering into the darkness of the vehicle when he heard them and turned at sight of the tall clergyman an expression of relief came into his face  i dont like the looks of this sir he said i thought he was pretty bad when i went to fetch him  holder pushed past him and looked into the carriage leaning back motionless in the corner of the seat was the figure of a man for a terrible moment of premonition of enlightenment the rector gazed at it  they sent for me from a family hotel in ayers street the driver was explaining mr bentleys voice interrupted him  he must be brought in at once do you know where dr latimers office is on tower street he asked the man go there and bring this doctor back with you as quickly as possible if he is not in get another physician  between them the driver and holder got the burden out of the carriage and up the steps the light from the hallway confirmed the rectors fear  its preston parr he said  the next moment was too dreadful for surprise but never had the sense of tragedy so pierced the innermost depths of holders being as now when horace bentleys calmness seemed to have forsaken him and as he gazed down upon the features on the pillow he wept holder turned away whatever memories those features evoked memories of a past that still throbbed with life these were too sacred for intrusion the years of exile of uncomplaining service to others in this sordid street and over the wide city had not yet sufficed to allay the pain to heal the wound of youth nay loyalty had kept it fresha loyalty that was the handmaid of faith  the rector softly left the room only to be confronted with another harrowing scene in the library where a frantic woman was struggling in sally grovers grasp he went to her assistance words of comfort of entreaty were of no availkate marcy did not seem to hear them hers in contrast to that other was the unmeaning grief the overwhelming sense of injustice of the child and with her regained physical strength the two had all they could do to restrain her  i will go to him she sobbed between her paroxysms youve got no right to keep mehes mine he came back to mehes all i ever had  so intent were they that they did not notice mr bentley standing beside them until they heard his voice  what she says is true he told them her place is in there let her go  kate marcy raised her head at the words and looked at him a strange halfcomprehending halfcredulous gaze they released her helped her towards the bedroom and closed the door gently behind her the three sat in silence until the carriage was heard returning and the doctor entered  the examination was brief and two words laconically spoken sufficed for an explanationapoplexy alcohol the prostrate quivering woman was left where they had found her  dr latimer was a friend of mr bentleys and betrayed no surprise at a situation which otherwise might have astonished him it was only when he learned the dead mans name and his parentage that he looked up quickly from his note book  the matter can be arranged without a scandal he said after an instant can you tell me something of the circumstances  it was hodder who answered  preston parr had been in love with this woman and separated from her she was under mr bentleys care when he found her again i infer by accident from what the driver says they were together in a hotel in ayers street and he died after he had been put in a carriage in her terror she was bringing him to mr bentley  the doctor nodded  poor woman he said unexpectedly will you be good enough to let mr parr know that i will see him at his house tonight he added as he took his departure    iv  sally grower went out with the physician and it was mr bentley who answered the question in the rectors mind which he hesitated to ask  mr parr must come here he said  as the rector turned mechanically to pick up his hat mr bentley added  you will come back hodder  since you wish it sir the rector said  once in the street he faced a predicament but swiftly decided that the telephone was impossible under the circumstances that there could be no decent procedure without going himself to park street it was only a little after ten the electric car which he caught seemed to lag the stops were interminable his thoughts flew hither and thither should he try first to see alison he was nearest to her now of all the world and he could not suffer the thought of her having the news otherwise yes he must tell her since she knew nothing of the existence of kate marcy  having settled thatthough the thought of the blow she was to receive lay like a weight on his heartmr bentleys reason for summoning eldon parr to dalton street came to him that the feelings of mr bentley towards the financier were those of christian forgiveness was not for a moment to be doubted but a meeting particularly under such circumstances could not but be painful indeed it must be it was hodder saw for kate marcys sake yes and for eldon parrs as well that he be given this opportunity to deal with the woman whom he had driven away from his son and ruined  the moon which had shed splendours over the world the night before was obscured by a lowdrifting mist as hodder turned in between the ornamental lamps that marked the gateway of the park street mansion and by some undiscerned thoughtsuggestion he pictured the heartbroken woman he had left beside the body of one who had been heir to all this magnificence useless now stone and iron and glass pictures and statuary all the labour all the care and cunning all the stealthy planning to get ahead of others had been in vain what indeed were left to eldon parr it was he who needed pitynot the woman who had sinned and had been absolved because of her great love not the wayward vicedriven boy who lay dead the very horror of what eldon parr was now to suffer turned hodder cold as he rang the bell and listened for the soft tread of the servant who would answer his summons  the man who flung open the door knew him and did not conceal his astonishment  will you take my card to miss parr the rector said if she has not retired and tell her i have a message  miss parr is still in the library sir  alone  yes sir the man preceded him but before his name had been announced alison was standing her book in her hand gazing at him with startled eyes his name rising a low cry to her lips  john  he took the book from her gently and held her hands  something has happened she said tell mei can bear it  he saw instantly that her dread was for him and it made his task the harder  its your brother alison  preston what is it hes done something  hodder shook his head  he diedtonight he is at mr bentleys  it was like her that she did not cry out or even speak but stood still her hands tightening on his her breast heaving she was not he knew a woman who wept easily and her eyes were dry and he had it to be thankful for that it was given him to be with her in this sacred relationship at such a moment but even now such was the mystery that ever veiled her soul he could not read her feelings nor know what these might be towards the brother whose death he announced  i want to tell you first alison to prepare you he said  her silence was eloquent she looked up at him bravely trustfully in a way that made him wince whatever the exact nature of her suffering it was too deep for speech and yet she helped him made it easier for him by reason of her very trust once given not to be withdrawn it gave him a paradoxical understanding of her which was beyond definition  you must knowyou would have sometime to know that there was a woman he loved whom he intended to marrybut she was separated from him she was not what is called a bad woman she was a working girl i found her this summer and she told me the story and she has been under the care of mr bentley she disappeared two or three days ago your brother met her again and he was stricken with apoplexy while with her this evening she brought him to mr bentleys house  my fatherbought her and sent her away  you knew  i heard a little about it at the time by accident i have always remembered it i have always felt that something like this would happen  her sense of fatality another impression she gave of living in the deeper instinctive currents of life had never been stronger upon him than now she released his hands  how strange she said that the end should have come at mr bentleys he loved my mothershe was the only woman he ever loved  it came to hodder as the completing touch of the revelation he had half glimpsed by the bedside  ah he could not help exclaiming that explains much  she had looked at him again through sudden tears as though divining his reference to mr bentleys grief when a step make them turn eldon parr had entered the room never not even in that last interview had his hardness seemed so concretely apparent as now again pity seemed never more out of place yet pity was hodders dominant feeling as he met the coldness the relentlessness of the glance the thing that struck him that momentarily kept closed his lips was the awful unconscious timeliness of the mans entrance and his unpreparedness to meet the blow that was to crush him  may i ask mr hodder he said in an unemotional voice what you are doing in this house  still hodder hesitated an unwilling executioner  father said alison mr hodder has come with a message  never perhaps had eldon parr given such complete proof of his lack of spiritual intuition the atmosphere charged with presage for him gave him nothing  mr hodder takes a strange way of delivering it was his comment  mercy took precedence over her natural directness she laid her hand gently on his arm and she had at that instant no thought of the long years he had neglected her for her brother  its aboutpreston she said  preston the name came sharply from eldon parrs lips what about him speak cant you  he died this evening said alison simply  hodder plainly heard the ticking of the clock on the mantel and the drama that occurred was the more horrible because it was hidden played as it were behind closed doors for the spectators there was only the black wall and the silence eldon parr literally did nothingmade no gesture uttered no cry the death they knew was taking place in his soul yet the man stood before them naturally for what seemed an interminable time  where is he he asked  at mr bentleys in dalton street it was alison who replied again  even then he gave no sign that he read retribution in the coincidence betrayed no agitation at the mention of a name which in such a connection might well have struck the terror of judgment into his heart they watched him while with a firm step he crossed the room and pressed a button in the wall and waited  i want the closed automobile at once he said when the servant came  i beg pardon sir but i think gratton has gone to bed he had no orders  then wake him said eldon parr instantly and send for my secretary  with a glance which he perceived alison comprehended hodder made his way out of the room he had from eldon parr as he passed him neither question acknowledgment nor recognition whatever the banker might have felt or whether his body had now become a mere machine mechanically carrying on a lifelong habit of action the impression was one of the tremendousness of the mans consistency a great effort was demanded to summon up the now almost unimaginable experience of his confidence of the evening when almost on that very spot he had revealed to hodder the one weakness of his life and yet the effort was not to be presently without startling results in the darkness of the street the picture suddenly grew distinct on the screen of the rectors mind the face of the banker subtly drawn with pain as he had looked down on it in compassion the voice with its undercurrent of agony  he never knew how much i caredthat what i was doing was all for him building for him that he might carry on my work    v  so swift was the trolley that ten minutes had elapsed after hodders arrival before the purr of an engine and the shriek of a brake broke the stillness of upper dalton street and announced the stopping of a heavy motor before the door the rector had found mr bentley in the library alone seated with bent head in front of the fire and had simply announced the intention of eldon parr to come from the chair hodder had unobtrusively chosen near the window his eyes rested on the noble profile of his friend what his thoughts were hodder could not surmise for he seemed again marvellously to have regained the outward peace which was the symbol of banishment from the inner man of all thought of self  i have prepared her for mr parrs coming he said to hodder at length  and yet he had left her there hodder recalled the words mr bentley had spoken it is her place her place the fallen womans the place she had earned by a great love and a great renunciation of which no earthly power might henceforth deprive her  then came the motor the ring at the door the entrance of eldon parr into the library he paused a perceptible moment on the threshold as his look fell upon the man whom he had deprived of home and fortuneyes and of the one woman in the world for them both mr bentley had risen and stood facing him that shining compassionate gaze should have been indeed a difficult one to meet vengeance was the lords in truth what ordeal that horace bentley in anger and retribution might have devised could have equalled this  and yet eldon parr did meet itwith an effort hodder from his corner detected the effort though it were barely discernible and would have passed a scrutiny less rigidthe first outward and visible sign of the lesion within for a brief instant the bankers eyes encountered mr bentleys look with a flash of the old defiance and fell and then swept the room  will you come this way mr parr mr bentley said indicating the door of the bedroom  alison followed her eyes wet with unheeded tears had never left mr bentleys face she put out her hand to him  eldon parr had halted abruptly he knew from alison the circumstances in which his son had died and how he had been brought hither to this house but the sight of the woman beside the bed fanned into flame his fury against a world which had cheated him by such ignominious means of his dearest wish he grew white with sudden passion  what is she doing here he demanded  kate marcy who had not seemed to hear his entrance raised up to him a face from which all fear had fled a face which by its suggestive power compelled him to realize the absolute despair clutching now at his own soul and against which he was fighting wildly hopelessly it was lying in wait for him with hideous patience in the coming watches of the night perhaps he read in the face of this woman whom he had condemned to suffer all degradation and over whom he was now powerless something which would ultimately save her from the hell now yawning for him a redeeming element in her grief of which she herself were not as yet conscious a light shining in the darkness of her soul which in eternity would become luminous and he saw no light for himhe thrashed in darkness he had nothing now to give no power longer to deprive she had given all she possessed the memorial of her kind which would outlast monuments  it was alison who crossed the room swiftly she laid her hand protectingly on kate marcys shoulder and stooped and kissed her she turned to her father  it is her right she said he belonged to her not to us and we must take her home with us  no answered kate marcy i dont want to go i wouldnt live she added with unexpected intensity with him  you would live with me said alison  i dont want to live kate marcy got up from the chair with an energy they had not thought her to possess a revival of the spirit which had upheld her when she had contended singly with a remorseless world she addressed herself to eldon parr you took him from me and i was a fool to let you he might have saved me and saved himself i listened to you when you told me lies as to how it would ruin him welli had him you never did  the sudden intolerable sense of wrong done to her love the swift anger which followed it the justness of her claim of him who now lay in the dignity of death clothed herwho in life had been crushed and blotted outwith a dignity not to be gainsaid in this moment of final selfassertion she became the dominating person in the room knew for once the birthright of human worth they watched her in silence as she turned and gave one last lingering look at the features of the dead stretched out her hand towards them but did not touch them and then went slowly towards the door beside alison she stopped  you are his sister she said  yes  she searched alisons face wistfully  i could have loved you  and can you notstill  kate mercy did not answer the question  it is because you understand she said youre like those ive come to knowhere and youre like him i dont mean in looks he too was goodand square she spoke the words a little defiantly as though challenging the verdict of the world and he wouldnt have been wild if he could have got going straight  i know said alison in a low voice  yes said kate mercy you look as if you did he thought a lot of you he said he was only beginning to find out what you was id like you to think as well of me as you can  i could not think better alison replied  kate mercy shook her head  i got about as low as any woman ever got she said  mr hodder will tell you i want you to know that i wouldnt marryyour brother she hesitated over the name he wanted me tohe was mad with me to night because i wouldntwhen this happened  she snatched her hand free from alisons and fled out of the room into the hallway  eldon parr had moved towards the bed seemingly unaware of the words they had spoken perhaps as he gazed upon the face he remembered in his agony the sunny smiling child who need to come hurrying down the steps in ransome street to meet him  in the library mr bentley and john hodder knowing nothing of her flight heard the front door close on kate marcy forever     chapter xxviii light   i  two days after the funeral which had taken place from calvary and not from st johns hodder was no little astonished to receive a note from eldon parrs secretary requesting the rector to call in park street in the same mail was a letter from alison i have had she wrote a talk with my father the initiative was his i should not have thought of speaking to him of my affairs so soon after prestons death it seems that he strongly suspected our engagement which of course i at once acknowledged telling him that it was your intention at the proper time to speak to him yourself  i was surprised when he said he would ask you to call i confess that i have not an idea of what he intends to say to you john but i trust you absolutely as always you will find him already terribly changed i cannot describe ityou will see for yourself and it has all seemed to happen so suddenly as i wrote you he sat up both nights with prestonhe could not be induced to leave the room and after the first night he was different he has hardly spoken a word except when he sent for me this evening and he eats nothing and yet somehow i do not think that this will be the end i feel that he will go on living  i did not realize how much he still hoped about preston and on monday when preston so unexpectedly came home he was happier than i have known him for years it was strange and sad that he could not see as i saw that whatever will power my brother had had was gone he could not read it in the face of his own son who was so quick to detect it in all others and then came the tragedy oh john do you think we shall ever find that girl againi know you are trying but we mustnt rest until we do do you think we ever shall i shall never forgive myself for not following her out of the door but i thought she had gone to you and mr bentley  hodder laid the letter down and took it up again he knew that alison felt as he felt that they never would find kate marcy he read on  my father wished to speak to me about the money he has plans for much of it it appears even now oh john he will never understand i want so much to see you to talk to youthere are times when i am actually afraid to be alone and without you if it be weakness to confess that i need your reassurance your strength and comfort constantly then i am weak i once thought i could stand alone that i had solved all problems for myself but i know now how foolish i was i have been face to face with such dreadful unimagined things and in my ignorance i did not conceive that life held such terrors and when i look at my father the thought of immortality turns me faint after you have come here this afternoon there can be no longer any reason why we should not meet and all the world know it i will go with you to mr bentleys  of course i need not tell you that i refused to inherit anything but i believe i should have consented if i possibly could have done so it seemed so crueli can think of no other wordto have to refuse at such a moment perhaps i have been cruel to him all my lifei dont know as i look back upon everything all our relations i cannot see how i could have been different he wouldnt let me i still believe to have stayed with him would have been a foolish and useless sacrifice but he looked at me so queerly as though he too had had a glimmering of what we might have been to each other after my mother died why is life so hard and why are we always getting glimpses of things when it is too late it is only honest to say that if i had it to do all over again i should have left him as i did  it is hard to write you this but he actually made the condition of my acceptance of the inheritance that i should not marry you i really do not believe i convinced him that you wouldnt have me take the money under any circumstances and the dreadful side of it all was that i had to make it plain to himafter what has happened that my desire to marry you wasnt the main reason of my refusal i had to tell him that even though you had not been in question i couldnt have taken what he wished to give me since it had not been honestly made he asked me why i went on eating the food bought with such money living under his roof but i cannot i will not leave him just yet it is two oclock i cannot write any more tonight    ii  the appointed time was at the november dusk hurried forward nearly an hour by the falling panoply of smoke driven westward over the park by the wet east wind and the rector was conducted with due ceremony to the office upstairs which he had never again expected to enter where that other memorable interview had taken place the curtains were drawn and if the greenshaded lampthe only light in the roomhad been arranged by a master of dramatic effect it could not have better served the setting  in spite of alisons letter holder was unprepared for the ravages a few days had made in the face of eldon parr not that he appeared older the impression was less natural more sinister the skin had drawn sharply over the cheekbones and strangely the eyes both contradicted and harmonized with the transformation of the features these too had changed they were not dead and lustreless but gleamed out of the shadowy caverns into which they had sunk unyielding indomitable in tormenteyes of a spirit rebellious in the fumes  this spirit somehow produced the sensation of its being separated from the body for the movement of the hand inviting holder to seat himself seemed almost automatic  i understand said eldon parr that you wish to marry my daughter  it is true that i am to marry alison holder answered and that i intended later on to come to inform you of the fact  he did not mention the death of preston condolences under the circumstances were utterly out of the question  how do you propose to support her the banker demanded  she is of age and independent of you you will pardon me if i reply that this is a matter between ourselves holder said  i had made up my mind that the day she married you i would not only disinherit her but refuse absolutely to have anything to do with her  if you cannot perceive what she perceives that you have already by your own life cut her off from you absolutely and that seeing her will not mend matters while you remain relentless nothing i can say will convince you holder did not speak rebukingly the utter uselessness of it was never more apparent the man was condemned beyond all present reprieve at least  she left me exclaimed eldon parr bitterly  she left you to save herself  we need not discuss that  i am far from wishing to discuss it holder replied  i do not know why you have asked me to come here mr parr it is clear that your attitude has not changed since our last conversation i tried to make it plain to you why the church could not accept your money your own daughter cannot accept it  there was a time retorted the banker when you did not refuse to accept it  yes holder replied that is true it came to him vividly then that it had been alison herself who had cast the enlightening gleam which revealed his inconsistency but he did not defend himself  i can see nothing in all this mr hodder but a species of insanity said eldon parr and there crept into his tone both querulousness and intense exasperation in the first place you insist upon marrying my daughter when neither she nor you have any dependable means of support she never spared her criticisms of me and you presume to condemn me a man who if he has neglected his children has done so because he has spent too much of his time in serving his community and his country and who hasif i have to say it myselfbuilt up the prosperity which you and others are doing your best to tear down and which can only result in the spread of misery you profess to have a sympathy with the masses but you do not know them as i do they cannot control themselves they require a strong hand but i am not asking for your sympathy i have been misunderstood all my life i have become used to ingratitude even from my children and from the rector of the church for which i have done more than any other man  hodder stared at him in amazement  you really believe that he exclaimed  believe it eldon parr repeated i have had my troubles as heavy bereavements as a man can have all of them even this of my sons death all the ingratitude and lack of sympathy i have experienced he looked deliberately at hodder have not prevented me do not prevent me today from regarding my fortune as a trust you have deprived st johns at least so long as you remain there of some of its benefits and the responsibility for that is on your own head and i am now making arrangements to give to calvary the settlement house which st johns should have had  the words were spoken with such an air of conviction of unconscious plausibility as it were that it was impossible for hodder to doubt the genuineness of the attitude they expressed and yet it was more than his mind could grasp horace bentley richard garvin and the miserable woman of the streets whom he had driven to destroy herself had made absolutely no impression whatever the gifts the benefactions of eldon parr to his fellowmen would go on as before  you ask me why i sent for you the banker went on it was primarily because i hoped to impress upon you the folly of marrying my daughter and in spite of all the injury and injustice you have done me i do not forget that you were once in a relationship to me which has been unique in my life i trusted you i admired you for your ability for your faculty of getting on with men at that time you were wise enough not to attempt to pass comment upon accidents in business affairs which are if deplorable inevitable  eldon parrs voice gave a momentary sign of breaking  i will be frank with you my sons death has led me perhaps weakly to make one more appeal you have ruined your career by these chimerical socialistic notions you have taken up and which you mistake for christianity as a practical man i can tell you positively that st johns will run downhill until you are bankrupt the people who come to you now are in search of a new sensation and when that grows stale they will fall away even if a respectable number remain in your congregation after this excitement and publicity have died down i have reason to know that it is impossible to support a large city church on contributions it has been tried again and again and failed you have borrowed money for the churchs present needs when that is gone i predict that you will find it difficult to get more  this had every indication of being a threat but hodder out of sheer curiosity did not interrupt and it was evident that the banker drew a wrong conclusion from his silence which he may actually have taken for reluctant acquiescence his tone grew more assertive  the church mr hodder cannot do without the substantial business men i have told the bishop so but he is failing so rapidly from old age that i might as well not have wasted my breath he needs an assistant a suffragan or coadjutor and i intend to make it my affair to see that he gets one when i remember him as he was ten years ago i find it hard to believe that he is touched with these fancies to be charitable it is senile decay he seems to forget what i have done for him personally made up his salary paid his expenses at different times and no appeal for the diocese to me was ever in vain but again i will let that go  what i am getting at is this you have made a mess of the affairs of st johns you have made a mess of your life i am willing to give you the credit for sincerity some of my friends might not be you want to marry my daughter and she is apparently determined to marry you if you are sensible and resign from st johns now i will settle on alison a sufficient sum to allow you both to live in comfort and decency the rest of your lives i will not have it said of me that i permitted my daughter to become destitute  after he had finished the rector sat for so long a time that the banker nervously shifted in his chair the clergymans look had a cumulative quality an intensity which seemed to increase as the silence continued there was no anger in it no fanaticism on the contrary the higher sanity of it was disturbing and its extraordinary implicationgradually borne in upon eldon parrwas that he himself were not in his right mind the words when they came were a confirmation of this inference  it is what i feared mr parr he said you are as yet incapable of comprehending  what do you mean asked the banker jerking his hand from the table  the rector shook his head  if this great chastisement with which you have been visited has given you no hint of the true meaning of life nothing i can say will avail if you will not yet listen to the spirit which is trying to make you comprehend how then will you listen to me how am i to open your eyes to the paradox of truth that he who would save his life shall lose it that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god if you will not believe him who said that you will not believe me i can only beg of you strive to understand that your heart many be softened that your suffering soul may be released  it is to be recorded strangely that eldon parr did not grow angry in his turn the burning eyes looked out at hodder curiously as at a being upon whom the vials of wrath were somehow wasted against whom the weapons of power were of no account the fanatic had become a phenomenon which had momentarily stilled passion to arouse interest art thou a master of israel and knowest not these things  do you mean to saysuch was the question that sprang to eldon parrs lipsthat you take the bible literally what is your point of view you speak about the salvation of souls i have heard that kind of talk all my life and it is easy i find for men who have never known the responsibilities of wealth to criticize and advise i regard indiscriminate giving as nothing less than a crime and i have always tried to be painstaking and judicious if i had taken the words you quoted at their face value i should have no wealth to distribute today  i too mr hodder odd as it may seem to you have had my dreamsof doing my share of making this country the best place in the world to live in it has pleased providence to take away my son he was not fitted to carry on my workthat is the waywith dreams i was to have taught him to build up and to give as i have given you think me embittered hard because i seek to do good to interpret the gospel in my own way before this year is out i shall have retired from all active business  i intend to spend the rest of my life in giving away the money i have earnedall of it i do not intend to spare myself and giving will be harder than earning i shall found institutions for research of disease hospitals playgrounds libraries and schools and i shall make the university here one of the best in the country what more may i ask would you have me do  ah replied the rector it is not what i would have you do it is not indeed a question of doing but of seeing  of seeing the banker repeated as i say of using judgment  judgment yes but the judgment which has not yet dawned for you the enlightenment which is the knowledge of gods will worldly wisdom is a rule of thumb many men may acquire the other wisdom the wisdom of the soul is personalthe reward of revelation which springs from desire you ask me what i think you should do i will tell youbut you will not do it you will be powerless to do it unless you see it for yourself unless the time shall come when you are willing to give up everything you have held dear in lifenot your money but your opinions the very judgment and wisdom you value until you have gained the faith which proclaims these worthless until you are ready to receive the kingdom of god as a little child you are not ready now your attitude your very words proclaim your blindness to all that has happened you your determination to carry out so far as it is left to you your own will you may die without seeing  crazy as it all sounded a slight tremor shook eldon parr there was something in the eyes in the powerful features of the clergyman that kept him still that made him listen with a fascination which had he taken cognizance of itwas akin to fear that this man believed it that he would impress it upon others nay had already done so the banker did not then doubt  you speak of giving hodder continued and you have nothing to givenothing you are poorer today than the humblest man who has seen god but you have much you have all to restore without raising his voice the rector had contrived to put a mighty emphasis on the word you speak of the labour of giving but if you seek your god and haply find him you will not rest night or day while you live until you have restored every dollar possible of that which you have wrongfully taken from others  john hodder rose and raised his arm in effective protest against the interruption eldon parr was about to make he bore him down  i know what you are going to say mr parrthat it is not practical that word practical is the barrier between you and your god i tell you that god can make anything practical your conscience the spirit tortures you today but you have not had enough torture you still think to escape easily to keep the sympathy of a world which despises you you are afraid to do what god would have you do you have the opportunity through grace by your example to leave the world better than you found it to do a thing of such magnitude as is given to few men to confess before all that your life has been blind and wicked that is what the spirit is trying to teach you but you fear the ridicule of the other blind men you have not the faith to believe that many eyes would be opened by your act the very shame of such a confession you think is not to be borne  suppose i acknowledge which i do not your preposterous charge how would you propose to do this thing  it is very simple said the rector so far as the actual method of procedure goes you have only to establish a board of men in whom you have confidencea court of claims so to speakto pass upon the validity of every application not from a business standpoint alone but from one of a broad justice and equity and not only that i should have it an important part of the duties of this board to discover for themselves other claimants who may not for various reasons come forward in the case of the consolidated tractions for instances there are doubtless many men like garvin who invested their savings largely on the strength of your name you cannot bring him back to life restore him to his family as he was before you embittered him but it would be a comparatively easy matter to return to his widow with compound interest the sum which he invested  for the sake of argument said eldon parr what would you do with the innumerable impostors who would overwhelm such a board with claims that they had bought and sold stock at a loss and that is only one case i could mention  would it be so dreadful a thing asked hodder to run the risk of making a few mistakes it would not be business you say if you had the desire to do this you would dismiss such an obsession from your brain you would prefer to err on the aide of justice and mercy and no matter how able your board in making restitution you could at best expect to mend only a fraction of the wrongs you have done  i shall waive for the moment my contention that the consolidated tractions company had it succeeded would greatly have benefited the city even if it had been the iniquitous piratical transaction you suggest why should i assume the responsibility for all who were concerned in it  if the grace were given you to do this that question would answer itself the rector replied the awful sense of responsibility which you now lack would overwhelm you  you have made me out a rascal and a charlatan said eldon parr and i have listened patiently in my desire to be fair to learn from your own lips whether there were anything in the extraordinary philosophy you have taken up and which you are pleased to call christianity if you will permit me to be as frank as you have been it appears to me as sheer nonsense and folly and if it were put into practice the world would be reduced at once to chaos and anarchy  there is no danger i am sorry to say of its being put into practice at once said hodder smiting sadly  i hope not answered the banker dryly utopia is a dream in which those who do the rough work of the world cannot afford to indulge and there is one more question you will no doubt deride it as practical but to my mind it is very much to the point you condemn the business practices in which i have engaged all my life as utterly unchristian if you are logical you will admit that no man or woman who owns stock in a modern corporation is according to your definition christian and to use your own phrase can enter the kingdom of god i can tell you as one who knows that there is no corporation in this country which in the struggle to maintain itself is not forced to adopt the natural law of the survival of the fittest which you condemn your own salary while you had it came from men who had made the money in corporations business is business and admits of no sentimental considerations if you can get around that fact i will gladly bow to your genius should you succeed in reestablishing st johns on what you call a free basisand in my opinion you will noteven then the money you would live on and which supported the church would be directly or indirectly derived from corporations  i do not propose to enter into an economics argument with you mr parr but if you tell me that the flagrant practices indulged in by those who organized the consolidated tractions company can be excused under any code of morals any conception of christianity i tell you they cannot what do we see today in your business world boards of directors trusted by stockholders betraying their trust withholding information in order to profit thereby buying and selling stock secretly stock watering selling to the public diluted valuesall kinds of iniquity and abuse of power which i need not go into do you mean to tell me on the plea that business is business and hence a department by itself that deception cheating and stealing are justified and necessary the awakened conscience of the public is condemning you  the time is at hand though neither you nor i may live to see it when the public conscience itself is beginning to perceive thin higher justice hidden from you and you are attempting to mislead when you do not distinguish between the men who for their own gain and power mismanage such corporations as are mismanaged and those who own stock and are misled  the public conscience of which i speak is the leaven of christianity at work and we must be content to work with it to await its fulfilment to realize that no one of us can change the world but can only do his part in making it better the least we can do is to refuse to indulge in practices which jeopardize our own souls to remain poor if we cannot make wealth honestly say what you will the christian government we are approaching will not recognize property because it is gradually becoming clear that the holding of property delays the kingdom at which you scoff giving the man who owns it a power over the body of the man who does not property produces slavery since it compels those who have none to work for those who have  the possession of property or of sufficient property to give one individual an advantage over his fellows is inconsistent with christianity hence it will be done away with but only when enough have been emancipated to carry this into effect hence the saying of our lord about the needles eyethe danger to the soul of him who owns much property  and how about your christian view of the world as a vale of tears eldon parr inquired  so long as humanity exists there will always be tears admitted the rector but it is a false christianity which does not bid us work for our fellowmen to relieve their suffering and make the world brighter it is becoming clear that the way to do this effectively is through communities cooperation through nations and not individuals and this if you like is practicalso practical that the men like you who have gained unexampled privilege fear it more and more the old christian misconception that the world is essentially a bad place and which has served the ends of your privilege is going by forever and the motto of the citizens of the future will be the christian motto i am my brothers keeper the world is a good place because the spirit is continually working in it to make it better and life is good if only we take the right view of itthe revealed view  what you say is all very fine said eldon parr and i have heard it before from the discontented the socialists but it does not take into account the one essential element human nature  on the other hand your scheme of life fails to reckon with the greater factor divine nature hodder replied  when you have lived as long as i have perhaps you will think differently mr hodder eldon parrs voice had abruptly grown metallic as though the full realization had come over him of the severity of the clergymans arraignment the audacity of the man who had ventured to oppose him and momentarily defeated him who had won the allegiance of his own daughter who had dared condemn him as an evildoer and give advice as to his future course he eldon parr who had been used to settle the destinies of men his anger was suddenly at white heat and his voice which he strove to control betrayed it  since you have rejected my offer which was made in kindness since you are bent on ruining my daughters life as well as your own and she has disregarded my wishes i refuse to see either of you no matter to what straits you may come as long as i live that is understood and she leaves this house today never to enter it again it is useless to prolong this conversation i think  quite useless as i feared mr parr do you know why alison is willing to marry me it is because the strength has been given me to oppose you in the name of humanity and this in spite of the fact that her love for you today is greater than it has ever been before it is a part of the heavy punishment you have inflicted on yourself that you cannot believe in her purity you insist on thinking that the time will come when she will return to you for help in senseless anger and pride you are driving her away from you whom you will some day need and in that day should god grant you a relenting heart to make the sign she will come to youbut to give comfort not to receive it and even as you have threatened me i will warn you yet not in anger except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god nor understand the motives of those who would enter into it seek and pray for repentance  infuriated though he was before the commanding yet compassionate bearing of the rector he remained speechless and after a moments pause hodder turned and left the room    iii  when hodder had reached the foot of the stairs alison came out to him the mourning she wore made her seem even taller in the face upturned to his framed in the black veil and paler than he had known it were traces of tears in the eyes a sad yet questioning and trustful smile they gazed at each other an instant before speaking in the luminous ecstasy of perfect communion which shone for them undimmed in the surrounding gloom of tragedy and thus they felt it would always shine of that tragedy of the worlds sin and sorrow they would ever be conscious without darkness there could be no light  i knew she said reading his tidings it would be of no use tell me the worst  if you marry me alison your father refuses to see you again he insists that you leave the house  then why did he wish to see you  it was to make an appeal he thinks of course that i have made a failure of life and that if i marry you i shall drag you down to poverty and disgrace  she raised her head proudly  but he knows that it is i who insist upon marrying you i explained it all to himhow i had asked you of course he did not understand he thinks i suppose that it is simply an infatuation  in spite of the solemnity of the moment hodder smiled down at her touched by the confession  that my dear doesnt relieve me of responsibility i am just as responsible as though i had spoken first instead of you  but john you didnt a sudden fear made her silent  he took her hand and pressed it reassuringly  give you up no alison he answered simply when you came to me god put you in my keeping  she clung to him suddenly in a passion of relief  oh i never could give you up i never would unless you yourself told me to then i would do itfor you but you wont ask me now  he put his arm around her shoulders and the strength of it seemed to calm her  no dear i would make the sacrifice ask you to make it if it would be of any good as you say he does not understand and you couldnt go on living with him and loving me that solution is impossible we can only hope that the time will come when he will realize his need of you and send for you  and did he not ask you anything more  hodder hesitated he had intended to spare her that her divination startled him  i know i know without your telling me he offered you money he consented to ourmarriage if you would give up st johns oh how could he she cried how could he so misjudge and insult you  it is not me he misjudges alison it is mankind it is god that is his terrible misfortune hodder released her tenderly you must see himyou must tell him that when he needs you you will come  i will see him now she said you will wait for me  now he repeated taken aback by her resolution though it was characteristic  yes i will go as i am i can send for my things my father has given me no choice no reprievenot that i ask one i have you dear i will stay with mr bentley tonight and leave for new york tomorrow to do what i have to doand then you will be ready for me  yes he said i shall be ready  he lingered in the wellremembered hall and when at last she came down again her eyes shone bravely through her tears her look answered the question of his own there was no need for speech with not so much as a look behind she left with him her fathers house  outside the mist had become a drizzle and as they went down the walk together beside the driveway she slipped her arm into his pressing close to his side her intuition was perfect the courage of her love sublime  i have you dear she whispered never in my life before have i been rich  alison  it was all he could say but the intensity of his mingled feeling went into the syllables of her name an impulse made them pause and turn and they stood looking back together at the great house which loomed the greater in the thickening darkness its windows edged with glow never as in this moment when the cold rain wet their faces had the thought of its comfort and warmth and luxury struck him so vividly yes and of its terror and loneliness now of the tortured spirit in it that found no rest  oh john she cried if we only could  he understood her such was the perfect quality of their sympathy that she had voiced his thought what were rain and cold the inclemency of the elements to them what the beauty and the warmth of those great empty rooms to eldon parr out of the heaven of their happiness they looked down helpless into the horrors of the luxury of hell  it must be he answered her in gods good time  life is terrible she said think of what he must have done to suffer so to be condemned to this and when i went to him just now he wouldnt even kiss me goodby oh my dear if i hadnt had you to take me what should i have done it never was a home to meto any of us and as i look back now all the troubles began when we moved into it i can only think of it as a huge prison all the more sinister for its costliness  a prison it had once been his own conceit he drew her gently away and they walked together along park street towards the distant arclight at the corner which flung a gleaming band along the wet pavement  perhaps it was because i was too young to know what trouble was when we lived in ransome street she continued but i can remember now how sad my mother was at timesit almost seemed as though she had a premonition alisons voice caught  the car which came roaring through the darkness and which stopped protestingly at their corner was ablaze with electricity almost filled with passengers a young man with a bundle changed his place in order that they might sit together in one of the little benches bordering the aisle opposite them was a laughing claysoiled group of labourers going home from work in front a young couple with a chubby child he stood between his parents facing about gazing in unembarrassed wonder at the dark lady with the veil alisons smile seemed only to increase the solemnity of his adoration and presently he attempted to climb over the barrier between them hodder caught him and the mother turned in alarm recapturing him  you mustnt bother the lady jimmy she said when she had thanked the rector she had dimpled cheeks and sparkling blue eyes but their expression changed as they fell on alisons face expressing something of the wonder of the childs  oh he isnt bothering me alison protested do let him stand  he dont make up to everybody explained the mother and the manner of her speech was such a frank tribute that alison flushed there had been too in the look the quick sympathy for bereavement of the poor  arent they nice alison leaned over and whispered to hodder when the woman had turned back one thing at least i shall never regretthat i shall have to ride the rest of my life in the streetcars i love them that is probably my only qualification dear for a clergymans wife  hodder laughed it strikes me he said as the supreme one  they came at length to mr bentleys door flung open in its usual wide hospitality by sam whatever theist fortunes they would always be welcome here but it turned out in answer to their question that their friend was not at home  no sah said sam bowing and smiling benignantly but he done tole me to say when you and miss alison come hit was to make no diffunce dat you bofe was to have supper heah and ise done cooked ityassah will you kindly step into the libay suh and miss alison dar was a lady crost de city marse hoace saidyassah  john said alison with a questioning smile when they were alone before the fire i believe he went out on purposedont youjust that we might be here alone  he knew we were coming  i wrote him  i think he might be convicted on the evidence hodder agreed but his question remained unasked  alison went up to him he had watched her absorbed and fascinated as with her round arms gracefully lifted in front of the old mirror she had taken off her hat and veil smoothing by a few deft touches the dark crown of her hair the unwonted intimacy of the moment invoking as it did an endless reflection of other similar moments in their future life together was in its effect overwhelming bringing with it at last a conviction not to be denied her colour rose as she faced him her lashes fell  did you seriously think dear that we could have deceived mr bentley then you are not as clever as i thought you as soon as it happened i sent him a note that very night for i felt that he ought to be told first of all  and as usual hodder answered you were right  supper was but a continuation of that delicious sense of intimacy and sam beaming in his starched shirt and swallowtail had an air of presiding over a banquet of state and for that matter none had ever gone away hungry from this table either for meat or love it was indeed a consecrated mealconsecrated for being just there such was the tact which the old darky had acquired from his master that he left the dishes on the shining mahogany board and bowed himself out  when you wants me miss alison des ring de bell  she was seated upright yet charmingly graceful behind the old english coffee service which had been mr bentleys mothers and it was she who by her wonderful selfpossession by the reassuring smile she gave him as she handed him his cup endowed it all with reality  its strange she said but it seems as though i had been doing it all my life instead of just beginning  and you do it as though you had he declared  which is a proof she replied of the superior adaptability of women  he did not deny it he would not then in truth have disputed her wildest statement but presently after they had gone back into the library and were seated side by side before the coals they spoke again of serious things marvelling once more at a happiness which could be tinged and yet unmarred by vicarious sorrow theirs was the soberer profounder happiness of gratitude and wonder too wise to exult but which of itself is exalted the happiness which praises and passes understanding  there are many things i want to say to you john she told him once and they trouble me a little it is only because i am so utterly devoted to you that i wish you to know me as i am i have always had queer views and although much has happened to change me since i have known and loved you i am not quite sure how much those views have changed love she added plays such havoc with ones opinions  she returned his smile but with knitted brows  its really seriousyou neednt laugh and its only fair to you to let you know the kind of a wife you are getting before it is too late for instance i believe in divorce although i cant imagine it for us one never can i suppose in this conditionthats the trouble i have seen so many immoral marriages that i cant think god intends people to live degraded and im sick and tired of the argument that an indissoluble marriage under all conditions is good for society that a man or woman the units of society should violate the divine in themselves for the sake of society is absurd they are merely setting an example to their children to do the same thing which means that society in that respect will never get any better in this love that has come to us we have achieved an ideal which i have never thought to reach oh john im sure you wont misunderstand me when i say that i would rather die than have to lower it  no he answered i shall not misunderstand you  even though it is so difficult to put into words what i mean i dont feel that we really need the marriage service since god has already joined us together and it is not through our own wills somehow but through his divorce would not only be a crime against the spirit it would be an impossibility while we feel as we do but if love should cease then god himself would have divorced us punished us by taking away a priceless gift of which we were not worthy he would have shut the gates of eden in our faces because we had sinned against the spirit it would be quite as true to say whom god has put asunder no man may join together am i hurting you  her hand was on the arm of his chair and the act of laying his own on it was an assurance stronger than words alison sighed  yes i believed you would understand even though i expressed myself badlythat you would help me that you have found a solution i used to regard the marriage service as a compromise as a lowering of the ideal as something mechanical and rational put in the place of the spiritual that it was making the church and therefore god conform to the human notion of what the welfare of society ought to be and it is absurd to promise to love we have no control over our affections they are in gods hands to grant or withdraw  and yet i am surethis is new since i have known youthat if such a great love as ours be withdrawn it would be an unpardonable wrong for either of us to marry again that is what puzzles meconfounds the wisdom i used to have and which in my littleness and pride i thought so sufficient i didnt believe in god but now i feel him through you though i cannot define him and one of many reasons why i could not believe in christ was because i took it for granted that he taught among other things a continuation of the marriage relation after love had ceased to justify it  hodder did not immediately reply nor did alison interrupt his silence but sat with the stillness which at times so marked her personality her eyes trustfully fixed on him the current pulsing between them was unbroken hodders own look as he gazed into the grate was that of a seer  yes he said at length it is by the spirit and not the letter of our lords teaching that we are guided the spirit which we draw from the gospels and everything written down there that does not harmonize with it is the mistaken interpretation of men once the spirit possesses us truly we are no longer troubled and confused by texts  the alpha and omega of christs message is rebirth into the knowledge of that spirit and hence submission to its guidance and that is what paul meant when he said that it freed us from the law you are right alison when you declare it to be a violation of the spirit for a man and woman to live together when love does not exist christ shows us that laws were made for those who are not reborn laws are the rules of society to be followed by those who have not found the inner guidance who live and die in the flesh but the path which those who live under the control of the spirit are to take is opened up to them as they journey if all men and women were reborn we should have the paradox which only the reborn can understand of what is best for the individual being best for society because under the will of the spirit none can transgress upon the rights and happiness of others the spirit would make the laws and rules superfluous  and the great crime of the church for which she is paying so heavy an expiation is that her faith wavered and she forsook the spirit and resumed the law her master had condemned she no longer insisted on that which christ proclaimed as imperative rebirth she became as you say a mechanical organization substituting as the jews had done hard and fast rules for inspiration she abandoned the communion of saints sold her birthright for a mess of pottage for worldly temporal power when she declared that inspiration had ceased with the apostles when she failed to see that inspiration is personal and comes through rebirth for the sake of increasing her membership of dominating the affairs of men she has permitted millions who lived in the law and the flesh who persisted in forcing men to live by the conventions and customs christ repudiated and so stultify themselves to act in christs name the unpardonable sin against the spirit is to doubt its workings to maintain that society will be ruined if it be substituted for the rules and regulations supposed to make for the material comforts of the nations but which in reality suppress and enslave the weak  nevertheless in spite of the church marvellously through the church the germ of our lords message has come down to us and the age in which we live is beginning to realize its purport to condemn the church for her subservient rationalism  let us apply the rule of the spirit to marriage if we examine the ideal we shall see clearly that the marriageservice is but a symbol like baptism it is a worthless and meaningless rite unless the man and the woman have been born again into the spirit released from the law if they are still as st paul would say in the flesh let them have if they wish a civil permit to live together for the spirit can have nothing to do with such an union true to herself the church symbolizes the union of her members the reborn she has nothing to do with laws and conventions which are supposedly for the good of society nor is any union accomplished if those whom she supposedly joins are not reborn if they are the church can neither make it or dissolve it but merely confirm and acknowledge the work of the spirit and every work of the spirit is a sacrament not baptism and communion and marriage only but every act of life  oh john she exclaimed her eyes lighting i can believe that how beautiful a thought i see now what is meant when it is said that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god that is the hourly guidance which is independent of the law and how terrible to think that all the spiritual beauty of such a religion should have been hardened into chapter and verse and regulation you have put into language what i think of mr bentleythat has acts are sacraments it is so simple when you explain it this way and yet i can see why it was said too that we must become as children to understand it  the difficult thing replied holder gravely is to retain it to hold it after we have understood iteven after we have experienced it to continue to live in the spirit demands all our effort all our courage and patience and faith we cannot as you say promise to love for life but the marriage service interpreted means that we will use all our human endeavour with the help of the spirit to remain in what may be called the reborn state since it is by the spirit alone that true marriage is sanctified when the spirit is withdrawn man and woman are indeed divorced  the words a sense of duty belong to moral philosophy and not to religion love annuls them i do not mean to decry them but the reborn are lifted far above them by the subversion of the will by which our will is submitted to gods it is so we develop and become as it were god and hence those who are not married in the spirit are not spiritually man and wife no consecration has taken place church or no church if rebirth occurs later to either or both the individual consciencewhich is the spirit must decide whether as regards each other they are bound or free and we must stand or fall by that men object that this is opening the door to individualism what they fail to see is that the door is open wide today and can never again be closed that the law of the naturally born is losing its power that the wornout authority of the church is being set at naught because that authority was devised by man to keep in check those who were not reborn the only check to material individualism is spiritual individualism and the reborn man or woman cannot act to the detriment of his fellowcreatures  in her turn she was silent still gazing at him her breath coming deeply for she was greatly moved  yes she said simply i can see now why divorce between us would be a sacrilege i felt it john but i couldnt reason it out it is the consecration of the spirit that justifies the union of the flesh for the spirit in that sense does not deny the flesh  that would be to deny life hodder replied  i see why was it all so hidden the exclamation was not addressed to himshe was staring pensively into the fire but presently with a swift movement she turned to him  you will preach this johnall of it  it was not a question but the cry of a new and wider vision of his task her face was transfigured and her voice low and vibrating expressed no doubts oh i am proud of you and if they put you out and persecute you i shall always be proud i shall never know why it was given me to have this and to live do you remember saying to me once that faith comes to us in some human form we love you are my faith and faith in you is my faith in humanity and faith in god  ere he could speak of his own faith in her in mankind by grace of which he had been lifted from the abyss there came a knock at the door and even as they answered it a deeper knowledge filtered into their hearts  horace bentley stood before them and the light from his face that shone down upon them was their benediction     afterword  although these pages have been published serially it is with a feeling of reluctance that i send them out into the world for better or worse between the covers of a book they have been written with reverence and the reading of the proofs has brought back to me vividly the long winters in which i pondered over the matter they contain and wrote and rewrote the chapters  i had not thought to add anything to them by way of an afterword nothing could be farther from my mind than to pose as a theologian and were it not for one or two of the letters i have received i should have supposed that no reader could have thought of making the accusation that i presumed to speak for any one except myself in a book of this kind the setting forth of a personal view of religion is not only unavoidable but necessary since if i wrote sincerely mr hodders solution must coincide with my ownso far as i have been able to work one out such as it is it represents many years of experience and reflection and i can only crave the leniency of any trained theologian who may happen to peruse it  no one realizes perhaps the incompleteness of the religious interpretations here presented more keenly than i more significant more vital elements of the truth are the rewards of a mind which searches and craves especially in these days when the fruit of so many able minds lies on the shelves of library and bookshop since the last chapter was written many suggestions have come to me which i should like to have the time to develop for this volume but the nature of these elements is positivei can think of nothing i should care to subtract  here then so far as what may be called religious doctrine is concerned is merely a personal solution we are in an age when the truth is being worked out through many minds a process which seems to me both christian and democratic yet a gentleman has so far misunderstood this that he has already accused me in a newspaper of committing all the heresies condemned by the council of chalcedonand more  i have no doubt that he is right my consolation must be that i have as companyin some of my heresies at leasta goodly array of gentlemen who wear the cloth of the orthodox churches whose doctrines he accuses me of denying the published writings of these clergymen are accessible to all the same critic declares that my interpretations are without authority this depends of course on ones view of authority but his accusation is true equally against many men whoif my observation be correctare doing an incalculable service for religion by giving to the world their own personal solutions interpreting christianity in terms of modern thought no doubt these too are offending the champions of the council of chalcedon  and does the gentleman may i ask ever read the pages of the hibbert journal  finally i have to meet a more serious charge that mr hodder remains in the church because of the dread of parting with the old strong anchorage the fear of anathema and criticism the thought of sorrowing and disapproving friends or perhaps he infers that it is i who keep mr hodder in the church for these personal reasons alas the concern of society is now for those upon whom the church has lost her hold who are seeking for a solution they can accept and the danger today is not from the side of heresy the rector of st johns as a result of his struggle gained what i believe to be a higher and surer faith than that which he formerly held and in addition to this the realization of the presence of a condition which was paralyzing the churchs influence  one thing i had hoped to make clear that if mr hodder had left the church under these circumstances he would have made the great refusal the situation which he faced demanded something of the sublime courage of his master  lastly may i be permitted to add that it is far from my intention to reflect upon any particular denomination the instance which i have taken is perhaps a pronounced rather than a particular case of the problem to which i have referred and which is causing the gravest concern to thoughtful clergymen and laymen of all denominations   winston churchill  santa barbara california march 311913           etext editors bookmarks       absurd
