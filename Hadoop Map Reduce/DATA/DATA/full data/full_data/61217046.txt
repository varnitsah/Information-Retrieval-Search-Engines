our mysterious stranger                 194    an oddlooking young man                                           201    he turned to me with an inane smile                                205    nothing seemed to put the man down                                 210    yah dont catch me going so fah from newmarket                     214    wasnt fra diavolo also a composah

262    i was a grotesque failure                                          265    the jury smiled                                                    270    the question requires no answer he said

stare at me                               291    i beckoned a porter                                                293    you cant get out here he said crustily                          296    we

          306    never he answered never                                         308    we shall have him in our power                                     312    victory                                                           316    you wished to see me sir                                         320    well this is a fair knockout he ejaculated                      325    harold your wife has bested me                                    329     i  the adventure of the cantankerous old lady   on the day when i found myself with twopence in my pocket i naturally made up my mind to go round the world  it was my stepfathers death that drove me to it i had never seen my stepfather indeed i never even thought of him as anything more than colonel wattsmorgan i owed him nothing except my poverty he married my dear mother when i was a girl at school in switzerland and he proceeded to spend her little fortune left at her sole disposal by my fathers will in paying his gambling debts after that he carried my dear mother off to burma and when he and the climate between them had succeeded in killing her he made up for his appropriations at the cheapest rate by allowing me just enough to send me to girton so when the colonel died in the year i was leaving college i did not think it necessary to go into mourning for him especially as he chose the precise moment when my allowance was due and bequeathed me nothing but his consolidated liabilities  of course you will teach said elsie petheridge when i explained my affairs to her there is a good demand just now for highschool teachers  i looked at her aghast teach elsie i cried i had come up to town to settle her in at her unfurnished lodgings did you say teach thats just like you dear good schoolmistresses you go to cambridge and get examined till the heart and life have been examined out of you then you say to yourselves at the end of it all let me see what am i good for now im just about fit to go away and examine other people thats what our principal would call a vicious circleif one could ever admit there was anything vicious at all about you dear no elsie i do not propose to teach nature did not cut me out for a highschool teacher i couldnt swallow a poker if i tried for weeks pokers dont agree with me between ourselves i am a bit of a rebel  you are brownie she answered pausing in her papering with her sleeves rolled upthey called me brownie partly because of my dark complexion but partly because they could never understand me we all knew that long ago  i laid down the pastebrush and mused  do you remember elsie i said staring hard at the paperboard when i first went to girton how all you girls wore your hair quite straight in neat smooth coils plaited up at the back about the size of a pancake and how of a sudden i burst in upon you like a tropical hurricane and demoralised you and how after three days of me some of the dear innocents began with awe to cut themselves artless fringes while others went out in fear and trembling and surreptitiously purchased a pair of curlingtongs i was a bombshell in your midst in those days why you yourself were almost afraid at first to speak to me  you see you had a bicycle elsie put in smoothing the halfpapered wall and in those days of course ladies didnt bicycle you must admit brownie dear it was a startling innovation you terrified us so and yet after all there isnt much harm in you  i hope not i said devoutly i was before my time that was all at present even a curates wife may blamelessly bicycle  but if you dont teach elsie went on gazing at me with those wondering big blue eyes of hers whatever will you do brownie her horizon was bounded by the scholastic circle  i havent the faintest idea i answered continuing to paste only as i cant trespass upon your elegant hospitality for life whatever i mean to do i must begin doing this morning when weve finished the papering i couldnt teach teaching like mauve is the refuge of the incompetent and i dont if possible want to sell bonnets  as a milliners girl elsie asked with a face of red horror  as a milliners girl why not tis an honest calling earls daughters do it now but you neednt look so shocked i tell you just at present i am not contemplating it  then what do you contemplate  i paused and reflected i am here in london i answered gazing rapt at the ceiling london whose streets are paved with goldthough it looks at first sight like muddy flagstones london the greatest and richest city in the world where an adventurous soul ought surely to find some loophole for an adventure that piece is hung crooked dear we shall have to take it down again i devise a plan therefore i submit myself to fate or if you prefer it i leave my future in the hands of providence i shall stroll out this morning as soon as ive cleaned myself and embrace the first stray enterprise that offers our bagdad teems with enchanted carpets let one but float my way and hi presto i seize it i go where glory or a modest competence waits me i snatch at the first offer the first hint of an opening  elsie stared at me more aghast and more puzzled than ever but how she asked where when you are so strange what will you do to find one  put on my hat and walk out i answered nothing could be simpler this city bursts with enterprises and surprises strangers from east and west hurry through it in all directions omnibuses traverse it from end to endeven i am told to islington and putney within folk sit face to face who never saw one another before in their lives and who may never see one another again or on the contrary may pass the rest of their days together  i had a lovely harangue all pat in my head in much the same strain on the infinite possibilities of entertaining angels unawares in cabs on the underground in the aërated bread shops but elsies widening eyes of horror pulled me up short like a hansom in piccadilly when the inexorable upturned hand of the policeman checks it oh brownie she cried drawing back you dont mean to tell me youre going to ask the first young man you meet in an omnibus to marry you  illustration i am going out simply in search of adventure  i shrieked with laughter elsie i cried kissing her dear yellow little head you are impayable you never will learn what i mean you dont understand the language no no i am going out simply in search of adventure what adventure may come i have not at this moment the faintest conception the fun lies in the search the uncertainty the tossup of it what is the good of being pennilesswith the trifling exception of twopenceunless you are prepared to accept your position in the spirit of a masked ball at covent garden  i have never been to one elsie put in  gracious heavens neither have i what on earth do you take me for but i mean to see where fate will lead me  i may go with you elsie pleaded  certainly not my child i answeredshe was three years older than i so i had the right to patronise her that would spoil all your dear little face would be quite enough to scare away a timid adventure she knew what i meant it was gentle and pensive but it lacked initiative  so when we had finished that wall i popped on my best hat and popped out by myself into kensington gardens  i am told i ought to have been terribly alarmed at the straits in which i found myselfa girl of twentyone alone in the world and only twopence short of penniless without a friend to protect a relation to counsel her i dont count aunt susan who lurked in ladylike indigence at blackheath and whose counsel like her tracts was given away too profusely to everybody to allow of ones placing any very high value upon it but as a matter of fact i must admit i was not in the least alarmed nature had endowed me with a profusion of crisp black hair and plenty of high spirits if my eyes had been like elsiesthat liquid blue which looks out upon life with mingled pity and amazementi might have felt as a girl ought to feel under such conditions but having large dark eyes with a bit of a twinkle in them and being as well able to pilot a bicycle as any girl of my acquaintance i have inherited or acquired an outlook on the world which distinctly leans rather towards cheeriness than despondency i croak with difficulty so i accepted my plight as an amusing experience affording full scope for the congenial exercise of courage and ingenuity  how boundless are the opportunities of kensington gardensthe round pond the winding serpentine the mysterious seclusion of the dutch brick palace genii swarm there one jostles possibilities it is a land of romance bounded on the north by the abyss of bayswater and on the south by the amphitheatre of the albert hall but for a centre of adventure i choose the long walk it beckoned me somewhat as the northwest passage beckoned my seafaring ancestorsthe buccaneering mariners of elizabethan devon i sat down on a chair at the foot of an old elm with a poetic hollow prosaically filled by a utilitarian plate of galvanised iron two ancient ladies were seated on the other side alreadyvery grandlooking dames with the haughty and exclusive ugliness of the english aristocracy in its later stages for frank hideousness commend me to the noble dowager they were talking confidentially as i sat down the trifling episode of my approach did not suffice to stem the full stream of their conversation the great ignore the intrusion of their inferiors  illustration oui madame merci beaucoup madame  yes its a terrible nuisance the eldest and ugliest of the two observedshe was a highborn lady with a distinctly cantankerous cast of countenance she had a roman nose and her skin was wrinkled like a wilted apple she wore coffeecoloured pointlace in her bonnet with a complexion to match but what could i do my dear i simply couldnt put up with such insolence so i looked her straight back in the faceoh she quailed i can tell you and i said to her in my iciest voiceyou know how icy i can be when occasion demands itthe second old lady nodded an ungrudging assent as if perfectly prepared to admit her friends rare gift of icinessi said to her célestine you can take your months wages and half an hour to get out of this house and she dropped me a deep reverence and she answered oui madame merci beaucoup madame je ne desire pas mieux madame and out she flounced so there was the end of it  still you go to schlangenbad on monday  thats the point on monday if it werent for the journey i should have been glad enough to be rid of the minx im glad as it is indeed for a more insolent upstanding independent answeryoubackagain young woman with a sneer of her own i never saw ameliabut i must get to schlangenbad now there the difficulty comes in on the one hand if i engage a maid in london i have the choice of two evils either i must take a trapesing english girland i know by experience that an english girl on the continent is a vast deal worse than no maid at all you have to wait upon her instead of her waiting upon you she gets seasick on the crossing and when she reaches france or germany she hates the meals and she detests the hotel servants and she cant speak the language so that shes always calling you in to interpret for her in her private differences with the filledechambre and the landlord or else i must pick up a french maid in london and i know equally by experience that the french maids one engages in london are invariably dishonestmore dishonest than the rest even theyve come here because they have no character to speak of elsewhere and they think you arent likely to write and enquire of their last mistress in toulouse or st petersburg then again on the other hand i cant wait to get a gretchen an unsophisticated little gretchen of the taunus at schlangenbad i suppose there are unsophisticated girls in germany stillmade in germanythey dont make em any longer in england im surelike everything else the trade in rustic innocence has been driven from the country i cant wait to get a gretchen as i should like to do of course because i simply darent undertake to cross the channel alone and go all that long journey by ostend or calais brussels and cologne to schlangenbad  you could get a temporary maid her friend suggested in a lull of the tornado  the cantankerous old lady flared up yes and have my jewelcase stolen or find she was an english girl without one word of german or nurse her on the boat when i want to give my undivided attention to my own misfortunes no amelia i call it positively unkind of you to suggest such a thing youre so unsympathetic i put my foot down there i will not take any temporary person  i saw my chance this was a delightful idea why not start for schlangenbad with the cantankerous old lady  of course i had not the slightest intention of taking a ladysmaids place for a permanency nor even if it comes to that as a passing expedient but if i wanted to go round the world how could i do better than set out by the rhine country the rhine leads you on to the danube the danube to the black sea the black sea to asia and so by way of india china and japan you reach the pacific and san francisco whence one returns quite easily by new york and the white star liners i began to feel like a globetrotter already the cantankerous old lady was the thin end of the wedgethe first rung of the ladder i proceeded to put my foot on it  illustration excuse me i said but i think i see a way out of your difficulty  i leaned around the corner of the tree and spoke excuse me i said in my suavest voice but i think i see a way out of your difficulty  my first impression was that the cantankerous old lady would go off in a fit of apoplexy she grew purple in the face with indignation and astonishment that a casual outsider should venture to address her so much so indeed that for a second i almost regretted my wellmeant interposition then she scanned me up and down as if i were a girl in a mantle shop and she contemplated buying either me or the mantle at last catching my eye she thought better of it and burst out laughing  what do you mean by this eavesdropping she asked  i flushed up in turn this is a public place i replied with dignity and you spoke in a tone which was hardly designed for the strictest privacy if you dont wish to be overheard you oughtnt to shout besides i desired to do you a service  the cantankerous old lady regarded me once more from head to foot i did not quail then she turned to her companion the girl has spirit she remarked in an encouraging tone as if she were discussing some absent person upon my word amelia i rather like the look of her well my good woman what do you want to suggest to me  merely this i replied bridling up and crushing her i am a girton girl an officers daughter no more a good woman than most others of my class and i have nothing in particular to do for the moment i dont object to going to schlangenbad i would convoy you over as companion or ladyhelp or anything else you choose to call it i would remain with you there for a week till you could arrange with your gretchen presumably unsophisticated and then i would leave you salary is unimportant my fare suffices i accept the chance as a cheap opportunity of attaining schlangenbad  the yellowfaced old lady put up her longhandled tortoiseshell eyeglasses and inspected me all over again well i declare she murmured what are girls coming to i wonder girton you say girton that place at cambridge you speak greek of course but how about german  like a native i answered with cheerful promptitude i was at school in canton berne it is a mother tongue to me  no no the old lady went on fixing her keen small eyes on my mouth those little lips could never frame themselves to schlecht or wunderschön they were not cut out for it  pardon me i answered in german what i say that i mean the nevertobeforgotten music of the fatherlandsspeech has on my infant ear from the firstbeginning impressed itself  the old lady laughed aloud  dont jabber it to me child she cried i hate the lingo its the one tongue on earth that even a pretty girls lips fail to render attractive you yourself make faces over it whats your name young woman  lois cayley  lois what a name i never heard of any lois in my life before except timothys grandmother youre not anybodys grandmother are you  not to my knowledge i answered gravely  she burst out laughing again  well youll do i think she said catching my arm that big mill down yonder hasnt

to have my own way if you come with me to schlangenbad you must do as i tell you  i think i could manage itfor a week i answered demurely  she smiled at my audacity we passed on to terms they were quite satisfactory she wanted no references do i look like a woman who cares about a reference what are called characters are usually essays in how not to say it you take my fancy thats the point and poor tom cayley but mind i will not be contradicted  i will not contradict your wildest misstatement i answered smiling  and your name and address i asked after we had settled preliminaries  a faint red spot rose quaintly in the centre of the cantankerous old ladys sallow cheek my dear she murmured my name is the one thing on earth im really ashamed of my parents chose to inflict upon me the most odious label that human ingenuity ever devised for a christian soul and ive not had courage enough to burst out and change it  a gleam of intuition flashed across me you dont mean to say i exclaimed that youre called georgina  the cantankerous old lady gripped my arm hard what an unusually intelligent girl she broke in how on earth did you guess it is georgina  fellowfeeling i answered so is mine georgina lois but as i quite agree with you as to the atrocity of such conduct i have suppressed the georgina it ought to be made penal to send innocent girls into the world so burdened  my opinion to a t you are really an exceptionally sensible young woman theres my name and address i start on monday  i glanced at her card the very copperplate was noisy lady georgina fawley 49 fortescue crescent w  it had taken us twenty minutes to arrange our protocols as i walked off well pleased lady georginas friend ran after me quickly  you must take care she said in a warning voice youve caught a tartar  so i suspect i answered but a week in tartary will be at least an experience  she has an awful temper  thats nothing so have i appalling i assure you and if it comes to blows im bigger and younger and stronger than she is  well i wish you well out of it  thank you it is kind of you to give me this warning but i think i can take care of myself i come you see of a military family  i nodded my thanks and strolled back to elsies dear little elsie was in transports of surprise when i related my adventure  will you really go and what will you do my dear when you get there  i havent a notion i answered thats where the fun comes in but anyhow i shall have got there  oh brownie you might starve  and i might starve in london in either place i have only two hands and one head to help me  but then here you are among friends you might stop with me for ever  i kissed her fluffy forehead you good generous little elsie i cried i wont stop here one moment after i have finished the painting and papering i came here to help you i couldnt go on eating your hardearned bread and doing nothing i know how sweet you are but the last thing i want is to add to your burdens now let us roll up our sleeves again and hurry on with the dado  but brownie youll want to be getting your own things ready remember youre off to germany on monday  i shrugged my shoulders tis a foreign trick i picked up in switzerland what have i got to get ready i asked i cant go out and buy a complete summer outfit in bond street for twopence now dont look at me like that be practical elsie and let me help you paint the dado for unless i helped her poor elsie could never have finished it herself i cut out half her clothes for her her own ideas were almost entirely limited to differential calculus and cutting out a blouse by differential calculus is weary uphill work for a highschool teacher  by monday i had papered and furnished the rooms and was ready to start on my voyage of exploration i met the cantankerous old lady at charing cross by appointment and proceeded to take charge of her luggage and tickets  oh my how fussy she was you will drop that basket i hope you have got through tickets viâ malines not by brussels i wont go by brussels you have to change there now mind you notice how much the luggage weighs in english pounds and make the man at the office give you a note of it to check those horrid belgian porters theyll charge you for double the weight unless you reduce it at once to kilogrammes i know their ways foreigners have no consciences they just go to the priest and confess you know and wipe it all out and start fresh again on a career of crime next morning im sure i dont know why i ever go abroad the only country in the world fit to live in is england no mosquitoes no passports nogoodness gracious child dont let that odious man bang about my hatbox have you no immortal soul porter that you crush other peoples property as if it was blackbeetles no i will not let you take this lois this is my jewelboxit contains all that remains of the fawley family jewels i positively decline to appear at schlangenbad without a diamond to my back this never leaves my hands its hard enough nowadays to keep body and skirt together have you secured that coupé at ostend  illustration a most urbane and obliging continental gentleman  we got into our firstclass carriage it was clean and comfortable but the cantankerous old lady made the porter mop the floor and fidgeted and worried till we slid out of the station fortunately the only other occupant of the compartment was a most urbane and obliging continental gentlemani say continental because i couldnt quite make out whether he was french german or austrianwho was anxious in every way to meet lady georginas wishes did madame desire to have the window open oh certainly with pleasure the day was so sultry closed a little more parfaitement there was a current of air il faut ladmettre madame would prefer the corner no then perhaps she would like this valise for a footstool permettezjust thus a cold draught runs so often along the floor in railway carriages this is kent that we traverse ah the garden of england as a diplomat he knew every nook of europe and he echoed the mot he had accidentally heard drop from madames lips on the platform no country in the world so delightful as england  monsieur is attached to the embassy in london lady georgina inquired growing affable  he twirled his grey moustache a waxed moustache of great distinction no madame i have quitted the diplomatic service i inhabit london now pour mon agrément some of my compatriots call it triste for me i find it the most fascinating capital in europe what gaiety what movement what poetry what mystery  if mystery means fog it challenges the world i interposed  he gazed at me with fixed eyes yes mademoiselle he answered in quite a different and markedly chilly voice whatever your great country attemptswere it only a fogit achieves consummately  i have quick intuitions i felt the foreign gentleman took an instinctive dislike to me  to make up for it he talked much and with animation to lady georgina they ferreted out friends in common and were as much surprised at it as people always are at that inevitable experience  ah yes madame i recollect him well in vienna i was there at the time attached to our legation he was a charming man you read his masterly paper on the central problem of the dual empire  you were in vienna then the cantankerous old lady mused back lois my child dont stareshe had covenanted from the first to call me lois as my fathers daughter and i confess i preferred it to being miss cayleyd we must surely have met dare i ask your name monsieur  i could see the foreign gentleman was delighted at this turn he had played for it and carried his point he meant her to ask him he had a card in his pocket conveniently close and he handed it across to her she read it and passed it on m le comte de larochesurloiret  oh i remember your name well the cantankerous old lady broke in i think you knew my husband sir evelyn fawley and my father lord kynaston  the count looked profoundly surprised and delighted what you are then lady georgina fawley he cried striking an attitude indeed miladi your admirable husband was one of the very first to exert his influence in my favour at vienna do i recall him ce cher sir evelyn if i recall him what a fortunate rencounter i must have seen you some years ago at vienna miladi though i had not then the great pleasure of making your acquaintance but your face had impressed itself on my subconscious self i did not learn till later that the esoteric doctrine of the subconscious self was lady georginas favourite hobby the moment chance led me to this carriage this morning i said to myself that face those features so vivid so striking i have seen them somewhere with what do i connect them in the recesses of my memory a highborn family genius rank the diplomatic service some unnameable charm some faint touch of eccentricity ha i have it vienna a carriage with footmen in red livery a noble presence a crowd of witspoets artists politicianspressing eagerly round the landau that was my mental picture as i sat and confronted you i understand it all now this is lady georgina fawley  i thought the cantankerous old lady who was a shrewd person in her way must surely see through this obvious patter but i had underestimated the average human capacity for swallowing flattery instead of dismissing his fulsome nonsense with a contemptuous smile lady georgina perked herself up with a conscious air of coquetry and asked for more yes they were delightful days in vienna she said simpering i was young then count i enjoyed life with a zest  illustration persons of miladis temperament are always young  persons of miladis temperament are always young the count retorted glibly leaning forward and gazing at her growing old is a foolish habit of the stupid and the vacant men and women of esprit are never older one learns as one goes on in life to admire not the obvious beauty of mere youth and healthhe glanced across at me disdainfullybut the profounder beauty of deep character in a facethat calm and serene beauty which is imprinted on the brow by experience of the emotions  i have had my moments lady georgina murmured with her head on one side  i believe it miladi the count answered and ogled her  thenceforward to dover they talked together with ceaseless animation the cantankerous old lady was capital company she had a tang in her tongue and in the course of ninety minutes she had flayed alive the greater part of london society with keen wit and sprightliness i laughed against my will at her illtempered sallies they were too funny not to amuse in spite of their vitriol as for the count he was charmed he talked well himself too and between them i almost forgot the time till we arrived at dover  it was a very rough passage the count helped us to carry our nineteen handpackages and four rugs on board but i noticed that fascinated as she was with him lady georgina resisted his ingenious efforts to gain possession of her precious jewelcase as she descended the gangway she clung to it like grim death even in the chops of the channel fortunately i am a good sailor and when lady georginas sallow cheeks began to grow pale i was steady enough to supply her with her shawl and her smellingbottle she fidgeted and worried the whole way over she would be treated like a vertebrate animal those horrid belgians had no right to stick their deckchairs just in front of her the impertinence of the hussies with the bright red haira grocers daughters she felt surein venturing to come and sit on the same bench with herthe bench for ladies only under the lee of the funnel ladies only indeed did the baggages pretend they considered themselves ladies oh that placid old gentleman in the episcopal gaiters was their father was he well a bishop should bring up his daughters better having his children in subjection with all gravity instead of whichlois my smellingsalts this was a beastly boat such an odour of machinery they had no decent boats nowadays with all our boasted improvements she could remember well when the crosschannel service was much better conducted than it was at present but that was before we had compulsory education the working classes were driving trade out of the country and the consequence was we couldnt build a boat which didnt reek like an oilshop even the sailors on board were frenchjabbering idiots not an honest british jacktar among the lot of them though the stewards were english and very inferior cockney english at that with their offhand ways and their school board airs and graces shed school board them if they were her servants shed show them the sort of respect that was due to people of birth and education but the children of the lower classes never learnt their catechism nowadays they were too much occupied with literatoor jography and freeand drawrin happily for my nerves a good lurch to leeward put a stop for a while to the course of her thoughts on the present distresses  at ostend the count made a second gallant attempt to capture the jewelcase which lady georgina automatically repulsed she had a fixed habit i believe of sticking fast to that jewelcase for she was too overpowered by the counts urbanity i feel sure to suspect for a moment his honesty of purpose but whenever she travelled i fancy she clung to her case as if her life depended upon it it contained the whole of her valuable diamonds  we had twenty minutes for refreshments at ostend during which interval my old lady declared with warmth that i must look after her registered luggage though as it was booked through to cologne i could not even see it till we crossed the german frontier for the belgian douaniers seal up the van as soon as the through baggage for germany is unloaded to satisfy her however i went through the formality of pretending to inspect it and rendered myself hateful to the head of the douane by asking various foolish and inept questions on which lady georgina insisted when i had finished this silly and uncongenial taskfor i am not by nature fussy and it is hard to assume fussiness as another persons proxyi returned to our coupé which i had arranged for in london to my great amazement i found the cantankerous old lady and the egregious count comfortably seated there monsieur has been good enough to accept a place in our carriage she observed as i entered  he bowed and smiled or rather madame has been so kind as to offer me one he corrected  would you like some lunch lady georgina i asked in my chilliest voice there are ten minutes to spare and the buffet is excellent  an admirable inspiration the count murmured permit me to escort you miladi  you will come lois lady georgina asked  no thank you i answered for i had an idea i am a capital sailor but the sea takes away my appetite  then youll keep our places she said turning to me i hope you wont allow them to stick in any horrid foreigners they will try to force them on you unless you insist i know their tricky ways you have the tickets i trust and the bulletin for the coupé well mind you dont lose the paper for the registered luggage dont let those dreadful porters touch my cloaks and if anybody attempts to get in be sure you stand in front of the door as they mount to prevent them  the count handed her out he was all high courtly politeness as lady georgina descended he made yet another dexterous effort to relieve her of the jewelcase i dont think she noticed it but automatically once more she waved him aside then she turned to me here my dear she said handing it to me youd better take care of it if i lay it down in the buffet while i am eating my soup some rogue may run away with it but mind dont let it out of your hands on any account hold it so on your knee and for heavens sake dont part with it  illustration that succeeds the shabbylooking man muttered  by this time my suspicions of the count were profound from the first i had doubted him he was so blandly plausible but as we landed at ostend i had accidentally overheard a low whispered conversation when he passed a shabbylooking man who had travelled in a secondclass carriage from london that succeeds the shabbylooking man had muttered under his breath in french as the haughty nobleman with the waxed moustache brushed by him  that succeeds admirably the count had answered in the same soft undertone Ça réussit à merveille  i understood him to mean that he had prospered in his attempt to impose on lady georgina  they had been gone five minutes at the buffet when the count came back hurriedly to the door of the coupé with a nonchalant air oh mademoiselle he said in an offhand tone lady georgina has sent me to fetch her jewelcase  i gripped it hard with both hands pardon m le comte i answered lady georgina intrusted it to my safe keeping and without her leave i cannot give it up to any one  you mistrust me he cried looking black you doubt my honour you doubt my word when i say that miladi has sent me  du tout i answered calmly but i have lady georginas orders to stick to this case and till lady georgina returns i stick to it  he murmured some indignant remark below his breath and walked off the shabbylooking passenger was pacing up and down the platform outside in a badlymade dustcoat as they passed their lips moved the counts seemed to mutter cest un coup manqué  however he did not desist even so i saw he meant to go on with his dangerous little game he returned to the buffet and rejoined lady georgina i felt sure it would be useless to warn her so completely had the count succeeded in gulling her but i took my own steps i examined the jewelcase closely it had a leather outer covering within was a strong steel box with stout bands of metal to bind it i took my cue at once and acted for the best on my own responsibility  when lady georgina and the count returned they were like old friends together the quails in aspic and the sparkling hock had evidently opened their hearts to one another as far as malines they laughed and talked without ceasing lady georgina was now in her finest vein of spleen her acid wit grew sharper and more caustic each moment not a reputation in europe had a rag left to cover it as we steamed in beneath the huge iron roof of the main central junction  i had observed all the way from ostend that the count had been anxious lest we might have to give up our coupé at malines i assured him more than once that his fears were groundless for i had arranged at charing cross that it should run right through to the german frontier but he waved me aside with one lordly hand i had not told lady georgina of his vain attempt to take possession of her jewelcase and the bare fact of my silence made him increasingly suspicious of me  pardon me mademoiselle he said coldly you do not understand these lines as well as i do nothing is more common than for those rascals of railway clerks to sell one a place in a coupé or a wagonlit and then never reserve it or turn one out half way it is very possible miladi may have to descend at malines  lady georgina bore him out by a large variety of selected stories concerning the various atrocities of the rival companies which had stolen her luggage on her way to italy as for trains de luxe they were dens of robbers  so when we reached malines just to satisfy lady georgina i put out my head and inquired of a porter as i anticipated he replied that there was no change we went through to verviers  the count however was still unsatisfied he descended and made some remarks a little farther down the platform to an official in the goldbanded cap of a chefdegare or some such functionary then he returned to us all fuming it is as i said he exclaimed flinging open the door these rogues have deceived us the coupé goes no farther you must dismount at once miladi and take the train just opposite  i felt sure he was wrong and i ventured to say so but lady georgina cried nonsense child the chefdegare must know get out at once bring my bag and the rugs mind that cloak dont forget the sandwichtin thanks count will you kindly take charge of my umbrellas hurry up lois hurry up the train is just starting  i scrambled after her with my fourteen bundles keeping a quiet eye meanwhile on the jewelcase  we took our seats in the opposite train which i noticed was marked amsterdam bruxelles paris but i said nothing the count jumped in jumped about arranged our parcels jumped out again he spoke to a porter then he rushed back excitedly mille pardons miladi he cried i find the chefdegare has cruelly deceived me you were right after all mademoiselle we must return to the coupé  with singular magnanimity i refrained from saying i told you so  lady georgina very flustered and hot by this time tumbled out once more and bolted back to the coupé both trains were just starting in her hurry at last she let the count take possession of her jewelcase i rather fancy that as he passed one window he handed it in to the shabbylooking passenger but i am not certain at any rate when we were comfortably seated in our own compartment once more and he stood on the footboard just about to enter of a sudden he made an unexpected dash back and flung himself wildly into a paris carriage at the selfsame moment with a piercing shriek both trains started  lady georgina threw up her hands in a frenzy of horror my diamonds she cried aloud oh lois my diamonds  dont distress yourself i answered holding her back for i verily believe she would have leapt from the train he has only taken the outer shell with the sandwichcase inside it here is the steel box and i produced it triumphantly  she seized it overjoyed how did this happen she cried hugging it for she loved those diamonds  very simply i answered i saw the man was a rogue and that he had a confederate with him in another carriage so while you were gone to the buffet at ostend i slipped the box out of the case and put in the sandwichtin that he might carry it off and we might have proofs against him all you have to do now is to inform the conductor who will telegraph to stop the train to paris i spoke to him about that at ostend so that everything is ready  she positively hugged me my dear she cried you are the cleverest little woman i ever met in my life who on earth could have suspected such a polished gentleman why youre worth your weight in gold what the dickens shall i do without you at schlangenbad     ii  the adventure of the supercilious attachÉ   the count must have been an adept in the gentle art of quickchange disguise for though we telegraphed full particulars of his appearance from louvain the next station nobody in the least resembling either him or his accomplice the shabbylooking man could be unearthed in the paris train when it drew up at brussels its first stoppingplace they must have transformed themselves meanwhile into two different persons indeed from the outset i had suspected his moustachetwas so very distinguished  when we reached cologne the cantankerous old lady overwhelmed me with the warmth of her thanks and praises nay more after breakfast next morning before we set out by slow train for schlangenbad she burst like a tornado into my bedroom at the cologne hotel with a cheque for twenty guineas drawn in my favour thats for you my dear she said handing it to me and looking really quite gracious  i glanced at the piece of paper and felt my face glow crimson oh lady georgina i cried you misunderstand you forget that i am a lady  nonsense child nonsense your courage and promptitude were worth ten times that sum she exclaimed positively slipping her arm round my neck it was your courage i particularly admired lois because you faced the risk of my happening to look inside the outer case and finding you had abstracted the blessed box in which case i might quite naturally have concluded you meant to steal it  i thought of that i answered but i decided to risk it i felt it was worth while for i was sure the man meant to take the case as soon as ever you gave him the opportunity  then you deserve to be rewarded she insisted pressing the cheque upon me  illustration i put her hand back firmly  i put her hand back firmly lady georgina i said it is very amiable of you i think you do right in offering me the money but i think i should do altogether wrong in accepting it a lady is not honest from the hope of gain she is not brave because she expects to be paid for her bravery you were my employer and i was bound to serve my employers interests i did so as well as i could and there is the end of it  she looked absolutely disappointed we all hate to crush a benevolent impulse but she tore the cheque up into very small pieces as you will my dear she said with her hands on her hips i see you are poor tom cayleys daughter he was always a bit quixotic though i believe she liked me all the better for my refusal  on the way from cologne to eltville however and on the drive up to schlangenbad i found her just as fussy and as worrying as ever let me see how many of these horrid pfennigs make an english penny i never can remember oh those silly little nickel things are ten pfennigs each are they well eight would be a penny i suppose a marks a shilling ridiculous of them to divide it into ten pence instead of twelve one never really knows how much ones paying for anything why these continental people cant be content to use pounds shillings and pence all over alike the same as we do passes my comprehension theyre glad enough to get english sovereigns when they can why then dont they use them as such instead of reckoning them each at twentyfive francs and then trying to cheat you out of the proper exchange which is always ten centimes more than the brokers give you what we use their beastly decimal system lois im ashamed of you an english girl to turn and rend her native country like that francs and centimes indeed fancy proposing it at peter robinsons no i will not go by the boat my dear i hate the rhine boats crowded with nasty selfish pigs of germans what i like is a firstclass compartment all to myself and no horrid foreigners especially germans theyre bursting with selfsatisfactionhave such an exaggerated belief in their land and their folk and when they come to england they do nothing but find fault with us if people arent satisfied with the countries they travel in theyd better stop at homethats my opinion nasty pigs of germans the very sight of them sickens me oh i dont mind if they do understand me child they all learn english nowadays it helps them in tradethats why theyre driving us out of all the markets but it must be good for them to learn once in a way what other people really think of themcivilised people i mean not germans theyre a set of barbarians  we reached schlangenbad alive though i sometimes doubted it for my old lady did her boisterous best to rouse some peppery german officer into cutting our throats incontinently by the way and when we got there we took up our abode in the nicest hotel in the village lady georgina had engaged the best front room on the first floor with a charming view across the pineclad valley but i must do her the justice to say that she took the second best for me and that she treated me in every way like the guest she delighted to honour my refusal to accept her twenty guineas made her anxious to pay it back to me within the terms of our agreement she described me to everybody as a young friend who was travelling with her and never gave any one the slightest hint of my being a paid companion our arrangement was that i was to have two guineas for the week besides my travelling expenses board and lodging  on our first morning at schlangenbad lady georgina sallied forth very much overdressed and in a youthful hat to use the waters they are valued chiefly for the complexion i learned i wondered then why lady georgina came therefor she hadnt any but they are also recommended for nervous irritability and as lady georgina had visited the place almost every summer for fifteen years it opened before ones mind an appalling vista of what her temper might have been if she had not gone to schlangenbad the hot springs are used in the form of a bath you dont need them my dear lady georgina said to me with a goodhumoured smile and i will own that i did not for nature has gifted me with a tolerable cuticle but i like when at rome to do as rome does so i tried the baths once i found them unpleasantly smooth and oily i do not freckle but if i did i think i should prefer freckles  we walked much on the terracethe inevitable dawdling promenade of all german wateringplacesit reeked of serene highness we also drove out among the low wooded hills which bound the rhine valley the majority of the visitors i found were ladiescourt ladies most of them all there for their complexions but all anxious to assure me privately they had come for what they described as nervous debility i divided them at once into two classes half of them never had and never would have a complexion at all the other half had exceptionally smooth and beautiful skins of which they were obviously proud and whose pinkandwhite peachblossom they thought to preserve by assiduous bathing it was vanity working on two opposite bases there was a sprinkling of men however who were really there for a sufficient reasonwounds or serious complaints while a few good old sticks porty and whisty were in attendance on invalid wives or sisters  illustration he cast a hasty glance at us  from the beginning i noticed that lady georgina went peering about all over the place as if she were hunting for something she had lost with her longhandled tortoiseshell glasses perpetually in evidencethe aristocratic outrage i called themand that she eyed all the men with peculiar attention but i took no open notice of her little weakness on our second day at the spa i was sauntering with her down the chief streeta beastly little hole my dear not a decent shop where one can buy a reel of thread or a yard of tape in the placewhen i observed a tall and handsome young man on the opposite side of the road cast a hasty glance at us and then sneak round the corner hurriedly he was a looselimbed languidlooking young man with large dreamy eyes and a peculiarly beautiful and gentle expression but what i noted about him most was an odd superficial air of superciliousness he seemed always to be looking down with scorn on that foolish jumble the universe he darted away so rapidly however that i hardly discovered all this just then i piece it out from subsequent observations  later in the day we chanced to pass a café where three young exquisites sat sipping rhine wines after the fashion of the country one of them with a goldtipped cigarette held gracefully between two slender fingers was my languidlooking young aristocrat he was blowing out smoke in a lazy blue stream the moment he saw me however he turned away as if he desired to escape observation and ducked down so as to hide his face behind his companions i wondered why on earth he should want to avoid me could this be the count no the young man with the halo of cigarette smoke stood three inches taller who then at schlangenbad could wish to avoid my notice it was a singular mystery for i was quite certain the supercilious young man was trying his best to prevent my seeing him  that evening after dinner the cantankerous old lady burst out suddenly well i cant for the life of me imagine why harold hasnt turned up here the wretch knew i was coming and i heard from our ambassador at rome last week that he was going to be at schlangenbad  who is harold i asked  my nephew lady georgina snapped back beating a devils tattoo with her fan on the table the only member of my family except myself who isnt a born idiot harolds not an idiot hes an attaché at rome  i saw it at a glance then he is in schlangenbad i answered i noticed him this morning  the old lady turned towards me sharply she peered right through me as if she were a röntgen ray i could see she was asking herself whether this was a conspiracy and whether i had come there on purpose to meet harold but i flatter myself i am tolerably mistress of my own countenance i did not blench how do you know she asked quickly with an acid intonation  if i had answered the truth i should have said i know he is here because i saw a goodlooking young man evidently trying to avoid you this morning and if a young man has the misfortune to be born your nephew and also to have expectations from you it is easy to understand that he would prefer to keep out of your way as long as possible but that would have been neither polite nor politic moreover i reflected that i had no particular reason for wishing to do mr harold a bad turn and that it would be kinder to him as well as to her to conceal the reasons on which i based my instinctive inference so i took up a strong strategic position i have an intuition that i saw him in the village this morning i said family likeness perhaps i merely jumped at it as you spoke a tall languid young man large poetical eyes an artistic moustachejust a trifle orientallooking  thats harold the cantankerous old lady rapped out sharply with clear conviction the miserable boy why on earth hasnt he been round to see me  i reflected that i knew why but i did not say so silence is golden i also remarked mentally on that curious human blindness which had made me conclude at first that the supercilious young man was trying to avoid me when i might have guessed it was far more likely he was trying to avoid my companion i was a nobody lady georgina fawley was a woman of european reputation  perhaps he didnt know which hotel you were stopping at i put in or even that you were here i felt a sudden desire to shield poor harold  not know which hotel nonsense child he knows i come here on this precise date regularly every summer and if he didnt know is it likely i should try any other inn when this is the only moderately decent house to stop at in schlangenbad and the morning coffee undrinkable at that while the hashsuch hash but thats the way in germany hes an ungrateful monster if he comes now i shall refuse to see him  illustration harold you viper what do you mean by trying to avoid me  next morning after breakfast however in spite of these threats she hailed me forth with her on the harold hunt she had sent the concierge to inquire at all the hotels already it seemed and found her truant at none of them now she ransacked the pensions at last she hunted him down in a house on the hill i could see she was really hurt harold you viper what do you mean by trying to avoid me  my dear aunt you here in schlangenbad why when did you arrive and what a colour youve got youre looking so well that clever thrust saved him  he cast me an appealing glance you will not betray me it said i answered mutely not for worlds with a faltering pair of downcast eyelids  oh im well enough thank you lady georgina replied somewhat mollified by his astute allusion to her personal appearance he had hit her weak point dexterously as well that is as one can expect to be nowadays hereditary goutthe sins of the fathers visited as usual but why didnt you come to see me  how can i come to see you if you dont tell me where you are lady georgina fawley europe was the only address i knew it strikes me as insufficient  his gentle drawl was a capital foil to lady georginas acidulous soprano it seemed to disarm her she turned to me with a benignant wave of her hand miss cayley she said introducing me my nephew mr harold tillington youve heard me talk of poor tom cayley harold this is poor tom cayleys daughter  indeed the supercilious attaché put in looking hard at me delighted to make miss cayleys acquaintance  now harold i can tell from your voice at once you havent remembered one word about captain cayley  harold stood on the defensive my dear aunt he observed expanding both palms i have heard you talk of so very many people that even my diplomatic memory fails at times to recollect them all but i do better i dissemble i will plead forgetfulness now of captain cayley since you force it on me it is not likely i shall have to plead it of captain cayleys daughter and he bowed towards me gallantly  the cantankerous old lady darted a lightning glance at him it was a glance of quick suspicion then she turned her röntgen rays upon my face once more i fear i burned crimson  a friend he asked or a fellowguest  a companion it was the first nasty thing she had said of me  ha more than a friend then a comrade he turned the edge neatly  we walked out on the terrace and a little way up the zigzag path the day was superb i found mr tillington in spite of his studiously languid and supercilious air a most agreeable companion he knew europe he was full of talk of rome and the romans he had epigrammatic wit curt keen and pointed we sat down on a bench he kept lady georgina and myself amused for an hour by his crisp sallies besides he had been everywhere and seen everybody culture and agriculture seemed all one to him  when we rose to go in lady georgina remarked with emphasis of course harold youll come and take up your diggings at our hotel  of course my dear aunt how can you ask free quarters nothing would give me greater pleasure  she glanced at him keenly again i saw she had expected him to fake up some lame excuse for not joining us and i fancied she was annoyed at his prompt acquiescence which had done her out of the chance for a family disagreement oh youll come then she said grudgingly  certainly most respected aunt i shall much prefer it  she let her piercing eye descend upon me once more i was aware that i had been talking with frank ease of manner to mr tillington and that i had said several things which clearly amused him then i remembered all at once our relative positions a companion i felt should know her place it is not her rôle to be smart and amusing perhaps i said drawing back mr tillington would like to remain in his present quarters till the end of the week while i am with you lady georgina after that he could have my room it might be more convenient  his eye caught mine quickly oh youre only going to stop a week then miss cayley he put in with an air of disappointment  only a week i nodded  my dear child the cantankerous old lady broke out what nonsense you do talk only going to stop a week how can i exist without you  that was the arrangement i said mischievously you were going to look about you recollect for an unsophisticated gretchen you dont happen to know of any warehouse where a supply of unsophisticated gretchens is kept constantly in stock do you mr tillington  no i dont he answered laughing i believe there are dodos and auks eggs in very small numbers still to be procured in the proper quarters but the unsophisticated gretchen i am credibly informed is an extinct animal why the cap of one fetches high prices nowadays among collectors  but you will come to the hotel at once harold lady georgina interposed  certainly aunt i will move in without delay if miss cayley is going to stay for a single week only that adds one extra inducement for joining you immediately  his aunts stony eye was cold as marble  so when we got back to our hotel after the baths that afternoon the concierge greeted us with well your noble nephew has arrived highwellborn countess he came with his boxes just now and has taken a room near your honourable ladyships  lady georginas face was a study of mingled emotions i dont know whether she looked more pleased or jealous  later in the day i chanced on mr tillington sunning himself on a bench in the hotel garden he rose and came up to me as fast as his languid nature permitted oh miss cayley he said abruptly i do want to thank you so much for not betraying me i know you spotted me twice in the town yesterday and i also know you were good enough to say nothing to my revered aunt about it  i had no reason for wishing to hurt lady georginas feelings i answered with a permissible evasion  his countenance fell i never thought of that he interposed with one hand on his moustache i i fancied you did it out of fellowfeeling  we all think of things mainly from our own point of view first i answered the difference is that some of us think of them from other peoples afterwards motives are mixed  he smiled i didnt know my deeply venerated relative was coming here so soon he went on i thought she wasnt expected till next week my brother wrote me that she had quarrelled with her french maid and twould take her full ten days to get another i meant to clear out before she arrived to tell you the truth i was going tomorrow  and now you are stopping on  he caught my eye again  illustration circumstances alter cases he murmured  circumstances alter cases he murmured with meaning  it is hardly polite to describe one as a circumstance i objected  i meant he said quickly my aunt alone is one thing my aunt with a friend is quite another  i see i answered there is safety in numbers  he eyed me hard  are you mediæval or modern he asked  modern i hope i replied then i looked at him again oxford  he nodded and you half joking  cambridge i said glad to catch him out what college  merton yours  girton  the odd rhyme amused him thenceforth we were friendstwo varsity men he said and indeed it does make a queer sort of linka freemasonry to which even women are now admitted  at dinner and through the evening he talked a great deal to me lady georgina putting in from time to time a characteristic growl about the tabledhôte chickena special breed my dear with eight drumsticks apieceor about the inadequate lighting of the heavy german salon she was worse than ever pungent as a rule that evening she was grumpy when we retired for the night to my great surprise she walked into my bedroom she seated herself on my bed i saw she had come to talk over harold  he will be very rich my dear you know a great catch in time he will inherit all my brothers money  lord kynastons  bless the child no kynastons as poor as a church mouse with the tithes unpaid he has three sons of his own and not a blessed stiver to leave between them how could he poor dear idiot agricultural depression a splendid pauper he has only the estate and thats in essex land going begging worth nothing a year encumbered up to the eyes and loaded with first rentcharges jointures settlements money indeed poor kynaston its my brother marmadukes i mean lucky dog he went in for speculationbegan life as a guineapig and rose with the rise of soap and cocoa hes worth his halfmillion  oh mr marmaduke ashurst  lady georgina nodded marmys a fool she said briefly but he knows which side of his bread is buttered  and mr tillington ishis nephew  bless the child yes have you never read your british bible the peerage astonishing the ignorance of these girton girls they dont even know the legers run at doncaster the family names ashurst kynastons an earl i was lady georgina ashurst before i took it into my head to marry and do for poor evelyn fawley my younger brothers the honourable marmaduke ashurstwomen get the best of it thereits about the only place where they do get the best of it an earls daughter is lady betty his sons nothing more than the honourable tom so one scores off ones brothers my younger sister lady guinevere ashurst married stanley tillington of the foreign office harolds their eldest son now child do you grasp it  perfectly i answered you speak like debrett has issue harold  and harold will inherit all marmadukes money what im always afraid of is that some fascinating adventuress will try to marry him out of hand a pretty face and over goes harold my business in life is to stand in the way and prevent it  she looked me through and through again with her xray scrutiny  i dont think mr tillington is quite the sort that falls a prey to adventuresses i answered boldly  ah but there are faggots and faggots the old lady said wagging her head with profound meaning never mind though id like to see an adventuress marry off harold without my leave id lead her a life id turn her black hair gray for her  i should think i assented you could do it lady georgina if you gave your attention seriously to it  from that moment forth i was aware that my cantankerous old ladys malign eye was inexorably fixed upon me every time i went within speaking distance of mr tillington she watched him like a lynx she watched me like a dozen lynxes wherever we went lady georgina was sure to turn up in the neighbourhood she was perfectly ubiquitous she seemed to possess a worldwide circulation i dont know whether it was this constant suggestion of hers that i was stalking her nephew which roused my latent human feeling of opposition but in the end i began to be aware that i rather liked the supercilious attaché than otherwise he evidently liked me and he tried to meet me whenever he spoke to me indeed it was without the superciliousness which marked his manner towards others in point of fact it was with graceful deference he watched for me on the stairs in the garden by the terrace whenever he got a chance he sidled over and talked to me sometimes he stopped in to read me heine he also introduced me to select portions of gabriele dannunzio it is feminine to be touched by such obvious attention i confess before long i grew to like mr harold tillington  the closer he followed me up the more did i perceive that lady georgina threw out acrid hints with increasing spleen about the ways of adventuresses they were hints of that acrimonious generalised kind too which one cannot answer back without seeming to admit that the cap has fitted it was atrocious how middleclass young women nowadays ran after young men of birth and fortune a girl would stoop to anything in order to catch five hundred thousand guileless youths should be thrown among their natural equals it was a mistake to let them see too much of people of a lower rank who consider themselves goodlooking and the clever ones were the worst they pretended to go in for intellectual companionship  i also noticed that though at first lady georgina had expressed the strongest disinclination to my leaving her after the time originally proposed she now began to take for granted that i would go at the end of my week as arranged in london and she even went on to some overt steps towards securing the help of the blameless gretchen  we had arrived at schlangenbad on tuesday i was to stop with the cantankerous old lady till the corresponding day of the following week on the sunday i wandered out on the wooded hillside behind the village and as i mounted the path i was dimly aware by a sort of instinct that harold tillington was following me  he came up with me at last near a ledge of rock how fast you walk he exclaimed i gave you only a few minutes start and yet even my long legs have had hard work to overtake you  i am a fairly good climber i answered sitting down on a little wooden bench you see at cambridge i went on the river a great deal i canoed and sculled and then besides ive done a lot of bicycling  what a splendid birthright it is he cried to be a wholesome athletic english girl you cant think how one admires english girls after living a year or two in italywhere women are dolls except for a brief period of intrigue before they settle down to be contented frumps with an outline like a barrel  a little muscle and a little mind are no doubt advisable adjuncts for a housewife i admitted  you shall not say that word he cried seating himself at my side it is a word for germans housewife our english ideal is something immeasurably higher and better a companion a complement do you know miss cayley it always sickens me when i hear german students sentimentalising over their mädchen their beautiful pure insipid yellowhaired blueeyed mädchen her so fair so innocent so unapproachably vacuousso like a wax dolland then think of how they design her in days to come to cook sausages for their dinner and knit them endless stockings through a placid middle age till the needles drop from her paralysed fingers and she retires into frilled caps and teutonic senility  you seem to have almost as low an opinion of foreigners as your respected aunt i exclaimed looking quizzically at him  he drew back surprised oh no im not narrowminded like my aunt i hope he answered i am a good cosmopolitan i allow continental nations all their own good points and each has many but their women miss cayleyand their point of view of their womenyou will admit that there they cant hold a candle to english women  i drew a circle in the dust with the tip of my parasol  on that issue i may not be a wholly unprejudiced observer i answered the fact of my being myself an englishwoman may possibly to some extent influence my judgment  you are sarcastic he cried drawing away  not at all i answered making a wider circle i spoke a simple fact but what is your ideal then as opposed to the german one  he gazed at me and hesitated his lips half parted my ideal he said after a pause well my idealdo you happen to have such a thing as a pocketmirror about you  i laughed in spite of myself now mr tillington i said severely if youre going to pay compliments i shall have to return if you want to stop here with me you must remember that i am only lady georgina fawleys temporary ladysmaid besides i didnt mean that i meant what is your ideal of a mans right relation to his mädchen  dont say mädchen he cried petulantly it sounds as if you thought me one of those sentimental germans i hate sentiment  then towards the woman of his choice  he glanced up through the trees at the light overhead and spoke more slowly than ever i think he said fumbling his watchchain nervously a man ought to wish the woman he loves to be a free agent his equal in point of action even as she is nobler and better than he in all spiritual matters i think he ought to desire for her a life as high as she is capable of leading with full scope for every faculty of her intellect or her emotional nature she should be beautiful with a vigorous wholesome manysided beauty moral intellectual physical yet with soul in her too and with the soul and the mind lighting up her eyes as it lights upwell that is immaterial and if a man can discover such a woman as that and can induce her to believe in him to love him to accept himthough how such a woman can be satisfied with any man at all is to me unfathomablewell then i think he should be happy in devoting his whole life to her and should give himself up to repay her condescension in taking him  and you hate sentiment i put in smiling  illustration miss cayley he said you are playing with me  he brought his eyes back from the sky suddenly miss cayley he said this is cruel i was in earnest you are playing with me  i believe the chief characteristic of the english girl is supposed to be common sense i answered calmly and i trust i possess it but indeed as he spoke my heart was beginning to make its beat felt for he was a charming young man he had a soft voice and lustrous eyes it was a summers day and alone in the woods with one other person where the sunlight falls mellow in spots like a leopards skin one is apt to remember that we are all human  that evening lady georgina managed to blurt out more malicious things than ever about the ways of adventuresses and the duty of relations in saving young men from the clever clutches of designing creatures she was ruthless in her rancour her gibes stung me  on monday at breakfast i asked her casually if she had yet found a gretchen  no she answered in a gloomy voice all slatterns my dear all slatterns brought up in pigsties i wouldnt let one of them touch my hair for thousands  thats unfortunate i said drily for you know im going tomorrow  if i had dropped a bomb in their midst they couldnt have looked more astonished tomorrow lady georgina gasped clutching my arm you dont mean it child you dont mean it  i asserted my ego certainly i answered with my coolest air i said i thought i could manage you for a week and i have managed you  she almost burst into tears but my child my child what shall i do without you  the unsophisticated gretchen i answered trying not to look concerned for in my heart of hearts in spite of her innuendoes i had really grown rather to like the cantankerous old lady  she rose hastily from the table and darted up to her own room lois she said as she rose in a curious voice of mingled regret and suspicion i will talk to you about this later i could see she was not quite satisfied in her own mind whether harold tillington and i had not arranged this coup together  i put on my hat and strolled off into the garden and then along the mossy hill path in a minute more harold tillington was beside me  he seated me half against my will on a rustic bench look here miss cayley he said with a very earnest face is this really true are you going tomorrow  my voice trembled a little yes i answered biting my lip i am going i see several reasons why i should go mr tillington  but so soon  yes i think so the sooner the better my heart was racing now and his eyes pleaded mutely  then where are you going  i shrugged my shoulders and pouted my lips a little i dont know i replied the world is all before me where to choose i am an adventuress i said it boldly and i am in quest of adventures i really have not yet given a thought to my next place of sojourn  but you will let me know when you have decided  it was time to speak out no mr tillington i said with decision i will not let you know one of my reasons for going is that i think i had better see no more of you  he flung himself on the bench at my side and folded his hands in a helpless attitude but miss cayley he cried this is so short a notice you give a fellow no chance i hoped i might have seen more of youmight have had some opportunity ofof letting you realise how deeply i admired and respected yousome opportunity of showing myself as i really am to youbeforebefore he paused and looked hard at me  i did not know what to say i really liked him so much and when he spoke in that voice i could not bear to seem cruel to him indeed i was aware at the moment how much i had grown to care for him in those six short days but i knew it was impossible dont say it mr tillington i murmured turning my face away the less said the sooner mended  but i must he cried i must tell you now if i am to have no chance afterwards i wanted you to see more of me before i ventured to ask you if you could ever love me if you could ever suffer me to go through life with you to share my all with you he seized my trembling hand lois he cried in a pleading voice i must ask you i cant expect you to answer me now but do say you will give me at least some other chance of seeing you and then in time of pressing my suit upon you  tears stood in my eyes he was so earnest so charming but i remembered lady georgina and his prospective halfmillion i moved his hand away gently i cannot i said i cannot i am a penniless girlan adventuress your family your uncle would never forgive you if you married me i will not stand in your way i i like you very much though i have seen so little of you but i feel it is impossibleand i am going tomorrow  illustration i rose of a sudden and ran down the hill  then i rose of a sudden and ran down the hill with all my might lest i should break my resolve never stopping once till i reached my own bedroom  an hour later lady georgina burst in upon me in high dudgeon why lois my child she cried whats this what on earth does it mean harold tells me he has proposed to youproposed to youand youve rejected him  i dried my eyes and tried to look steadily at her yes lady georgina i faltered you need not be afraid i have refused him and i mean it  she looked at me all aghast and you mean it she repeated you mean to refuse him then all i can say is lois cayley i call it pure cheek of you  what i cried drawing back  yes cheek she answered volubly forty thousand a year and a good old family harold tillington is my nephew hes an earls grandson hes an attaché at rome and hes bound to be one of the richest commoners in england who are you id like to know miss that you dare to reject him  i stared at her amazed but lady georgina i cried you said you wished to protect your nephew against barefaced adventuresses who were setting their caps at him  she fixed her eyes on me halfangry halftremulous  of course she answered with withering scorn but then i thought you were trying to catch him he tells me now you wont have him and you wont tell him where you are going i call it sheer insolence where do you hail from girl that you should refuse my nephew a man that any woman in england would be proud to marry forty thousand a year and an earls grandson thats what comes i suppose of going to girton  i drew myself up lady georgina i said coldly i cannot allow you to use such language to me i promised to accompany you to germany for a week and i have kept my word i like your nephew i respect your nephew he has behaved like a gentleman but i will not marry him your own conduct showed me in the plainest way that you did not judge such a match desirable for him and i have common sense enough to see that you were quite right i am a lady by birth and education i am an officers daughter but i am not what society calls a good match for mr tillington he had better marry into a rich stockbrokers family  it was an unworthy taunt the moment it escaped my lips i regretted it  illustration i was going to oppose you and harold  to my intense surprise however lady georgina flung herself on my bed and burst into tears my dear she sobbed out covering her face with her hands i thought you would be sure to set your cap at harold and after i had seen you for twentyfour hours i said to myself thats just the sort of girl harold ought to fall in love with i felt sure he would fall in love with you i brought you here on purpose i saw you had all the qualities that would strike harolds fancy so i had made up my mind for a delightful regulation family quarrel i was going to oppose you and harold tooth and nail i was going to threaten that marmy would leave his money to kynastons eldest son i was going to kick up oh a dickens of a row about it then of course in the end we should all have been reconciled we should have kissed and made friends for youre just the one girl in the world for harold indeed i never met anybody so capable and so intelligent and now you spoil all my sport by going and refusing him its really most illtimed of you and harold has sent me herehes trembling with anxietyto see whether i cant induce you to think better of your decision  i made up my mind at once no lady georgina i said in my gentlest voicepositively stooping down and kissing her i like mr tillington very much i dare not tell you how much i like him he is a dear good kind fellow but i cannot rest under the cruel imputation of being moved by his wealth and having tried to capture him even if you didnt think so his family would i am sorry to go for in a way i like you but it is best to adhere to our original plan if i changed my mind you might change yours again let us say no more i will go tomorrow  but you will see harold again  not alone only at dinner for i feared lest if he spoke to me alone he might overpersuade me  then at least you will tell him where you are going  no lady georgina i do not know myself and besides it is best that this should now be final  she flung herself upon me but my dear child a lady cant go out into the world with only two pounds in pocket you must let me lend you something  i unwound her clasping hands no dear lady georgina i said though i was loth to say it you are very sweet and good but i must work out my life in my own way i have started to work it out and i wont be turned aside just here on the threshold  and you wont stop with me she cried opening her arms you think me too cantankerous  i think you have a dear kind old heart i said under the quaintest and crustiest outside such a heart ever wore youre a truculent old darling so thats the plain truth of it  she kissed me i kissed her in return with fervour though i am but a poor hand at kissing for a woman so now this episode is concluded i murmured  i dont know about that she said drying her eyes i have set my heart upon you now and harold has set his heart upon you and considering that your own heart goes much the same way i daresay my dear we shall find in the end some convenient road out of it  nevertheless next morning i set out by myself in the coach from schlangenbad i went forth into the world to live my own life partly because it was just then so fashionable but mainly because fate had denied me the chance of living anybody elses     iii  the adventure of the inquisitive american   in one week i had multiplied my capital two hundred and fortyfold i left london with twopence in the world i quitted schlangenbad with two pounds in pocket  theres a splendid turnover i thought to myself if this luck holds at the same rate i shall have made four hundred and eighty pounds by tuesday next and i may look forward to being a barney barnato by christmas for i had taken high mathematical honours at cambridge and if there is anything on earth on which i pride myself it is my firm grasp of the principle of ratios  still in spite of this brilliant financial prospect a budding klondike i went away from the little spa on the flanks of the taunus with a heavy heart i had grown quite to like dear virulent fidgety old lady georgina and i felt that it had cost me a distinct wrench to part with harold tillington the wrench left a scar which was long in healing but as i am not a professional sentimentalist i will not trouble you here with details of the symptoms  my livelihood however was now assured me with two pounds in pocket a sensible girl can read her title clear to six days board and lodging at six marks a day with a glorious margin of four marks over for pocketmoney and if at the end of six days my fairy godmother had not pointed me out some other means of earning my bread honestlywell i should feel myself unworthy to be ranked in the noble army of adventuresses i thank thee lady georgina for teaching me that word an adventuress i would be for i loved adventure  meanwhile it occurred to me that i might fill up the interval by going to study art at frankfort elsie petheridge had been there and had impressed upon me the fact that i must on no account omit to see the städel gallery she was strong on culture besides the study of art should be most useful to an adventuress for she must need all the arts that human skill has developed  so to frankfort i betook myself and found there a nice little pensionfor ladies only frau bockenheifner assured meat very moderate rates in a pleasant part of the lindenstrasse it had dimity curtains i will not deny that as i entered the house i was conscious of feeling lonely my heart sank once or twice as i glanced round the luncheontable at the domesticallyunsympathetic german old maids who formed the rankandfile of my fellowboarders there they sateight comfortable fraus who had missed their vocation plentiful ladies bulging and surging in tightly stretched black silk bodices they had been cut out for such housewives as harold tillington had described but found themselves deprived of their natural sphere in life by the unaccountable caprice of the men of their nation each was a model teutonic matron manquée each looked capable of frying frankfort sausages to a turn and knitting woollen socks to a remote eternity but i sought in vain for one kindred soul among them how horrified they would have been with their fat puddingfaces and big saucereyes had i boldly announced myself as an english adventuress  i spent my first morning in laborious selfeducation at the ariadneum and the städel gallery i borrowed a catalogue i wrestled with van der weyden i toiled like a galleyslave at meister wilhelm and meister stephan i have a confused recollection that i saw a number of stiff mediæval pictures and an alabaster statue of the lady who smiled as she rode on a tiger taken at the beginning of that interesting episode but the remainder of the institute has faded from my memory  in the afternoon i consoled myself for my herculean efforts in the direction of culture by going out for a bicycle ride on a hired machine to which end i decided to devote my pocketmoney you will perhaps object here that my conduct was imprudent to raise that objection is to misunderstand the spirit of these artless adventures i told you that i set out to go round the world but to go round the world does not necessarily mean to circumnavigate it my idea was to go round by easy stages seeing the world as i went as far as i got and taking as little heed as possible of the morrow most of my readers no doubt accept that philosophy of life on sundays only on weekdays they swallow the usual contradictory economic platitudes about prudential forethought and the horrid improvidence of the lower classes for myself i am not built that way i prefer to take life in a spirit of pure inquiry i put on my hat i saunter where i choose so far as circumstances permit and i wait to see what chance will bring me my ideal is breeziness  the hired bicycle was not a bad machine as hired bicycles go it jolted one as little as you can expect from a common hack it never stopped at a biergarten and it showed very few signs of having been ridden by beginners with an unconquerable desire to tilt at the hedgerow so off i soared at once heedless of the jeers of teutonic youth who found the sight of a lady riding a cycle in skirts a strange onefor in south germany the rational costume is so universal among women cyclists that tis the skirt that provokes unfavourable comment from those jealous guardians of female propriety the street boys i hurried on at a brisk pace past the palmgarden and the suburbs with my loose hair straying on the breeze behind till i found myself pedalling at a good round pace on a broad level road which led towards a village by name fraunheim  as i scurried across the plain with the wind in my face not unpleasantly i had some dim consciousness of somebody unknown flying after me headlong my first idea was that harold tillington had hunted me down and tracked me to my lair but gazing back i saw my pursuer was a tall and ungainly man with a strawcoloured moustache apparently american and that he was following me on his machine closely watching my action he had such a cunning expression on his face and seemed so strangely inquisitive with eyes riveted on my treadles that i didnt quite like the look of him i put on the pace to see if i could outstrip him for i am a swift cyclist but his long legs were too much for me he did not gain on me it is true but neither did i outpace him pedalling my very hardestand i can make good time when necessaryi still kept pretty much at the same distance in front of him all the way to fraunheim  illustration he kept close at my heels  gradually i began to feel sure that the weedylooking man with the alert face was really pursuing me when i went faster he went faster too when i gave him a chance to pass me he kept close at my heels and appeared to be keenly watching the style of my ankleaction i gathered that he was a connoisseur but why on earth he should persecute me i could not imagine my spirit was roused now i pedalled with a will if i rode all day i would not let him go past me  beyond the cobblepaved chief street of fraunheim the road took a sharp bend and began to mount the slopes of the taunus suddenly it was an abrupt steep climb but i flatter myself i am a tolerable mountain cyclist i rode sturdily on my pursuer darted after me but on this stiff upward grade my light weight and agile ankleaction told i began to distance him he seemed afraid that i would give him the slip and called out suddenly with a whoop in english stop miss i looked back with dignity but answered nothing he put on the pace panting i pedalled away and got clear from him  illustration i was pulled up short by a mounted policeman  at a turn of the corner however as luck would have it i was pulled up short by a mounted policeman he blocked the road with his horse like an ogre and asked me in a very gruff swabian voice if this was a licensed bicycle i had no idea till he spoke that any license was required though to be sure i might have guessed it for modern germany is studded with notices at all the street corners to inform you in minute detail that everything is forbidden i stammered out that i did not know the mounted policeman drew near and inspected me rudely it is strongly undersaid he began but just at that moment my pursuer came up and with american quickness took in the situation he accosted the policeman in choice bad german i have two licenses he said producing a handful the fräulein rides with me  i was too much taken aback at so providential an interposition to contradict this highly imaginative statement my highwayman had turned into a protecting knighterrant of injured innocence i let the policeman go his way then i glanced at my preserver a very ordinary modern st george he looked with no lance to speak of and no steed but a bicycle yet his mien was reassuring  good morning miss he beganhe called me miss every time he addressed me as though he took me for a barmaid excuse me but why did you want to speed her  i thought you were pursuing me i answered a little tremulous i will confess but avid of incident  and if i was he went on you might have conjectured miss it was for our mutual advantage a business man dont go out of his way unless he expects to turn an honest dollar and he dont reckon on other folks going out of theirs unless he knows he can put them in the way of turning an honest dollar with him  thats reasonable i answered for i am a political economist the benefit should be mutual but i wondered if he was going to propose at sight to me  he looked me all up and down youre a lady of considerable personal attractions he said musingly as if he were criticising a horse and i want one that sort thats jest why i trailed you see besides which theres some style about you  style i repeated  yes he went on you know how to use your feet and you have good understandings  i gathered from his glance that he referred to my nether limbs we are all vertebrate animals why seek to conceal the fact  i fail to follow you i answered frigidly for i really didnt know what the man might say next  illustration seems i didnt make much of a job of it  thats so he replied it was i that followed you seems i didnt make much of a job of it either anyway  i mounted my machine again well good morning i said coldy i am much obliged for your kind assistance but your remark was fictitious and i desire to go on unaccompanied  he held up his hand in warning you aint going he cried horrified you aint going without hearing me i mean business say dont chuck away good money like that i tell you theres dollars in it  in what i asked still moving on but curious on the slope if need were i could easily distance him  why in this cycling of yours he replied youre jest about the very woman im looking for miss lithethats what i call you i kin put you in the way of making your pile i kin this is a bonâfide offer no flies on my business you decline it prejudice injures you injures me be reasonable anyway  i looked round and laughed formulate yourself i said briefly  he rose to it like a man meet me at fraunheim corner by the post office ten oclock tomorrow morning he shouted as i rode off and ef i dont convince you theres money in this job my names not cyrus w hitchcock  something about his keen unlovely face impressed me with a sense of his underlying honesty very well i answeredill come if you follow me no further i reflected that fraunheim was a populous village and that only beyond it did the mountain road over the taunus begin to grow lonely if he wished to cut my throat i was well within reach of the resources of civilisation  when i got home to the abode of blighted fraus that evening i debated seriously with myself whether or not i should accept mr cyrus w hitchcocks mysterious invitation prudence said no curiosity said yes i put the question to a meeting of one and since i am a daughter of eve curiosity had it carried unanimously i think i might have hesitated indeed had it not been for the blighted fraus their talk was of dinner and of the digestive process they were critics of digestion they each of them sat so complacently through the eveningsolid and stolid stodgy and podgy stuffed comatose images knitting white woollen shawls to throw over their capacious shoulders at table dhôteand they purred with such content in their middleaged rotundity that i made up my mind i must take warning betimes and avoid their temptations to adipose deposit i prefer to grow upwards the frau grows sideways better get my throat cut by an american desperado in my pursuit of romance than settle down on a rock like a placid fat oyster i am not by nature sessile  adventures are to the adventurous they abound on every side but only the chosen few have the courage to embrace them and they will not come to you you must go out to seek them then they meet you halfway and rush into your arms for they know their true lovers there were eight blighted fraus at the home for lost ideals and i could tell by simple inspection that they had not had an average of half an adventure per lifetime between them they sat and knitted still like awful examples  if i had declined to meet mr hitchcock at fraunheim i know not what changes it might have induced in my life i might now be knitting but i went boldly forth on a voyage of exploration prepared to accept aught that fate held in store for me  as mr hitchcock had assured me there was money in his offer i felt justified in speculating i expended another three marks on the hire of a bicycle though i ran the risk thereby of going perhaps without mondays dinner that showed my vocation the blighted fraus i felt sure would have clung to their dinner at all hazards  when i arrived at fraunheim i found my alert american punctually there before me he raised his crush hat with awkward politeness i could see he was little accustomed to ladies society then he pointed to a close cab in which he had reached the village  ive got it inside he whispered in a confidential tone i couldnt let em ketch sight of it you see theres dollars in it  what have you got inside i asked suspiciously drawing back i dont know why but the word it somehow suggested a corpse i began to grow frightened  why the wheel of course he answered aint you come here to ride it  oh the wheel i echoed vaguely pretending to look wise but unaware as yet that that word was the accepted americanism for a cycle and i have come to ride it  why certainly he replied jerking his hand towards the cab but we mustnt start right here this thing has got to be kept dark dont you see till the last day  till the last day that was ominous it sounded like monomania so ghostly and elusive i began to suspect my american ally of being a dangerous madman  jest you wheel away a bit up the hill he went on out o sight of the folks and ill fetch her along to you  her i cried who for the man bewildered me  why the wheel miss you understand this is business you bet and youre jest the right woman  he motioned me on urged by a sort of spell i remounted my machine and rode out of the village he followed on the boxseat of his cab then when we had left the world well behind and stood among the sunsmitten boles of the pinetrees he opened the door mysteriously and produced from the vehicle a very oddlooking bicycle  it was clumsy to look at it differed immensely in many particulars from any machine i had yet seen or ridden  the strenuous american fondled it for a moment with his hand as if it were a pet child then he mounted nimbly pride shone in his eye i saw in a second he was a fond inventor  he rode a few yards on next he turned to me eagerly this machine he said in an impressive voice is propelled by an eccentric like all his countrymen he laid most stress on unaccented syllables  oh i knew you were an eccentric i said the moment i set eyes upon you  he surveyed me gravely you misunderstand me miss he corrected when i say an eccentric i mean a crank  they are much the same thing i answered briskly though i confess i would hardly have applied so rude a word as crank to you  he looked me over suspiciously as if i were trying to make game of him but my face was sphinxlike so he brought the machine a yard or two nearer and explained its construction to me he was quite right it was driven by a crank it had no chain but was moved by a pedal working narrowly up and down and attached to a rigid bar which impelled the wheels by means of an eccentric  besides this it had a curious device for altering the gearing automatically while one rode so as to enable one to adapt it to the varying slope in mounting hills this part of the mechanism he explained to me elaborately there was a gauge in front which allowed one to sight the steepness of the slope by mere inspection and according as the gauge marked one two three or four as its gradient on the scale the rider pressed a button on the handlebar with his left hand once twice thrice or four times so that the gearing adapted itself without an effort to the rise in the surface besides there were devices for rigidity and compensation altogether it was a most apt and ingenious piece of mechanism i did not wonder he was proud of it  get up and ride miss he said in a persuasive voice  i did as i was bid to my immense surprise i ran up the steep hill as smoothly and easily as if it were a perfectlylaid level  goes nicely doesnt she mr hitchcock murmured rubbing his hands  beautifully i answered one could ride such a machine up mont blanc i should fancy  he stroked his chin with nervous fingers it ought to knock em he said in an eager voice its geared to run up most anything in creation  how steep  one foot in three  thats good  yes itll climb mount washington  what do you call it i asked  he looked me over with close scrutiny  in amurrica he said slowly we call it the great manitou because it kin do pretty well what it chooses but in europe i am thinking of calling it the martin conway or the whymper or something like that  why so  well because its a famous mountain climber  i see i said with such a machine youll put a notice on the matterhorn this hill is dangerous to cyclists  he laughed low to himself and rubbed his hands again youll do miss he said youre the right sort you are the moment i seen you i thought we two could do a trade together benefits me benefits you a mutual advantage reciprocity is the soul of business you hev some go in you you hev theres money in your feet youll give these meinherrs fits youll take the clearstarch out of them  i fail to catch on i answered speaking his own dialect to humour him  oh youll get there all the same he replied stroking his machine meanwhile it was a squirrel it was he pronounced it squirl it ud run up a tree ef it wanted wouldnt it he was talking to it now as if it were a dog or a baby there there it mustnt kick it was a frisky little thing jest you step up on it miss and have a go at that there mountain  i stepped up and had a go the machine bounded forward like an agile greyhound you had but to touch it and it ran of itself never had i ridden so vivacious so animated a cycle i returned to him sailing with the gradient reversed the manitou glided smoothly as on a gentle slope without the need for backpedalling  it soars he remarked with enthusiasm  balloons are at discount beside it i answered  now you want to know about this business i guess he went on you want to know jest where the reciprocity comes in anyhow  i am ready to hear you expound i admitted smiling  oh it aint all on one side he continued eyeing his machine at an angle with parental affection im agoing to make your fortune right here you shall ride her for me on the last day and ef you pull this thing off dont you be scared that i wont treat you handsome  if you were a little more succinct i said gravely we should get forrader faster  perhaps you wonder he put in that with money on it like this i should intrust the job into the hands of a female i winced but was silent well its like this dont you see ef a female wins it makes success all the more striking and conspicuous the world today is ruled by advertizement  i could stand it no longer mr hitchcock i said with dignity i havent the remotest idea what on earth you are talking about  he gazed at me with surprise what he exclaimed at last and you kin cycle like that not know what all the cycling world is mad about why you dont mean to tell me youre not a professional  i enlightened him at once as to my position in society which was respectable if not lucrative his face fell somewhat hightoned eh still youd run all the same wouldnt you he inquired  run for what i asked innocently parliament the presidency the frankfort town council  he had difficulty in fathoming the depths of my ignorance but by degrees i understood him it seemed that the german imperial and prussian royal governments had offered a kaiserly and kingly prize for the best military bicycle the course to be run over the taunus from frankfort to limburg the winning machine to get the equivalent of a thousand pounds each firm to supply its own make and rider the last day was saturday next and the great manitou was the dark horse of the contest  then all was clear as day to me mr cyrus w hitchcock was keeping his machine a profound secret he wanted a woman to ride it so that his triumph might be the more complete and the moment he saw me pedal up the hill in trying to avoid him he recognised at once that i was that woman  i recognised it too twas a preordained harmony after two or three trials i felt that the manitou was built for me and i was built for the manitou we ran together like parts of one mechanism i was always famed for my circular ankleaction and in this new machine ankleaction was everything strength of limb counted for naught what told was the power of clawing up again promptly i possess that power i have prehistoric feet my remote progenitors must certainly have been treehaunting monkeys  we arranged terms then and there  you accept  implicitly  if i pulled off the race i was to have fifty pounds if i didnt i was to have five it aint only your skill you see mr hitchcock said with frank commercialism its your personal attractiveness as well that i go upon thats an element to consider in business relations  my face is my fortune i answered gravely he nodded acquiescence  till saturday then i was free meanwhile i trained and practised quietly with the manitou in sequestered parts of the hills i also took spells turn about at the städel institute i like to intersperse culture and athletics i know something about athletics and hope in time to acquire a taste for culture tis expected of a girton girl though my own accomplishments run rather towards rowing punting bicycling  on saturday i confess i rose with great misgivings i was not a professional and to find oneself practically backed for a thousand pounds in a race against men is a trifle disquieting still having once put my hand to the plough i felt i was bound to pull it through somehow i dressed my hair neatly in a very tight coil i ate a light breakfast eschewing the fried sausages which the blighted fraus pressed upon my notice and satisfying myself with a gentlyboiled egg and some toast and coffee i always found i rowed best at cambridge on the lightest diet in my opinion the raw beef régime is a serious error in training  at a minute or two before eleven i turned up at the schiller platz in my short serge dress and cycling jacket the great square was thronged with spectators to see us start the police made a lane through their midst for the riders my backer had advised me to come to the post as late as possible for i have entered your name he said simply as lois cayley these deutschers dont think but what youre a man and a brother but i am apprehensive of contingencies when you put in a show theyll try to raise objections to you on account of your being a female there wont be much time though and i shall rush the objections once they let you run and win it dont matter to me whether i get the twenty thousand marks or not its the advertizement that tells jest you mark my words miss and dont you make no mistake about itthe world today is governed by advertizement  so i turned up at the last moment and cast a timid glance at my competitors they were all men of course and two of them were german officers in a sort of undress cycling uniform they eyed me superciliously one of them went up and spoke to the herr oversuperintendent who had charge of the contest i understood him to be lodging an objection against a mere woman taking part in the race the herr oversuperintendent a bulky official came up beside me and perpended visibly he bent his big brows to it twas appalling to observe the measurable amount of teutonic cerebration going on under cover of his round green glasses he was perpending for some minutes time was almost up then he turned to mr hitchcock having finally made up his colossal mind and murmured rudely the woman cannot compete  why not i inquired in my very sweetest german with an angelic smile though my heart trembled  warum nicht because the word rider in the kaiserly and kingly forthiscontestprovided decree is distinctly in the masculine gender stated  pardon me herr oversuperintendent i replied pulling out a copy of law 97 on the subject with which i had duly provided myself if you will to section 45 of the bicyclescirculationregulationact your attention turn you will find it therein expressly enacted that unless any clause be anywhere to the contrary inserted the word rider in the masculine gender put shall here the word rideress in the feminine to embrace be considered  for anticipating this objection i had taken the precaution to look the legal question up beforehand  that is true the herr oversuperintendent observed in a musing voice gazing down at me with relenting eyes the masculine habitually embraces the feminine and he brought his massive intellect to bear upon the problem once more with prodigious concentration  i seized my opportunity let me start at least i urged holding out the act if i win you can the matter more fully with the kaiserly and kingly governments hereafter argue out  i guess this will be an international affair mr hitchcock remarked well pleased it would be a firstrate advertizement for the great manitou ef england and germany were to make the question into a casus belli the united states could look on and pocket the chestnuts  two minutes to go the official starter with the watch called out  fall in then fräulein engländerin the herr oversuperintendent observed without prejudice waving me into line he pinned a badge with a large number 7 on my dress the kaiserly and kingly governments shall on the affair of the startings legality hereafter on my report more at leisure pass judgment  the lieutenant in undress uniform drew back a little  oh if this is to be womans play he muttered then can a prussian officer himself by competing not into contempt bring  i dropped a little curtsy if the herr lieutenant is afraid even to enter against an englishwoman i said smiling  he came up to the scratch sullenly one minute to go called out the starter  we were all on the alert there was a pause a deep breath i was horribly frightened but i tried to look calm then sharp and quick came the one word go and like arrows from a bow off we all started  i had ridden over the whole course the day but one before on a mountain pony with an observant eye and my sedulous americanrising at five oclock so as not to excite undue attention and i therefore knew beforehand the exact route we were to follow but i confess when i saw the prussian lieutenant and one of my other competitors dash forward at a pace that simply astonished me that fifty pounds seemed to melt away in the dim abyss of the ewigkeit i gave up all for lost i could never make the running against such practised cyclists  illustration dont scorch miss dont scorch  however we all turned out into the open road which leads across the plain and down the main valley in the direction of mayence for the first ten miles or so it is a dusty level the surface is perfect but twas a blinding white thread as i toiled along it that broiling june day i could hear the voice of my backer who followed on horseback exhorting me in loud tones dont scorch miss dont scorch never mind ef you lose sight of em keep your wind thats the point the wind the winds everything let em beat you on the level youll catch em up fast enough when you get on the taunus  but in spite of his encouragement i almost lost heart as i saw one after another of my opponents backs disappear in the distance till at last i was left toiling along the bare white road alone in a showerbath of sunlight with just a dense cloud of dust rising gray far ahead of me my head swam it repented me of my boldness  then the riders on horseback began to grumble for by police regulation they were not allowed to pass the hindmost of the cyclists and they were kept back by my presence from following up their special champions give it up fräulein give it up they cried youre beaten let us pass and get forward but at the selfsame moment i heard the shrill voice of my american friend whooping aloud across the din dont you do nothing of the sort miss you stick to it and keep your wind its the wind that wins them germans wont be worth a cent on the high slopes anyway  encouraged by his voice i worked steadily on neither scorching nor relaxing but maintaining an even pace at my natural pitch under the broiling sunshine heat rose in waves on my face from the road below in the thin white dust the accusing tracks of six wheels confronted me still i kept on following them till i reached the town of höchstnine miles from frankfort soldiers along the route were timing us at intervals with chronometers and noting our numbers as i rattled over the paved high street i called aloud to one of them how far ahead the last man  he shouted back goodhumouredly four minutes fräulein  again i lost heart then i mounted a slight slope and felt how easily the manitou moved up the gradient from its summit i could note a long gray cloud of dust rolling steadily onward down the hill towards hattersheim  i coasted down with my feet up and a slight breeze just cooling me mr hitchcock behind called out fullthroated from his seat no hurry no flurry take your time takeyourtime miss  over the bridge at hattersheim you turn to the right abruptly and begin to mount by the side of a pretty little stream the schwarzbach which runs brawling over rocks down the taunus from eppstein by this time the excitement had somewhat cooled down for the moment i was getting reconciled to be beaten on the level and began to realise that my chances would be best as we approached the steepest bits of the mountain road about niederhausen so i positively plucked up heart to look about me and enjoy the scenery with hair flying behindthat coil had played me falsei swept through hofheim a pleasant little village at the mouth of a grassy valley inclosed by wooded slopes the schwarzbach making cool music in the glen below as i mounted beside it clambering larches like huge candelabra stood out on the ridge silhouetted against the skyline  how far ahead the last man i cried to the recording soldier he answered me back two minutes fräulein  i was gaining on them i was gaining i thundered across the schwarzbach by halfadozen clamorous little iron bridges making easy time now and with my feet working as if they were themselves an integral part of the machinery up up up it looked a vertical ascent the manitou glided well in its oilbath at its halfway gearing i rode for dear life at sixteen miles lorsbach at eighteen eppstein the road still rising how far ahead the last man just round the corner fräulein  i put on a little steam sure enough round the corner i caught sight of his back with a spurt i passed hima dustcovered soul very hot and uncomfortable he had not kept his wind i flew past him like a whirlwind but oh how sultry hot in that sweltering close valley a pretty little town eppstein with its mediæval castle perched high on a craggy rock i owed it some gratitude i felt as i left it behind for twas here that i came up with the tailend of my opponents  that one victory cheered me so far our route had lain along the wellmade but dusty high road in the steaming valley at niederjosbach two miles on we quitted the road abruptly by the course marked out for us and turned up a mountain path only wide enough for two cycles abreasta path that clambered towards the higher slopes of the taunus that was arranged on purposefor this was no fairweather show but a practical trial for military bicycles under the conditions they might meet with in actual warfare it was rugged riding black walls of pine rose steep on either hand the ground was uncertain our path mounted sharply from the first the steeper the better by the time i had reached oberjosbach nestling high among larchwoods i had distanced all but two of my opponents it was cooler now too as i passed the hamlet my cry altered  illustration how far ahead the first man  how far ahead the first man  two minutes fräulein  a civilian  no no a prussian officer  the herr lieutenant led then for old englands sake i felt i must beat him  the steepest slope of all lay in the next two miles if i were going to win i must pass these two there for my advantage lay all in the climb if it came to coasting the mens mere weight scored a point in their favour bump crash jolt i pedalled away like a machine the manitou sobbed my ankles flew round so that i scarcely felt them but the road was rough and scarred with waterwaysruts turned by rain to runnels at half a mile after a desperate struggle among sand and pebbles i passed the second man just ahead the prussian officer looked round and saw me thunderweather you there engländerin he cried darting me a look of unchivalrous dislike such as only your sentimental german can cast at a woman  illustration i am here behind you herr lieutenant  yes i am here behind you herr lieutenant i answered putting on a spurt and i hope next to be before you  he answered not a word but worked his hardest so did i he bent forward i sat erect on my manitou pulling hard at my handles now my front wheel was upon him it reached his pedal we were abreast he had a narrow thread of solid path and he forced me into a runnel still i gained he swerved i think he tried to foul me but the slope was too steep his attempt recoiled on himself he ran against the rock at the side and almost overbalanced that second lost him i waved my hand as i sailed ahead good morning i cried gaily see you again at limburg  from the top of the slope i put my feet up and flew down into idstein a thundershower burst i was glad of the cool of it it laid the dust i regained the high road from that moment save for the risk of sideslips twas easy runningjust an undulating line with occasional ups and downs but i saw no more of my pursuers till twentytwo kilometres farther on i rattled on the cobblepaved causeway into limburg i had covered the fortysix miles in quick time for a mountain climb as i crossed the bridge over the lahn to my immense surprise mr hitchcock waved his arms all excitement to greet me he had taken the train on from eppstein it seemed and got there before me as i dismounted at the cathedral which was our appointed end and gave my badge to the soldier he rushed up and shook my hand fifty pounds he cried fifty pounds hows that for the great anglosaxon race and hooray for the manitou  the second man the civilian rode in wet and draggled forty seconds later as for the herr lieutenant a disappointed man he fell out by the way alleging a puncture i believe he was ashamed to admit the fact that he had been beaten in open fight by the objurgated engländerin  so the end of it was i was now a woman of means with fifty pounds of my own to my credit  i lunched with my backer royally at the best inn in limburg     iv  the adventure of the amateur commission agent   my eccentric american had assured me that if i won the great race for him i need not be skeert lest he should fail to treat me well and to do him justice i must admit that he kept his word magnanimously while we sat at lunch in the cosy hotel at limburg he counted out and paid me in hand the fifty good gold pieces he had promised me whether these deutschers fork out my twenty thousand marks or not he said in his brisk way it dont much matter i shall get the contract and i shall hev gotten the advertizement  why do you start your bicycles in germany though i asked innocently i should have thought myself there was so much a better chance of selling them in england  illustration let them boom or bust on it  he closed one eye and looked abstractedly at the light through his glass of pale yellow brauneberger with the other england yes england well see miss you hev not been raised in business business is business the way to do it in germany isto manufacture for yourself and ive got my works started right here in frankfort the way to do it in englandwhere capitals dirt cheapis to sell your patent for every cent its worth to an english company and let them boom or bust on it  i see i said catching at it the principles as clear as mud the moment you point it out to one an english company will pay you well for the concession and work for a smaller return on its investment than you americans are content to receive on your capital  thats so you hit it in one miss which will you take a cigar or a cocoanut  i smiled and what do you think you will call the machine in europe  he gazed hard at me and stroked his strawcoloured moustache well what do you think of the lois cayley  for heavens sake no i cried fervently mr hitchcock i implore you  he smiled pity for my weakness ah hightoned again he repeated as if it were some natural malformation under which i laboured oh ef you dont like it miss well say no more about it i am a gentleman i am whats the matter with the excelsior  nothing except that its very bad latin i objected  that may be so but its very good business  he paused and mused then he murmured low to himself when through an alpine village passed thats where the idea of the excelsior comes in see it goes up mont blanc you said yourself through snow and ice a cycle with the strange device excelsior  if i were you i said i would stick to the name manitou its original and its distinctive  think so then chalk it up the things done you may not be aware of it miss but you are a lady for whose opinion in such matters i hev a high regard and you understand europe i do not i admit it everything seems to me to be verboten in germany and everything else to be bad form in england  we walked down the steps together what a picturesque old town i said looking round me well pleased its beauty appealed to me for i had fifty pounds in pocket and i had lunched sumptuously  old town he repeated gazing with a blank stare you call this town old do you  why of course just look at the cathedral eight hundred years old at least  he ran his eye down the streets dissatisfied  well ef this town is old he said at last with a snap of his fingers its precious little for its age and he strode away towards the railway station  what about the bicycle i asked for it lay a silent victor against the railing of the steps surrounded by a crowd of inquiring teutons  he glanced at it carelessly oh the wheel he said you may keep it  he said it so exactly in the tone in which one tells a waiter he may keep the change that i resented the impertinence no thank you i answered i do not require it  he gazed at me openmouthed what put my foot in it again he interposed not hightoned enough eh now i do regret it no offence meant miss nor none need be taken what i meant to insinuate was this you hev won the big race for me folks will notice you and talk about you at frankfort ef you ride a manitou thatll make em talk the more a mutual advantage benefits you benefits me you get the wheel i get the advertizement  i saw that reciprocity was the lodestar of his life very well mr hitchcock i said pocketing my pride ill accept the machine and ill ride it  then a light dawned upon me i saw eventualities look here i went on innocentlyrecollect i was a girl just fresh from girtoni am thinking of going on very soon to switzerland now why shouldnt i do thistry to sell your machines or rather take orders for them from anybody that admires them a mutual advantage benefits you benefits me you sell your wheels i get  he stared at me the commission  i dont know what commission means i answered somewhat at sea as to the name but i thought it might be worth your while till the manitou becomes better known to pay me say ten per cent on all orders i brought you  his face was one broad smile i do admire at you miss he cried standing still to inspect me you may not know the meaning of the word commission but durned ef you havent got a hang of the thing itself that would do honour to a wall street operator anyway  then thats business i asked eagerly for i beheld vistas  business he repeated yes thats jest about the size of itbusiness advertizement miss may be the soul of commerce but commissions its body you go in and win ten per cent on every order you send me  he insisted on taking my ticket back to frankfort my affair miss my affair there was no gainsaying him he was immensely elated the biggest thing in cycles since dunlop tyres he repeated and tomorrow theyll give me advertizements gratis in every newspaper  next morning he came round to call on me at the abode of unclaimed domestic angels he was explicit and generous look here miss he began i didnt do fair by you when you interviewed me about your agency last evening i took advantage at the time of your youth and inexperience you suggested 10 per cent as the amount of your commission on sales you might effect and i jumped at it that was conduct unworthy of a gentleman now i will not deceive you the ordinary commission on transactions in wheels is 25 per cent i am going to sell the manitou retail at twenty english pounds apiece you shall hev your 25 per cent on all orders  five pounds for every machine i sell i exclaimed overjoyed  he nodded thats so  i was simply amazed at this magnificent prospect the cycle trade must be honeycombed with middlemens profits i cried for i had my misgivings  thats so he replied again then jest you take and be a middlewoman  but as a consistent socialist  it is your duty to fleece the capitalist and the consumer a mutual benefittriangular this time i get the order the public gets the machine and you get the commission i am richer you are richer and the public is mounted on much the best wheel ever yet invented  that sounds plausible i admitted i shall try it on in switzerland i shall run up steep hills whenever i see any likely customers looking on then i shall stop and ask them the time as if quite accidentally  he rubbed his hands you take to business like a young duck to the water he exclaimed admiringly thats the way to rake em in you go up and say to them why not investigate we defy competition leave the drudgery of walking uphill beside your cycle progress is the order of the day use modern methods this is the age of the telegraph the telephone and the typewriter you kin no longer afford to go on with an antiquated antediluvian armourplated wheel invest in a hillclimber the last and lightest product of evvolootion is it commonsense to buy an oldstyle unautomatic singlegeared inconvertible tenton machine when for the same money or less you can purchase the selfacting manitou a priceless gem as light as a feather with all the most recent additions and improvements be reasonable get the best thats the style to fetch em  i laughed in spite of myself oh mr hitchcock i burst out thats not my style at all i shall say simply this is a lovely new bicycle you can see for yourself how it climbs hills try it if you wish it skims like a swallow and i get what they call five pounds commission on every one i can sell of them i think that way of dealing is much more likely to bring you in orders  his admiration was undisguised well i do call you a woman of business miss he cried you see it at a glance thats so thats the right kind of thing to rope in the europeans some originality about you you take em on their own ground youve got the draw on them you hev i like your system youll jest haul in the dollars  i hope so i said fervently for i had evolved in my own mind oh such a lovely scheme for elsie petheridges holidays  he gazed at me once more ef only i could get hold of a woman of business like you to soar through life with me he murmured  illustration his open admiration was getting quite embarrassing  i grew interested in my shoes his open admiration was getting quite embarrassing  he paused a minute then he went on well what do you say to it  to what i asked amazed  to my propositionmy offer  i i dont understand i stammered out bewildered the 25 per cent you mean  no the devotion of a lifetime he answered looking sideways at me miss cayley when a business man advances a proposition commercial or otherwise he advances it because he means it he asks a prompt reply your time is valuable so is mine are you prepared to consider it  mr hitchcock i said drawing back i think you misunderstand i think you do not realise  all right miss he answered promptly though with a disappointed air ef it kin not be managed it kin not be managed i understand your european exclusiveness i know your prejudices but this little episode need not antagonise with the normal course of ordinary business i respect you miss cayley you are a lady of intelligence of initiative and of hightoned culture i will wish you good day for the present without further words and i shall be happy at any time to receive your orders on the usual commission  he backed out and was gone he was so honestly blunt that i really quite liked him  next day i bade a tearless farewell to the blighted fraus when i told those eight phlegmatic souls i was going they all said so much as they had said so to every previous remark i had been moved to make to them so is capital garnishing but viewed as a staple of conversation i find it a trifle vapid not to say monotonous  i set out on my wanderings therefore to go round the world on my own account and my own manitou which last i grew to love in time with a love passing the love of mr cyrus hitchcock i carried the strict necessary before me in a small waterproof bicycling valise but i sent on the portmanteau containing my whole estate real or personal to some point in advance which i hoped to reach from time to time in a day or two my first days journey was along a pleasant road from frankfort to heidelberg some fiftyfour miles in all skirting the mountains the greater part of the way the manitou took the ups and downs so easily that i diverged at intervals to choose sidepaths over the wooded hills i arrived at heidelberg as fresh as a daisy my mount not having turned a hair meanwhilea favourite expression of cyclists which carries all the more conviction to an impartial mind because of the machine being obviously hairless thence i journeyed on by easy stages to karlsruhe baden appenweier and offenburg where i set my front wheel resolutely for the black forest it is the prettiest and most picturesque route to switzerland and being also the hilliest it would afford me i thought the best opportunity for showing off the manitous paces and trying my prentice hand as an amateur cycleagent  from the quaint little black eagle at offenburg however before i dashed into the forest i sent off a letter to elsie petheridge setting forth my lovely scheme for her summer holidays she was delicate poor child and the london winters sorely tried her i was now a millionaire with the better part of fifty pounds in pocket so i felt i could afford to be royal in my hospitality as i was leaving frankfort i had called at a tourist agency and bought a secondclass circular ticket from london to lucerne and back i made it secondclass because i am opposed on principle to excessive luxury and also because it was three guineas cheaper even fifty pounds will not last for ever though i could scarce believe it you see i am not wholly free after all from the besetting british vice of prudence it was a mighty joy to me to be able to send this ticket to elsie at her lodgings in bayswater pointing out to her that now the whole mischief was done and that if she would not come out as soon as her summer vacation begantwas a point of honour with elsie to say vacation instead of holidaysto join me at lucerne and stop with me as my guest at a mountain pension the ticket would be wasted i love burning my boats tis the only safe way for securing prompt action  then i turned my flying wheels up into the black forest growing weary of my lonelinessfor it is not all jam to ride by oneself in germanyand longing for elsie to come out and join me i loved to think how her dear pale cheeks would gain colour and tone on the hills about the brünig where for business reasons so i said to myself with the conscious pride of the commission agent i proposed to pass the greater part of the summer  from offenburg to hornberg the road makes a good stiff climb of twentyseven miles and some 1200 english feet in altitude with a fair number of minor undulations on the way to diversify it i will not describe the route though it is one of the most beautiful i have ever travelledrocky hills ruined castles huge straightstemmed pines that clamber up green slopes or halt in sombre line against steeps of broken crag the reality surpasses my poor powers of description and the people i passed on the road were almost as quaint and picturesque in their way as the hills and the villagesthe men in redlined jackets the women in black petticoats shortwaisted green bodices and broadbrimmed straw hats with blackandcrimson pompons but on the steepest gradient just before reaching hornberg i got my first nibblestrange to say from two german students they wore heidelberg caps and were toiling up the incline with short broken wind i put on a spurt with the manitou and passed them easily i did it just at first in pure wantonness of health and strength but the moment i was clear of them it occurred to the business half of me that here was a good chance of taking an order filled with this bright idea i dismounted near the summit and pretended to be engaged in lubricating my bearings though as a matter of fact the manitou runs in a bath of oil selffeeding and needs no looking after presently my two heidelbergers straggled uphot dusty panting womanlike i pretended to take no notice one of them drew near and cast an eye on the manitou  thats a new machine fräulein he said at last with more politeness than i expected  it is i answered casually the latest model climbs hills like no other and i feigned to mount and glide off towards hornberg  stop a moment pray fräulein my prospective buyer called out here heinrich i wish you this new so excellent mountainclimbing machine without chain propelled more fully to investigate  i am going on to hornberg i said with mixed feminine guile and commercial strategy still if your friend wishes to look  illustration minute inspection  they both jostled round it with achs innumerable and after minute inspection pronounced its principle wunderschön might i essay it heinrich asked  oh by all means i answered he paced it down hill a few yards then skimmed up again  it is a bird he cried to his friend with many guttural interjections like the eagles flight so soars it come try the thing ludwig  you permit fräulein  i nodded they both mounted it several times it behaved like a beauty then one of them asked and where can man of this new so remarkable machine nearest by purchase himself make possessor  i am the sole agent i burst out with swelling dignity if you will give me your orders with cash in hand for the amount i will send the cycle carriage paid to any address you desire in germany  you they exclaimed incredulously the fräulein is pleased to be humorous  oh very well i answered vaulting into the saddle if you choose to doubt my word i waved one careless hand and coasted off goodmorning meine herren  they lumbered after me on their ramshackled tractionengines pardon fräulein do not thus go away oblige us at least with the name and address of the maker  i perpendedlike the herr oversuperintendent at frankfort look here i said at last telling the truth with frankness i get 25 per cent on all bicycles i sell i am as i say the makers sole agent if you order through me i touch my profit if otherwise i do not still since you seem to be gentlemen they bowed and swelled visibly i will give you the address of the firm trusting to your honour to mention my namei handed them a cardif you decide on ordering the price of the palfrey is 400 marks it is worth every pfennig of it and before they could say more i had spurred my steed and swept off at full speed round a curve of the highway  i pencilled a note to my american that night from hornberg detailing the circumstance but i am sorry to say for the discredit of humanity that when those two students wrote the same evening from their inn in the village to order manitous they did not mention my name doubtless under the misconception that by suppressing it they would save my commission however it gives me pleasure to add per contra as we say in business that when i arrived at lucerne a week or so later i found a letter poste restante from mr cyrus hitchcock inclosing an english tenpound note he wrote that he had received two orders for manitous from hornberg and feeling considerable confidence that these must necessarily originate from my german students he had the pleasure of forwarding me what he hoped would be the first of many similar commissions  illustration felt a perfect little hypocrite  i will not describe my further adventures on the still steeper mountain road from hornberg to triberg and st georgenhow i got bites on the way from an english curate an austrian hussar and two unprotected american ladies nor how i angled for them all by riding my machine up impossible hills and then reclining gracefully to eat my lunch three times in one day on mossy banks at the summit i felt a perfect little hypocrite but mr hitchcock had remarked that business is business and i will only add in confirmation of his view that by the time i reached lucerne i had sown the good seed in fifteen separate human souls no less than four of which brought forth fruit in orders for manitous before the end of the season  i had now so little fear what the morrow might bring forth that i settled down in a comfortable hotel at lucerne till elsies holidays began and amused myself meanwhile by picking out the hilliest roads i could find in the neighbourhood in order to display my steel steeds possibilities to the best advantage  by the end of july elsie joined me she was halfangry at first that i should have forced the ticket and my hospitality upon her  nonsense dear i said smoothing her hair for her pale face quite frightened me what is the good of a friend if she will not allow you to do her little favours  but brownie you said you wouldnt stop and be dependent upon me one day longer than was necessary in london  that was different i cried that was me this is you i am a great strong healthy thing fit to fight the battle of life and take care of myself you elsie are one of those fragile little flowers which tis everybodys duty to protect and to care for  she would have protested more but i stifled her mouth with kisses indeed for nothing did i rejoice in my prosperity so much as for the chance it gave me of helping poor dear overworked overwrought elsie  we took up our quarters thenceforth at a highperched little guesthouse near the top of the brünig it was bracing for elsie and it lay close to a tourist track where i could spread my snares and exhibit the manitou in its true colours to many passing visitors elsie tried it and found she could ride on it with ease she wished she had one of her own a bright idea struck me in fear and trembling i wrote suggesting to mr hitchcock that i had a girl friend from england stopping with me in switzerland and that two manitous would surely be better than one as an advertizement i confess i stood aghast at my own cheek but my hand i fear was rapidly growing subdued to that it worked in anyhow i sent the letter off and waited developments  by return of post came an answer from my american       dear missby rail herewith please receive one ladys no 4      automatic quadruplegeared selffeeding manitou as per your      esteemed favour of july 27th for which i desire to thank you the      more i see of your way of doing business the more i do admire at      you this is an elegant poster two hightoned english ladies      mounted on manitous careering up the alps represent to both of      us quite a mint of money the mutual benefit to me to you and      to the other lady ought to be simply incalculable i shall be      pleased at any time to hear of any further developments of your      very remarkable advertising skill and i am obliged to you for      this brilliant suggestion you have been good enough to make to      merespectfully    cyrus w hitchcock  what am i to have it for nothing brownie elsie exclaimed bewildered when i read the letter to her  i assumed the airs of a woman of the world why certainly my dear i answered as if i always expected to find bicycles showered upon me its a mutual arrangement benefits him benefits you reciprocity is the groundwork of business he gets the advertisement you get the amusement its a form of handbill like the ladies who exhibit their back hair dont you know in that window in regent street  thus inexpensively mounted we scoured the country together up the steepest hills between stanzstadt and meiringen we had lots of nibbles one lady in particular often stopped to look on and admire the manitou she was a nicelooking widow of fortyfive very fresh and roundfaced a mrs evelegh we soon found out who owned a charming chalet on the hills above lungern she spoke to us more than once what a perfect dear of a machine she cried i wonder if i dare try it  can you cycle i asked  i could once she answered i was awfully fond of it but dr fortescuelangley wont let me any longer  try it i said dismounting she got up and rode oh isnt it just lovely she cried ecstatically  buy one i put in theyre as smooth as silk they cost only twenty pounds and on every machine i sell i get five pounds commission  i should love to she answered but dr fortescuelangley  who is he i asked i dont believe in drugdrenchers  she looked quite shocked oh hes not that kind you know she put in breathlessly hes the celebrated esoteric faithhealer he wont let me move far away from lungern though im longing to be off to england again for the summer my boys at portsmouth  then why dont you disobey him  her face was a study i darent she answered in an awestruck voice he comes here every summer and he does me so much good you know he diagnoses my inner self he treats me psychically when my inner self goes wrong my bangle turns dusky she held up her right hand with an indian silver bangle on it and sure enough it was tarnished with a very thin black deposit my soul is ailing now she said in a comically serious voice but it is seldom so in switzerland the moment i land in england the bangle turns black and remains black till i get back to lucerne again  when she had gone i said to elsie that is odd about the bangle state of health might affect it i suppose though it looks to me like a surface deposit of sulphide i knew nothing of chemistry i admit but i had sometimes messed about in the laboratory at college with some of the other girls and i remembered now that sulphide of silver was a blackishlooking body like the film on the bangle  however at the time i thought no more about it  illustration she invited elsie and myself to stop with her  by dint of stopping and talking we soon got quite intimate with mrs evelegh as always happens i found out i had known some of her cousins in edinburgh where i always spent my holidays while i was at girton she took an interest in what she was kind enough to call my originality and before a fortnight was out our hotel being uncomfortably crowded she had invited elsie and myself to stop with her at the chalet we went and found it a delightful little home mrs evelegh was charming but we could see at every turn that dr fortescuelangley had acquired a firm hold over her hes so clever you know she said and so spiritual he exercises such strong odylic force he binds my being together if he misses a visit i feel my inner self goes all to pieces  does he come often i asked growing interested  oh dear no she answered i wish he did it would be ever so good for me but hes so much run after i am but one among many he lives at château doex and comes across to see patients in this district once a fortnight it is a privilege to be attended by an intuitive seer like dr fortescuelangley  mrs evelegh was richleft comfortably as the phrase goes but with a clause which prevented her marrying again without losing her fortune and i could gather from various hints that dr fortescuelangley whoever he might be was bleeding her to some tune using her soul and her inner self as his financial lancet i also noticed that what she said about the bangle was strictly true generally bright as a new pin on certain mornings it was completely blackened i had been at the chalet ten days however before i began to suspect the real reason then it dawned upon me one morning in a flash of inspiration the evening before had been cold for at the height where we were perched even in august we often found the temperature chilly in the night and i heard mrs evelegh tell cécile her maid to fill the hotwater bottle it was a small point but it somehow went home to me next day the bangle was black and mrs evelegh lamented that her inner self must be suffering from an attack of evil vapours  i held my peace at the time but i asked cécile a little later to bring me that hotwaterbottle as i more than half suspected it was made of indiarubber wrapped carefully up in the usual red flannel bag lend me your brooch elsie i said i want to try a little experiment  wont a franc do as well elsie asked tendering one thats equally silver  i think not i answered a franc is most likely too hard it has base metal to alloy it but i will vary the experiment by trying both together your brooch is indian and therefore soft silver the native jewellers never use alloy hand it over it will clean with a little platepowder if necessary im going to see what blackens mrs eveleghs bangle  i laid the franc and the brooch on the bottle filled with hot water and placed them for warmth in the fold of a blanket after déjeûner we inspected them as i anticipated the brooch had grown black on the surface with a thin iridescent layer of silver sulphide while the franc had hardly suffered at all from the exposure  i called in mrs evelegh and explained what i had done she was astonished and half incredulous how could you ever think of it she cried admiringly  why i was reading an article yesterday about indiarubber in one of your magazines i answered and the person who wrote it said the raw gum was hardened for vulcanising by mixing it with sulphur when i heard you ask cécile for the hotwaterbottle i thought at once the sulphur and the heat account for the tarnishing of mrs eveleghs bangle  and the franc doesnt tarnish then that must be why my other silver bracelet which is english make and harder never changes colour and dr fortescuelangley assured me it was because the soft one was of indian metal and had mystic symbols on itsymbols that answered to the cardinal moods of my subconscious self and that darkened in sympathy  i jumped at a clue he talked about your subconscious self i broke in  yes she answered he always does its the keynote of his system he heals by that alone but my dear after this how can i ever believe in him  does he know about the hotwaterbottle i asked  oh yes he ordered me to use it on certain nights and when i go to england he says i must never be without one i see now that was why my inner self invariably went wrong in england it was all just the sulphur blackening the bangles  i reflected a middleaged man i asked stout diplomaticlooking with wrinkles round his eyes and a distinguished grey moustache twirled up oddly at the corners  thats the man my dear his very picture where on earth have you seen him  and he talks of subconscious selves i went on  he practises on that basis he says its no use prescribing for the outer man to do that is to treat mere symptoms the subconscious self is the inner seat of diseases  how long has he been in switzerland  oh he comes here every year he arrived this season late in may i fancy  when will he visit you again mrs evelegh  tomorrow morning  i made up my mind at once then i must see him without being seen i said i think i know him he is our count i believe for i had told mrs evelegh and elsie the queer story of my journey from london  impossible my dear impossible i have implicit faith in him  wait and see mrs evelegh you acknowledge he duped you over the affair of the bangle  illustration the count  there are two kinds of dupe one kind the commonest goes on believing in its deceiver no matter what happens the other far rarer has the sense to know it has been deceived if you make the deception as clear as day to it mrs evelegh was fortunately of the rarer class next morning dr fortescuelangley arrived by appointment as he walked up the path i glanced at him from my window it was the count not a doubt of it on his way to gull his dupes in switzerland he had tried to throw in an incidental trifle of a diamond robbery  i telegraphed the facts at once to lady georgina at schlangenbad she answered i am coming ask the man to meet his friend on wednesday  mrs evelegh now almost convinced invited him on wednesday morning with a bounce lady georgina burst in upon us my dear such a journeyalone at my agebut there i havent known a happy day since you left me oh yes i got my gretchenunsophisticated wellhmthats not the word for it i declare to you lois there isnt a trick of the trade in paris or londonnot a perquisite or a tip that that girl isnt up to comes straight from the remotest recesses of the black forest and hadnt been with me a week i assure you honour bright before she was bandolining her yellow hair and rouging her cheeks and wearing my brooches and wagering gloves with the hotel waiters upon the baden races and her language and her manners why werent you born in that station of life i wonder child so that i might offer you five hundred a year and all found to come and live with me for ever but this gretchenher fringe her shoes her ribbonsupon my soul my dear i dont know what girls are coming to nowadays  ask mrs lynnlinton i suggested as she paused she is a recognised authority on the subject  the cantankerous old lady stared at me and this count she went on so you have really tracked him youre a wonderful girl my dear i wish you were a ladys maid youd be worth me any money  i explained how i had come to hear of dr fortescuelangley  lady georgina waxed warm dr fortescuelangley she exclaimed the wicked wretch but he didnt get my diamonds ive carried them here in my hands all the way from wiesbaden i wasnt going to leave them for a single day to the tender mercies of that unspeakable gretchen the fool would lose them well well catch him this time lois and well give him ten years for it  ten years mrs evelegh cried clasping her hands in horror oh lady georgina  we waited in mrs eveleghs diningroom the old lady and i behind the folding doors at three precisely dr fortescuelangley walked in i had difficulty in restraining lady georgina from falling upon him prematurely he talked a lot of highflown nonsense to mrs evelegh and elsie about the influences of the planets and the seventyfive emanations and the eternal wisdom of the east and the medical efficacy of subconscious suggestion excellent patter all of itquite as good in its way as the diplomatic patter he had poured forth in the train to lady georgina it was rich in spheres in elements in cosmic forces at last as he was discussing the reciprocal action of the inner self upon the exhalations of the lungs we pushed back the door and walked calmly in upon him  his breath came and went the exhalations of the lungs showed visible perturbation he rose and stared at us for a second he lost his composure then as bold as brass he turned with a cunning smile to mrs evelegh where on earth did you pick up such acquaintances he inquired in a wellsimulated tone of surprise yes lady georgina i have met you before i admit butit can hardly be agreeable to you to reflect under what circumstances  lady georgina was beside herself you dare she cried confronting him you dare to brazen it out you miserable sneak but you cant bluff me now i have the police outside which i regret to confess was a lighthearted fiction  the police he echoed drawing back i could see he was frightened  i had an inspiration again take off that moustache i said calmly in my most commanding voice  illustration i thought it kinder to him to remove it altogether  he clapped his hand to it in horror in his agitation he managed to pull it a little bit awry it looked so absurd hanging there all crooked that i thought it kinder to him to remove it altogether the thing peeled off with difficulty for it was a work of art very firmly and gracefully fastened with stickingplaster but it peeled off at lastand with it the whole of the counts and dr fortescuelangleys distinction the man stood revealed a very palpable manservant  lady georgina stared hard at him where have i seen you before she murmured slowly that face is familiar to me why yes you went once to italy as mr marmaduke ashursts courier i know you now your name is higginson  it was a comedown for the comte de larochesurloiret but he swallowed it like a man at a single gulp  yes my lady he said fingering his hat nervously now all was up you are quite right my lady but what would you have me do times are hard on us couriers nobody wants us now i must take to what i can he assumed once more the tone of the vienna diplomat que voulezvous madame these are revolutionary days a man of intelligence must move with the zeitgeist  lady georgina burst into a loud laugh and to think she cried that i talked to this lackey from london to malines without ever suspecting him higginson youre a fraudbut youre a precious clever one  he bowed i am happy to have merited lady georgina fawleys commendation he answered with his palm on his heart in his grandiose manner  but i shall hand you over to the police all the same you are a thief and a swindler  he assumed a comic expression unhappily not a thief he objected this young lady prevented me from appropriating your diamonds convey the wise call it i wanted to take your jewelcaseand she put me off with a sandwichtin i wanted to make an honest penny out of mrs evelegh andshe confronts me with your ladyship and tears my moustache off  lady georgina regarded him with a hesitating expression but i shall call the police she said wavering visibly  de grace my lady de grace is it worth while pour si peu de chose consider i have really effected nothing will you charge me with having takenin errora small tin sandwichcasevalue elevenpence an affair of a weeks imprisonment that is positively all you can bring up against me and brightening up visibly i have the case still i will return it tomorrow with pleasure to your ladyship  but the indiarubber waterbottle i put in you have been deceiving mrs evelegh it blackens silver and you told her lies in order to extort money under false pretences  he shrugged his shoulders you are too clever for me young lady he broke out i have nothing to say to you but lady georgina mrs eveleghyou are humanlet me go reflect i have things i could tell that would make both of you look ridiculous that journey to malines lady georgina those indian charms mrs evelegh besides you have spoiled my game let that suffice you i can practise in switzerland no longer allow me to go in peace and i will try once more to be indifferent honest  illustration inch by inch he retreated  he backed slowly towards the door with his eyes fixed on them i stood by and waited inch by inch he retreated lady georgina looked down abstractedly at the carpet mrs evelegh looked up abstractedly at the ceiling neither spoke another word the rogue backed out by degrees then he sprang downstairs and before they could decide was well out into the open  lady georgina was the first to break the silence after all my dear she murmured turning to me there was a deal of sound english commonsense about dogberry  i remembered then his charge to the watch to apprehend a rogue how if a will not stand  why then take no note of him but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank god you are rid of a knave when i remembered how lady georgina had hobnobbed with the count from ostend to malines i agreed to a great extent both with her and with dogberry     v  the adventure of the impromptu mountaineer   the explosion and evaporation of dr fortescuelangley with whom were amalgamated the comte de larochesurloiret mr higginson the courier and whatever else that versatile gentleman chose to call himself entailed many results of varying magnitudes  in the first place mrs evelegh ordered a great manitou that however mattered little to the firm as i loved to call us because it shocked dear elsie so for of course after all her kindness we couldnt accept our commission on her purchase so that she got her machine cheap for £15 from the maker but in the second placei declare i am beginning to write like a woman of businessshe decided to run over to england for the summer to see her boy at portsmouth being certain now that the discoloration of her bangle depended more on the presence of sulphur in the indiarubber bottle than on the passing state of her astral body tis an abrupt descent from the inner self to a hotwater bottle i admit but mrs evelegh took the plunge with grace like a sensible woman dr fortescuelangley had been annihilated for her at one blow she returned forthwith to commonsense and england  what will you do with the chalet while youre away lady georgina asked when she announced her intention you cant shut it up to take care of itself every blessed thing in the place will go to rack and ruin shutting up a house means spoiling it for ever why ive got a cottage of my own that i let for the summer in the best part of surreya pretty little place now vacant for which by the way i want a tenant if you happen to know of one and when its left empty for a month or two  perhaps it would do for me mrs evelegh suggested jumping at it im looking out for a furnished house for the summer within easy reach of portsmouth and london for myself and oliver  lady georgina seized her arm with a face of blank horror my dear she cried for you i wouldnt dream of letting it to you a nasty damp cold unwholesome house on stiff clay soil with detestable drains in the deadliest part of the weald of surreywhy you and your boy would catch your deaths of rheumatism  is it the one i saw advertised in the times this morning i wonder mrs evelegh inquired in a placid voice charming furnished house on holmesdale common six bedrooms four receptionrooms splendid views pure air picturesque surroundings exceptionally situated i thought of writing about it  illustration never leave a house to the servants my dear  thats it lady georgina exclaimed with a demonstrative wave of her hand i drew up the advertisement myself exceptionally situated i should just think it was why my dear i wouldnt let you rent the place for worlds a horrid poky little hole stuck down in the bottom of a boggy hollow as damp as devonshire with the paper peeling off the walls so that i had to take my choice between giving it up myself ten years ago or removing to the cemetery and ive let it ever since to city men with large families nothing would induce me to allow you and your boy to expose yourself to such risks for lady georgina had taken quite a fancy to mrs evelegh but what i was just going to say was this you cant shut your house up itll all go mouldy houses always go mouldy shut up in summer and you cant leave it to your servants i know the baggages no conscienceno conscience theyll ask their entire families to come and stop with them en bloc and turn your place into a perfect piggery why when i went away from my house in town one autumn didnt i leave a policeman and his wife in chargea most respectable manonly he happened to be an irishman and what was the consequence my dear i assure you i came back unexpectedly from poor dear kynastons one dayat a moments noticehaving quarrelled with him over home rule or education or somethingpoor dear kynastons what they call a liberal i believegot at by that man roseberyand there didnt i find all the oflanagans and oflahertys and oflynns in the neighbourhood camping out in my drawingroom with a strong detachment of odonohues and odohertys and odriscolls lying around loose in possession of the library never leave a house to the servants my dear its positively suicidal put in a responsible caretaker of whom you know somethinglike lois here for instance  lois mrs evelegh echoed dear me thats just the very thing what a capital idea i never thought of lois she and elsie might stop on here with ursula and the gardener  i protested that if we did it was our clear duty to pay a small rent but mrs evelegh brushed that aside youve robbed yourselves over the bicycle she insisted and im delighted to let you have it its i who ought to pay for youll keep the house dry for me  i remembered mr hitchcockmutual advantage benefits you benefits meand made no bones about it so in the end mrs evelegh set off for england with cécile leaving elsie and me in charge of ursula the gardener and the chalet  as for lady georgina having by this time completed her cure at schlangenbad complexion as usual no guinea yellower she telegraphed for gretcheni cant do without the idiotand hung round lucerne apparently for no other purpose but to send people up the brünig on the hunt for our wonderful new machines and so put money in our pockets she was much amused when i told her that aunt susan who lived you will remember in respectable indigence at blackheath had written to expostulate with me on my unladylike conduct in becoming a bicycle commission agent unladylikethe cantankerous old lady exclaimed with warmth what does the woman mean has she got no gumption its ladylike i suppose to be a companion or a governess or a musicteacher or something else in the blackthreadglove way in london but not to sell bicycles for a good round commission my dear between you and me i dont see it if you had a brother now he might sell cycles or corner wheat or rig the share market or do anything else he pleased in these days and nobodyd think the worse of himas long as he made money and its my opinion that what is sauce for the goose cant be far out for the ganderand viceversâ besides which whats the use of trying to be ladylike you are a lady child and you couldnt help being one why trouble to be like what nature made you tell aunt susan from me to put that in her pipe and smoke it  i did tell aunt susan by letter giving lady georginas authority for the statement and i really believe it had a consoling effect upon her for aunt susan is one of those innocentminded people who cherish a profound respect for the opinions and ideas of a lady of title especially where questions of delicacy are concerned it calmed her to think that though i an officers daughter had declined upon trade i was mixing at least with the best people  we had a lovely time at the chalettwo girls alone messing just as we pleased in the kitchen and learning from ursula how to concoct potaufeu in the most approved swiss fashion we pottered as we women love to potter half the day long the other half we spent in riding our cycles about the eternal hills and ensnaring the flies whom lady georgina dutifully sent up to us she was our decoy duck and in virtue of her handle she decoyed to a marvel indeed i sold so many manitous that i began to entertain a deep respect for my own commercial faculties as for mr cyrus w hitchcock he wrote to me from frankfort the world continues to revolve on its axis the manitou and the machine is booming orders romp in daily when you ventilated the suggestion of an agency at limburg i concluded at a glance you had the material of a firstclass business woman about you but i reckon i did not know what a traveller meant till you started on the road i am now enlarging and altering this factory to meet increased demands branch offices at berlin hamburg crefeld and düsseldorf inspect our stock before dealing elsewhere a liberal discount allowed to the trade two hundred agents wanted in all towns of germany if they were every one of them like you misswell i guess i would hire the town of frankfort for my business premises  one morning after we had spent about a week at the chalet by ourselves i was surprised to see a young man with a knapsack on his back walking up the garden path towards our cottage quick quick elsie i cried being in a mischievous mood come here with the operaglass theres a man in the offing  a what elsie exclaimed shocked as usual at my levity  a man i answered squeezing her arm a man a real live man a specimen of the masculine gender in the human being man ahoy he has come at lastthe lodestar of our existence  next minute i was sorry i spoke for as the man drew nearer i perceived that he was endowed with very long legs and a languidly poetical bearing that supercilious smilethat enticing moustache could it beyes it wasnot a doubt of itharold tillington  i grew grave at once harold tillington and the situation were serious what can he want here i exclaimed drawing back  who is it elsie asked for being a woman she read at once in my altered demeanour the fact that the man was not unknown to me  lady georginas nephew i answered with a telltale cheek i fear you remember i mentioned to you that i had met him at schlangenbad but this is really too bad of that wicked old lady georgina she has told him where we lived and sent him up to see us  perhaps elsie put in he wants to charter a bicycle  i glanced at elsie sideways i had an uncomfortable suspicion that she said it slyly like one who knew he wanted nothing of the sort but at any rate i brushed the suggestion aside frankly nonsense i answered he wants me not a bicycle  he came up to us waving his hat he did look handsome well miss cayley he cried from afar i have tracked you to your lair i have found out where you abide what a beautiful spot and how well youre looking  this is an unexpected i paused he thought i was going to say pleasure but i finished it intrusion his face fell how did you know we were at lungern mr tillington  my respected relative he answered laughing she mentionedcasually his eyes met minethat you were stopping in a chalet and as i was on my way back to the diplomatic mill i thought i might just as well walk over the grimsel and the furca and then on to the gotthard the court is at monza so it occurred to me  that in passing  i might venture to drop in and say howdoyoudo to you  thank you i answered severelybut my heart spoke otherwisei do very well and you mr tillington  badly he echoed badly since you went away from schlangenbad  i gazed at his dusty feet you are tramping i said cruelly i suppose you will get forward for lunch to meiringen  i i did not contemplate it  indeed  he grew bolder no to say the truth i half hoped i might stop and spend the day here with you  elsie i remarked firmly if mr tillington persists in planting himself upon us like this one of us must go and investigate the kitchen department  elsie rose like a lamb i have an impression that she gathered we wanted to be left alone  illustration i may stay maynt i  he turned to me imploringly lois he cried stretching out his arms with an appealing air i may stay maynt i  i tried to be stern but i fear twas a feeble pretence we are two girls alone in a house i answered lady georgina as a matron of experience ought to have protected us merely to give you lunch is almost irregular good diplomatic word irregular still in these days i suppose you may stay if you leave early in the afternoon thats the utmost i can do for you  you are not gracious he cried gazing at me with a wistful look  i did not dare to be gracious uninvited guests must not quarrel with their welcome i answered severely then the woman in me broke forth but indeed mr tillington i am glad to see you  he leaned forward eagerly so you are not angry with me lois i may call you lois  i trembled and hesitated i am not angry with you i i like you too much to be ever angry with you and i am glad you camejust this onceto see me yeswhen we are aloneyou may call me lois  he tried to seize my hand i withdrew it then i may perhaps hope he began that some day  i shook my head no no i said regretfully you misunderstand me i like you very much and i like to see you but as long as you are rich and have prospects like yours i could never marry you my pride wouldnt let me take that as final  i looked away he bent forward again but if i were poor he put in eagerly  i hesitated then my heart rose and i gave way if ever you are poor i falteredpenniless hunted friendlesscome to me harold and i will help and comfort you but not till then not till then i implore you  he leant back and clasped his hands you have given me something to live for dear lois he murmured i will try to be poorpenniless hunted friendless to win you i will try and when that day arrives i shall come to claim you  we sat for an hour and had a delicious talkabout nothing but we understood each other only that artificial barrier divided us at the end of the hour i heard elsie coming back by judiciously slow stages from the kitchen to the livingroom through six feet of passage discoursing audibly to ursula all the way with a tardiness that did honour to her heart and her understanding dear kind little elsie i believe she had never a tiny romance of her own yet her sympathy for others was sweet to look upon  we lunched at a small deal table in the veranda around us rose the pinnacles the scent of pines and moist moss was in the air elsie had arranged the flowers and got ready the omelette and cooked the chicken cutlets and prepared the junket i never thought i could do it alone without you brownie but i tried and it all came right by magic somehow we laughed and talked incessantly harold was in excellent cue and elsie took to him a livelier or merrier table there wasnt in the twentytwo cantons that day than ours under the sapphire sky looking out on the sunsmitten snows of the jungfrau  after lunch harold begged hard to be allowed to stop for tea i had misgivings but i gave wayhe was such good company one may as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb says the wisdom of our ancestors and after all mrs grundy was only represented here by elsie the gentlest and least censorious of her daughters so he stopped and chatted till four when i made tea and insisted on dismissing him he meant to take the rough mountain path over the screes from lungern to meiringen which ran right behind the chalet i feared lest he might be belated and urged him to hurry  thanks im happier here he answered  i was sternness itself you promised me i said in a reproachful voice  he rose instantly and bowed your will is laweven when it pronounces sentence of exile  would we walk a little way with him no i faltered we would not we would follow him with the operaglasses and wave him farewell when he reached the kulm he shook our hands unwillingly and turned up the little path looking handsomer than ever it led ascending through a firwood to the rockstrewn hillside  once a quarter of an hour later we caught a glimpse of him near a sharp turn in the road after that we waited in vain with our eyes fixed on the kulm not a sign could we discern of him at last i grew anxious he ought to be there i cried fuming  he ought elsie answered  i swept the slopes with the operaglasses anxiety and interest in him quickened my senses i suppose look here elsie i burst out at last just take this glass and have a glance at those birds down the crag below the kulm dont they seem to be circling and behaving most oddly  elsie gazed where i bid her theyre wheeling round and round she answered after a minute and they certainly do look as if they were screaming  they seem to be frightened i suggested  it looks like it brownie  then hes fallen over a precipice i cried rising up and hes lying there on a ledge by their nest elsie we must go to him  she clasped her hands and looked terrified oh brownie how dreadful she exclaimed her face was deadly white mine burned like fire  not a moment to lose i said holding my breath get out the rope and let us run to him  dont you think elsie suggested we had better hurry down on our cycles to lungern and call some men from the village to help us we are two girls and alone what can we do to aid him  no i answered promptly that wont do it would only lose timeand time may be precious you and i must go ill send ursula off to bring up guides from the village  fortunately we had a good long coil of new rope in the house which mrs evelegh had provided in case of accident i slipped it on my arm and set out on foot for the path was by far too rough for cycles i was sorry afterwards that i had not taken ursula and sent elsie to lungern to rouse the men for she found the climbing hard and i had difficulty at times in dragging her up the steep and stony pathway almost a watercourse however we persisted in the direction of the kulm tracking harold by his footprints for he wore mountain boots with sharpheaded nails which made dints in the moist soil and scratched the smooth surface of the rock where he trod on it  we followed him thus for a mile or two along the regular path then of a sudden in an open part the trail failed us i turned back a few yards and looked close with my eyes fixed on the spongy soil as keen as a hound that sniffs his way after his quarry he went off here elsie i said at last pulling up short by a spindle bush on the hillside  how do you know brownie  why see there are the marks of his stick he had a thick one you remember with a square iron spike these are its dints i have been watching them all the way along from the chalet  but there are so many such marks  yes i know i can tell his from the older ones made by the spikes of alpenstocks because harolds are fresher and sharper on the edge they look so much newer see here he slipped on the rock you can know that scratch is recent by the clean way its traced and the little glistening crystals still left behind in it those other marks have been windswept and washed by the rain there are no broken particles  how on earth did you find that out brownie  how on earth did i find it out i wondered myself but the emergency seemed somehow to teach me something of the instinctive lore of hunters and savages i did not trouble to answer her at this bush the tracks fail i went on and look he must have clutched at that branch and crushed the broken leaves as the twigs slipped through his fingers he left the path here then and struck off on a short cut of his own along the hillside lower down elsie we must follow him  she shrank from it but i held her hand it was a more difficult task to track him now for we had no longer the path to guide us however i explored the ground on my hands and knees and soon found marks of footsteps on the boggy patches with scratches on the rock where he had leapt from point to point or planted his stick to steady himself i tried to help elsie along among the littered boulders and the dwarf growth of windswept daphne but poor child it was too much for her she sat down after a few minutes upon the flat juniper scrub and began to cry what was i to do my anxiety was breathless i couldnt leave her there alone and i couldnt forsake harold yet i felt every minute might now be critical we were making among wet whortleberry thicket and torn rock towards the spot where i had seen the birds wheel and circle screaming the only way left was to encourage elsie and make her feel the necessity for instant action he is alive still i exclaimed looking up the birds are crying if he were dead they would return to their nest elsie we must get to him  she rose bewildered and followed me i held her hand tight and coaxed her to scramble over the rocks where the scratches showed the way or to clamber at times over fallen trunks of huge firtrees yet it was hard work climbing even harolds sure feet had slipped often on the wet and slimy boulders though like most of queen margheritas set he was an expert mountaineer then at times i lost the faint track so that i had to diverge and look close to find it these delays fretted me see a stone loosed from its bedhe must have passed by here that twig is newly snapped no doubt he caught at it ha the moss there has been crushed a foot has gone by and the ants on that anthill with their eggs in their mouthsa mans tread has frightened them so by some instinctive sense as if the spirit of my savage ancestors revived within me i managed to recover the spoor again and again by a miracle till at last round a corner by a defiant cliffwith a terrible foreboding my heart stood still within me  we had come to an end a great projecting buttress of crag rose sheer in front above lay loose boulders below was a shrubhung precipice the birds we had seen from home were still circling and screaming  they were a pair of peregrine hawks their nest seemed to lie far below the broken scar some sixty or seventy feet beneath us  he is not dead i cried once more with my heart in my mouth if he were they would have returned he has fallen and is lying alive below there  illustration i advanced on my hands and knees to the edge of the precipice  elsie shrank back against the wall of rock i advanced on my hands and knees to the edge of the precipice it was not quite sheer but it dropped like a seacliff with broken ledges  i could see where harold had slipped he had tried to climb round the crag that blocked the road and the ground at the edge of the precipice had given way with him it showed a recent founder of a few inches then he clutched at a branch of broom as he fell but it slipped through his fingers cutting them for there was blood on the wiry stem i knelt by the side of the cliff and craned my head over i scarcely dared to look in spite of the birds my heart misgave me  there on a ledge deep below he lay in a mass half raised on one arm but not dead i believed harold i cried harold  he turned his face up and saw me his eyes lighted with joy he shouted back something but i could not hear it  i turned to elsie i must go down to him  her tears rose again oh brownie  i unwound the coil of rope the first thing was to fasten it i could not trust elsie to hold it she was too weak and too frightened to bear my weight even if i wound it round her body i feared my mere mass might drag her over i peered about at the surroundings no tree grew near no rock had a pinnacle sufficiently safe to depend upon but i found a plan soon in the crag behind me was a cleft narrowing wedgeshape as it descended i tied the end of the rope round a stone a good big waterworn stone rudely girdled with a groove near the middle which prevented it from slipping then i dropped it down the fissure till it jammed after which i tried it to see if it would bear it was firm as the rock itself i let the rope down by it and waited a moment to discover whether harold could climb he shook his head and took a notebook with evident pain from his pocket then he scribbled a few words and pinned them to the rope i hauled it up cant move either severely bruised and sprained or else legs broken  there was no help for it then i must go to him  my first idea was merely to glide down the rope with my gloved hands for i chanced to have my dogskin bicycling gloves in my pocket fortunately however i did not carry out this crude idea too hastily for next instant it occurred to me that i could not swarm up again i have had no practice in ropeclimbing here was a problem but the moment suggested its own solution i began making knots or rather nooses or loops in the rope at intervals of about eighteen inches what are they for elsie asked looking on in wonder  footholds to climb up by  but the ones above will pull out with your weight  i dont think so still to make sure i shall tie them with this string i must get down to him  i threaded a sufficient number of loops trying the length over the edge then i said to elsie who sat cowering propped against the crag you must come and look over and do as i wave to you mind dear you must two lives depend upon it  brownie i darent i shall turn giddy and fall over  i smoothed her golden hair elsie dear i said gently gazing into her blue eyes you are a woman a woman can always be brave where those she loves are concerned and i believe you love me i led her coaxingly to the edge sit there i said in my quietest voice so as not to alarm her you can lie at full length if you like and only just peep over but when i wave my hand remember you must pull the rope up  she obeyed me like a child i knew she loved me  illustration i gripped the rope and let myself down  i gripped the rope and let myself down not using the loops to descend but just sliding with hands and knees and allowing the knots to slacken my pace halfway down i will confess the eerie feeling of physical suspense was horrible one hung so in midair the hawks flapped their wings but harold was below and a woman can always be brave where those she loveswell just that moment catching my breath i knew i loved harold  i glided down swiftly the air whizzed at last on a narrow shelf of rock i leant over him he seized my hand i knew you would come he cried i felt sure you would find out though how you found out heaven only knows you clever brave little woman  are you terribly hurt i asked bending close his clothes were torn  i hardly know i cant move it may only be bruises  can you climb by these nooses with my help  he shook his head oh no i couldnt climb at all i must be lifted somehow you had better go back to lungern and bring men to help you  and leave you here alone never harold never  then what can we do  i reflected a moment lend me your pencil i said he pulled it outhis arms were almost unhurt fortunately i scribbled a line to elsie tie my plaid to the rope and let it down then i waved to her to pull up again  i was half surprised to find she obeyed the signal for she crouched there whitefaced and openmouthed watching but i have often observed that women are almost always brave in the great emergencies she pinned on the plaid and let it down with commendable quickness i doubled it and tied firm knots in the four corners so as to make it into a sort of basket then i fastened it at each corner with a piece of the rope crossed in the middle till it looked like one of the cages they use in mills for letting down sacks with as soon as it was finished i said now just try to crawl into it  he raised himself on his arms and crawled in with difficulty his legs dragged after him i could see he was in great pain but still he managed it  i planted my foot in the first noose you must sit still i said breathless i am going back to haul you up  are you strong enough lois  with elsie to help me yes i often stroked a four at girton  i can trust you he answered it thrilled me that he said so  i began my hazardous journey i mounted the rope by the noosesone two three four counting them as i mounted i did not dare to look up or down as i did so lest i should grow giddy and fall but kept my eyes fixed firmly always on the one noose in front of me my brain swam the rope swayed and creaked twenty thirty forty foot after foot i slipped them in mechanically taking up with me the longer coil whose ends were attached to the cage and harold my hands trembled it was ghastly swinging there between earth and heaven fortyfive fortysix fortyseven i knew there were fortyeight of them at last after some weeks as it seemed i reached the summit tremulous and half dead i prised myself over the edge with my hands and knelt once more on the hill beside elsie  she was white but attentive what next brownie her voice quivered  i looked about me i was too faint and shaky after my perilous ascent to be fit for work but there was no help for it what could i use as a pulley not a tree grew near but the stone jammed in the fissure might once more serve my purpose i tried it again it had borne my weight was it strong enough to bear the precious weight of harold i tugged at it and thought so i passed the rope round it like a pulley and then tied it about my own waist i had a happy thought i could use myself as a windlass i turned on my feet for a pivot elsie helped me to pull up you go i cried cheerily we wound slowly for fear of shaking him bit by bit i could feel the cage rise gradually from the ground its weight taken so with living capstan and stone axle was less than i should have expected but the pulley helped us and elsie spurred by need put forth more reserve of nervous strength than i could easily have believed lay in that tiny body i twisted myself round and round close to the edge so as to look over from time to time but not at all quickly for fear of dizziness the rope strained and gave it was a deadly ten minutes of suspense and anxiety twice or thrice as i looked down i saw a spasm of pain break over harolds face but when i paused and glanced inquiringly he motioned me to go on with my venturesome task there was no turning back now we had almost got him up when the rope at the edge began to creak ominously  it was straining at the point where it grated against the brink of the precipice my heart gave a leap if the rope broke all was over  with a sudden dart forward i seized it with my hands below the part that gave thenone fierce little run backand i brought him level with the edge he clutched at elsies hand i turned thrice round to wind the slack about my body the taut rope cut deep into my flesh but nothing mattered now except to save him catch the cloak elsie i cried catch it pull him gently in elsie caught it and pulled him in with wonderful pluck and calmness we hauled him over the edge he lay safe on the bank then we all three broke down and cried like children together i took his hand in mine and held it in silence  when we found words again i drew a deep breath and said simply how did you manage to do it  illustration i rolled and slid down  i tried to clamber past the wall that barred the way there by sheer force of strideyou know my legs are longand i somehow overbalanced myself but i didnt exactly fallif i had fallen i must have been killed i rolled and slid down clutching at the weeds in the crannies as i slipped and stumbling over the projections without quite losing my foothold on the ledges till i found myself brought up short with a bump at the end of it  and you think no bones are broken  i cant feel sure it hurts me horribly to move i fancy just at first i must have fainted but im inclined to guess im only sprained and bruised and sore all over why youre as bad as me i believe see your dear hands are all torn and bleeding  how are we ever to get him back again brownie elsie put in she was paler than ever now and prostrate with the aftereffects of her unwonted effort  you are a practical woman elsie i answered stop with him here a minute or two ill climb up the hillside and halloo for ursula and the men from lungern  i climbed and hallooed in a few minutes worn out as i was i had reached the path above and attracted their attention they hurried down to where harold lay and using my cage for a litter slung on a young firtrunk carried him back between them across their shoulders to the village he pleaded hard to be allowed to remain at the chalet and elsie joined her prayers to his but there i was adamant it was not so much what people might say that i minded but a deeper difficulty for if once i nursed him through this trouble how could i or any woman in my place any longer refuse him so i passed him ruthlessly on to lungern though my heart ached for it and telegraphed at once to his nearest relative lady georgina to come up and take care of him  he recovered rapidly though sore and shaken his worst hurts it turned out were sprains and in three or four days he was ready to go on again i called to see him before he left i dreaded the interview for ones own heart is a hard enemy to fight so long but how could i let him go without one word of farewell to him  after this lois he said taking my hand in hisand i was weak enough for a moment to let it lie thereyou cannot say no to me  oh how i longed to fling myself upon him and cry out no harold i cannot i love you too dearly but his future and marmaduke ashursts half million restrained me for his sake and for my own i held myself in courageously though indeed it needed some courage and selfcontrol i withdrew my hand slowly do you remember i said you asked me that first day at schlangenbadit was an epoch to me now that first daywhether i was mediæval or modern and i answered modern i hope and you said thats well you see i dont forget the least things you say to me well because i am modernmy lips trembled and belied mei can answer you no i can even now refuse you the oldfashioned girl the mediæval girl would have held that because she saved your life if i did save your life which is a matter of opinion she was bound to marry you but i am modern and i see things differently if there were reasons at schlangenbad which made it impracticable for me to accept youthough my heart pleaded hardi do not deny itthose reasons cannot have disappeared merely because you have chosen to fall over a precipice and i have pulled you up again my decision was founded you see not on passing accidents of situation but on permanent considerations nothing has happened in the last three days to affect those considerations we are still ourselves you rich i a penniless adventuress i could not accept you when you asked me at schlangenbad on just the same grounds i cannot accept you now i do not see how the unessential fact that i made myself into a winch to pull you up the cliff and that i am still smarting for it  he looked me all over comically how severe we are he cried in a bantering tone and how extremely girtony a system of logic ratiocinative and inductive by lois cayley what a pity we didnt take a professors chair my child that isnt you its not yourself at all its an attempt to be unnaturally and unfemininely reasonable  logic fled i broke down utterly harold i cried rising i love you i admit i love you but i will never marry youwhile you have those thousands  i havent got them yet  or the chance of inheriting them  he smothered my hand with kissesfor i withdrew my face if you admit you love me he cried quite joyously then all is well when once a woman admits that the rest is but a matter of timeand lois i can wait a thousand years for you  not in my case i answered through my tears not in my case harold i am a modern woman and what i say i mean i will renew my promise if ever you are poor and friendless come to me i am yours till then dont harrow me by asking me the impossible  i tore myself away at the hall door lady georgina intercepted me she glanced at my red eyes then you have taken him she cried seizing my hand  i shook my head firmly i could hardly speak no lady georgina i answered in a choking voice i have refused him again i will not stand in his way i will not ruin his prospects  she drew back and let her chin drop well of all the hardhearted cruel obdurate young women i ever saw in my born days if youre not the very hardest  illustration  i half ran from the house i hurried home to the chalet there i dashed into my own room locked the door behind me flung myself wildly on my bed and burying my face in my hands had a good long hardhearted cruel obdurate cryexactly like any other mediæval woman its all very well being modern but my experience is that when it comes to a man one loveswell the middle ages are still horribly strong within us     vi  the adventure of the urbane old gentleman   when elsies holidaysi beg pardon vacationcame to an end she proposed to return to her high school in london zeal for the higher mathematics devoured her but she still looked so frail and coughed so oftena perfect campo santo of a coughin spite of her summer of openair exercise that i positively worried her into consulting a doctornot one of the fortescuelangley order the report he gave was mildly unfavourable he spoke disrespectfully of the apex of her right lung it was not exactly tubercular he remarked but he feared tuberculosisexcuse the long words the phrase was his not mine i repeat verbatim he vetoed her exposing herself to a winter in london in her present unstable condition davos well no not davos with deliberative thumb and finger on closeshaven chin he judged her too delicate for such drastic remedies those high mountain stations suited best the robust invalid who had dropped by accident into casual phthisis for miss petheridges caselooking wisehe would not recommend the riviera either too stimulating too exciting what this young lady needed most was rest rest in some agreeable southern town some city of the soulsay rome or florencewhere she might find much to interest her and might forget the apex of her right lung in the new world of art that opened around her  very well i said promptly thats settled elsie the apex and you shall winter in florence  but brownie can we afford it  afford it i echoed goodness gracious my dear child what a bourgeois sentiment your medical attendant says to you go to florence and to florence you must go theres no getting out of it why even the swallows fly south when their medical attendant tells them england is turning a trifle too cold for them  but what will miss latimer say she depends upon me to come back at the beginning of term she must have somebody to undertake the higher mathematics  and she will get somebody dear i answered calmly dont trouble your sweet little head about that an eminent statistician has calculated that five hundred and thirty duly qualified young women are now standing foursquare in a solid phalanx in the streets of london all agog to teach the higher mathematics to anyone who wants them at a moments notice let miss latimer take her pick of the five hundred and thirty ill wire to her at once elsie petheridge unable through ill health to resume her duties ordered to florence resigns post engage substitute thats the way to do it  elsie clasped her small white hands in the despair of the woman who considers herself indispensableas if we were any of us indispensable but dearest the girls theyll be so disappointed  theyll get over it i answered grimly there are worse disappointments in store for them in life which is a fine old crusted platitude worthy of aunt susan anyhow ive decided look here elsie i stand to you in loco parentis i have already remarked i think that she was three years my senior but i was so pleased with this phrase that i repeated it lovingly i stand to you dear in loco parentis now i cant let you endanger your precious health by returning to town and miss latimer this winter let us be categorical i go to florence you go with me  what shall we live upon elsie suggested piteously  our fellowcreatures as usual i answered with prompt callousness i object to these base utilitarian considerations being imported into the discussion of a serious question florence is the city of art as a woman of culture it behoves you to revel in it your medical attendant sends you there as a patient and an invalid you can revel with a clear conscience money well money is a secondary matter all philosophies and all religions agree that money is mere dross filthy lucre rise superior to it we have a fair sum in hand to the credit of the firm we can pick up some more i suppose in florence  how  i reflected elsie i said you are deficient in faithwhich is one of the leading christian graces my mission in life is to correct that want in your spiritual nature now observe how beautifully all these events work in together the winter comes when no man can bicycle especially in switzerland therefore what is the use of my stopping on here after october again in pursuance of my general plan of going round the world i must get forward to italy your medical attendant considerately orders you at the same time to florence in florence we shall still have chances of selling manitous though possibly i admit in diminished numbers i confess at once that people come to switzerland to tour and are therefore liable to need our machines while they go to florence to look at pictures and a bicycle would doubtless prove inconvenient in the uffizi or the pitti still we may sell a few but i descry another opening you write shorthand dont you  a little dear only ninety words a minute  thats not business advertise yourself à la cyrus hitchcock say boldly i write shorthand leave the world to ask how fast it will ask it quick enough without your suggesting it well my idea is this florence is a town teeming with english tourists of the cultivated classesmen of letters painters antiquaries artcritics i suppose even artcritics may be classed as cultivated such people are sure to need literary aid we exist to supply it we will set up the florentine school of stenography and typewriting well buy a couple of typewriters  how can we pay for them brownie  illustration theres enterprise for you  i gazed at her in despair elsie i cried clapping my hand to my head you are not practical did i ever suggest we should pay for them i said merely buy them base is the slave that pays thats shakespeare and we all know shakespeare is the mirror of nature argal it would be unnatural to pay for a typewriter we will hire a room in florence on tick of course and begin operations clients will flock in and we tide over the winter theres enterprise for you and i struck an attitude  elsies face looked her doubts i walked across to mrs eveleghs desk and began writing a letter it occurred to me that mr hitchcock who was a man of business might be able to help a woman of business in this delicate matter i put the point to him fairly and squarely without circumlocution we were going to start an english typewriting office in florence what was the ordinary way for people to become possessed of a typewriting machine without the odious and mercenary preliminary of paying for it the answer came back with commendable promptitude       dear missyour spirit of enterprise is really remarkable i have      forwarded your letter to my friends of the spread eagle      typewriting and phonograph company limited of new york city      informing them of your desire to open an agency for the sale of      their machines in florence italy and giving them my estimate of      your business capacities i have advised their london house to      present you with two complimentary machines for your own use and      your partners and also to supply a number of others for disposal      in the city of florence if you would further like to undertake an      agency for the development of the trade in salt codfish large      quantities of which are of course consumed in catholic europe      i could put you into communication with my respected friends      messrs abel woodward and co exporters of preserved provisions      st john newfoundland but perhaps in this suggestion i am not      sufficiently hightonedrespectfully cyrus w hitchcock  the moment had arrived for elsie to be firm i have no prejudice against trade brownie she observed emphatically but i do draw the line at salt fish  so do i dear i answered  she sighed her relief i really believe she half expected to find me trotting about florence with miscellaneous samples of messrs abel woodwards esteemed productions protruding from my pocket  so to florence we went my first idea was to travel by the brenner route through the tyrol but a queer little episode which met us at the outset on the austrian frontier put a check to this plan we cycled to the border sending our trunks on by rail when we went to claim them at the austrian customhouse we were told they were detained for political reasons  political reasons i exclaimed nonplussed  even so fräulein your boxes contain revolutionary literature  some mistake i cried warmly i am but a drawingroom socialist  not at all look here and he drew a small book out of elsies portmanteau  what elsie a conspirator elsie in league with nihilists so mild and so meek i could never have believed it i took the book in my hands and read the title revolution of the heavenly bodies  but this is astronomy i burst out dont you see sunandstar circling the revolution of the planets  it matters not fräulein our instructions are strict we have orders to intercept all revolutionary literature without distinction  come elsie i said firmly this is too ridiculous let us give them a clear berth these kaiserlykingly blockheads so we registered our luggage right back to lucerne and cycled over the gotthard  illustration painting the signboard  when at last by leisurely stages we arrived at florence i felt there was no use in doing things by halves if you are going to start the florentine school of stenography and typewriting you may as well start it on a proper basis so i took sunny rooms at a nice hotel for myself and elsie and hired a ground floor in a convenient house close under the shadow of the great marble campanile considerations of space compel me to curtail the usual gush about arnolfo and giotto this was our office when i had got a tuscan painter to plant our flag in the shape of a signboard i sailed forth into the street and inspected it from outside with a swelling heart it is true the tuscan painters unaccountable predilection for the rare spellings scool without an h and stenografy with an f somewhat damped my exuberant pride for the moment but i made him take the board back and correct his italianate english as soon as all was fitted up with desk and tables we reposed upon our laurels and waited only for customers in shoals to pour in upon us i called them customers elsie maintained that we ought rather to say clients being by temperament averse to sectarianism i did not dispute the point with her  we reposed on our laurelsin vain neither customers nor clients seemed in any particular hurry to disturb our leisure  i confess i took this ill it was a rude awakening i had begun to regard myself as the special favourite of a fairy godmother it surprised me to find that any undertaking of mine did not succeed immediately however reflecting that my fairy godmothers name was really enterprise i recalled mr cyrus w hitchcocks advice and advertised  theres one good thing about florence elsie i said just to keep up her courage when the customers do come theyll be interesting people and it will be interesting work artistic work dont you knowfra angelico and della robbia and all that sort of thing or else fresh light on dante and petrarch  when they do come no doubt elsie answered dubiously but do you know brownie it strikes me there isnt quite that literary stir and ferment one might expect in florence dante and petrarch appear to be dead the distinguished authors fail to stream in upon us as one imagined with manuscripts to copy  i affected an air of confidencefor i had sunk capital in the concern thats businesslikesunk capital oh were a new firm i assented carelessly our enterprise is yet young when cultivated florence learns were here cultivated florence will invade us in its thousands  but we sat in our office and bit our thumbs all day the thousands stopped at home we had ample opportunities for making studies of the decorative detail on the campanile till we knew every square inch of it better than mr ruskin elsies notebook contains i believe eleven hundred separate sketches of the campanile from the right end the left end and the middle of our window with eight hundred and five distinct distortions of the individual statues that adorn its niches on the side turned towards us  at last after we had sat and bitten our thumbs and sketched the four greater prophets for a fortnight on end an immense excitement occurred an old gentleman was distinctly seen to approach and to look up at the signboard which decorated our office  i instantly slipped in a sheet of foolscap and began to typewrite with alarming speedclick click click while elsie rising to the occasion set to work to transcribe imaginary shorthand as if her life depended upon it  the old gentleman after a moments hesitation lifted the latch of the door somewhat nervously i affected to take no notice of him so breathless was the haste with which our immense business connection compelled me to finger the keyboard but looking up at him under my eyelashes i could just make out he was a peculiarly bland and urbane old person dressed with the greatest care and some attention to fashion his face was smooth it tended towards portliness  he made up his mind and entered the office i continued to click till i had reached the close of a sentenceor to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them then i looked up sharply can i do anything for you i inquired in the smartest tone of business i observe that politeness is not professional  illustration the urbane old gentleman  the urbane old gentleman came forward with his hat in his hand he looked as if he had just landed from the eighteenth century his figure was that of mr edward gibbon yes madam he said in a markedly deferential tone fussing about with the rim of his hat as he spoke and adjusting his pincenez i was recommended to youruryour establishment for shorthand and typewriting i have some work which i wish done if it falls within your province but i am rather particular i require a quick worker excuse my asking it but how many words can you do a minute  shorthand i asked sharply for i wished to imitate official habits  the urbane old gentleman bowed yes shorthand certainly  i waved my hand with careless grace towards elsieas if these things happened to us daily miss petheridge undertakes the shorthand department i said with decision i am the typewriting from dictation miss petheridge forward  elsie rose to it like an angel a hundred she answered confronting him  the old gentleman bowed again and your terms he inquired in a honeytongued voice if i may venture to ask them  we handed him our printed tariff he seemed satisfied  could you spare me an hour this morning he asked still fingering his hat nervously with his puffy hand but perhaps you are engaged i fear i intrude upon you  not at all i answered consulting an imaginary engagement list this work can wait let me see 1130 elsie i think you have nothing to do before one that cannot be put off quite sovery well then yes we are both at your service  the urbane old gentleman looked about him for a seat i pushed him our one easy chair he withdrew his gloves with great deliberation and sat down in it with an apologetic glance i could gather from his dress and his diamond pin that he was wealthy indeed i half guessed who he was already there was a fussiness about his manner which seemed strangely familiar to me  he sat down by slow degrees edging himself about till he was thoroughly comfortable i could see he was of the kind that will have comfort he took out his notes and a packet of letters which he sorted slowly then he looked hard at me and at elsie he seemed to be making his choice between us after a time he spoke i think he said in a most leisurely voice i will not trouble your friend to write shorthand for me after all or should i say your assistant excuse my change of plan i will content myself with dictation you can follow on the machine  as fast as you choose to dictate to me  he glanced at his notes and began a letter it was a curious communication it seemed to be all about buying bertha and selling claraa coldblooded proceeding which almost suggested slavedealing i gathered he was giving instructions to his agent could he have business relations with cuba i wondered but there were also hints of mysterious middiesbrave british tars to the rescue possibly perhaps my bewilderment showed itself upon my face for at last he looked queerly at me you dont quite like this im afraid he said breaking off short  i was the soul of business not at all i answered i am an automatonnothing more it is a typewriters function to transcribe the words a client dictates as if they were absolutely meaningless to her  quite right he answered approvingly quite right i see you understand a very proper spirit  then the woman within me got the better of the typewriter though i confess i continued i do feel it is a little unkind to sell clara at once for whatever she will fetch it seems to mewellunchivalrous  he smiled but held his peace  stillthe middies i went on they will perhaps take care that these poor girls are not illtreated  he leaned back clasped his hands and regarded me fixedly bertha he said after a pause is brighton asto be strictly correct london brighton and south coast first preference debentures clara is glasgow and southwestern deferred stock middies are midland ordinary but i respect your feeling you are a young lady of principle and he fidgeted more than ever  illustration he went on dictating for just an hour  he went on dictating for just an hour his subjectmatter bewildered me it was all about india bills and telegraphic transfers and selling cotton short and holding tight to egyptian unified markets it seemed were glutted hungarians were only to be dealt in if they hardenedhardened sinners i know but what are hardened hungarians and fears were not unnaturally expressed that turks might be irregular consols it appeared were certain to give way for political reasons but the downward tendency of australians i was relieved to learn for the honour of so great a group of colonies could only be temporary greeks were growing decidedly worse though i had always understood greeks were bad enough already and argentine central were likely to be weak but provincials must soon become commendably firm and if uruguays went flat something good ought to be made out of them scotch rails might shortly be quiet i always understood they were based upon sleepers but if southeastern stiffened advantage should certainly be taken of their stiffening he would telegraph particulars on monday morning and so on till my brain reeled oh artistic florence was this the filippo lippi the michael angelo i dreamed of  at the end of the hour the urbane old gentleman rose urbanely he drew on his gloves again with the greatest deliberation and hunted for his stick as if his life depended upon it let me see i had a pencil oh thanks yes that is it this cover protects the point my hat ah certainly and my notes much obliged notes always get mislaid people are so careless then i will come again tomorrow the same hour if you will kindly keep yourself disengaged though excuse me you had better make an entry of it at once upon your agenda  i shall remember it i answered smiling  no will you but you havent my name  i know it i answered at least i think so you are mr marmaduke ashurst lady georgina fawley sent you here  he laid down his hat and gloves again so as to regard me more undistracted you are a most remarkable young lady he said in a very slow voice i impressed upon georgina that she must not mention to you that i was coming how on earth did you recognise me  intuition most likely  he stared at me with a sort of suspicion please dont tell me you think me like my sister he went on for though of course every rightminded man feelsura natural respect and affection for the members his familybows if i may so say to the inscrutable decrees of providencewhich has mysteriously burdened him with themstill there are points about lady georgina which i cannot conscientiously assert i approve of  i remembered marmys a fool and held my tongue judiciously  i do not resemble her i hope he persisted with a look which i could almost describe as wistful  a family likeness perhaps i put in family likenesses exist you knowoften with complete divergence of tastes and character  he looked relieved that is true oh how true but the likeness in my case i must admit escapes me  i temporised strangers see these things most i said airing the stock platitudes it may be superficial and of course one knows that profound differences of intellect and moral feeling often occur within the limits of a single family  you are quite right he said with decision georginas principles are not mine excuse my remarking it but you seem to be a young lady of unusual penetration  i saw he took my remark as a compliment what i really meant to say was that a commonplace man might easily be brother to so clever a woman as lady georgina  illustration he bowed to us each separately  he gathered up his hat his stick his gloves his notes and his typewritten letters one by one and backed out politely he was a punctilious millionaire he had risen by urbanity to his brother directors like a model guineapig he bowed to us each separately as if we had been duchesses  as soon as he was gone elsie turned to me brownie how on earth did you guess it theyre so awfully different  not at all i answered a few surface unlikenesses only just mask an underlying identity their features are the same but his are plump hers shrunken lady georginas expression is sharp and worldly mr ashursts is smooth and bland and financial and then their manner both are fussy but lady georginas is honest open illtempered fussiness mr ashursts is concealed under an artificial mask of obsequious politeness ones cantankerous the others only pernicketty its one tune after all in two different keys  from that day forth the urbane old gentleman was a daily visitor he took an hour at a time at first but after a few days the hour lengthened out apologetically to an entire morning he presumed to ask my christian name the second day and remembered my fathera man of excellent principles but he didnt care for elsie to work for him fortunately for her other work dropped in once we had found a client or else poor girl she would have felt sadly slighted i was glad she had something to do the sense of dependence weighed heavily upon her  the urbane old gentleman did not confine himself entirely after the first few days to stock exchange literature he was engaged on a workhe spoke of it always with bated breath and a capital letter was implied in his intonation the work was one on the interpretation of prophecy unlike lady georgina who was tart and crisp mr marmaduke ashurst was devout and decorous where she said pack of fools he talked with unction of the mental deficiencies of our poorer brethren but his religious opinions and his stockbroking had got strangely mixed up at the wash somehow he was convinced that the british nation represented the lost ten tribes of israeland in particular ephraima matter on which as a mere laywoman i would not presume either to agree with him or to differ from him that being so miss cayley we can easily understand that the existing commercial prosperity of england depends upon the promises made to abraham  i assented without committing myself it would seem to follow  mr ashurst encouraged by so much assent went on to unfold his system of interpretation which was of a strictly commercial or companypromoting character it ran like a prospectus we have inherited the gold of australia and the diamonds of the cape he said growing didactic and lifting one fat forefinger we are now inheriting klondike and the rand for it is morally certain that we shall annex the transvaal again the chief things of the ancient mountains and the precious things of the everlasting hills what does that mean the ancient mountains are clearly the rockies can the everlasting hills be anything but the himalayas for they shall suck of the abundance of the seasthat refers of course to our worldwide commerce due mainly to importsand of the treasures hid in the sand which sand undoubtedly i say the desert of mount sinai what then is our obvious destiny a lady of your intelligence must gather at once that it is he paused and gazed at me  to drive the sultan out of syria i suggested tentatively and to annex palestine to our practical province of egypt  he leaned back in his chair and folded his fat hands in undisguised satisfaction now you are a thinker of exceptional penetration he broke out do you know miss cayley i have tried to make that point clear to the war office and the prime minister and many leading financiers in the city of london and i cant get them to see it they have no heads those people but you catch at it at a glance why i endeavoured to interest rothschild and induce him to join me in my palestine development syndicate and will you believe it the man refused point blank though if he had only looked at nahum iii 17  mere financiers i said smiling will not consider these questions from a historical and prophetic point of view they see nothing above percentages  thats it he replied lighting up they have no higher feelings though mind you there will be dividends too mark my words there will be dividends this syndicate besides fulfilling the prophecies will pay forty per cent on every penny embarked in it  only forty per cent for ephraim i murmured half below my breath why judah is said to batten upon sixty  he caught at it eagerly without perceiving my gentle sarcasm  in that case we might even expect seventy he put in with a gasp of anticipation though i approached rothschild first with my scheme on purpose so that israel and judah might once more unite in sharing the promises  your combined generosity and commercial instinct does you credit i answered it is rare to find so much love for an abstract study side by side with such conspicuous financial ability  his guilelessness was beyond words he swallowed it like an infant so i think he answered i am glad to observe that you understand my character mere city men dont they have no soul above shekels though as i show them there are shekels in it too dividends dividends dividends but you are a lady of understanding and comprehension you have been to girton havent you perhaps you read greek then  enough to get on with  could you look things up in herodotus  certainly  in the original  oh dear yes  he regarded me once more with the same astonished glance his own classics i soon learnt were limited to the amount which a public school succeeds in dinning during the intervals of cricket and football into an english gentleman then he informed me that he wished me to hunt up certain facts in herodotus and elsewhere confirmatory of his view that the english were the descendants of the ten tribes i promised to do so swallowing even that comprehensive elsewhere it was none of my business to believe or disbelieve i was paid to get up a case and i got one up to the best of my ability i imagine it was at least as good as most other cases in similar matters at any rate it pleased the old gentleman vastly  by dint of listening i began to like him but elsie couldnt bear him she hated the fat crease at the back of his neck she told me  after a week or two devoted to the interpretation of prophecy on a strictly commercial basis of founders shares with interludes of mining engineers reports upon the rubies of mount sinai and the supposed auriferous quartzites of palestine the urbane old gentleman trotted down to the office one day carrying a packet of notes of most voluminous magnitude can we work in a room alone this morning miss cayley he asked with mystery in his voice he was always mysterious i want to intrust you with a piece of work of an exceptionally private and confidential character it concerns property in point of fact he dropped his voice to a whisper i want you to draw up my will for me  certainly i said opening the door into the back office but i trembled in my shoes could this mean that he was going to draw up a will disinheriting harold tillington  and suppose he did what then my heart was in a tumult if harold were richwell and good i could never marry him but if harold were poor i must keep my promise could i wish him to be rich could i wish him to be poor my heart stood divided two ways within me  the urbane old gentleman began with immense deliberation as befits a man of principle when property is at stake you will kindly take down notes from my dictation he said fussing with his papers and afterwards i will ask you to be so good as to copy it all out fair on your typewriter for signature  is a typewritten form legal i ventured to inquire  a most perspicacious young lady he interjected well pleased i have investigated that point and find it perfectly regular only if i may venture to say so there should be no erasures  there shall be none i answered  the urbane old gentleman leant back in his easy chair and began dictating from his notes with tantalising deliberateness this was the last will and testament of him marmaduke courtney ashurst its verbiage wearied me i was eager for him to come to the point about harold instead of that he did what it seems is usual in such casesset out with a number of unimportant legacies to old family servants and other hangerson among our poorer brethren i fumed and fretted inwardly next came a series of quaint bequests of a quite novel character i give and bequeath to james walsh and sons of 720 high holborn london the sum of five hundred pounds in consideration of the benefit they have conferred upon humanity by the invention of a sugarspoon or silver sugarsifter by means of which it is possible to dust sugar upon a tart or pudding without letting the whole or the greater part of the material run through the apertures uselessly in transit you must have observed miss cayleywith your usual perspicacitythat most sugarsifters allow the sugar to fall through them on to the table prematurely  i have noticed it i answered trembling with anxiety  james walsh and sons acting on a hint from me have succeeded in inventing a form of spoon which does not possess that regrettable drawback run through the apertures uselessly in transit i think i said last yes thank you very good we will now continue and i give and bequeath the like sum of five hundred poundsdid i say free of legacy duty no then please add it to james walshs clause five hundred pounds free of legacy duty to thomas webster jones of wheeler street soho for his admirable invention of a pair of braces which will not slip down on the wearers shoulders after half an hours use most braces you must have observed miss cayley  my acquaintance with braces is limited not to say abstract i interposed smiling  he gazed at me and twirled his fat thumbs  of course he murmured of course but most braces you may not be aware slip down unpleasantly on the shoulderblade and so lead to an awkward habit of hitching them up by the sleevehole of the waistcoat at frequent intervals such a habit must be felt to be ungraceful thomas webster jones to whom i pointed out this error of manufacture has invented a brace the two halves of which diverge at a higher angle than usual and fasten further towards the centre of the body in frontpardon these detailsso as to obviate that difficulty he has given me satisfaction and he deserves to be rewarded  i heard through it all the voice of lady georgina observing tartly why the idiots cant make braces to fit one at first passes my comprehension but there my dear the people who manufacture them are a set of born fools and what can you expect from an imbecile mr ashurst was lady georgina veneered with a thin layer of ingratiating urbanity lady georgina was clever and therefore acrimonious mr ashurst was astute and therefore obsequious  he went on with legacies to the inventor of a saucebottle which did not let the last drop dribble down so as to spot the tablecloth of a shoehorn the handle of which did not come undone and of a pair of sleevelinks which you could put off and on without injury to the temper a real benefactor miss cayley a real benefactor to the linkwearing classes for he has sensibly diminished the average annual output of profane swearing  when he left five hundred pounds to his faithful servant frederic higginson courier i was tempted to interpose but i refrained in time and i was glad of it afterwards  at last after many divagations my urbane old gentleman arrived at the central pointand i give and bequeath to my nephew harold ashurst tillington younger of gledcliffe dumfriesshire attaché to her majestys embassy at rome  illustration i waited breathless  i waited breathless  he was annoyingly dilatory my house and estate of ashurst court in the county of gloucester and my town house at 24 park lane north in london together with the residue of all my estate real or personal and so forth  i breathed again at least i had not been called upon to disinherit harold  provided always he went on in the same voice  i wondered what was coming  provided always that the said harold ashurst tillington does not marryleave a blank there miss cayley i will find out the name of the young person i desire to exclude and fill it in afterward i dont recollect it at this moment but higginson no doubt will be able to supply the deficiency in fact i dont think i ever heard it though higginson has told me all about the woman  higginson i inquired is he here  oh dear yes you heard of him i suppose from georgina georgina is prejudiced he has come back to me i am glad to say an excellent servant higginson though a trifle too omniscient all men are equal in the eyes of their maker of course but we must have due subordination a courier ought not to be better informed than his masteror ought at least to conceal the fact dexterously well higginson knows this young persons name my sister wrote to me about her disgraceful conduct when she first went to schlangenbad an adventuress it seems an adventuress quite a shocking creature foisted herself upon lady georgina in kensington gardensunintroduced if you can believe such a thingwith the most astonishing effrontery and georgina who will forgive anything on earth for the sake of what she calls originalityanother name for impudence as i am sure you must knowtook the young woman with her as her maid to germany there this minx tried to set her cap at my nephew harold who can be caught at once by a pretty face and harold was bowled overalmost got engaged to her georgina took a fancy to the girl later having a taste for dubious people i cannot say i approve of georginas friends and wrote again to say her first suspicions were unfounded the young woman was in reality a paragon of virtue but i know better than that georgina has no judgment i regret to be obliged to confess it but cleverness i fear is the only thing in the world my excellent sister cares for the hussy it seems was certainly clever higginson has told me about her he says her bare appearance would suffice to condemn hera bold fast shameless brazenfaced creature but you will forgive me i am sure my dear young lady i ought not to discuss such painted jezebels before you we will leave this persons name blank i will not sully your peni mean your typewriterby asking you to transcribe it  i made up my mind at once mr ashurst i said looking up from my keyboard i can give you this girls name and then you can insert the proviso immediately  you can my dear young lady what a wonderful person you are you seem to know everybody and everything but perhaps she was at schlangenbad with lady georgina and you were there also  she was i answered deliberately the name you want islois cayley  he let his notes drop in his astonishment  i went on with my typewriting unmoved provided always that the said harold ashurst tillington does not marry lois cayley in which case i will and desire that the said estate shall pass towhom shall i put in mr ashurst  he leant forward with his fat hands on his ample knees it was really you he inquired openmouthed  i nodded there is no use in denying the truth mr tillington did ask me to be his wife and i refused him  but my dear miss cayley  the difference in station i said the difference still greater in this worlds goods yes i know i admit all that so i declined his offer i did not wish to ruin his prospects  the urbane old gentleman eyed me with a sudden tenderness in his glance young men are lucky he said slowly after a short pause and higginson is an idiot i say it deliberatelyan idiot how could one dream of trusting the judgment of a flunkey about a lady my dear excuse the familiarity from one who may consider himself in a certain sense a contingent unclesuppose we amend the last clause by the omission of the word not it strikes me as superfluous provided always the said harold ashurst tillington consents to marry i think that sounds better  he looked at me with such fatherly regard that it pricked my heart ever to have poked fun at his interpretation of prophecy on stock exchange principles i think i flushed crimson no no i answered firmly that will not do either please thats worse than the other way you must not put it mr ashurst i could not consent to be willed away to anybody  he leant forward with real earnestness my dear he said thats not the point pardon my reminding you that you are here in your capacity as my amanuensis i am drawing up my will and if you will allow me to say so i cannot admit that anyone has a claim to influence me in the disposition of my property  please i cried pleadingly  he looked at me and paused well he went on at last after a long interval since you insist upon it i will leave the bequest to stand without condition  thank you i murmured bending low over my machine  if i did as i like though he went on i should say unless he marries miss lois cayley who is a deal too good for him the estate shall revert to kynastons eldest son a confounded jackass i do not usually indulge in intemperate language but i desire to assure you with the utmost calmness that kynastons eldest son lord southminster is a confounded jackass  i rose and took his hand in my own spontaneously mr ashurst i said you may interpret prophecy as long as ever you like but you are a dear kind old gentleman i am truly grateful to you for your good opinion  and you will marry harold  never i answered while he is rich i have said as much to him  thats hard he went on slowly for  i should like to be your uncle  i trembled all over elsie saved the situation by bursting in abruptly  i will only add that when mr ashurst left i copied the will out neatly without erasures the rough original i threw somewhat carelessly into the wastepaper basket  that afternoon somebody called to fetch the fair copy for mr ashurst i went out into the front office to see him to my surprise it was higginsonin his guise as courier  illustration what you here he cried  he was as astonished as myself what you here he cried you dog me  i was thinking the same thing of you m le comte i answered curtsying  he made no attempt at an excuse well i have been sent for the will he broke out curtly  and you were sent for the jewelcase i retorted no no dr fortescuelangley i am in charge of the will and i will take it myself to mr ashurst  i will be even with you yet he snapped out i have gone back to my old trade and am trying to lead an honest life but you wont let me  on the contrary i answered smiling a polite smile i rejoice to hear it if you say nothing more against me to your employer i will not disclose to him what i know about you but if you slander me i will so now we understand one another  and i kept the will till i could give it myself into mr ashursts own hands in his rooms that evening     vii  the adventure of the unobtrusive oasis   i will not attempt to describe to you the minor episodes of our next twelve monthsthe manuscripts we typewrote and the manitous we sold tis one of my aims in a world so rich in bores to avoid being tedious i will merely say therefore that we spent the greater part of the year in florence where we were building up a connection but rode back for the summer months to switzerland as being a livelier place for the trade in bicycles the net result was not only that we covered our expenses but that as chancellor of the exchequer i found myself with a surplus in hand at the end of the season  when we returned to florence for the winter however i confess i began to chafe this is slow work elsie i said i started out to go round the world it has taken me eighteen months to travel no further than italy at this rate i shall reach new york a grayhaired old lady in a nice lace cap and totter back into london a venerable crone on the verge of ninety  however those invaluable doctors came to my rescue unexpectedly i do love doctors they are always sending you off at a moments notice to delightful places you never dreamt of elsie was better but still far from strong i took it upon me to consult our medical attendant and his verdict was decisive he did just what a doctor ought to do she is getting on very well in florence he said but if you want to restore her health completely i should advise you to take her for a winter to egypt after six months of the dry warm desert air i dont doubt she might return to her work in london  that last point i used as a lever with elsie she positively revels in teaching mathematics at first to be sure she objected that we had only just money enough to pay our way to cairo and that when we got there we might starveher favourite programme i have not this extraordinary taste for starving my idea is to go where you like and find something decent to eat when you get there however to humour her i began to cast about me for a source of income there is no absolute harm in seeing your way clear before you for a twelvemonth though of course it deprives you of the plotinterest of poverty  elsie i said in my best didactic stylei excel in didacticsyou do not learn from the lessons that life sets before you look at the stage for example the stage is universally acknowledged at the present day to be a great teacher of morals does not irving say soand he ought to know there is that splendid model for imitation for instance the clown in the pantomime how does clown regulate his life does he take heed for the morrow not a bit of it i wish i had a goose he says at some critical juncture and just as he says itpata super strolls upon the stage with a property goose on a wooden tray and clown cries oh look here joey heres a goose and proceeds to appropriate it then he puts his fingers in his mouth and observes i wish i had a few apples to make the sauce with and as the words escape himpat againa small boy with a very squeaky voice runs on carrying a basket of apples clown trips him up and bolts with the basket theres a model for imitation the stage sets these great moral lessons before you regularly every christmas yet you fail to profit by them govern your life on the principles exemplified by clown expect to find that whatever you want will turn up with punctuality and dispatch at the proper moment be adventurous and you will be happy take that as a new maxim to put in your copybook  i wish i could think so dear elsie answered but your confidence staggers me  that evening at our tabledhôte however it was amply justified a smoothfaced young man of ample girth and most prosperous exterior happened to sit next us he had his wife with him so i judged it safe to launch on conversation we soon found out he was the millionaire editorproprietor of a great london daily with many more strings to his journalistic bow his honoured name was elworthy i mentioned casually that we thought of going for the winter to egypt he pricked his ears up but at the time he said nothing after dinner we adjourned to the cosy salon i talked to him and his wife and somehow that evening the devil entered into me i am subject to devils i hasten to add they are mild ones i had one of my reckless moods just then however and i reeled off rattling stories of our various adventures mr elworthy believed in youth and audacity i could see i interested him the more he was amused the more reckless i became thats bright he said at last when i told him the tale of our amateur exploits in the sale of manitous that would make a good article  yes i answered with bravado determined to strike while the iron was hot what the daily telephone lacks is just one enlivening touch of feminine brightness  he smiled what is your forte he inquired  my forte i answered isto go where i choose and write what i like about it  he smiled again and a very good new departure in journalism too a roving commission have you ever tried your hand at writing  had i ever tried it was the ambition of my life to see myself in print though hitherto it had been ineffectual i have written a few sketches i answered with becoming modesty as a matter of fact our office bulged with my unpublished manuscripts  could you let me see them he asked  i assented with inner joy but outer reluctance if you wish it i murmured butyou must be very lenient  illustration he read them cruel man before my very eyes  though i had not told elsie the truth of the matter was i had just then conceived an idea for a novelmy magnum opusthe setting of which compelled egyptian local colour and i was therefore dying to get to egypt if chance so willed it i submitted a few of my picked manuscripts accordingly to mr elworthy in fear and trembling he read them cruel man before my very eyes i sat and waited twiddling my thumbs demure but apprehensive  when he had finished he laid them down  racy he said racy youre quite right miss cayley thats just what we want on the daily telephone i should like to print these three selecting them out at our usual rate of pay per thousand  you are very kind but the room reeled with me  not at all i am a man of business and these are good copy now about this egypt i will put the matter in the shape of a business proposition will you undertake if i pay your passage and your friends with all travelling expenses to let me have three descriptive articles a week on cairo the nile syria and india running to about two thousand words apiece at three guineas a thousand  my breath came and went it was positive opulence the super with the goose couldnt approach it for patness my editor had brought me the apple sauce as well without even giving me the trouble of cooking it  the very next day everything was arranged elsie tried to protest on the foolish ground that she had no money but the faculty had ordered the apex of her right lung to go to egypt and i couldnt let her fly in the face of the faculty we secured our berths in a p and o steamer from brindisi and within a week we were tossing upon the bosom of the blue mediterranean  people who havent crossed the blue mediterranean cherish an absurd idea that it is always calm and warm and sunny i am sorry to take away any seas character but i speak of it as i find it to borrow a phrase from my old gyp at girton and i am bound to admit that the mediterranean did not treat me as a lady expects to be treated it behaved disgracefully people may rhapsodize as long as they choose about a life on the ocean wave for my own part i wouldnt give a pin for seasickness we glided down the adriatic from brindisi to corfu with a reckless profusion of lateral motion which suggested the idea that the ship must have been drinking  i tried to rouse elsie when we came abreast of the ionian islands and to remind her that here was the home of nausicaa in the odyssey elsie failed to respond she was otherwise occupied at last i succumbed and gave it up i remember nothing further till a day and a half later when we got under lee of crete and the ship showed a tendency to resume the perpendicular then i began once more to take a languid interest in the dinner question  i may add parenthetically that the mediterranean is a mere bit of a sea when you look at it on the mapa pocket sea to be regarded with mingled contempt and affection but you learn to respect it when you find that it takes four clear days and nights of abject misery merely to run across its eastern basin from brindisi to alexandria i respected the mediterranean immensely while we lay off the peloponnesus in the trough of the waves with a north wind blowing i only began to temper my respect with a distant liking when we passed under the welcome shelter of crete on a calm starlit evening  it was deadly cold we had not counted upon such weather in the sunny south i recollected now that the greeks were wont to represent boreas as a chilly deity and spoke of the thracian breeze with the same deferentially deprecating adjectives which we ourselves apply to the east wind of our fatherland but that apt classical memory somehow failed to console or warm me a goodnatured male passenger however volunteered to ask us will i get ye a rug ladies the form of his courteous question suggested the probability of his irish origin  you are very kind i answered if you dont want it for yourself im sure my friend would be glad to have the use of it  is it meself sure ive got me big ulsther and im as warrum as a toast in it but yere not provided for this weather yeve thrusted too much to those rascals the pouts where breaks the blue sicilian say the rogues write id like to set them down in it wid a noreaster blowing  he fetched up his rug it was ample and soft a smooth brown camelhair he wrapped us both up in it we sat late on deck that night as warm as a toast ourselves thanks to our genial irishman  illustration tis doctor macloghlen he answered  we asked his name tis dr macloghlen he answered im from county clare ye see and im on me way to egypt for thravel and exploration me fader whisht me to see the worruld a bit before id settle down to practise me profession at liscannor have ye ever been in county clare sure tis the pick of oireland  we have that pleasure still in store i answered smiling it spreads goldleaf over the future as george meredith puts it  is it meredith ah theres the foine writer tis jaynius the man has i cant undtherstand a word of him but hes half oirish ye know what proof have i got of it an would he write like that if there wasnt a dhrop of the blood of the celt in him  next day and next night mr macloghlen was our devoted slave i had won his heart by admitting frankly that his countrywomen had the finest and liveliest eyes in europeeyes with a deep twinkle half fun half passion he took to us at once and talked to us incessantly he was a redhaired rawboned munsterman but a real good fellow we forgot the aggressive inequalities of the mediterranean while he talked to us of the pizzantry late the second evening he propounded a confidence it was a lovely night orion overhead and the plashing phosphorescence on the water below conspired with the hour to make him specially confidential now miss cayley he said leaning forward on his deck chair and gazing earnestly into my eyes theres wan question id like to ask ye the ambition of me life is to get into parlimint and i want to know from ye as a frindif i accomplish me hearts wishis there annything in me apparence ar in me voice ar in me accent ar in me manner that would lade annybody to suppose i was an oirishman  i succeeded by good luck in avoiding elsies eye what on earth could i answer then a happy thought struck me dr macloghlen i said it would not be the slightest use your trying to conceal it for even if nobody ever detected a faint irish intonation in your words or phraseshow could your eloquence fail to betray you for a countryman of sheridan and burke and grattan  he seized my hand with such warmth that i thought it best to hurry down to my stateroom at once under cover of my compliment  at alexandria and cairo we found him invaluable he looked after our luggage which he gallantly rescued from the lean hands of fifteen arab porters all eagerly struggling to gain possession of our effects he saw us safe into the train and he never quitted us till he had safely ensconced us in our rooms at shepheards for himself he said with subdued melancholy twas to some cheaper hotel he must go shepheards wasnt for the likes of him though if land in county clare was wort what it ought to be there wasnt a finer estate in all oireland than his faders  our mr elworthy was a modern proprietor who knew how to do things on the lordly scale having commissioned me to write this series of articles he intended them to be written in the first style of art and he had instructed me accordingly to hire one of cooks little steam dahabeeahs where i could work at leisure dr macloghlen was in his element arranging for the trip sure the only thing i mind he said isthat ill not be going wid ye i think he was half inclined to invite himself but there again i drew a line i will not sell salt fish and i will not go up the nile unchaperoned with a casual man acquaintance  he did the next best thing however he took a place in a sailing dahabeeah and as we steamed up slowly stopping often on the way to give me time to write my articles he managed to arrive almost always at every town or ruin exactly when we did  i will not describe the voyage the nile is the nile just at first before we got used to it we conscientiously looked up the name of every village we passed on the bank in our murray and our baedeker after a couple of days niling however we found that formality quite unnecessary they were all the same village under a number of aliases they did not even take the trouble to disguise themselves anew like dr fortescuelangley on each fresh appearance they had every one of them a small whitewashed mosque with a couple of tall minarets and around it spread a number of mudbuilt cottages looking more like beehives than human habitations they had also every one of them a group of datepalms overhanging a cluster of mean bare houses and they all alike had a picturesque and even imposing air from a distance but faded away into indescribable squalor as one got abreast of them our progress was monotonous at twelve noon we would pass abooteeg with its mosque its palms its mudhuts and its camels then for a couple of hours we would go on through the midst of a green field on either side studded by more mudhuts and backed up by a range of gray desert mountains only to come at 2 pm twenty miles higher up upon abooteeg once more with the same mosque the same mudhuts and the same haughty camels placidly chewing the same aristocratic cud but under the alias of kooskam after a wild hubbub at the quay we would leave kooskam behind with its camels still serenely munching daybeforeyesterdays dinner and twenty miles further on again having passed through the same green plain backed by the same gray mountains we would stop once more at the identical kooskam which this time absurdly described itself as tahtah but whether it was abooteeg or kooskam or tahtah or anything else only the name differed it was always the same town and had always the same camels at precisely the same stage of the digestive process it seemed to us immaterial whether you saw all the nile or only five miles of it it was just like wallpaper a sample sufficed the whole was the sample infinitely repeated  however i had my letters to write and i wrote them valiantly i described the various episodes of the complicated digestive process in the camel in the minutest detail i gloated over the datepalms which i knew in three days as if i had been brought up upon dates i gave wordpictures of every individual child veiled woman arab sheikh and coptic priest whom we encountered on the voyage and i am open to reprint those conscientious studies of mudhuts and minarets with any enterprising publisher who will make me an offer  illustration too much nile  another disillusion weighed upon my soul before i went up the nile i had a fancy of my own that the bank was studded with endless ruined temples whose vast red colonnades were reflected in the water at every turn i think macaulays lays were primarily answerable for that particular misapprehension as a matter of fact it surprised me to find that we often went for two whole days hard steaming without ever a temple breaking the monotony of those eternal datepalms those calm and superciliously irresponsive camels in my humble opinion egypt is a fraud there is too much nilevery dirty nile at thatand not nearly enough temple besides the temples when you do come up with them are just like the villages they are the same temple over again under a different name each time and they have the same gods the same kings the same wearisome basreliefs except that the gentleman in a chariot ten feet high who is mowing down enemies a quarter his own size with unsportsmanslike recklessness is called rameses in this place and sethi in that and amenhotep in the other with this trifling variation when you have seen one temple one obelisk one hieroglyphic table you have seen the whole of ancient egypt  at last after many days voyage through the same scenery dailyrising in the morning off a village with a mosque ten palms and two minarets and retiring late at night off the same village once more with mosque palms and minarets as before da capowe arrived one evening at a place called geergeh in itself i believe geergeh did not differ materially from all the other places we had passed on our voyage it had its mosque its ten palms and its two minarets as usual but i remember its name because something mysterious went wrong there with our machinery and the engineer informed us we must wait at least three days to mend it dr macloghlens dahabeeah happened opportunely to arrive at the same spot on the same day and he declared with fervour he would see us through our throubles but what on earth were we to do with ourselves through three long days and nights at geergeh there were the ruins of abydus close at hand to be sure though i defy anybody not a professed egyptologist to give more than one day to the ruins of abydus in this emergency dr macloghlen came gallantly to our aid he discovered by inquiring from an englishspeaking guide that there was an unobtrusive oasis never visited by europeans one long days journey off across the desert as a rule it takes at least three days to get camels and guides together for such an expedition for egypt is not a land to hurry in but the indefatigable doctor further unearthed the fact that a sheikh had just come in who for a consideration would lend us camels for a two days trip and we seized the chance to do our duty by mr elworthy and the worldwide circulation an unvisited oasisand two christian ladies to be the first to explore it theres journalistic enterprise for you if we happened to be killed so much the better for the daily telephone i pictured the excitement at piccadilly circus extra special our own correspondent brutally murdered i rejoiced at the opportunity  i cannot honestly say that elsie rejoiced with me she cherished a prejudice against camels massacres and the new journalism she didnt like being murdered though this was premature for she had never tried it she objected that the fanatical mohammedans of the senoosi sect who were said to inhabit the oasis in question might cut our throats for dogs of infidels i pointed out to her at some length that it was just that chance which added zest to our expedition as a journalistic venture fancy the glory of being the first lady journalists martyred in the cause but she failed to grasp this aspect of the question however if i went she would go too she said like a dear girl that she is she would not desert me when i was getting my throat cut  illustration emphasis  dr macloghlen made the bargain for us and insisted on accompanying us across the desert he told us his method of negotiation with the arabs with extreme gusto is it pay in advance ye want says i to the dirty beggars divvil a penny will ye get till ye bring these ladies safe back to geergeh and remimber mr sheikh says i fingering me pistol so by way of emphasis we take no money wid us so if yer friends at wadi bou choose to cut our throats tis for the pleasure of it theyll be cutting them not for anything theyll gain by it provisions effendi says he salaaming provisions is it says i take everything yell want wid you i suppose ye can buy food fit for a crischun in the bazaar in geergeh and never wan penny do ye touch for it all till yeve landed us on the bank again as safe as ye took us so if the religious sintiments of the faithful at wadi bou should lade them to hack us to pieces says i just waving me revolver thin tis yerself that will be out of pocket by it and the ould divvil cringed as if he took me for the prince of wales faix tis the purse thats the best argumint to catch these haythen arabs upon  when we set out for the desert in the early dawn next day it looked as if we were starting for a few months voyage we had a company of camels that might have befitted a caravan we had two large tents one for ourselves and one for dr macloghlen with a third to dine in we had bedding and cushions and drinking water tied up in swollen pigskins which were really goatskins looking far from tempting we had bread and meat and a supply of presents to soften the hearts and weaken the religious scruples of the sheikhs at wadi bou we thravel en prince said the doctor when all was ready we got under way solemnly our camels rising and sniffing the breeze with a superior air as who should say i happen to be going where you happen to be going but dont for a moment suppose i do it to please you it is mere coincidence you are bound for wadi bou i have business of my own which chances to take me there  illustration riding a camel does not greatly differ prom seasickness  over the incidents of the journey i draw a veil riding a camel i find does not greatly differ from seasickness they are the same phenomenon under altered circumstances we had been assured beforehand on excellent authority that much of the comfort on a desert journey depends upon having a good camel on this matter i am no authority i do not set up as a judge of camelflesh but i did not notice any of the comfort so i venture to believe my camel must have been an exceptionally bad one  we expected trouble from the fanatical natives i am bound to admit we had most trouble with elsie she was not insubordinate but she did not care for camelriding and her beast took advantage of her youth and innocence a wellbehaved camel should go almost as fast as a child can walk and should not sit down plump on the burning sand without due reason elsies brute crawled and called halts for prayer at frequent intervals it tried to kneel like a good mussulman many times a day and it showed an intolerant disposition to crush the infidel by rolling over on top of elsie dr macloghlen admonished it with irish eloquence not always in language intended for publication but it only turned up its supercilious lip and inquired in its own unspoken tongue what he knew about the desert  i feel like a wurrum before the baste the doctor said nonplussed  if the nile was monotonous the road to wadi bou was nothing short of dreary we crossed a great ridge of bare gray rock and followed a rolling valley of sand scored by dry ravines and baking in the sun it was ghastly to look upon all day long save at the midday rest by some brackish wells we rode on and on the brutes stepping forward with slow outstretched legs though sometimes we walked by the camels sides to vary the monotony but ever through that dreary upland plain sand in the centre rocky mountain at the edge and not a thing to look at we were relieved towards evening to stumble against stunted tamarisks half buried in sand and to feel we were approaching the edge of the oasis  when at last our arrogant beasts condescended to stop in their patronising way we saw by the dim light of the moon a sort of uneven basin or hollow studded with datepalms and in the midst of the depression a crumbling walled town with a whitewashed mosque two minarets by its side and a crowd of mudhouses it was strangely familiar we had come all this way just to see abooteeg or kooskam over again  we camped outside the fortified town that night next morning we essayed to make our entry  at first the servants of the prophet on watch at the gate raised serious objections no infidel might enter but we had a pass from cairo exhorting the faithful in the name of the khedive to give us food and shelter and after much examination and many loud discussions the gatemen passed us we entered the town and stood alone three christian europeans in the midst of three thousand fanatical mohammedans  i confess it was weird elsie shrank by my side suppose they were to attack us brownie  thin the sheikh here would never get paid dr macloghlen put in with true irish recklessness faix hell whistle for his money on the whistle i gave him that touch of humour saved us we laughed and the people about saw we could laugh they left off scowling and pressed around trying to sell us pottery and native brooches in the intervals of fanaticism the arab has an eye to business  we passed up the chief street of the bazaar the inhabitants told us in pantomime the chief of the town was away at asioot whither he had gone two days ago on business if he were here our interpreter gave us to understand things might have been different for the chief had determined that whatever came no infidel dog should settle in his oasis  illustration her agitation was evident  the women with their veiled faces attracted us strangely they were wilder than on the river they ran when one looked at them suddenly as we passed one we saw her give a little start she was veiled like the rest but her agitation was evident even through her thick covering  she is afraid of christians elsie cried nestling towards me  the woman passed close to us she never looked in our direction but in a very low voice she murmured as she passed then you are english  i had presence of mind enough to conceal my surprise at this unexpected utterance dont seem to notice her elsie i said looking away yes we are english  she stopped and pretended to examine some jewellery on a stall so am i she went on in the same suppressed low voice for heavens sake help me  what are you doing here  i live heremarried i was with gordons force at khartoum they carried me off a mere girl then now i am thirty  and you have been here ever since  she turned away and walked off but kept whispering behind her veil we followed unobtrusively yes i was sold to a man at dongola he passed me on again to the chief of this oasis i dont know where it is but i have been here ever since i hate this life is there any chance of a rescue  anny chance of a rescue is it the doctor broke in a trifle too ostensibly if it costs us a whole british army me dear lady well fetch you away and save you  but nowtoday you wont go away and leave me you are the first europeans i have seen since khartoum fell they may sell me again you will not desert me  no i said we will not then i reflected a moment  what on earth could we do this was a painful dilemma if we once lost sight of her we might not see her again yet if we walked with her openly and talked like friends we would betray ourselves and her to those fanatical senoosis  i made my mind up promptly i may not have much of a mind but such as it is i flatter myself i can make it up at a moments notice  can you come to us outside the gate at sunset i asked as if speaking to elsie  the woman hesitated i think so  then keep us in sight all day and when evening comes stroll out behind us  she turned over some embroidered slippers on a booth and seemed to be inspecting them but my children she murmured anxiously  the doctor interposed is it childern she has he asked thin theyll be the mohammedan gintlemans we mustnt interfere wid them we can take away the ladyshes english and detained against her will but we cant deprive anny man of his own childern  i was firm and categorical yes we can i said stoutly if he has forced a woman to bear them to him whether she would or not thats common justice i have no respect for the mohammedan gentlemans rights let her bring them with her how many are there  twoa boy and girl not very old the eldest is seven she spoke wistfully a mother is a mother  then say no more now but keep us always in sight and we will keep you come to us at the gate about sundown we will carry you off with us  she clasped her hands and moved off with the peculiar gliding air of the veiled mohammedan woman our eyes followed her we walked on through the bazaar thinking of nothing else now it was strange how this episode made us forget our selfish fears for our own safety even dear timid elsie remembered only that an englishwomans life and liberty were at stake we kept her more or less in view all day she glided in and out among the people in the alleys when we went back to the camels at lunchtime she followed us unobtrusively through the open gate and sat watching us from a little way off among a crowd of gazers for all wadi bou was of course agog at this unwonted invasion  we discussed the circumstance loudly so that she might hear our plans dr macloghlen advised that we should tell our sheikh we meant to return part of the way to geergeh that evening by moonlight i quite agreed with him it was the only way out besides i didnt like the looks of the people they eyed us askance this was getting exciting now i felt a professional journalistic interest whether we escaped or got killed what splendid business for the daily telephone  the sheikh of course declared it was impossible to start that evening the men wouldnt movethe camels needed rest but dr macloghlen was inexorable very well thin mr sheikh he answered philosophically yell plaze yerself about whether ye come on wid us or whether ye shtop thats yer own business but we set out at sundown and whin ye return by yerself on foot to geergeh ye can ask for yer camels at the british consulate  all through that anxious afternoon we sat in our tents under the shade of the mudwall wondering whether we could carry out our plan or not about an hour before sunset the veiled woman strolled out of the gate with her two children she joined the crowd of sightseers once more for never through the day were we left alone for a second the excitement grew intense elsie and i moved up carelessly towards the group talking as if to one another i looked hard at elsie then i said as though i were speaking about one of the children go straight along the road to geergeh till you are past the big clump of palms at the edge of the oasis just beyond it comes a sharp ridge of rock wait behind the ridge where no one can see you when we get there i patted the little girls head dont say a word but jump on my camel my two friends will each take one of the children if you understand and consent stroke your boys curls we will accept that for a signal  she stroked the childs head at once without the least hesitation even through her veil and behind her dress i could somehow feel and see her trembling nerves her beating heart but she gave no overt token she merely turned and muttered something carelessly in arabic to a woman beside her  we waited once more in longdrawn suspense would she manage to escape them would they suspect her motives  after ten minutes when we had returned to our crouchingplace under the shadow of the wall the woman detached herself slowly from the group and began strolling with almost overdone nonchalance along the road to geergeh we could see the little girl was frightened and seemed to expostulate with her mother fortunately the arabs about were too much occupied in watching the suspicious strangers to notice this episode of their own people presently our new friend disappeared and with beating hearts we awaited the sunset  illustration crouching by the rocks sat our mysterious stranger  then came the usual scene of hubbub with the sheikh the camels the porters and the drivers it was eagerness against apathy with difficulty we made them understand we meant to get under way at all hazards i stormed in bad arabic the doctor inveighed in very choice irish at last they yielded and set out one by one the camels rose bent their slow knees and began to stalk in their lordly way with outstretched necks along the road to the river we moved through the palm groves a crowd of boys following us and shouting for backsheesh we began to be afraid they would accompany us too far and discover our fugitive but fortunately they all turned back with one accord at a little whitewashed shrine near the edge of the oasis we reached the clump of palms we turned the corner of the ridge had we missed one another no there crouching by the rocks with her children by her side sat our mysterious stranger  the doctor was equal to the emergency make those bastes kneel he cried authoritatively to the sheikh  the sheikh was taken aback this was a new exploit burst upon him he flung his arms up gesticulating wildly the doctor unmoved made the drivers understand by some strange pantomime what he wanted they nodded half terrified in a second the stranger was by my side elsie had taken the girl the doctor the boy and the camels were passively beginning to rise again that is the best of your camel once set him on his road and he goes mechanically  the sheikh broke out with several loud remarks in arabic which we did not understand but whose hostile character could not easily escape us he was beside himself with anger then i was suddenly aware of the splendid advantage of having an irishman on our side dr macloghlen drew his revolver like one well used to such episodes and pointed it full at the angry arab look here mr sheikh he said calmly yet with a fine touch of bravado do ye see this revolver well unless ye make yer camels thravel sthraight to geergeh widout wan other wurrud tis yer own brains will be spattered sor on the sand of this desert and if ye touch wan hair of our heads yell answer for it wid yer life to the british government  i do not feel sure that the sheikh comprehended the exact nature of each word in this comprehensive threat but i am certain he took in its general meaning punctuated as it was with some flourishes of the revolver he turned to the drivers and made a gesture of despair it meant apparently that this infidel was too much for him then he called out a few sharp directions in arabic next minute our camels legs were stepping out briskly along the road to geergeh with a promptitude which im sure must have astonished their owners we rode on and on through the gloom in a fever of suspense had any of the senoosis noticed our presence would they miss the chiefs wife before long and follow us under arms would our own sheikh betray us i am no coward as women go but i confess if it had not been for our fiery irishman i should have felt my heart sink we were grateful to him for the reckless and goodhumoured courage of the untamed celt it kept us from giving way yell take notice mr sheikh he said as we threaded our way among the moonlit rocks that i have twintywan cartridges in me case for me revolver and that if theres throuble tonight tis twinty of them therell be for your frinds the senoosis and wan for yerself but for fear of disappointing a gintleman tis yer own special bullet ill disthribute first if it comes to fighting  the sheikhs english was a vanishing quantity but to judge by the way he nodded and salaamed at this playful remark i am convinced he understood the doctors irish quite as well as i did  we spoke little by the way we were all far too frightened except the doctor who kept our hearts up by a running fire of wild celtic humour but i found time meanwhile to learn by a few questions from our veiled friend something of her captivity she had seen her father massacred before her eyes at khartoum and had then been sold away to a merchant who conveyed her by degrees and by various exchanges across the desert through lonely spots to the senoosi oasis there she had lived all those years with the chief to whom her last purchaser had trafficked her she did not even know that her husbands village was an integral part of the khedives territory far less that the english were now in practical occupation of egypt she had heard nothing and learnt nothing since that fateful day she had waited in vain for the offchance of a deliverer  but did you never try to run away to the nile i cried astonished  run away how could i i did not even know which way the river lay and was it possible for me to cross the desert on foot or find the chance of a camel the senoosis would have killed me even with you to help me see what dangers surround me alone i should have perished like hagar in the wilderness with no angel to save me  an yeve got the angel now dr macloghlen exclaimed glancing at me steady there mr sheikh whats this thats coming  it was another caravan going the opposite way on its road to the oasis a voice halloaed from it  our new friend clung tight to me my husband she whispered gasping  they were still far off on the desert and the moon shone bright a few hurried words to the doctor and with a wild resolve we faced the emergency he made the camels halt and all of us springing off crouched down behind their shadows in such a way that the coming caravan must pass on the far side of us at the same moment the doctor turned resolutely to the sheikh look here mr arab he said in a quiet voice with one more appeal to the simple volapuk of the pointed revolver i cover ye wid this let these frinds of yours go by if theres anny unnecessary talking betwixt ye or anny throuble of anny kind remimber the first bullet goes sthraight as an arrow trough that haythen head of yours  the sheikh salaamed more submissively than ever  the caravan drew abreast of us we could hear them cry aloud on either side the customary salutes in allahs name peace answered by allah is great there is no god but allah  would anything more happen would our sheikh play us false it was a moment of breathlessness we crouched and cowered in the shade holding our hearts with fear while the arab drivers pretended to be unsaddling the camels a minute or two of anxious suspense then peering over our beasts backs we saw their long line filing off towards the oasis we watched their turbaned heads silhouetted against the sky disappear slowly one by one they faded away the danger was past with beating hearts we rose up again  the doctor sprang into his place and seated himself on his camel now ride on mr sheikh he said wid all yer men as if grim death was afther ye camels or no camels yeve got to march all night for yell never draw rein till were safe back at geergeh  and sure enough we never halted under the persuasive influence of that loaded revolver till we dismounted once more in the early dawn upon the nile bank under british protection  then elsie and i and our rescued countrywoman broke down together in an orgy of relief we hugged one another and cried like so many children     viii  the adventure of the peagreen patrician   away to india a life on the ocean wave once more andmay it prove less wavy  in plain prose my arrangement with my proprietor mr elworthy thus we speak in the newspaper trade included a trip to bombay for myself and elsie so as soon as we had drained upper egypt journalistically dry we returned to cairo on our road to suez i am glad to say my letters to the daily telephone gave satisfaction my employer wrote you are a born journalist i confess this surprised me for i have always considered myself a truthful person still as he evidently meant it for praise i took the doubtful compliment in good part and offered no remonstrance  i have a mercurial temperament my spirits rise and fall as if they were consols monotonous egypt depressed me as it depressed the israelites but the passage of the red sea set me sounding my timbrel i love fresh air i love the sea if the sea will but behave itself and i positively revelled in the change from egypt  unfortunately we had taken our passages by a p and o steamer from suez to bombay many weeks beforehand so as to secure good berths and still more unfortunately in a letter to lady georgina i had chanced to mention the name of our ship and the date of the voyage i kept up a spasmodic correspondence with lady georgina nowadaystuppencehapenny a fortnight the dear cantankerous racy old lady had been the foundation of my fortunes and i was genuinely grateful to her or rather i ought to say she had been their second foundress for i will do myself the justice to admit that the first was my own initiative and enterprise i flatter myself i have the knack of taking the tide on the turn and i am justly proud of it but being a grateful animal i wrote once a fortnight to report progress to lady georgina besideslet me whisperstrictly between ourselvestwas an indirect way of hearing about harold  this time however as events turned out i recognised that i had made a grave mistake in confiding my movements to my shrewd old lady she did not betray me on purpose of course but i gathered later that casually in conversation she must have mentioned the fact and date of my sailing before somebody who ought to have had no concern in it and the somebody i found had governed himself accordingly all this however i only discovered afterwards so without anticipating i will narrate the facts exactly as they occurred to me  illustration an oddlooking young man  when we mounted the gangway of the jumna at suez and began the process of frizzling down the red sea i noted on deck almost at once an oddlooking young man of twentytwo or thereabouts with a curious faint peagreen complexion he was the wishywashiest young man i ever beheld in my life an achromatic study in spite of the delicate peagreeniness of his skin all the colouring matter of the body seemed somehow to have faded out of him perhaps he had been bleached as he leant over the taffrail gazing down with open mouth and vacant stare at the water i took a good long look at him he interested me muchbecause he was so exceptionally uninteresting a pallid anæmic indefinite hobbledehoy with a high narrow forehead and sketchy features he had watery restless eyes of an insipid light blue thin yellow hair almost white in its paleness and twitching hands that played nervously all the time with a shadowy moustache this shadowy moustache seemed to absorb as a rule the best part of his attention it was so sparse and so blanched that he felt it continuallyto assure himself no doubt of the reality of its existence i need hardly add that he wore an eyeglass  he was an aristocrat i felt sure eton and christ church no ordinary person could have been quite so flavourless imbecility like his is only to be attained as the result of long and judicious selection  he went on gazing in a vacant way at the water below an ineffectual patrician smile playing feebly round the corners of his mouth meanwhile then he turned and stared at me as i lay back in my deckchair for a minute he looked me over as if i were a horse for sale when he had finished inspecting me he beckoned to somebody at the far end of the quarterdeck  the somebody sidled up with a deferential air which confirmed my belief in the peagreen young mans aristocratic origin it was such deference as the british flunkey pays only to blue blood for he has gradations of flunkeydom he is respectful to wealth polite to acquired rank but servile only to hereditary nobility indeed you can make a rough guess at the social status of the person he addresses by observing which one of his twentyseven nicely graduated manners he adopts in addressing him  the peagreen young man glanced over in my direction and murmured something to the satellite whose back was turned towards me i felt sure from his attitude he was asking whether i was the person he suspected me to be the satellite nodded assent whereat the peagreen young man screwing up his face to fix his eyeglass stared harder than ever he must be heir to a peerage i felt convinced nobody short of that rank would consider himself entitled to stare with such frank unconcern at an unknown lady  presently it further occurred to me that the satellites back seemed strangely familiar i have seen that man somewhere elsie i whispered putting aside the wisps of hair that blew about my face  so have i dear elsie answered with a slight shudder and i was instinctively aware that i too disliked him  as elsie spoke the man turned and strolled slowly past us with that ineffable insolence which is the other side of the flunkeys insufferable selfabasement he cast a glance at us as he went by a withering glance of brazen effrontery we knew him now of course it was that variable star our old acquaintance mr higginson the courier  he was here as himself this time no longer the count or the mysterious faithhealer the diplomat hid his rays under the garb of the manservant  depend upon it elsie i cried clutching her arm with a vague sense of fear this man means mischief there is danger ahead when a creature of higginsons sort who has risen to be a count and a fashionable physician descends again to be a courier you may rest assured it is because he has something to gain by it he has some deep scheme afloat and we are part of it  his master looks weak enough and silly enough for anything elsie answered eyeing the suspected lordling i should think he is just the sort of man such a wily rogue would naturally fasten upon  when a wily rogue gets hold of a weak fool who is also dishonest i said the two together may make a formidable combination but never mind were forewarned i think i shall be even with him  that evening at dinner in the saloon the peagreen young man strolled in with a jaunty air and took his seat next to us the red sea by the way was kinder than the mediterranean it allowed us to dine from the very first evening cards had been laid on the plates to mark our places i glanced at my neighbours it bore the inscription viscount southminster  that was the name of lord kynastons eldest sonlady georginas nephew harold tillingtons cousin so this was the man who might possibly inherit mr marmaduke ashursts money i remembered now how often and how fervently lady georgina had said kynastons sons are all fools if the rest came up to sample i was inclined to agree with her  it also flashed across me that lord southminster might have heard through higginson of our meeting with mr marmaduke ashurst at florence and of my acquaintance with harold tillington at schlangenbad and lungern with a womans instinct i jumped at the fact that the peagreen young man had taken passage by this boat on purpose to baffle both me and harold  thinking it over it seemed to me too that he might have various possible points of view on the matter he might desire for example that harold should marry me under the impression that his marriage with a penniless outsider would annoy his uncle for the peagreen young man doubtless thought that i was still to mr ashurst just that dreadful adventuress if so his obvious cue would be to promote a good understanding between harold and myself in order to make us marry so that the urbane old gentlemen might then disinherit his favourite nephew and make a new will in lord southminsters interest or again the peagreen young man might on the contrary be aware that mr ashurst and i had got on admirably together when we met at florence in which case his aim would naturally be to find out something that might set the rich uncle against me yet once more he might merely have heard that i had drawn up uncle marmadukes will at the office and he might desire to worm the contents of it out of me whichever was his design i resolved to be upon my guard in every word i said to him and leave no door open to any trickery either way for of one thing i felt sure that the colourless young man had torn himself away from the mudhoney of piccadilly for this voyage to india only because he had heard there was a chance of meeting me  that was a politic move whoever planned ithimself or higginson for a week on board ship with a person or persons is the very best chance of getting thrown in with them whether they like it or lump it they cant easily avoid you  it was while i was pondering these things in my mind and resolving with myself not to give myself away that the young man with the peagreen face lounged in and dropped into the next seat to me he was dressed amongst other things in a dinner jacket and a white tie for myself i detest such fopperies on board ship they seem to me out of place they conflict with the infinite possibilities of the situation one stands too near the realities of things evening dress and maldemer sort ill together  illustration he turned to me with an inane smile  as my neighbour sat down he turned to me with an inane smile which occupied all his face good evening he said in a baronial drawl miss cayley i gathah i asked the skippahs leave to set next yah we ought to be friendsrathah i think yah know my poor deah old aunt lady georgina fawley  i bowed a somewhat freezing bow lady georgina is one of my dearest friends i answered  no really poor deah old georgey got somebody to stick up for her at last has she now thats what i call chivalrous of yah magnanimous isnt it i like to see people stick up for their friends and it must be a novelty for georgey for between you and me a moah cantankerous spiteful acidulated old coughdrop than the poor deah soul it ud be difficult to hit upon  lady georgina has brains i answered and they enable her to recognise a fool when she sees him i will admit that she does not suffer fools gladly  he turned to me with a sudden sharp look in the depths of the lacklustre eyes already it began to strike me that though the peagreen young man was inane he had his due proportion of a certain insidious practical cunning thats true he answered measuring me and according to her almost everybodys a foolespecially her relations theres a fine knack of sweeping generalisation about deah skinny old georgey the few people she reahlly likes are all archangels the rest are blithering idiots theres no middle course with her  i held my peace frigidly  she thinks me a very special and peculiah fool he went on crumbling his bread  lady georgina i answered is a person of exceptional discrimination i would almost always accept her judgment on anyone as practically final  he laid down his soupspoon fondled the imperceptible moustache with his tapering fingers and then broke once more into a cheerful expanse of smile which reminded me of nothing so much as of the village idiot it spread over his face as the splash from a stone spreads over a millpond now thats a nice cheerful sort of thing to say to a fellah he ejaculated fixing his eyeglass in his eye with a few fierce contortions of his facial muscles thats encouraging dont yah know as the foundation of an acquaintance makes a good cornahstone calculated to place things at once upon what yah call a friendly basis georgey said you had a pretty wit i see now why she admiahed it birds of a feathah very wise old proverb  i reflected that after all this young man had nothing overt against him beyond a fishy blue eye and an inane expression so feeling that i had perhaps gone a little too far i continued after a minute and your uncle how is he  marmy he inquired with another elephantine smile and then i perceived it was a form of humour with him or rather a cheap substitute to speak of his elder relations by their abbreviated christian names without any prefix marmys doing very well thank yah as well as could be expected in fact bettah habakkuk on the brain its carrying him off at last he has brights disease very baddrank port dont yah knowand wont trouble this wicked world much longah with his presence it will be a happy releaseespecially for his nephews  i was really grieved for i had grown to like the urbane old gentleman as i had grown to like the cantankerous old lady in spite of his fussiness and his stock exchange views on the interpretation of scripture his genuine kindliness and his real liking for me had softened my heart to him and my face must have shown my distress for the peagreen young man added quickly with an afterthought but you neednt be afraid yah know its all right for harold tillington you ought to know that as well as anyoneand bettah for it was you who drew up his will for him at florence  i flushed crimson i believe then he knew all about me i was not asking on mr tillingtons account i answered i asked because i have a personal feeling of friendship for your uncle mr ashurst  his hand strayed up to the straggling yellow hairs on his upper lip once more and he smiled again this time with a curious undercurrent of foolish craftiness thats a good one he answered georgey told me you were original marmys a millionaire and many people love millionaires for their money but to love marmy for himself i do call that originality why weight for age hes acknowledged to be the most portentous old boah in london society  i like mr ashurst because he has a kind heart and some genuine instincts i answered he has not allowed all human feeling to be replaced by a cheap mask of pall mall cynicism  oh i say hows that for preaching dont you manage to give it hot to a fellah neithah and at sight too without the usual three days of grace have some of my champagne im a forgiving creachah  no thank you i prefer this hock  your friend then and he motioned the steward to pass the bottle  to my great disgust elsie held out her glass i was annoyed at that it showed she had missed the drift of our conversation and was therefore lacking in feminine intuition i should be sorry if i had allowed the higher mathematics to kill out in me the most distinctively womanly faculty  from that first day forth however in spite of this beginning lord southminster almost persecuted me with his persistent attentions he did all a fellah could possibly do to please me i could not make out precisely what he was driving at but i saw he had some artful game of his own to play and that he was playing it subtly i also saw that vapid as he was his vapidity did not prevent him from being worldly wise with the wisdom of the selfseeking man of the world who utterly distrusts and disbelieves in all the higher emotions of humanity he harped so often on this string that on our second day out as we lolled on deck in the heat i had to rebuke him sharply he had been sneering for some hours there are two kinds of silly simplicity lord southminster i said at last one kind is the silly simplicity of the rustic who trusts everybody the other kind is the silly simplicity of the pall mall clubman who trusts nobody it is just as foolish and just as onesided to overlook the good as to overlook the evil in humanity if you trust everyone you are likely to be taken in but if you trust no one you put yourself at a serious practical disadvantage besides losing half the joy of living  then you think me a fool like georgey he broke out  i should never be rude enough to say so i answered fanning myself  well youre what i call a firstrate companion for a voyage down the red sea he put in gazing abstractedly at the awnings such a lovely freezing mixture a fellah doesnt need ices when youre on tap i recommend you as a refrigeratah  i am glad i answered demurely if i have secured your approbation in that humble capacity im sure i have tried hard for it  illustration nothing seemed to put the man down  yet nothing that i could say seemed to put the man down in spite of rebuffs he was assiduous in running down the companionladder for my parasol or my smellingbottle he fetched me chairs he stayed me with cushions he offered to lend me books he pestered me to drink his wine and he kept elsie in champagne which she annoyed me by accepting poor dear elsie clearly failed to understand the creature hes so kind and polite brownie isnt he she would observe in her simple fashion do you know i think hes taken quite a fancy to you and hell be an earl byandby i call it romantic how lovely it would seem dear to see you a countess  elsie i said severely with one hand on her arm you are a dear little soul and i am very fond of you but if you think i could sell myself for a coronet to a pastyfaced young man with a peagreen complexion and glassy blue eyesi can only say my child you have misread my character he isnt a man hes a lump of putty  i think elsie was quite shocked that i should apply these terms to a courtesy lord the eldest son of a peer nature had endowed her with the profound british belief that peers should be spoken of in choice and peculiar language if a peers a fool lady georgina said once to me people think you should say his temperament does not fit him for the conduct of affairs if hes a roué or a drunkard they think you should say he has unfortunate weaknesses  what most of all convinced me however that the wishywashy young man with the peagreen complexion must be playing some stealthy game was the demeanour and mental attitude of mr higginson his courier after the first day higginson appeared to be politeness and deference itself to us he behaved to us both almost as if we belonged to the titled classes he treated us with the second best of his twentyseven graduated manners he fetched and carried for us with a courtly grace which recalled that distinguished diplomat the comte de larochesurloiret at the station at malines with lady georgina it is true at his politest moments i often caught the undercurrent of a wicked twinkle in his eye and felt sure he was doing it all with some profound motive but his external demeanour was everything that one could desire from a welltrained manservant i could hardly believe it was the same man who had growled to me at florence i shall be even with you yet as he left our office  do you know brownie elsie mused once i really begin to think we must have misjudged higginson hes so extremely polite perhaps after all he is really a count who has been exiled and impoverished for his political opinions  i smiled and held my tongue silence costs nothing but mr higginsons political opinions i felt sure were of that simple communistic sort which the law in its blunt way calls fraudulent they consisted in a belief that all was his which he could lay his hands on  higginsons a splendid fellah for his place yah know miss cayley lord southminster said to me one evening as we were approaching aden what i like about him is hes so doosid intelligent  extremely so i answered then the devil entered into me again he had the doosid intelligence even to take in lady georgina  yaas thats just it dont you know georgey told me that story screamingly funny wasnt it and i said to myself at once higginsons the man for me i want a courier with jolly lots of brains and no blooming scruples ill entice this chap away from marmy and i did i outbid marmy oh yaas hes a firstrate fellah higginson what i want is a man who will do what hes told and ask no beastly unpleasant questions higginsons that man hes as sharp as a ferret  and as dishonest as they make them  he opened his hands with a gesture of unconcern all the bettah for my purpose see how frank i am miss cayley i tell the truth the truth is very rare you ought to respect me for it  it depends somewhat upon the kind of truth i answered with a random shot i dont respect a man for instance for confessing to a forgery  he winced not for months after did i know how a stone thrown at a venture had chanced to hit the spot and had vastly enhanced his opinion of my cleverness  you have heard about dr fortescuelangley too i suppose i went on  oh yaas wasnt it real jam he did the doctortrick on a lady in switzerland and the way he has come it ovah deah simple old marmy he played marmy with ezekiel not so dusty was it hes too lovely for anything  hes an edged tool i said  yaas thats why i use him  and edged tools may cut the users fingers  illustration yah dont catch me going so fah from newmarket  not mine he answered taking out a cigarette oh deah no he cant turn against me he wouldnt dare to yah see i have the fellah entirely in my powah i know all his little games and i can expose him any day but it suits me to keep him i dont mind telling yah since i respect your intellect that he and i are engaged in pulling off a big coup togethah if it were not for that i wouldnt be heah yah dont catch me going away so fah from newmarket and the empire for nothing  i judged as much i answered and then i was silent  but i wondered to myself why the neutraltinted young man should be so communicative to an obviously hostile stranger  for the next few days it amused me to see how hard our lordling tried to suit his conversation to myself and elsie he was absurdly anxious to humour us just at first it is true he had discussed the subjects that lay nearest to his own heart he was an ardent votary of the noble quadruped and he loved the turfwhose sward we judged he trod mainly at tattersalls he spoke to us with erudition on twoyearold form and gave us several safe things for the spring handicaps the oaks he considered a moral for clorinda he also retailed certain choice anecdotes about ladies whose christian names were chiefly tottie and flo and whose honoured surnames have escaped my memory most of them flourished i recollect at the frivolity music hall but when he learned that our interest in the noble quadruped was scarcely more than tepid and that we had never even visited the friv as he affectionately called it he did his best in turn to acquire our subjects he had heard us talk about florence for example and he gathered from our talk that we loved its art treasures so he set himself to work to be studiously artistic it was a beautiful study in human ineptitude ah yaas he murmured turning up the pale blue eyes ecstatically towards the masthead chawming place florence i dote on the pickchahs i know them all by heart i assuah yah ive spent houahs and houahs feeding my soul in the galleries  and what particular painter does your soul most feed upon i asked bluntly with a smile  the question staggered him i could see him hunting through the vacant chambers of his brain for a florentine painter then a faint light gleamed in the leaden eyes and he fingered the strawcoloured moustache with that nervous hand till he almost put a visible point upon it ah raphael he said tentatively with an inquiring air yet beaming at his success dont you think so splendid artist raphael  and a very safe guess i answered leading him on you cant go far wrong in mentioning raphael can you but after him  he dived into the recesses of his memory again peered about him for a minute or two and brought back nothing i cant remembah the othah fellahs names he went on theyre all so much alike all in elli dont yah know but i recollect at the time they impressed me awfully  no doubt i answered  he tried to look through me and failed then he plunged like a noble sportsman that he was on a second fetch of memory ahand michael angelo he went on quite proud of his treasuretrove sweet things michael angelos  very sweet i admitted so simple so touching so tender so domestic  i thought elsie would explode but she kept her countenance the peagreen young man gazed at me uneasily he had half an idea by this time that i was making game of him  however he fished up a name once more and clutched at it savonarola too he adventured i adore savonarola his pickchahs are beautiful  and so rare elsie murmured  then there is fra diavolo i suggested going one better how do you like fra diavolo  he seemed to have heard the name before but still he hesitated ahwhat did he paint he asked with growing caution  i stuffed him valiantly those charming angels you know i answered with the roses and the glories  oh yaas i recollect all askew arent they like this i remembah them very well but a doubt flitted across his brain wasnt his name fra angelico  his brother i replied casting truth to the winds they worked together you must have heard one did the saints the other did the opposite division of labour dont you see fra angelico fra diavolo  illustration wasnt fra diavolo also a composah  he fingered his cigarette with a dubious hand and wriggled his eyeglass tighter yaas beautiful beautiful but growing suspicious apace wasnt fra diavolo also a composah  of course i assented in his off time he composed those early italiansso versatile you see so versatile  he had his doubts but he suppressed them  and torricelli i went on with a side glance at elsie who was choking by this time and chianti and frittura and cinquevalli and giulio romano  his distrust increased now youre trying to make me commit myself he drawled out i remembah torricellihes the fellah who used to paint all his women crooked but chiantis a wine ive often drunk it and romanoswell every fellah knows romanos is a restaurant near the gaiety theatre  besides i continued in a drawl like his own there are risotto and gnocchi and vermicelli and anchovyall famous paintahs and all of whom i dont doubt you admiah  elsie exploded at last but he took no offence he smiled inanely as if he rather enjoyed it look heah you know he said with his crafty smile thats one too much im not taking any you think yourselves very clevah for kidding me with paintahs who are really macaroni and cheese and claret yet if i were to tell you the lejah was run at ascot or the cesarewitch at doncastah why youd be no wisah when it comes to art i dont have a look in but i could tell you a thing or two about starting prices  and i was forced to admit that there he had reason  still i think he realised that he had better avoid the subject of art in future as we avoided the noble quadruped he saw his limitations  not till the last evening before we reached bombay did i really understand the nature of my neighbours project that evening as it chanced elsie had a headache and went below early i stopped with her till she dozed off then i slipped up on deck once more for a breath of fresh air before retiring for the night to the hot and stuffy cabin it was an exquisite evening the moon rode in the pale green sky of the tropics a strange light still lingered on the western horizon the stifling heat of the red sea had given way long since to the refreshing coolness of the indian ocean i strolled a while on the quarterdeck and sat down at last near the stern next moment i was aware of somebody creeping up to me  look heah miss cayley a voice broke in im in luck at last ive been waiting oh evah so long for this opportunity  i turned and faced him have you indeed i answered well i have not lord southminster  i tried to rise but he motioned me back to my chair there were ladies on deck and to avoid being noticed i sank into my seat again  i want to speak to you he went on in a voice that for him was almost impressive half a mo miss cayley i want to saythis last nightyou misunderstand me  on the contrary i answered the trouble isthat i understand you perfectly  no yah dont look heah he bent forward quite romantically im going to be perfectly frank of course yah know that when i came on board this ship i cameto checkmate yah  of course i replied why else should you and higginson have bothered to come here  he rubbed his hands together thats just it youre always clevah you hit it first shot but theres wheah the point comes in at first i only thought of how we could circumvent yah i treated yah as the enemy now its all the othah way miss cayley youre the cleverest woman i evah met in this world you extort my admiration  i could not repress a smile i didnt know how it was but i could see i possessed some mysterious attraction for the ashurst family i was fatal to ashursts lady georgina harold tillington the honourable marmaduke lord southminsterdifferent types as they were all succumbed without one blow to me  you flatter me i answered coldly  no i dont he cried flashing his cuffs and gazing affectionately at his sleevelinks pon my soul i assuah yah i mean it i cant tell you how much i admiah yah i admiah your intellect every day i have seen yah i feel it moah and moah why youre the only person who has evah outflanked my fellah higginson as a rule i dont think much of women ive been through several london seasons and lots of em have tried their level best to catch me the cleverest mammas have been aftah me for their ethels but i wasnt so easily caught i dodged the ethels with you its different i feelhe pausedyoure a woman a fellah might be really proud of  you are too kind i answered in my refrigerator voice  well will you take me he asked trying to seize my hand miss cayley if you will you will make me unspeakably happy  it was a great effortfor himand i was sorry to crush it i regret i said that i am compelled to deny you unspeakable happiness  illustration take my word for it youre staking your money on the wrong fellah  oh but you dont catch on you mistake let me explain youre backing the othah man now i happen to know about that and i assuah you its an error take my word for it youre staking your money on the wrong fellah  i do not understand you i replied drawing away from his approach and what is more i may add you could never understand me  yaas but i do i understand perfectly i can see where you go wrong you drew up marmys will and you think marmy has left all hes worth to harold tillington so youre putting every penny youve got on harold well thats mere moonshine harold may think its all right but its not all right theres many a slip twixt the cup and the probate court listen heah miss cayley higginson and i are a jolly sight sharpah than your friend harold harolds what they call a clevah fellah in society and im what they call a fool but i know bettah than harold which side of my breads buttahed  i dont doubt it i answered  well i have managed this business i dont mind telling you now i had a telegram from marmys valet when we touched at aden and poor old marmys sinking habakkuks been too much for him sixteen stone going under why am i not with him yah may ask because when a man of marmys temperament is dying its safah to be away from him theres plenty of time for marmy to altah his will yetand there are othah contingencies still harolds quite out of it you take my word for it if you back harold you back a man whos not going to get anything while if you back me you back the winnah with a coronet into the bargain and he smiled fatuously  i looked at him with a look that would have made a wiser man wince but it fell flat on lord southminster do you know why i do not rise and go down to my cabin at once i said slowly because if i did somebody as i passed might see my burning cheekscheeks flushed with shame at your insulting proposaland might guess that you had asked me and that i had refused you and i should shrink from the disgrace of anyones knowing that you had put such a humiliation upon me you have been frank with meafter your kind lord southminster frank with the frankness of a low and purely commercial nature i will be frank with you in turn you are right in supposing that i love harold tillingtona man whose name i hate to mention in your presence but you are wrong in supposing that the disposition of mr marmaduke ashursts money has or can have anything to do with the feelings i entertain towards him i would marry him all the sooner if he were poor and penniless you cannot understand that state of mind of course but you must be content to accept it and i would not marry you if there were no other man left in the world to marry i should as soon think of marrying a lump of dough i faced him all crimson is that plain enough do you see now that i really mean it  he gazed at me with a curious look and twirled what he considered his moustache once more quite airily the man was imperturbablea pachydermatous imbecile youre all wrong yah know he said after a long pause during which he had regarded me through his eyeglass as if i were a specimen of some rare new species youre all wrong and yah wont believe me but i tell yah i know what im talking about you think its quite safe about marmys moneythat hes left it to harold because you drew the will up i assuah you that wills not worth the paper its written on you fancy harolds a hot favourite hes a rank outsidah i give you a chance and you wont take it i want yah because youre a remarkable woman most of the ethels cry when theyre trying to make a fellah propose to em and i dont like em damp but you have some go about yah you insist upon backing the wrong man but youll find your mistake out yet a bright idea struck him i saywhy dont you hedge leave it open till marmys gone and then marry the winnah  it was hopeless trying to make this clod understand his brain was not built with the right cells for understanding me lord southminster i said turning upon him and clasping my hands i will not go away while you stop here but you have some spark enough of a gentleman in your composition i hope not to inflict your company any longer upon a woman who does not desire it i ask you to leave me here alone when you have gone and i have had time to recover from your degrading offer i may perhaps feel able to go down to my cabin  he stared at me with open blue eyesthose watery blue eyes oh just as you like he answered i wanted to do you a good turn because youre the only woman i evah really admiahedto say admiah dont you know not trotted round like the ethels but you wont allow me ill go if you wish it though i tell you again youre backing the wrong man and soonah or latah youll discover it i dont mind laying you six to four against him howevah ill do one thing for yah ill leave this offah always open im not likely to marry any othah womannot good enough is itand if evah you find out youre mistaken about harold tillington remembah honour bright i shall be ready at any time to renew my offah  by this time i was at boilingpoint i could not find words to answer him i waved him away angrily with one hand he raised his hat with quite a jaunty air and strolled off forward puffing his cigarette i dont think he even knew the disgust with which he inspired me  i sat some hours with the cool air playing about my burning cheeks before i mustered up courage to rise and go down below again     ix  the adventures of the magnificent maharajah   our arrival at bombay was a triumphal entry we were received like royalty indeed to tell you the truth elsie and i were beginning to get just a leetle bit spoiled it struck us now that our casual connection with the ashurst family in its various branches had succeeded in saddling us like the lady of burleigh with the burden of an honour unto which we were not born we were everywhere treated as persons of importance and oh dear by dint of such treatment we began to feel at last almost as if we had been raised in the purple i felt that when we got back to england we should turn up our noses at plain bread and butter  yes life has been kind to me have your researches into english literature ever chanced to lead you into reading horace walpole i wonder that polite trifler is fond of a word which he coined himselfserendipity it derives from the name of a certain happy indian prince serendip whom he unearthed or invented in some obscure oriental story a prince for whom the fairies or the genii always managed to make everything pleasant it implies the faculty which a few of us possess of finding whatever we want turn up accidentally at the exact right moment well i believe i must have been born with serendipity in my mouth in place of the proverbial silver spoon for wherever i go all things seem to come out exactly right for me  the jumna for example had hardly heaved to in bombay harbour when we noticed on the quay a very distinguishedlooking oriental potentate in a large white turban with a particularly big diamond stuck ostentatiously in its front he stalked on board with a martial air as soon as we stopped and made inquiries from our captain after someone he expected the captain received him with that odd mixture of respect for rank and wealth combined with true british contempt for the inferior black man which is universal among his class in their dealings with native indian nobility the oriental potentate however who was accompanied by a gorgeous suite like that of the wise men in italian pictures seemed satisfied with his information and moved over with his stately glide in our direction elsie and i were standing near the gangway among our rugs and bundles in the hopeless helplessness of disembarkation he approached us respectfully and bowing with extended hands and a deferential air asked in excellent english may i venture to inquire which of you two ladies is miss lois cayley  i am i replied my breath taken away by this unexpected greeting may i venture to inquire in return how you came to know i was arriving by this steamer  illustration i am the maharajah of moozuffernuggar  he held out his hand with a courteous inclination i am the maharajah of moozuffernuggar he answered in an impressive tone as if everybody knew of the maharajah of moozuffernuggar as familiarly as they knew of the duke of cambridge moozuffernuggar in rajputananot the one in the doab you must have heard my name from mr harold tillington  i had not but i dissembled so as to salve his pride mr tillingtons friends are our friends i answered sententiously  and mr tillingtons friends are my friends the maharajah retorted with a low bow to elsie this is no doubt miss petheridge i have heard of your expected arrival as you will guess from tillington he and i were at oxford together i am a merton man it was tillington who first taught me all i know of cricket he took me to stop at his fathers place in dumfriesshire i owe much to his friendship and when he wrote me that friends of his were arriving by the jumna why i made haste to run down to bombay to greet them  the episode was one of those topsyturvy mixtures of all places and ages which only this jumbled century of ours has witnessed it impressed me deeply here was this indian prince a feudal rajput chief living practically among his vassals in the middle ages when at home in india yet he said i am a merton man as harold himself might have said it and he talked about cricket as naturally as lord southminster talked about the noble quadruped the oddest part of it all was we alone felt the incongruity to the maharajah the change from moozuffernuggar to oxford and from oxford back again to moozuffernuggar seemed perfectly natural they were but two alternative phases in a modern indian gentlemans education and experience  still what were we to do with him if harold had presented me with a white elephant i could hardly have been more embarrassed than i was at the apparition of this urbane and magnificent hindoo prince he was young he was handsome he was slim for a rajah he wore european costume save for the huge white turban with its obtrusive diamond and he spoke english much better than a great many englishmen yet what place could he fill in my life and elsies for once i felt almost angry with harold why couldnt he have allowed us to go quietly through india two simple unofficial journalistic pilgrims in our native obscurity  his highness of moozuffernuggar however had his own views on this question with a courteous wave of one dusky hand he motioned us gracefully into somebody elses deck chairs and then sat down on another beside us while the gorgeous suite stood by in respectful silenceunctuous gentlemen in pinkandgold brocadeforming a court all round us elsie and i unaccustomed to be so observed grew conscious of our hands our skirts our postures but the maharajah posed himself with perfect unconcern like one well used to the fierce light of royalty i have come he said with simple dignity to superintend the preparations for your reception  gracious heavens i exclaimed our reception maharajah i think you misunderstand we are two ordinary english ladies of the proletariat accustomed to the level plain of professional society we expect no reception  he bowed again with stately eastern deference friends of tillingtons he said shortly are persons of distinction besides i have heard of you from lady georgina fawley  lady georgina is too good i answered though inwardly i raged against her why couldnt she leave us alone to feed in peace on dakbungalow chicken instead of sending this regalmannered heathen to bother us  so i have come down to bombay to make sure that you are met in the style that befits your importance in society he went on waving his suite away with one careless hand for he saw it fussed us i mentioned you to his honour the actinggovernor who had not heard you were coming his honours aidedecamp will follow shortly with an invitation to government house while you remain in bombaywhich will not be many days i dont doubt for there is nothing in this city of plague to stop for later on during your progress up country i do myself the honour to hope that you will stay as my guests for as long as you choose at moozuffernuggar  my first impulse was to answer impossible maharajah we couldnt dream of accepting your kind invitation but on second thoughts i remembered my duty to my proprietor journalism first inclination afterwards my letter from egypt on the rescue of the englishwoman who escaped from khartoum had brought me great éclat as a special correspondent and the daily telephone now billed my name in big letters on its placards so mr elworthy wrote me here was another noble chance must i not strive to rise to it two english ladies at a native court in rajputana that ought to afford scope for some rattling journalism  it is extremely kind of you i said hesitating and it would give us great pleasure were it feasible to accept your friendly offer butenglish ideas you know prince two unprotected women i hardly see how we could come alone to moozuffernuggar unchaperoned  the maharajahs face lighted up he was evidently flattered that we should even thus dubiously entertain his proposal oh ive thought about that too he answered growing more colloquial in tone ive been some days in bombay making inquiries and preparations you see you had not informed the authorities of your intended visit so that you were travelling incognitoor should it be incognitaand if tillington hadnt written to let me know your movements you might have arrived at this port without anybodys knowing it and have been compelled to take refuge in an hotel on landing he spoke as if we had been accustomed all our lives long to be received with red cloth by the mayor and corporation and presented with illuminated addresses and the freedom of the city in a gold snuffbox but i have seen to all that the actinggovernors aidedecamp will be down before long and i have arranged that if you consent a little later to honour my humble roof in rajputana with your august presence major balmossie and his wife will accompany you and chaperon you i have lived in england of course i understand that two english ladies of your rank and position cannot travel aloneas if you were americans but mrs balmossie is a nice little soul of unblemished characterthat sweet touch charmed mereceived at government househe had learned the respect due to mrs grundyso that if you will accept my invitation you may rest assured that everything will be done with the utmost regard to thethe unaccountable prejudices of europeans  his thoughtfulness took me aback i thanked him warmly he unbent at my thanks and i am obliged to you in return he said it gives me real pleasure to be able through you to repay harold tillington part of the debt i owe him he was so good to me at oxford miss cayley you are new to india and thereforeas yetno doubt unprejudiced you treat a native gentleman i see like a human being i hope you will not stop long enough in our country to get over that stageas happens to most of your countrymen and countrywomen in england a man like myself is an indian prince in india to ninetynine out of a hundred europeans he is just a damned nigger  i smiled sympathetically i think i said venturing under these circumstances on a harmless little swearwordof course in quotation marksyou may trust me never to reach damnnigger point  so i believe he answered if you are a friend of harold tillingtons ebony or ivory he never forgot we were two men together  illustration whos your black friend  five minutes later when the maharajah had gone to inquire about our luggage lord southminster strolled up oh i say miss cayley he burst out im off now tata but remembah that offahs always open by the way whos your black friend i couldnt help laughing at the airs the fellah gave himself to see a niggah sitting theah with his suite all round him waving his hands and sunning his rings and behaving for all the world as if he were a gentleman its reahly too ridiculous harold tillington picked up with a fellah like that at oxforddoosid good cricketer too wondah if this is the same one  goodbye lord southminster i said quietly with a stiff little bow remember on your side that your offer was rejected once for all last night yes the indian prince is harold tillingtons friend the maharajah of moozuffernuggarwhose ancestors were princes while ours were dressed in woad and oakleaves but you were right about one thing he behaveslike a gentleman  oh i say the peagreen young man ejaculated drawing back thats anothah in the eye for me youre a good un at facers you gave me one for a welcome and you give me one now for a parting shot nevah mind though i can wait youre backing the wrong fellahbut youre not the ethels and youre well worth waiting for he waved his hand solong see yah again in london  and he retired with that fatuous smile still absorbing his features                                       our three days in bombay were uneventful we merely waited to get rid of the roll of the ship which continued to haunt us for hours after we landedthe floor of our bedrooms having acquired an ugly trick of rising in long undulations as if bombay were suffering from chronic earthquake we made the acquaintance of his honour the acting governor and his honours consort we were also introduced to mrs balmossie the lady who was to chaperon us to moozuffernuggar her husband was a soldierly scotchman from forfarshire but she herself was englisha flighty little body with a perpetual giggle she giggled so much over the idea of the maharajahs inviting us to his palace that i wondered why on earth she accepted his invitation at this she seemed surprised why its one of the jolliest places in rajputana she answered with a bland simla smile so picturesquehe he heand so delightful simpkin flows like water simpkins baboo english for champagne you knowhe he he and though of course the maharajahs only a native like the rest of themhe he hestill hes been educated at oxford and has mixed with europeans and he knows how to make onehe he hewell thoroughly comfortable  but what shall we eat i asked rice ghee and chupatties  oh dear nohe he heeurope food every bit of it foie gras and york ham and wine ad lib his hospitalitys massive if it werent for that of course one wouldnt dream of going there but archie hopes some day to be made resident dont you know and it will do him no harmhe he hewith the foreign office to have cultivated friendly relations beforehand with his highness of moozuffernuggar these nativeshe he heso absurdly sensitive  for myself the maharajah interested me and i rather liked him besides he was harolds friend and that was in itself sufficient recommendation so i determined to push straight into the heart of native india first and only afterwards to do the regulation tourist round of agra and delhi the taj and the mosques benares and allahabad leaving the english and calcutta for the tailend of my journey it was better journalism as i thought that thought i began to fear that mr elworthy was right after all and that i was a born journalist  on the day fixed for our leaving bombay whom should i meet but lord southminsterwith the maharajahat the railway station  he lounged up to me with that eternal smile still vaguely pervading his empty features well we shall have a jolly party i gathah he said they tell me this niggah is famous for his tigahs  i gazed at him positively taken aback you dont mean to tell me i cried you actually propose to accept the maharajahs hospitality  his smile absorbed him yaas he answered twirling his yellow moustache and gazing across at the unconscious prince who was engaged in overlooking the arrangements for our saloon carriage the black fellah discovahed i was a cousin of harolds so he came to call upon me at the club of which some johnnies heah made me an honorary membah hes offahed me the run of his place while im in indiah and of course ive accepted eccentric sort of chap cant make him out myself says anyone connected with harold tillington is always deah to him rum start isnt it  he is a mere oriental i answered unused to the ways of civilised life he cherishes the superannuated virtue of gratitude  yaas no doubtso im coming along with you  i drew back horrified now while i am there after what i told you last week on the steamer  oh thats all right i bear yah no malice if i want any fun of course i must go while youre at moozuffernuggar  why so  yah see this black boundah means to get up some big things at his place in your honah and one naturally goes to stop with anyone who has big things to offah hang it all what does it mattah who a fellah is if he can give yah good shooting its shooting dont yah know that keeps society in england togethah  and therefore you propose to stop in the same house with me i exclaimed in spite of what i have told you well lord southminster i should have thought there were limits which even your taste  he cut me short with an inane grin there you make your blooming little erraw he answered airily i told yah i keep my offah still open and hang it all i dont mean to lose sight of yah in a hurry some other fellah might come along and pick you up when i wasnt looking and i dont want to miss yah in point of fact i dont mind telling yah i back myself still for a couple of thou soonah or latah to marry yah its dogged as does it faint heart they say nevah won fair lady  if it had not been that i could not bear to disappoint my indian prince i think when i heard this i should have turned back then and there at the station  the journey up country was uneventful but dusty the mofussil appears to consist mainly of dust indeed i can now recall nothing of it but one pervading white cloud which has blotted from my memory all its other components the dust clung to my hair after many washings and was never really beaten out of my travelling clothes i believe part of it thus went round the world with me to england when at last we reached moozuffernuggar after two days and a nights hard travelling we were met by a crowd of local grandees who looked as if they had spent the greater part of their lives in brushing back their whiskers and we drove up at once in european carriages to the maharajahs palace the look of it astonished me it was a strange and rambling old hindoo hillfort high perched on a scarped crag like edinburgh castle and accessible only on one side up a gigantic staircase guarded on either hand by huge sculptured elephants cut in the living sandstone below clustered the town an intricate mass of tangled alleys i had never seen anything so picturesque or so dirty in my life as for elsie she was divided between admiration for its beauty and terror at the bigwhiskered and whiteturbaned attendants  what sort of rooms shall we have i whispered to our moral guarantee mrs balmossie  oh beautiful dear the little lady smirked back furnished throughouthe he heby liberty the maharajah wants to do honour to his european guestshe he hehe fancies poor man hes quite european thats what comes of sending these creatures to oxford so hes had suites of rooms furnished for any white visitors who may chance to come his way ridiculous isnt it and champagneoh gallons of it hes quite proud of his rooms he he hehes always asking people to come and occupy them he thinks hes done them up in the best style of decoration  he had reason for they were as tasteful as they were dainty and comfortable and i could not for the life of me make out why his hospitable inclination should be voted ridiculous but mrs balmossie appeared to find all natives alike a huge joke together she never even spoke of them without a condescending smile of distant compassion indeed most angloindians seem first to do their best to anglicise the hindoo and then to laugh at him for aping the englishman  after we had been three days at the palace and had spent hours in the wonderful temples and ruins the maharajah announced with considerable pride at breakfast one morning that he had got up a tigerhunt in our special honour  lord southminster rubbed his hands  ha thats right maharaj he said briskly i do love big game to tell yah the truth old man thats just what i came heah for  you do me too much honour the hindoo answered with quiet sarcasm my town and palace may have little to offer that is worth your attention but i am glad that my big game at least has been lucky enough to attract you  the remark was thrown away on the peagreen young man he had described his host to me as a black boundah out of his own mouth i condemned himhe supplied the very wordhe was himself nothing more than a born bounder  illustration a tigerhunt is not a thing to be got up lightly  during the next few days the preparations for the tigerhunt occupied all the maharajahs energies you know miss cayley he said to me as we stood upon the big stairs looking down on the hindoo city a tigerhunt is not a thing to be got up lightly our people themselves dont like killing a tiger they reverence it too much theyre afraid its spirit might haunt them afterwards and bring them bad luck thats one of our superstitions  you do not share it yourself then i asked  he drew himself up and opened his palms with a twinkling of pendant emeralds i am royal he answered with naïve dignity and the tiger is a royal beast kings know the ways of kings if a king kills what is kingly it owes him no grudge for it but if a common man or a low caste man were to kill a tigerwho can say what might happen  i saw he was not himself quite free from the superstition  our peasants he went on fixing me with his great black eyes wont even mention the tiger by name for fear of offending him they believe him to be the dwellingplace of a powerful spirit if they wish to speak of him they say the great beast or my lord the striped one some think the spirit is immortal except at the hands of a king but they have no objection to see him destroyed by others they will even point out his whereabouts and rejoice over his death for it relieves the village of a serious enemy and they believe the spirit will only haunt the huts of those who actually kill him  then you know where each tiger lives i asked  as well as your gamekeepers in england know which covert may be drawn for foxes yes tis a royal sport and we keep it for maharajahs i myself never hunt a tiger till some european visitor of distinction comes to moozuffernuggar that i may show him good sport this tiger we shall hunt tomorrow for example he is a bad old hand he has carried off the buffaloes of my villagers over yonder for years and years and of late he has also become a maneater he once ate a whole family at a meala man his wife and his three children the people at janwargurh have been pestering me for weeks to come and shoot him and each week he has eaten somebodya child or a woman the last was yesterdaybut i waited till you came because i thought it would be something to show you that you would not be likely to see elsewhere  and you let the poor people go on being eaten that we might enjoy this sport i cried  he shrugged his shoulders and opened his palms they were villagers you knowryots mere tillers of the soilpoor naked peasants i have thousands of them to spare if a tiger eats ten of them they only say it was written upon their foreheads one woman more or lesswho would notice her at moozuffernuggar  then i perceived that the maharajah was a gentleman but still a barbarian  the eventful morning arrived at last and we started all agog for the jungle where the tiger was known to live elsie excused herself she remarked to me the night before as i brushed her back hair for her that she had half a mind not to go my dear i answered giving the brush a good dash for a higher mathematician that phrase lacks accuracy if you were to say seveneighths of a mind it would be nearer the mark in point of fact if you ask my opinion your inclination to go is a vanishing quantity  she admitted the impeachment with an accusing blush youre quite right brownie to tell you the truth im afraid of it  so am i dear horribly afraid between ourselves im in a deadly funk of it but the brave man is not he that feels no fear and i believe the same principle applies almost equally to the brave woman i mean that fear to subdue as far as i am able the maharajah says i shall be the first girl who has ever gone tigerhunting im frightened out of my life i never held a gun in my born days before but elsie recollect this is splendid journalism i intend to go through with it  you offer yourself on the altar brownie  i do dear i propose to die in the cause i expect my proprietor to carve on my tomb sacred to the memory of the martyr of journalism she was killed in the act of taking shorthand notes by a bengal tiger  we started at early dawn a motley mixture my short bicycling skirt did beautifully for tigerhunting there was a vast company of native swells nawabs and ranas in gorgeous costumes whose precise names and titles i do not pretend to remember there were also major balmossie lord southminster the maharajah and myselfall mounted on gailycaparisoned elephants we had likewise on foot a miserable crowd of wretched beaters with dirty white loincloths we were all very brave of coursedemonstratively braveand we talked a great deal at the start about the exhilaration given by the spice of danger but it somehow struck me that the poor beaters on foot had the majority of the danger and extremely little of the exhilaration each of us great folk was mounted on his own elephant which carried a light basketwork howdah in two compartments the front one intended for the noble sportsman the back one for a servant with extra guns and ammunition i pretended to like it but i fear i trembled visibly our mahouts sat on the elephants necks each armed with a pointed goad to whose admonition the huge beasts answered like clockwork a born journalist always pretends to know everything before hand so i speak carelessly of the mahout as if he were a familiar acquaintance but i dont mind telling you aside in confidence that i had only just learnt the word that morning  the maharajah protested at first against my taking part in the actual hunt but i think his protest was merely formal in his heart of hearts i believe he was proud that the first lady tigerhunter should have joined his party  dusty and shadeless the road from moozuffernuggar fares straight across the plain towards the crumbling mountains behind in the heat mist the castle and palace on their steeplyscarped crag with the squalid town that clustered at their feet reminded me once more most strangely of edinburgh where i used to spend my vacations from girton but the pitiless sun differed greatly from the gray haar of the northern metropolis it warmed into intense white the little temples of the wayside and beat on our heads with tropical garishness  i am bound to admit also that tigerhunting is not quite all it is cracked up to be in my fancy i had pictured the gallant and bloodthirsty beast rushing out upon us full pelt from some grassgrown nullah at the first sniff of our presence and fiercely attacking both men and elephants instead of that i will confess the whole truth frightened as at least one of us was of the tiger the tiger was still more desperately frightened of his human assailants i could see clearly that so far from rushing out of his own accord to attack us his one desire was to be let alone he was horribly afraid he skulked in the jungle like a wary old fox in a trusty spinney there was no nullah whatever a nullah may be there was only a waste of dusty canebrake we encircled the tall grass patch where he lurked forming a big round with a ringfence of elephants the beaters on foot advancing half naked with a caution with which i could fully sympathise endeavoured by loud shouts and gesticulations to rouse the royal beast to a sense of his position not a bit of it the royal beast declined to be drawn he preferred retirement the maharajah whose elephant was stationed next to mine even apologised for the resolute cowardice with which he clung to his ignoble lurkingplace  the beaters drew in the elephants raising their trunks in air and sniffing suspicion moved slowly inward we had girt him round now with a perfect ring through which he could not possibly break without attacking somebody the maharajah kept a fixed eye on my personal safety but still the royal animal crouched and skulked and still the black beaters shrieked howled and gesticulated at last among the tall perpendicular lights and shadows of the big grasses and bamboos i seemed to see something movesomething striped like the stems yet passing slowly slowly slowly between them it moved in a stealthy undulating line no one could believe till he saw it how the bright flamecoloured bands of vivid orangeyellow on the monsters flanks and the interspersed black stripes could fade away and harmonise in their native surroundings with the lights and shades of the upright jungle it was a marvel of mimicry look there i cried to the maharajah pointing one eager hand what is that thing there moving  he stared where i pointed by jove he cried raising his rifle with a sportsmans quickness you have spotted him first the tiger  the terrified beast stole slowly and cautiously through the tall grasses his lithe silken side gliding in and out snakewise and only his fierce eyes burning bright with gleaming flashes between the gloom of the jungle once i had seen him i could follow with ease his sinuous path among the tangled bamboos a waving line of beauty in perpetual motion the maharajah followed him too with his keen eyes and pointed his rifle hastily but quick as he was lord southminster was before him i had half expected to find the peagreen young man turn coward at the last moment but in that i was mistaken i will do him the justice to say whatever else he was he was a born sportsman the gleam of joy in his leaden eye when he caught sight of the tiger the flush of excitement on his pasty face the eagerness of his alert attitude were things to see and remember that moment almost ennobled him in sight of danger the best instincts of the savage seemed to revive within him in civilised life he was a poor creature face to face with a wild beast he became a mighty shikari perhaps that was why he was so fond of biggame shooting he may have felt it raised him in the scale of being  he lifted his rifle and fired he was a cool shot and he wounded the beast upon its left shoulder i could see the great crimson stream gush out all at once across the shapely sides staining the flamecoloured stripes and reddening the black shadows the tiger drew back gave a low fierce growl and then crouched among the jungle i saw he was going to leap he bent his huge backbone into a strong downward curve took in a deep breath and stood at bay glaring at us which elephant would he attack that was what he was now debating next moment with a frightful rrrr he had straightened out his muscles and like a bolt from a bow had launched his huge bulk forward  i never saw his charge i never knew he had leapt upon me i only felt my elephant rock from side to side like a ship in a storm he was trumpeting shaking roaring with rage and pain for the tiger was on his flanks its claws buried deep in the skin of his forehead i could not keep my seat i felt myself tossed about in the frail howdah like a pill in a pillbox the elephant in a death grapple was trying to shake off his ghastly enemy for a minute or two i was conscious of nothing save this swinging movement then opening my eyes for a second i saw the tiger in all his terrible beauty clinging to the elephants head by the claws of his fore paws and struggling for a foothold on its trunk with his mighty hind legs in a wounded agony of despair and vengeance he would sell his life dear he would have one or other of us  lord southminster raised his rifle again but the maharajah shouted aloud in an angry voice dont fire dont fire you will kill the lady you cant aim at him like that the beast is rocking so that no one can say where a shot will take effect down with your gun sir instantly  illustration it went off unexpectedly  my mahout unable to keep his seat with the rocking now dropped off his cushion among the scrub below he could speak a few words of english shoot mem sahib shoot he cried flinging his hands up but i was tossed to and fro from side to side with my rifle under my arm it was impossible to aim yet in sheer terror i tried to draw the trigger i failed but somehow i caught my rifle against the side of my cage something snapped in it somewhere it went off unexpectedly without my aiming or firing i shut my eyes when i opened them again i saw a swimming picture of the great sullen beast loosing his hold on the elephant i saw his brindled face i saw his white tusks but his gleaming pupils burned bright no longer his jaw was full towards me i had shot him between the eyes he fell slowly with blood streaming from his nostrils and his tongue lolling out his muscles relaxed his huge limbs grew limp in a minute he lay stretched at full length on the ground with his head on one side a grand terrible picture  my mahout flung up his hands in wonder and amazement my father he cried aloud truly the mem sahib is a great shikari  the maharajah stretched across to me that was a wonderful shot he exclaimed i could never have believed a woman could show such nerve and coolness  nerve and coolness indeed i was trembling all over like an italian greyhound every limb a jelly and i had not even fired the rifle went off of itself without me i am innocent of having ever endangered the life of a haycock but once more i dissembled yes it was a difficult shot i said jauntily as if i rather liked tigerhunting i didnt think id hit him still the effect of my speech was somewhat marred i fear by the tears that in spite of me rolled down my cheek silently  pon honah i nevah saw a finah piece of shooting in my life lord southminster drawled out then he added aside in an undertone makes a fellow moah determined to annex her than evah  i sat in my howdah half dazed i hardly heard what they were saying my heart danced like the elephant then it stood still within me i was only aware of a feeling of faintness luckily for my reputation as a mighty sportswoman however i just managed to keep up and did not actually faint as i was more than half inclined to do  next followed the native pæan the beaters crowded round the fallen beast in a chorus of congratulation many of the villagers also ran out with prayers and ejaculations to swell our triumph it was all like a dream they hustled round me and salaamed to me a woman had shot him wonderful a babel of voices resounded in my ears i was aware that pure accident had elevated me into a heroine  put the beast on a pad elephant the maharajah called out  the beaters tied ropes round his body and raised him with difficulty  the maharajahs face grew stern where are the whiskers he asked fiercely in his own tongue which major balmossie interpreted for me  the beaters and the villagers bowing low and expanding their hands made profuse expressions of ignorance and innocence but the fact was patentthe grand face had been mangled while they had crowded in a dense group round the fallen carcass somebody had cut off the lips and whiskers and secreted them  they have ruined the skin the maharajah cried out in angry tones i intended it for the lady i shall have them all searched and the man who has done this thing  illustration i saw him now the oriental despot  he broke off and looked around him his silence was more terrible by far than the fiercest threat i saw him now the oriental despot all the natives drew back awestruck  the voice of a king is the voice of a great god my mahout murmured in a solemn whisper then nobody else said anything  why do they want the whiskers i asked just to set things straight again they seem to have been in a precious hurry to take them  the maharajahs brow cleared he turned to me once more with his european manner a tigers body has wonderful power after his death he answered his fangs and his claws are very potent charms his heart gives courage whoever eats of it will never know fear his liver preserves against death and pestilence but the highest virtue of all exists in his whiskers they are mighty talismans chopped up in food they act as a slow poison which no doctor can detect no antidote guard against they are also a sovereign remedy against magic or the evil eye and administered to women they make an irresistible philtre a puissant lovepotion they secure you the heart of whoever drinks them  id give a couple of monkeys for those whiskahs lord southminster murmured half unnoticed  we began to move again well go on to where we know there is another tiger the maharajah said lightly as if tigers were partridges miss cayley you will come with us  i rested on my laurels i was quivering still from head to foot no thank you maharajah as unconcernedly as i could ive had quite enough sport for my first days tigerhunting i think ill go back now and write a newspaper account of this little adventure  you have had luck he put in not everyone kills a tiger his first day out this will make good reading  i wouldnt have missed it for a hundred pounds i answered  then try another  i wouldnt try another for a thousand i cried fervently that evening at the palace i was the heroine of the day they toasted me in a bumper of heidsiecks dry monopole the men made speeches everybody talked gushingly of my splendid courage and my steadiness of hand it was a brilliant shot under such difficult circumstances for myself i said nothing i pretended to look modest i dared not confess the truththat i never fired at all and from that day to this i have never confessed it till i write it down now in these confiding memoirs  illustration its i who am the winnah  one episode cast a gloom over my illdeserved triumph in the course of the evening a telegram arrived for the peagreen young man by a whiteturbaned messenger he read it and crumpled it up carelessly in his hand i looked inquiry yaas he answered nodding youre quite right its that pooah old marmy has gone aftah all ezekiel and habakkuk have carried off his sixteen stone at last and i dont mind telling yah nowthough it was a neah thingits i who am the winnah     x  the adventure of the crosseyed qc   the cold weather as it is humorously called was now drawing to a close and the young ladies in sailor hats and cambric blouses who flock to india each autumn for the annual marriagemarket were beginning to resign themselves to a return to englandunless of course they had succeeded in catching so i realised that i must hurry on to delhi and agra if i was not to be intercepted by the intolerable summer  when we started from moozuffernuggar for delhi and the east lord southminster was starting for bombay and europe this surprised me not a little for he had confided to my unsympathetic ear a few nights earlier in the maharajahs billiardroom that he was stony broke and must wait at moozuffernuggar for lack of funds till the oofbird laid at his bankers in england his conversation enlarged my vocabulary at any rate  so youve managed to get away i exclaimed as he dawdled up to me at the hot and dusty station  yaas he drawled fixing his eyeglass and lighting a cigarette ivepfmanaged to get away maharaj seems to have thoughtpfit would be cheepah in the end to pay me out than to keep me  you dont mean to say he offered to lend you money i cried  no not exactly that i offahed to borrow it  from the man you call a nigger  his smile spread broader over his face than ever well we borrow from the jews yah know he said pleasantly so why the jooce shouldnt we borrow from the heathen also spoiling the egyptians dont yah seethe same as we used to read about in the scripchah when we were innocent kiddies like marriage quite you borrow in hasteand repay at leisure  he strolled off and took his seat i was glad to get rid of him at the main line junction  in accordance with my usual merciful custom i spare you the details of our visit to agra muttra benares at calcutta elsie left me her health was now quite restored dear little soul i felt i had done that one good thing in life if no otherand she could no longer withstand the higher mathematics which were beckoning her to london with invisible fingers for myself having so far accomplished my original design of going round the world with twopence in my pocket i could not bear to draw back at half the circuit and mr elworthy having willingly consented to my return by singapore and yokohama i set out alone on my homeward journey  illustration he wrote i expect you to come back to england and marry me  harold wrote me from london that all was going well he had found the will which i drew up at florence in his uncles escritoire and everything was left to him but he trusted in spite of this untoward circumstance long absence might have altered my determination dear lois he wrote i expect you to come back to england and marry me  i was brief but categorical nothing meanwhile had altered my resolve i did not wish to be considered mercenary while he was rich and honoured i could never take him if some day fortune frownedbut therelet us not forestall the feet of calamity let us await contingencies  still i was heavy in heart if only it had been otherwise to say the truth i should be thrown away on a millionaire but just think what a splendid managing wife a girl like me would have made for a penniless pauper  at yokohama however while i dawdled in curiosity shops a telegram from harold startled me into seriousness my chance at last i knew what it meant that villain higginson  come home at once i want your evidence to clear my character southminster opposes the will as a forgery he has a strong case the experts are with him  forgery that was clever i never thought of that i suspected them of trying to forge a will of their own but to upset the real oneto throw the burden of suspicion on harolds shouldershow much subtler and craftier  i saw at a glance it gave them every advantage in the first place it put harold virtually in the place of the accused and compelled him to defend instead of attackingan attitude which prejudices people against one from the outset then again it implied positive criminality on his part and so allowed lord southminster to assume the air of injured innocence the eldest son of the eldest brother unjustly set aside by the scheming machinations of an unscrupulous cousin primogeniture the ingrained english love for keeping up the dignity of a noble family the prejudice in favour of the direct male line as against the femaleall were astutely utilised in lord southminsters interest but worst of all it was i who had typewritten the willi a friend of harolds a woman whom lord southminster would doubtless try to exhibit as his fiancée i saw at once how much like conspiracy it looked harold and i had agreed together to concoct a false document and harold had forged his uncles signature to it could a british jury doubt when a lord declared it  fortunately i was just in time to catch the canadian steamer from japan to vancouver but oh the endless breadth of that broad pacific how time seemed to lag as each day one rose in the morning in the midst of space blue sky overhead behind one the hard horizon in front of one the hard horizon and nothing else visible then steamed on all day to arrive at night wherewhy in the midst of space starry sky overhead behind one the dim horizon in front of one the dim horizon and nothing else visible the nile was childs play to it  illustration it was endlessly wearisome  day after day we steamed and night after night were still where we beganin the centre of the sea no farther from our startingpoint no nearer to our goal yet for ever steaming it was endlessly wearisome who could say what might be happening meanwhile in england  at last after months as it seemed of this slow torture we reached vancouver there in the raw new town a telegram awaited me glad to hear you are coming make all haste you may be just in time to arrive for the trial  just in time i would not waste a moment i caught the first train on the canadian pacific and travelled straight through day and night to montreal and quebec without one hours interval  i cannot describe to you that journey across a continent i had never before seen it was endless and hopeless i only know that we crawled up the rocky mountains and the selkirk range over spiderlike viaducts with interminable effort and that the prairies were just the broad pacific over again they rolled on for ever but we did reach quebecin time we reached it and we caught by an hour the first liner to liverpool  at princes landingstage another telegram awaited me come on at once case now proceeding harold is in court we need your evidencegeorgina fawley  i might still be in time to vindicate harolds character  at euston to my surprise i was met not only by my dear cantankerous old lady but also by my friend the magnificent maharajah dressed this time in a frockcoat and silk hat of bond street glossiness  what has brought you to england i asked astonished the jubilee  he smiled and showed his two fine rows of white teeth that nominally in reality the cricket season i play for berks but most of all to see dear tillington safe through this trouble  hes a brick lady georgina cried with enthusiasm a regular brick my dear lois his carriage is waiting outside to take you up to my house he has stood by haroldwell like a christian  or a hindu the maharajah corrected smiling  and how have you been all this time dear lady georgina i asked hardly daring to inquire about what was nearest to my soulharold  the cantankerous old lady knitted her brows in a familiar fashion oh my dear dont ask i havent known a happy hour since you left me in switzerland lois i shall never be happy again without you it would pay me to give you a retaining fee of a thousand a yearhonour bright it would i assure you what ive suffered from the gretchens since youve been in the east has only been equalled by what ive suffered from the mary annes and the célestines not a hair left on my scalp not one hair i declare to you theyve made my head into a tabula rasa for the various restorers george r sims and mrs s a allen are going to fight it out between them my dear i wish you could take my maids place ive always said  i finished the speech for her a lady can do better whatever she turns her hand to than any of these hussies  she nodded and why because her hands are hands while as for the gretchens and the mary annes paws is the only word one can honestly apply to them then on top of it all comes this trouble about harold so distressing isnt it you see at the point which the matter has reached its simply impossible to save harolds reputation without wrecking southminsters pretty position that for a respectable family the ashursts hitherto have been quite respectable a corespondent or two perhaps but never anything serious now either southminster sends harold to prison or harold sends southminster theres a nice sort of dilemma i always knew kynastons boys were born fools but to find theyre born knaves too is hard on an old woman in her hairless dotage however youve come my child and youll soon set things right youre the one person on earth i can trust in this matter  harold go to prison my head reeled at the thought i staggered out into the open air and took my seat mechanically in the maharajahs carriage all london swam before me after so many months absence the polychromatic decorations of our english streets looming up through the smoke seemed both strange and familiar i drove through the first half mile with a vague consciousness that liptons tea is the perfection of cocoa and matchless for the complexion but that it dyes all colours and wont wash clothes  after a while however i woke up to the full terror of the situation where are you taking me i inquired  to my house dear lady georgina answered looking anxiously at me for my face was bloodless  no that wont do i answered my cue must be now to keep myself as aloof as possible from harold and harolds backers i must put up at an hotel it will sound so much better in crossexamination  shes quite right the maharajah broke in with sudden conviction one must block every ball with these nasty swift bowlers  wheres harold i asked after another pause why didnt he come to meet me  my dear how could he hes under examination a crosseyed qc with an odious leer southminsters chosen the biggest bully at the bar to support his contention  drive to some hotel in the jermyn street district i cried to the maharajahs coachman that will be handy for the law courts  he touched his hat and turned in a sort of dickey behind sat two gorgeousturbaned rajput servants  that evening harold came round to visit me at my rooms i could see he was much agitated things had gone very badly lady georgina was there she had stopped to dine with me dear old thing lest i should feel lonely and give way so had elsie petheridge mr elworthy sent a telegram of welcome from devonshire i knew at least that my friends were rallying round me in this hour of trial the kind maharajah himself would have come too if i had allowed him but i thought it inexpedient they explained everything to me harold had propounded mr ashursts willthe one i drew up at florenceand had asked for probate lord southminster intervened and opposed the grant of probate on the ground that the signatures were forgeries he propounded instead another will drawn some twenty years earlier when they were both children duly executed at the time and undoubtedly genuine in it testator left everything without reserve to the eldest son of his eldest brother lord kynaston  marmy didnt know in those days that kynastons sons would all grow up fools lady georgina said tartly besides which that was before the poor dear soul took to plunging on the stock exchange and made his money he had nothing to leave then but his best silk hat and a few paltry hundreds afterwards when hed feathered his nest in soap and cocoa he discovered that bertiethats lord southminsterwas a firstclass idiot marmy never liked southminster nor southminster marmy for after all with all his faults marmy was a gentleman while bertiewell my dear we neednt put a name to it so he altered his will as you know when he saw the sort of man southminster turned out and left practically everything he possessed to harold  who are the witnesses to the will i asked  theres the trouble who do you think why higginsons sister who was marmys masseuse and a waiterfranz markheimat the hotel at florence whos dead they sayor at least not forthcoming  and higginsons sister forswears her signature harold added gloomily while the experts are most of them dead against the genuineness of my uncles  thats clever i said leaning back and taking it in slowly higginsons sister how well theyve worked it they couldnt prevent mr ashurst from making this will but they managed to supply their own tainted witnesses if it had been higginson himself now hed have had to be crossexamined and in crossexamination of course we could have shaken his credit by bringing up the episodes of the count de larochesurloiret and dr fortescuelangley but his sister whats she like have you anything against her  my dear lady georgina cried there the rogue has bested us isnt it just like him what do you suppose he has done why provided himself with a sister of tried respectability and blameless character  and she denies that it is her handwriting i asked  declares on her bible oath she never signed the document  i was fairly puzzled it was a stupendously clever dodge higginson must have trained up his sister for forty years in the ways of wickedness yet held her in reserve for this supreme moment  and where is higginson i asked  lady georgina broke into a hysterical laugh where is he my dear thats the question with consummate strategy the wretch has disappeared into space at the last moment  thats artful again i said his presence could only damage their case i can see of course lord southminster has no need of him  southminsters the wiliest fool that ever lived harold broke out bitterly under that mask of imbecility hes a fox for trickiness  i bit my lip well if you succeed in evading him i said you will have cleared your character and if you dontthen harold our time will have come you will have your longedfor chance of trying me  that wont do me much good he answered if i have to wait fourteen years for youat portland  illustration the crosseyed qc begged him to be very careful  next morning in court i heard harolds crossexamination he described exactly where he had found the contested will in his uncles escritoire the crosseyed qc a heavy man with bloated features and a bulbous nose begged him with one fat uplifted forefinger to be very careful how did he know where to look for it  because i knew the house well i knew where my uncle was likely to keep his valuables  oh indeed not because you had put it there  the court rang with laughter my face grew crimson  after an hour or two of fencing harold was dismissed he stood down baffled counsel recalled lord southminster  the peagreen young man stepping briskly up gazed about him openmouthed with a vacant stare the look of cunning on his face was carefully suppressed he wore on the contrary an air of injured innocence combined with an eyeglass  you did not put this will in the drawer where mr tillington found it did you counsel asked  the peagreen young man laughed no i certainly didnt put it theah my cousin harold was man in possession he took jolly good care i didnt come neah the premises  do you think you could forge a will if you tried  lord southminster laughed no i dont he answered with a wellassumed naïveté thats just the difference between us dont yah know im what they call a fool and my cousin harolds a precious clevah fellah  there was another loud laugh  thats not evidence the judge observed severely  it was not but it told far more than much that was it told strongly against harold  besides lord southminster continued with engaging frankness if i forged a will at all id take jolly good care to forge it in my own favah  my turn came next our counsel handed me the incriminated will did you draw up this document he asked  i looked at it closely the paper bore our florentine watermark and was written with a spreadeagle i typewrote it i answered gazing at it with care to make sure i recognised it  our counsels business was to uphold the will not to cast aspersions upon it he was evidently annoyed at my close examination you have no doubts about it he said trying to prompt me  i hesitated no no doubts i answered turning over the sheet and inspecting it still closer i typewrote it at florence  do you recognise that signature as mr marmaduke ashursts he went on  i stared at it was it his it was like it certainly yet that k and those ss i almost wondered  counsel was obviously annoyed at my hesitation he thought i was playing into the enemys hands is it his or is it not he inquired again testily  it is his i answered yet i own i was troubled  illustration i was a grotesque failure  he asked many questions about the circumstances of the interview when i took down the will i answered them all but i vaguely felt he and i were at crosspurposes i grew almost as uncomfortable under his gaze as if he had been examining me in the interest of the other side he managed to fluster me as a witness for harold i was a grotesque failure  then the crosseyed qc rising and shaking his huge bulk began to crossexamine me where did you typewrite this thing do you say he said pointing to it contemptuously  in my office at florence  yes i understand you had an office in florenceafter you gave up retailing bicycles on the public roads and you had a partner i thinka miss petherick or petherton or pennyfarthing or something  miss petheridge i corrected while the court tittered  ah petheridge you call it well now answer this question carefully did your miss petheridge hear mr ashurst dictate the terms of his last will and testament  no i answered the interview was of a strictly confidential character mr ashurst took me aside into the back room at our office  oh he took you aside confidential well now were getting at it and did anybody but yourself see or hear any part whatsoever of this precious document  certainly not i replied it was a private matter  private oh very nobody else saw it did mr ashurst take it away from the office in person  no he sent his courier for it  his courier the man higginson  yes but i refused to give it to higginson i took it myself that night to the hotel where mr ashurst was stopping  ah you took it yourself so the only other person who knows anything at first hand about the existence of the alleged will is this person higginson  miss petheridge knows i said flushing at the time i told her of it  oh you told her well that doesnt help us much if what you are swearing isnt trueremember you are on your oathwhat you told miss petherick or petheridge or pennyfarthing at the time can hardly be regarded as corroborative evidence your word then and your word now are just equally valuableor equally worthless the only person who knows besides yourself is higginson now i ask you where is higginson are you going to produce him  the wicked cunning of it struck me dumb they were keeping him away and then using his absence to cast doubts on my veracity stop i cried taken aback higginson is well known to be a rogue and he is keeping away lest he may damage your side i know nothing of higginson  yes im coming to that in good time dont be afraid that were going to pass over higginson you admit this man is a man of bad character now what do you know of him  i told the stories of the count and of dr fortescuelangley  the crosseyed crossexaminer leant across towards me and leered and this is the man he exclaimed with a triumphant air whose sister you pretended you had got to sign this precious document of yours  whom mr ashurst got to sign it i answered redhot it is not my document  and you have heard that she swears it is not her signature at all  so they tell me she is higginsons sister for all i know she may be prepared to swear or to forswear anything  dont cast doubt upon our witnesses without cause miss higginson is an eminently respectable woman you gave this document to mr ashurst you say there your knowledge of it ends a signature is placed on it which is not his as our experts testify it purports to be witnessed by a swiss waiter who is not forthcoming and who is asserted to be dead as well as by a nurse who denies her signature and the only other person who knows of its existence before mr tillington discovers it in his uncles desk isthe missing man higginson is that or is it not the truth of the matter  i suppose so i said baffled  well now as to this man higginson he first appears upon the scene so far as you are concerned on the day when you travelled from london to schlangenbad  that is so i answered  and he nearly succeeded then in stealing lady georgina fawleys jewelcase  he nearly took it but i saved it and i explained the circumstance  the crosseyed qc held his fat sides with his hands looking incredulously at me and smiled his vast width of waistcoat shook with silent merriment you are a very clever young lady he murmured you can explain away anything but dont you think it just as likely that it was a plot between you two and that owing to some mistake the plot came off unsuccessful  i do not i cried crimson i never saw the count before that morning  he tried another tack still wherever you went this man higginsonthe only other person you admit who knows about the previous existence of the willturned up simultaneously he was always turning upat the same place as you did he turned up at lucerne as a faithhealer didnt he  if you will allow me to explain i cried biting my lip  he bowed all blandness oh certainly he murmured explain away everything  i explained but of course he had discounted and damaged my explanation  he made no comment and then he went on with his hands on his hips and his obtrusive rotundity he turned up at florence as courier to mr ashurst at the very date when this socalled will was being concocted  he was at florence when mr ashurst dictated it to me i answered growing desperate  you admit he was in florence good once more he turned up in india with my client lord southminster upon whose youth and inexperience he had managed to impose himself and he carried him off did he not by one of these strange coincidences to which you are peculiarly liable on the very same steamer on which you happened to be travelling  lord southminster told me he took higginson with him because a rogue suited his book i answered warmly  will you swear his lordship didnt say the rogue suited his bookwhich is quite another thing the qc asked blandly  i will swear he did not i replied i have correctly reported him  then i congratulate you young lady on your excellent memory my lud will you allow me later to recall lord southminster to testify on this point  the judge nodded  now once more as to your relations with the various members of the ashurst family you introduced yourself to lady georgina fawley i believe quite casually on a seat in kensington gardens  that is true i answered  you had never seen her before  never  and you promptly offered to go with her as her ladys maid to schlangenbad in germany  in place of her ladys maid for one week i answered  ah a delicate distinction in place of her ladys maid you are a lady i believe an officers daughter you told us educated at girton  so i have said already i replied crimson  and you stick to it by all means tellthe truthand stick to it its always safest now dont you think it was rather an odd thing for an officers daughter to doto run about germany as maid to a lady of title  illustration the jury smiled  i tried to explain once more but the jury smiled you cant justify originality to a british jury why they would send you to prison at once for that alone if they made the laws as well as dispensing them  he passed on after a while to another topic i think you have boasted more than once in society that when you first met lady georgina fawley you had twopence in your pocket to go round the world with  i had i answeredand i went round the world with it  exactly im getting there in time with itand other things a few months later more or less you were touring up the nile in your steam dahabeeah and in the lap of luxury you were taking salooncarriages on indian railways werent you  i explained again the dahabeeah was in the service of the daily telephone i answered i became a journalist  he crossquestioned me about that then i am to understand he said at last leaning forward with all his waistcoat that you sprang yourself upon mr elworthy at sight pretty much as you sprang yourself upon lady georgina fawley  we arranged matters quickly i admitted the dexterous wretch was making my strongest points all tell against me  hm well he was a man and you will admit i suppose fingering his smooth fat chin that you are a lady ofwhat is the stock phrase the reporters useconsiderable personal attractions  my lord i said turning to the bench i appeal to you has he the right to compel me to answer that question  illustration the question requires no answer he said  the judge bowed slightly the question requires no answer he said with a quiet emphasis i burned bright scarlet  well my lud i defer to your ruling the crosseyed crossexaminer continued radiant i go on to another point when in india i believe you stopped for some time as a guest in the house of a native maharajah  is that matter relevant the judge asked sharply  my lud the qc said in his blandest voice i am striving to suggest to the jury that this ladythe only person who ever beheld this socalled will till mr harold tillingtondescribed in its terms as younger of gledcliffe whatever that may beproduced it out of his uncles desk i am striving to suggest that this lady ismy duty to my client compels me to sayan adventuress  he had uttered the word i felt my character had not a leg left to stand upon before a british jury  i went there with my friend miss petheridge i began  oh miss petheridge once moreyou hunt in couples  accompanied and chaperoned by a married lady the wife of a major balmossie on the bombay staff corps  that was certainly prudent one ought to be chaperoned can you produce the lady  how is it possible i cried mrs balmossie is in india  yes but the maharajah i understand is in london  that is true i answered  and he came to meet you on your arrival yesterday  with lady georgina fawley i cried taken off my guard  do you not consider it curious he asked that these higginsons and these maharajahs should happen to follow you so closely round the worldshould happen to turn up wherever you do  he came to be present at this trial i exclaimed  and so did you i believe he met you at euston last night and drove you to your hotel in his private carriage  with lady georgina fawley i answered once more  and lady georgina is on mr tillingtons side i fancy ah yes i thought so and mr tillington also called to see you and likewise miss petherick i beg your pardon petheridge we must be strictly accuratewhere miss petheridge is concerned and in fact you had quite a little family party  my friends were glad to see me back again i murmured  he sprang a fresh innuendo but mr tillington did not resent your visit to this gallant maharajah  certainly not i cried bridling why should he  oh were getting to that too now answer me this carefully we want to find out what interest you might have supposing a will were forged on either side in arranging its terms we want to find out just who would benefit by it please reply to this question yes or no without prevarication are you or are you not conditionally engaged to mr harold tillington  if i might explain i began quivering  he sneered you have a genius for explaining we are aware answer me first yes or no we will qualify afterward  i glanced appealingly at the judge he was adamant answer as counsel directs you witness he said sternly  yes i am i faltered but  excuse me one moment you promised to marry him conditionally upon the result of mr ashursts testamentary dispositions  i did i answered but  my explanation was drowned in roars of laughter in which the judge joined in spite of himself when the mirth in court had subsided a little i went on i told mr tillington i would only marry him in case he was poor and without expectations if he inherited mr marmaduke ashursts money i could never be his wife i said it proudly  the crosseyed qc drew himself up and let his rotundity take care of itself do you take me he inquired for one of her majestys horsemarines  there was another roar of laughterfeebly suppressed by a judicial frownand i slank away annihilated  you can go my persecutor said i think we have gotwell everything we wanted from you you promised to marry him if all went ill that is a delicate feminine way of putting it women like these equivocations they relieve one from the onus of speaking frankly  i stood down from the box feeling for the first time in my life conscious of having scored an ignominious failure  our counsel did not care to reexamine me i recognised that it would be useless the hateful qc had put all my history in such an odious light that explanation could only make matters worseit must savour of apology the jury could never understand my point of view it could never be made to see that there are adventuresses and adventuresses  then came the final speeches on either side harolds advocate said the best he could in favour of the will our party propounded but his best was bad and what galled me most was this i could see he himself did not believe in its genuineness his speech amounted to little more than a perfunctory attempt to put the most favourable face on a probable forgery  as for the crosseyed qc he rose to reply with humorous confidence swaying his big body to and fro he crumpled our will and our case in his fat fingers like so much flimsy tissuepaper mr ashurst had made a disposition of his property twenty years agothe right disposition the natural disposition he had left the bulk of it as childless english gentlemen have ever been wont to leave their wealthto the eldest son of the eldest son of his family the honourable marmaduke courtney ashurst the testator was the scion of a great house which recent agricultural changes he regretted to say had relatively impoverished he had come to the succour of that great house as such a scion should with his property acquired by honest industry elsewhere it was fitting and reasonable that mr ashurst should wish to see the kynaston peerage regain in the person of the amiable and accomplished young nobleman whom he had the honour to represent some portion of its ancient dignity and splendour  but jealousy and greed intervened here he frowned at harold mr harold tillington the son of one of mr ashursts married sisters cast longing eyes as he had tried to suggest to them on his cousin lord southminsters natural heritage the result he feared was an unnatural intrigue mr harold tillington formed the acquaintance of a young ladyshould we say young ladyhe withered me with his glancewell yes a lady indeed by birth and education but an adventuress by choicea lady who brought up in a respectable though not he must admit a distinguished sphere had lowered herself by accepting the position of a ladys maid and had trafficked in patent american cycles on the public highroads of germany and switzerland this clever and designing woman he would grant her abilityhe would grant her good looks had fascinated mr tillingtonthat was the theory he ventured to lay before the jury today and the jury would see for themselves that whatever else the young lady might be she had distinctly a certain outer gift of fascination it was for them to decide whether miss lois cayley had or had not suggested to mr harold tillington the design of substituting a forged will for mr marmaduke ashursts undeniable testament he would point out to them her singular connection with the missing man higginson whom the young lady herself described as a rogue and from whom she had done her very best to dissociate herself in this courtbut ineffectually wherever miss cayley went the man higginson went independently such frequent recurrences such apt juxtapositions could hardly be set down to mere accidental coincidence  he went on to insinuate that higginson and i had concocted the disputed will between us that we had passed it on to our fellowconspirator harold and that harold had forged his uncles signature to it and had appended those of the two supposed witnesses but who now were these witnesses one franz markheim was dead or missing dead men tell no tales the other was obviously suggested by higginson it was his own sister perhaps he forged her name to the document doubtless he thought that family feeling would induce her when it came to the pinch to accept and endorse her brothers lie nay he might even have been foolish enough to suppose that this cockandbull will would not be disputed if so he and his master had reckoned without lord southminster a gentleman who concealed beneath the careless exterior of a man of fashion the solid intelligence of a man of affairs and the hard head of a man not to be lightly cheated in matters of business  the alleged will had thus not a leg to stand upon it was typewritten save the mark from dictation at florence by whom by the lady who had most to gain from its successthe lady who was to be transformed from a shady adventuress tossed about between irish doctors and hindu maharajahs into the lawful wife of a wealthy diplomatist of noble family on one condition onlyif this pretended will could be satisfactorily established the signatures were forgeries as shown by the expert evidence and also by the oath of the one surviving witness  the will left all the estatepracticallyto mr harold tillington and five hundred pounds to whomwhy to the accomplice higginson the minor bequests the qc regarded as ingenious inventions pure play of fancy intended to give artistic verisimilitude as poohbah says in the opera to an otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative the fads it was true were known fads of mr ashursts but what sort of fads bimetallism angloisrael no braces and shoehornsclearly the kind that would best be known to a courier like higginson the sole begetter he believed of this nefarious conspiracy  the crosseyed qc lifting his fat right hand in solemn adjuration called upon the jury confidently to set aside this ridiculous fabrication and declare for a will of undoubted genuineness a will drawn up in london by a firm of eminent solicitors and preserved ever since by the testators bankers it would then be for his lordship to decide whether in the public interest he should recommend the crown to prosecute on a charge of forgery the clumsy fabricator of this preposterous document  the judge summed upstrongly in favour of lord southminsters will if the jury believed the experts and miss higginson one verdict alone was possible the jury retired for three minutes only it was a foregone conclusion they found for lord southminster the judge looking grave concurred in their finding a most proper verdict and he considered it would be the duty of the public prosecutor to pursue mr harold tillington on the charge of forgery  illustration i reeled where i sat  i reeled where i sat then i looked round for harold  he had slipped from the court unseen during counsels address some minutes earlier  that distressed me more than anything else on that dreadful day i wished he had stood up in his place like a man to face this vile and cruel conspiracy  i walked out slowly supported by lady georgina who was as white as a ghost herself but very straight and scornful i always knew southminster was a fool she said aloud i always knew he was a sneak but i did not know till now he was also a particularly bad type of criminal  on the steps of the court the peagreen young man met us his air was jaunty well i was right yah see he said smiling and withdrawing his cigarette you backed the wrong fellah i told you id win i wont say moah now this is not the time or place to recur to that subject but byandby youll come round youll think bettah of it still youll back the winnah  i wished i were a man that i might have the pleasure of kicking him  we drove back to my hotel and waited for harold to my horror and alarm he never came near us i might almost have doubted himif he had not been harold  i waited and waited he did not come at all he sent no word no message and all that evening we heard the newsboys shouting at the top of their voice in the street extra speshul the ashurst will kise sensational developments mysterious disappearance of mr arold tillington     xi  the adventure of the oriental attendant   i did not sleep that night next morning i rose very early from a restless bed with a dry hot mouth and a general feeling that the solid earth had failed beneath me  still no news from harold it was cruel i thought my faith almost flagged he was a man and should be brave how could he run away and hide himself at such a time even if i set my own anxiety aside just think to what serious misapprehension it laid him open  i sent out for the morning papers they were full of harold rumours rumours rumours mr tillington had deliberately chosen to put himself in the wrong by disappearing mysteriously at the last moment he had only himself to blame if the worst interpretation were put upon his action but the police were on his track scotland yard had a clue it was confidently expected an arrest would be made before evening at latest as to details authorities differed the officials of the great western railway at paddington were convinced that mr tillington had started alone and undisguised by the night express for exeter the southeastern inspectors at charing cross on the other hand were equally certain that he had slipped away with a false beard in company with his accomplice higginson by the 815 pm to paris everybody took it for granted however that he had left london  conjecture played with various ultimate destinationsspain morocco sicily the argentine in italy said the chronicle he might lurk for a whilehe spoke italian fluently and could manage to put up at tiny osterie in outoftheway places seldom visited by englishmen he might try albania said the morning post airing its exclusive society information he had often hunted there and might in turn be hunted he would probably attempt to slink away to some remote spot in the carpathians or the balkans said the daily news quite proud of its geography still wherever he went leadenfooted justice in this age said the times must surely overtake him the day of universal extradition had dawned we had no more alsatias even the argentine itself gives up its roguesat last not an asylum for crime remains in europe not a refuge in asia africa america australia or the pacific islands  i noted with a shudder of horror that all the papers alike took his guilt as certain in spite of a few decent pretences at not prejudging an untried cause they treated him already as the detected criminal the fugitive from justice i sat in my little sittingroom at the hotel in jermyn street a limp rag looking idly out of the window with swimming eyes and waiting for lady georgina it was early too early butoh why didnt she come unless somebody soon sympathised with me my heart would break under this load of loneliness  presently as i looked out on the sloppy morning street i was vaguely aware through the mist that floated before my dry eyes for tears were denied me of a very grand carriage driving up to the doorwaythe porch with the four wooden ionic pillars i took no heed of it i was too heartsick for observation my life was wrecked and harolds with it yet dimly through the mist i became conscious after a while that the carriage was that of an indian prince i could see the black faces the white turbans the gold brocades of the attendants in the dickey then it came home to me with a pang that this was the maharajah  it was kindly meant yet after all that had been insinuated in court the day before i was by no means overpleased that his dusky highness should come to call upon me walls have eyes and ears reporters were hanging about all over london eager to distinguish themselves by successful eavesdropping they would note with brisk innuendoes after their kind how the maharajah of moozuffernuggar called early in the day on miss lois cayley with whom he remained for at least half an hour in close consultation i had half a mind to send down a message that i could not see him my face still burned with the undeserved shame of the crosseyed qcs unspeakable suggestions  before i could make my mind up however i saw to my surprise that the maharajah did not propose to come in himself he leaned back in his place with his lordly eastern air and waited looking down on the gapers in the street while one of the two gorgeous attendants in the dickey descended obsequiously to receive his orders the man was dressed as usual in rich oriental stuffs and wore his full white turban swathed in folds round his head i could not see his features he bent forward respectfully with oriental suppleness to take his highnesss orders then receiving a card and bowing low he entered the porch with the wooden ionic pillars and disappeared within while the maharajah folded his hands and seemed to resign himself to a temporary nirvana  illustration the messenger entered  a minute later a knock sounded on my door come in i said faintly and the messenger entered  i turned and faced him the blood rushed to my cheek harold i cried darting forward my joy overcame me he folded me in his arms i allowed him unreproved for the first time he kissed me i did not shrink from it  then i stood away a little and gazed at him even at that crucial moment of doubt and fear i could not help noticing how admirably he made up as a handsome young rajput three years earlier at schlangenbad i remembered he had struck me as strangely orientallooking he had the features of a highborn indian gentleman without the complexion his large poetical eyes his regular oval face his even teeth his mouth and moustache all vaguely recalled the highest type of the eastern temperament now he had blackened his face and hands with some permanent stainindian ink i learned laterand the resemblance to a rajput chief was positively startling in his gold brocade and ample white turban no passerby i felt sure would ever have dreamt of doubting him  then you knew me at once he said holding my face between his hands thats bad darling i flattered myself i had transformed my face into the complete indian  love has sharp eyes i answered it can see through brick walls but the disguise is perfect no one else would detect you  love is blind i thought  not where it ought to see there it pierces everything i knew you instantly harold but all london i am sure would pass you by unknown you are absolute orient  thats well for all london is looking for me he answered bitterly the streets bristle with detectives southminsters knaveries have won the day so i have tried this disguise otherwise i should have been arrested the moment the jury brought in their verdict  and why were you not i asked drawing back oh harold i trust you but why did you disappear and make all the world believe you admitted yourself guilty  he opened his arms cant you guess he cried holding them out to me  i nestled in them once more but i answered through my tearsi had found tears nowno harold it baffles me  you remember what you promised me he murmured leaning over me and clasping me if ever i were poor friendless huntedyou would marry me now the opportunity has come when we can both prove ourselves today except you and dear georgey i havent a friend in the world everyone else has turned against me southminster holds the field i am a suspected forger in a very few days i shall doubtless be a convicted felon unjustly as you know yet stillwe must face ita convicted felon so i have come to claim you i have come to ask you now in this moment of despair will you keep your promise  i lifted my face to his he bent over it trembling i whispered the words in his ear yes harold i will keep it i have always loved you and now i will marry you  i knew you would he cried and pressed me to his bosom  we sat for some minutes holding each others hands and saying nothing we were too full of thought for words then suddenly harold roused himself we must make haste darling he cried we are keeping partab outside and every minute is precious every minutes delay dangerous we ought to go down at once partabs carriage is waiting at the door for us  go down i exclaimed clinging to him how why i dont understand what is your programme  ah i forgot i hadnt explained to you listen here dearestquick i can waste no words over it i said just now i had no friends in the world but you and georgey thats not true for dear old partab has stuck to me nobly when all my english friends fell away the rajput was true to me he arranged all this it was his own idea he foresaw what was coming he urged me yesterday just before the verdict when he saw my acquaintances beginning to look askance to slip quietly out of court and make my way by unobtrusive roads to his house in curzon street there he darkened my face like his and converted me to hinduism i dont suppose the disguise will serve me for more than a day or two but it will last long enough for us to get safely away to scotland  scotland i murmured then you mean to try a scotch marriage  it is the only thing possible we must be married today and in england of course we cannot do it we would have to be called in church or else to procure a license either of which would involve disclosure of my identity besides even the license would keep us waiting about for a day or two in scotland on the other hand we can be married at once partabs carriage is below to take you to kings cross he is staunch as steel dear fellow do you consent to go with me  my faculty for promptly making up such mind as i possess stood me once more in good stead implicitly i answered dear harold this calamity has its happy sidefor without it much as i love you i could never have brought myself to marry you  one moment he cried before you go recollect this step is irrevocable you will marry a man who may be torn from you this evening and from whom fourteen years of prison may separate you  i know it i cried through my tears but i shall be showing my confidence in you my love for you  he kissed me once more fervently this makes amends for all he cried lois to have won such a woman as you i would go through it all a thousand times over it was for this and for this alone that i hid myself last night i wanted to give you the chance of showing me how much how truly you loved me  and after we are married i asked trembling  i shall give myself up at once to the police in edinburgh  i clung to him wistfully my heart half urged me to urge him to escape but i knew that was wrong give yourself up then i said sobbing it is a brave mans place you must stand your trial and come what will i will strive to bear it with you  i knew you would he cried i was not mistaken in you  we embraced again just once it was little enough after those years of waiting  now come he cried let us go  i drew back not with you dearest i whispered not in the maharajahs carriage you must start by yourself i will follow you at once to kings cross in a hansom  he saw i was right it would avoid suspicion and it would prevent more scandal he withdrew without a word we meet i said at ten at kings cross station  i did not even wait to wash the tears from my eyes all red as they were i put on my hat and my little brown travelling jacket i dont think i so much as glanced once at the glass the seconds were precious i saw the maharajah drive away with harold in the dickey arms crossed imperturbable orientally silent he looked the very counterpart of the rajput by his side then i descended the stairs and walked out boldly as i passed through the hall the servants and the visitors stared at me and whispered they spoke with nods and liftings of the eyebrows i was aware that that morning i had achieved notoriety  at piccadilly circus i jumped of a sudden into a passing hansom kings cross i cried as i mounted the step drive quick i have no time to spare and as the man drove off i saw by a convulsive dart of someone across the road that i had given the slip to a disappointed reporter  at the station i took a firstclass ticket for edinburgh on the platform the maharajah and his attendants were waiting he lifted his hat to me though otherwise he took no overt notice but i saw his keen eyes follow me down the train harold in his oriental dress pretended not to observe me one or two porters and a few curious travellers cast inquiring eyes on the eastern prince and made remarks about him to one another thats the chap as was up yesterday in the ashurst will kise said one lounger to his neighbour but nobody seemed to look at harold his subordinate position secured him from curiosity the maharajah had always two eastern servants gorgeously dressed in attendance he had been a wellknown figure in london society and at lords and the oval for two or three seasons  bloomin fine cricketer one porter observed to his mate as he passed  yuss not so dusty for a nigger the other man replied fustrite bowler but lord he cant old a candle to good old ranji  as for myself nobody seemed to recognise me i set this fact down to the fortunate circumstance that the evening papers had published rough woodcuts which professed to be my portrait and which naturally led the public to look out for a brazenfaced rawboned hardfeatured termagant  i took my seat in a ladies compartment by myself as the train was about to start harold strolled up as if casually for a moment you think it better so he queried without moving his lips or seeming to look at me  decidedly i answered go back to partab dont come near me again till we get to edinburgh it is dangerous still the police may at any moment hear we have started and stop us halfway and now that we have once committed ourselves to this plan it would be fatal to be interrupted before we have got married  you are right he cried lois you are always right somehow  i wished i could think so myself but twas with serious misgivings that i felt the train roll out of the station  oh that long journey north alone in a ladies compartmentwith the feeling that harold was so near yet so unapproachable it was an endless agony he had the maharajah who loved and admired him to keep him from brooding but i left alone and confined with my own fears conjured up before my eyes every possible misfortune that heaven could send us i saw clearly now that if we failed in our purpose this journey would be taken by everyone for a flight and would deepen the suspicion under which we both laboured it would make me still more obviously a conspirator with harold  whatever happened we must strain every nerve to reach scotland in safety and then to get married in order that harold might immediately surrender himself  illustration he took a long careless stare at me  at york i noticed with a thrill of terror that a man in plain clothes with the obtrusively unobtrusive air of a detective looked carefully though casually into every carriage i felt sure he was a spy because of his marked outer jauntiness of demeanour which hardly masked an underlying hangdog expression of scrutiny when he reached my place he took a long careless stare at mea seemingly careless stare which was yet brimfull of the keenest observation then he paced slowly along the line of carriages with a glance at each till he arrived just opposite the maharajahs compartment there he stared hard once more the maharajah descended so did harold and the hindu attendant who was dressed just like him the man i took for a detective indulged in a frank long gaze at the unconscious indian prince but cast only a hasty eye on the two apparent followers that touch of revelation relieved my mind a little i felt convinced the police were watching the maharajah and myself as suspicious persons connected with the case but they had not yet guessed that harold had disguised himself as one of the two invariable rajput servants  we steamed on northward at newcastle the same detective strolled with his hands in his pockets along the train once more and puffed a cigar with the nonchalant air of a sporting gentleman but i was certain now from the studious unconcern he was anxious to exhibit that he must be a spy upon us he overdid his mood of careless observation it was too obvious an assumption precisely the same thing happened again when we pulled up at berwick i knew now that we were watched it would be impossible for us to get married at edinburgh if we were thus closely pursued there was but one chance open we must leave the train abruptly at the first scotch stopping station  the detective knew we were booked through for edinburgh so much i could tell because i saw him make inquiries of the ticket examiner at york and again at berwick and because the ticketexaminer thereupon entered a mental note of the fact as he punched my ticket each time oh edinburgh miss all right and then stared at me suspiciously i could tell he had heard of the ashurst will case he also lingered long about the maharajahs compartment and then went back to confer with the detective thus putting two and two together as a woman will i came to the conclusion that the spy did not expect us to leave the train before we reached edinburgh that told in our favour most men trust much to just such vague expectations they form a theory and then neglect the adverse chances you can only get the better of a skilled detective by taking him thus psychologically and humanly  by this time i confess i felt almost like a criminal never in my life had danger loomed so nearnot even when we returned with the arabs from the oasis for then we feared for our lives alone now we feared for our honour  i drew a card from my case before we left berwick station and scribbled a few hasty words on it in german we are watched a detective if we run through to edinburgh we shall doubtless be arrested or at least impeded this train will stop at dunbar for one minute just before it leaves again get out as quietly as you canat the last moment i will also get out and join you let partab go on it will excite less attention the scheme i suggest is the only safe plan if you agree as soon as we have well started from berwick shake your handkerchief unobtrusively out of your carriage window  illustration i beckoned a porter  i beckoned a porter noiselessly without one word the detective was now strolling along the forepart of the train with his back turned towards me peering as he went into all the windows i gave the porter a shilling take this to a black gentleman in the next carriage but one i said in a confidential whisper the porter touched his hat nodded smiled and took it  would harold see the necessity for acting on my advice i wondered i gazed out along the train as soon as we had got well clear of berwick a minutetwo minutesthree minutes passed and still no handkerchief i began to despair he was debating no doubt if he refused all was lost and we were disgraced for ever  at last after long waiting as i stared still along the whizzing line with the smoke in my eyes and the dust half blinding me i saw to my intense relief a handkerchief flutter it fluttered once not markedly then a black hand withdrew it only just in time for even as it disappeared the detectives head thrust itself out of a farther window he was not looking for anything in particular as far as i could telljust observing the signals but it gave me a strange thrill to think even now we were so nearly defeated  my next trouble waswould the train draw up at dunbar the 10 am from kings cross is not set down to stop there in bradshaw for no passengers are booked to or from the station by the day express but i remembered from of old when i lived at edinburgh that it used always to wait about a minute for some enginedrivers purpose this doubt filled me with fresh fear did it draw up there stillthey have accelerated the service so much of late years and abolished so many old accustomed stoppages i counted the familiar stations with my breath held back they seemed so much farther apart than usual restongrants housecockburnspathinnerwick  the next was dunbar if we rolled past that then all was lost we could never get married i trembled and hugged myself  the engine screamed did that mean she was running through oh how i wished i had learned the interpretation of the signals  then gradually gently we began to slow were we slowing to pass the station only no with a jolt she drew up my heart gave a bound as i read the word dunbar on the station noticeboard  i rose and waited with my fingers on the door happily it had one of those newfashioned sliplatches which open from inside no need to betray myself prematurely to the detective by a hand displayed on the outer handle i glanced out at him cautiously his head was thrust through his window and his sloping shoulders revealed the spy but he was looking the other wayobserving the signals doubtless to discover why we stopped at a place not mentioned in bradshaw  harolds face just showed from another window close by too soon or too late might either of them be fatal he glanced inquiry at me i nodded back now the train gave its first jerk a faint backward jerk indicative of the nascent intention of starting as it braced itself to go on i jumped out so did harold we faced one another on the platform without a word stand away there the stationmaster cried in an angry voice the guard waved his green flag the detective still absorbed on the signals never once looked back one second later we were safe at dunbar and he was speeding away by the express for edinburgh  it gave us a breathing space of about an hour  illustration you cant get out here he said crustily  for half a minute i could not speak my heart was in my mouth i hardly even dared to look at harold then the stationmaster stalked up to us with a threatening manner you cant get out here he said crustily in a gruff scotch voice this train is not timed to set down before edinburgh  we have got out i answered taking it upon me to speak for my fellowculprit the hinduas he was to all seeming the logic of facts is with us we were booked through to edinburgh but we wanted to stop at dunbar and as the train happened to pull up we thought we neednt waste time by going on all that way and then coming back again  ye should have changed at berwick the stationmaster said still gruffly and come on by the slow train i could see his careful scotch soul was vexed incidentally at our extravagance in paying the extra fare to edinburgh and back again  in spite of agitation i managed to summon up one of my sweetest smilesa smile that ere now had melted the hearts of rickshaw coolies and of french douaniers he thawed before it visibly time was important to us i saidoh he guessed not how important and besides you know it is so good for the company  thats true he answered mollified he could not tilt against the interests of the north british shareholders but how about yer luggage itll have gone on to edinburgh im thinking  we have no luggage i answered boldly  he stared at us both puckered his brow a moment and then burst out laughing oh ay i see he answered with a comic air of amusement well well its none of my business no doubt and i will not interfere with ye though why a lady like you he glanced curiously at harold  i saw he had guessed right and thought it best to throw myself unreservedly on his mercy time was indeed important i glanced at the station clock it was not very far from the stroke of six and we must manage to get married before the detective could miss us at edinburgh where he was due at 630  so i smiled once more that heartsoftening smile we have each our own fancies i said blushingand indeed such is the pride of race among women i felt myself blush in earnest at the bare idea that i was marrying a black man in spite of our good maharajahs kindness he is a gentleman and a man of education and culture i thought that recommendation ought to tell with a scotchman we are in sore straits now but our case is a just one can you tell me who in this place is most likely to sympathisemost likely to marry us  he looked at meand surrendered at discretion i should think anybody would marry ye who saw yer pretty face and heard yer sweet voice he answered but perhaps yed better present yerself to mr schoolcraft the up minister at little kirkton he was aye softhearted  how far from here i asked  about two miles he answered  can we get a trap  oh ay theres machines always waiting at the station  illustration we told our tale  we interviewed a machine and drove out to little kirkton there we told our tale in the fewest words possible to the obliging and goodnatured up minister he looked as the stationmaster had said softhearted but he dashed our hopes to the ground at once by telling us candidly that unless we had had our residence in scotland for twentyone days immediately preceding the marriage it would not be legal if you were scotch he added i could go through the ceremony at once of course and then you could apply to the sheriff tonight for leave to register the marriage in proper form afterward but as one of you is english and the other i judgehe smiled and glanced towards haroldan indianborn subject of her majesty it would be impossible for me to do it the ceremony would be invalid under lord broughams act without previous residence  this was a terrible blow i looked away appealingly harold i cried in despair do you think we could manage to hide ourselves safely anywhere in scotland for twentyone days  his face fell how could i escape notice all the world is hunting for me and then the scandal no matter where you stoppedhowever far from meno lois darling i could never expose you to it  the minister glanced from one to the other of us puzzled harold he said turning over the word on his tongue harold that doesnt sound like an indian name does it and he hesitated you speak wonderful english  i saw the safest plan was to make a clean breast of it he looked the sort of man one could trust on an emergency you have heard of the ashurst will case i said blurting it out suddenly  i have seen something about it in the newspapers yes but it did not interest me i have not followed it  i told him the whole truth the case against usthe facts as we knew them then i added slowly this is mr harold tillington whom they accuse of forgery does he look like a forger i want to marry him before he is tried it is the only way by which i can prove my implicit trust in him as soon as we are married he will give himself up at once to the policeif you wish it before your eyes but married we must be cant you manage it somehow  my pleading voice touched him harold tillington he murmured i know of his forebears lady guinevere tillingtons son is it not then you must be younger of gledcliffe for scotland is a village everyone in it seems to have heard of every other  what does he mean i asked younger of gledcliffe i remembered now that the phrase had occurred in mr ashursts will though i never understood it  a scotch fashion harold answered the heir to a laird is called younger of soandso my father has a small estate of that name in dumfriesshire a very small estate i was born and brought up there  then you are a scotchman the minister asked  yes harold answered frankly by remote descent we are trebly of the female line at gledcliffe still i am no doubt more or less scotch by domicile  younger of gledcliffe oh yes that ought certainly to be quite sufficient for our purpose do you live there  i have been living there lately i always live there when im in britain it is my only home i belong to the diplomatic service  but thenthe lady  she is unmitigatedly english harold admitted in a gloomy voice  not quite i answered i lived four years in edinburgh and i spent my holidays there while i was at girton i keep my boxes still at my old rooms in maitland street  oh that will do the minister answered quite relieved for it was clear that our anxiety and the touch of romance in our tale had enlisted him in our favour indeed now i come to think of it it suffices for the act if one only of the parties is domiciled in scotland and as mr tillington lives habitually at gledcliffe that settles the question still i can do nothing save marry you now by religious service in the presence of my servantswhich constitutes what we call an ecclesiastical marriageit becomes legal if afterwards registered and then you must apply to the sheriff for a warrant to register it but i will do what i can later on if you like you can be remarried by the rites of your own church in england  are you quite sure our scotch domicile is good enough in law harold asked still doubtful  i can turn it up if you wish i have a legal handbook before lord broughams act no formalities were necessary but the act was passed to prevent gretna green marriages the usual phrase is that such a marriage does not hold good unless one or other of the parties either has had his or her usual residence in scotland or else has lived there for twentyone days immediately preceding the date of the marriage if you like i will wait to consult the authorities  no thank you i cried there is no time to lose marry us first and look it up afterwards one or other will do it seems mr tillington is scotch enough i am sure he has no address in britain but gledcliffe we will rest our claim upon that even if the marriage turns out invalid we only remain where we were this is a preliminary ceremony to prove good faith and to bind us to one another we can satisfy the law if need be when we return to england  the minister called in his wife and servants and explained to them briefly he exhorted us and prayed we gave our solemn consent in legal form before two witnesses then he pronounced us duly married in a quarter of an hour more we had made declaration to that effect before the sheriff the witnesses accompanying us and were formally affirmed to be man and wife before the law of great britain i asked if it would hold in england as well  you couldnt be firmer married the sheriff said with decision by the archbishop of canterbury in westminster abbey  harold turned to the minister will you send for the police he said calmly i wish to inform them that i am the man for whom they are looking in the ashurst will case  our own cabman went to fetch them it was a terrible moment but harold sat in the sheriffs study and waited as if nothing unusual were happening he talked freely but quietly never in my life had i felt so proud of him  at last the police came much inflated with the dignity of so great a capture and took down our statement do you give yourself in charge on a confession of forgery the superintendent asked as harold ended  certainly not harold answered i have not committed forgery but i do not wish to skulk or hide myself i understand a warrant is out against me in london i have come to scotland hurriedly for the sake of getting married not to escape apprehension i am here openly under my own name i tell you the facts tis for you to decide if you choose you can arrest me  the superintendent conferred for some time in another room with the sheriff then he returned to the study very well sir he said in a respectful tone i arrest you  so that was the beginning of our married life more than ever i felt sure i could trust in harold  the police decided after hearing by telegram from london that we must go up at once by the night express which they stopped for the purpose they were forced to divide us i took the sleepingcar harold travelled with two constables in a ordinary carriage strange to say notwithstanding all this so great was our relief from the tension of our flight that we both slept soundly  next morning we arrived in london harold guarded the police had arranged that the case should come up at bow street that afternoon it was not an ideal honeymoon and yet i was somehow happy  at kings cross they took him away from me still i hardly cried all the way up in the train whenever i was awake an idea had been haunting mea possible clue to this trickery of lord southminsters petty details cropped up and fell into their places i began to unravel it all now i had an inkling of a plan to set harold right again  the will we had provedbut i must not anticipate  when we parted harold kissed me on the forehead and murmured rather sadly now i suppose its all up lois i must go these rogues have been too much for us  illustration i have found a clue  not a bit of it i answered new hope growing stronger and stronger within me i see a way out i have found a clue i believe dear harold the right will still be vindicated  and redeyed as i was i jumped into a hansom and called to the cabman to drive at once to lady georginas     xii  the adventure of the unprofessional detective   is lady georgina at home the discreet manservant in sober black clothes eyed me suspiciously no miss he answered that is to sayno maam her ladyship is still at mr marmaduke ashurststhe late mr marmaduke ashurst i meanin park lane north you know the number maam  yes i know it i replied with a gasp for this was indeed a triumph my one fear had been lest lord southminster should already have taken possessionwhy you will see hereafter and it relieved me to learn that lady georgina was still at hand to guard my husbands interests she had been living at the house practically since her brothers death i drove round with all speed and flung myself into my dear old ladys arms  kiss me i cried flushed i am your niece but she knew it already for our movements had been fully reported by this time with picturesque additions in the morning papers imagination illdeveloped in the english race seems to concentrate itself in the lower order of journalists  she kissed me on both cheeks with unwonted tenderness lois she cried with tears in her eyes youre a brick it was not exactly poetical at such a moment but from her it meant more than much gushing phraseology  and youre here in possession i murmured  illustration ive held the fort by main force  the cantankerous old lady nodded she was in her element i must admit she dearly loved a rowabove all a family row but to be in the thick of a family row and to feel herself in the right with the law against herthat was joy such as lady georgina had seldom before experienced yes dear she burst out volubly im in possession thank heaven and whats more they wont oust me without a legal process ive been here off and on you know ever since poor dear marmy died looking after things for harold and i shall look after them still till bertie southminster succeeds in ejecting me which wont be easy oh ive held the fort by main force i can tell you held it like a trojan berties in a precious great hurry to move in i can see but i wont allow him hes been down here this morning fatuously blustering and trying to carry the post by storm with a couple of policemen  policemen i cried to turn you out  yes my dear policemen but the lord be praised i was too much for him there are legal formalities to fulfil yet and i wont budge an inch lois not one inch my dear till hes fulfilled every one of them mark my words child that boys up to some devilry  he is i answered  yes he wouldnt be in such a rampaging hurry to get inbeing as lazy as hes emptyheadedtakes after gwendoline in thatif he hadnt some excellent reason for wishing to take possession and depend upon it the reason is that he wants to get hold of something or other thats harolds but he shant if i can help it and thank my stars im a dour woman to reckon with if he comes he comes over my old bones child ive been overhauling everything of marmys i can tell you to checkmate the boy if i can but ive found nothing yet and till ive satisfied myself on that point ill hold the fort still if i have to barricade that pastyfaced scoundrel of a nephew of mine out by piling the furniture against the front door i will as sure as my names georgina fawley  i know you will dear i assented kissing her and so i shall venture to leave you while i go out to institute another little enquiry  what enquiry  i shook my head its only a surmise i said hesitating ill tell you about it later ive had time to think while ive been coming back in the train and ive thought of many things mount guard till i return and mind you dont let lord southminster have access to anything  ill shoot him first dear and i believe she meant it  i drove on in the same cab to harolds solicitor there i laid my fresh doubts at once before him he rubbed his bony hands youve hit it he cried charmed my dear madam youve hit it i never did like that will i never did like the signatures the witnesses the look of it but what could i do mr tillington propounded it of course it wasnt my business to go dead against my own client  then you doubted harolds honour mr hayes i cried flushing  illustration never he answered never  never he answered never i felt sure there must be some mistake somewhere but not any trickery onyour husbands part now you supply the right clue we must look into this immediately  he hurried round with me at once in the same cab to the court the incriminated will had been impounded as they call it but under certain restrictions and subject to the closest surveillance i was allowed to examine it with my husbands solicitor before the eyes of the authorities i looked at it long with the naked eye and also with a small pocket lens the paper as i had noted before was the same kind of foolscap as that which i had been in the habit of using at my office in florence and the typewritingwas it mine the longer i looked at it the more i doubted it  after a careful examination i turned round to our solicitor mr hayes i said firmly having arrived at my conclusion this is not the document i typewrote at florence  how do you know he asked a different machine some small peculiarity in the shape of the letters  no the rogue who typed this will was too cunning for that he didnt allow himself to be foiled by such a scholars mate it is written with a spread eagle the same sort of machine precisely as my own i know the type perfectly but i hesitated  but what  well it is difficult to explain there is character in typewriting just as there is in handwriting only of course not quite so much of it every operator is liable to his own peculiar tricks and blunders if i had some of my own typewritten manuscript here to show you i could soon make that evident  i can easily believe it individuality runs through all we do however seemingly mechanical but are the points of a sort that you could make clear in court to the satisfaction of a jury  i think so look here for example certain letters get habitually mixed up in typewriting c and v stand next one another on the keyboard of the machine and the person who typed this draft sometimes strikes a c instead of a v or vice versâ i never do that the letters i tend to confuse are s and w or else e and r which also come very near one another in the arbitrary arrangement besides when i typewrote the original of this will i made no errors at all i took such very great pains about it  and this person did make errors  yes struck the wrong letter first and then corrected it often by striking another rather hard on top of it see this was a v to begin with and he turned it into a c besides the hand that wrote this will is heavier than mine it comes down thump thump thump while mine glides lightly and the hyphens are used with a space between them and the character of the punctuation is not exactly as i make it  still mr hayes objected we have nothing but your word im afraid in such a case we could never induce a jury to accept your unsupported evidence  i dont want them to accept it i answered i am looking this up for my own satisfaction i want to know first who wrote this will and of one thing i am quite clear it is not the document i drew up for mr ashurst just look at that x the x alone is conclusive my typewriter had the upper righthand stroke of the small x badly formed or broken while this one is perfect i remember it well because i used always to improve all my lowercase xs with a pen when i reread and corrected i see their dodge clearly now it is a most diabolical conspiracy instead of forging a will in lord southminsters favour they have substituted a forgery for the real will and then managed to make my poor harold prove it  in that case no doubt they have destroyed the real one the original mr hayes put in  i dont think so i answered after a moments deliberation from what i know of mr ashurst i dont believe it is likely he would have left his will about carelessly anywhere he was a secretive man fond of mysteries and mystifications he would be sure to conceal it besides lady georgina and harold have been taking care of everything in the house ever since he died  but mr hayes objected the forger of this document supposing it to be forged must have had access to the original since you say the terms of the two are identical only the signatures are forgeries and if he saw and copied it why might he not also have destroyed it  a light flashed across me all at once the forger did see the original i cried but not the fair copy i have it all now i detect their trick it comes back to me vividly when i had finished typing the copy at florence from my first rough draft which i had taken down on the machine before mr ashursts eyes i remember now that i threw the original into the wastepaper basket it must have been there that evening when higginson called and asked for the will to take it back to mr ashurst he called for it no doubt hoping to open the packet before he delivered it and make a copy of the document for this very purpose but i refused to let him have it before he saw me however he had been left by himself for ten minutes in the office for i remember coming out to him and finding him there alone and during that ten minutes being what he is you may be sure he fished out the rough draft and appropriated it  illustration we shall have him in our power  that is more than likely my solicitor nodded you are tracking him to his lair we shall have him in our power  i grew more and more excited as the whole cunning plot unravelled itself mentally step by step before me he must then have gone to lord southminster i went on and told him of the legacy he expected from mr ashurst it was five hundred poundsa mere trifle to higginson who plays for thousands so he must have offered to arrange matters for lord southminster if southminster would consent to make good that sum and a great deal more to him that odious little cad told me himself on the jumna they were engaged in pulling off a big coup between them he thought then i would marry him and that he would so secure my connivance in his plans but who would marry such a piece of moist clay besides i could never have taken anyone but harold then another clue came home to me mr hayes i cried jumping at it higginson who forged this will never saw the real document itself at all he saw only the draft for mr ashurst altered one word viva voce in the original at the last moment and i made a pencil note of it on my cuff at the time and see it isnt here though i inserted it in the final clean copy of the willthe word especially it grows upon me more and more each minute that the real instrument is hidden somewhere in mr ashursts househarolds houseour house and that because it is there lord southminster is so indecently anxious to oust his aunt and take instant possession  in that case mr hayes remarked we had better go back to lady georgina without one minutes delay and while she still holds the house institute a thorough search for it  no sooner said than done we jumped again into our cab and started as we drove back mr hayes asked me where i thought we were most likely to find it  in a secret drawer in mr ashursts desk i answered by a flash of instinct without a seconds hesitation  how do you know theres a secret drawer  i dont know it i infer it from my general knowledge of mr ashursts character he loved secret drawers ciphers cryptograms mysterymongering  but it was in that desk that your husband found the forged document the lawyer objected  once more i had a flash of inspiration or intuition because white mr ashursts valet had it in readiness in his possession i answered and hid it there in the most obvious and unconcealed place he could find as soon as the breath was out of his masters body i remember now lord southminster gave himself away to some extent in that matter the hateful little creature isnt really clever enough for all his cunningand with higginson to back himto mix himself up in such tricks as forgery he told me at aden he had had a telegram from marmys valet to report progress and he received another the night mr ashurst died at moozuffernuggar depend upon it white was more or less in this plot higginson left him the forged will when they started for india and as soon as mr ashurst died white hid it where harold was bound to find it  if so mr hayes answered thats well we have something to go upon the more of them the better there is safety in numbersfor the honest folk i never knew three rogues hold long together especially when threatened with a criminal prosecution their confederacy breaks down before the chance of punishment each tries to screen himself by betraying the others  higginson was the soul of this plot i went on of that you may be sure hes a wily old fox but well run him to earth yet the more i think of it the more i feel sure from what i know of mr ashursts character he would never have put that will in so exposed a place as the one where harold says he found it  we drew up at the door of the disputed house just in time for the siege mr hayes and i walked in we found lady georgina face to face with lord southminster the opposing forces were still at the stage of preliminaries of warfare  look heah the peagreen young man was observing in his drawling voice as we entered its no use your talking deah georgey this house is mine and i wont have you meddling with it  this house is not yours you odious little scamp his aunt retorted raising her shrill voice some notes higher than usual and while i can hold a stick you shall not come inside it  very well then you drive me to hostilities dont yah know im sorry to show disrespect to your gray hairsif anybut i shall be obliged to call in the police to eject yah  call them in if you like i answered interposing between them go out and get them mr hayes while hes gone send for a carpenter to break open the back of mr ashursts escritoire  a carpentah he cried turning several degrees whiter than his pasty wont what for a carpentah  i spoke distinctly because we have reason to believe mr ashursts real will is concealed in this house in a secret drawer and because the keys were in the possession of white whom we believe to be your accomplice in this shallow conspiracy  he gasped and looked alarmed no you dont he cried stepping briskly forward you dont i tell yah break open marmys desk why hang it all its my property  we shall see about that after weve broken it open i answered grimly here this screwdriver will do the backs not strong now your help mr hayesone two three we can prise it apart between us  lord southminster rushed up and tried to prevent us but lady georgina seizing both wrists held him tight as in a vice with her dear skinny old hands he writhed and struggled all in vain he could not escape her ive often spanked you bertie she cried and if you attempt to interfere ill spank you again thats the long and the short of it  he broke from her and rushed out to call the police i believe and prevent our desecration of pooah marmys property  illustration victory  inside the first shell were several locked drawers and two or three open ones out of one of which harold had fished the false will instinct taught me somehow that the central drawer on the lefthand side was the compartment behind which lay the secret receptacle i prised it apart and peered about inside it presently i saw a slippanel which i touched with one finger the pigeonhole flew open and disclosed a narrow slit i clutched at somethingthe will ho victory the will i raised it aloft with a wild shout not a doubt of it the real the genuine document  we turned it over and read it it was my own fair copy written at florence and bearing all the small marks of authenticity about it which i had pointed out to mr hayes as wanting to the forged and impounded document fortunately lady georgina and four of the servants had stood by throughout this scene and had watched our demeanour as well as lord southminsters  we turned next to the signatures the principal one was clearly mr ashursts i knew it at oncehis legible fat hand marmaduke courtney ashurst and then the witnesses they fairly took our breath away  why higginsons sister isnt one of them at all mr hayes cried astonished  a flush of remorse came over me i saw it all now i had misjudged that poor woman she had the misfortune to be a rogues sister but as harold had said was herself a most respectable and blameless person higginson must have forged her name to the document that was all and she had naturally sworn that she never signed it he knew her honesty it was a masterstroke of rascality  the other one isnt here either i exclaimed growing more puzzled the waiter at the hotel why thats another forgery higginson must have waited till the man was safely dead and then used him similarly it was all very clever now who are these people who really witnessed it  the first one mr hayes said examining the handwriting is sir roger bland the dorsetshire baronet hes dead poor fellow but he was at florence at the time and i can answer for his signature he was a client of mine and died at mentone the second is captain richards of the mounted police hes living still but hes away in south africa  then they risked his turning up  if they knew who the real witnesses were at allwhich is doubtful you see as you say they may have seen the rough draft only  higginson would know i answered he was with mr ashurst at florence at the time and he would take good care to keep a watch upon his movements in my belief it was he who suggested this whole plot to lord southminster  of course it was lady georgina put in thats absolutely certain berties a rogue as well as a fool but hes too great a fool to invent a clever roguery and too great a knave not to join in it foolishly when anybody else takes the pains to invent it  and it was a clever roguery mr hayes interposed an ordinary rascal would have forged a later will in lord southminsters favour and run the risk of detection higginson had the acuteness to forge a will exactly like the real one and to let your husband bear the burden of the forgery it was as sagacious as it was ruthless  the next point i said will be for us to prove it  at that moment the bell rang and one of the houseservantsall puzzled by this conflict of interestscame in with a telegram which he handed me on a salver i broke it open without glancing at the envelope its contents baffled me my address is hotel bristol paris name as usual send me a thousand pounds on account at once i cant afford to wait no shillyshallying  the message was unsigned for a moment i couldnt imagine who sent it or what it was driving at  then i took up the envelope viscount southminster 24 park lane north london  my heart gave a jump i saw in a second that chance or providence had delivered the conspirators into my hands that day the telegram was from higginson i had opened it by accident  it was obvious what had happened lord southminster must have written to him on the result of the trial and told him he meant to take possession of his uncles house immediately higginson had acted on that hint and addressed his telegram where he thought it likely lord southminster would receive it earliest i had opened it in error and that too was fortunate for even in dealing with such a pack of scoundrels it would never have occurred to me to violate somebody elses correspondence had i not thought it was addressed to me but having arrived at the truth thus unintentionally i had of course no scruples about making full use of my information  i showed the despatch at once to lady georgina and mr hayes they recognised its importance what next i inquired time presses at halfpast three harold comes up for examination at bow street  mr hayes was ready with an apt expedient ring the bell for mr ashursts valet he said quietly the moment has now arrived when we can begin to set these conspirators by the ears as soon as they learn that we know all they will be eager to inform upon one another  i rang the bell send up white i said we wish to speak to him  the valet stole up selfaccused a timid servile creature rubbing his hands nervously and suspecting mischief he was a rat in trouble he had thin brown hair neatly brushed and plastered down so as to make it look still thinner and his face was the average narrow cunning face of the dishonest manservant it had an ounce of wile in it to a pound or two of servility he seemed just the sort of rogue meanly to join in an underhand conspiracy and then meanly to back out of it you could read at a glance that his principle in life was to save his own bacon  illustration you wished to see me sir  he advanced fumbling his hands all the time and smiling and fawning you wished to see me sir he murmured in a deprecatory voice looking sideways at lady georgina and me but addressing the lawyer  yes white i wished to see you i have a question to ask you who put the forged will in mr ashursts desk was it you or some other person  the question terrified him he changed colour and gasped but he rubbed his hands harder than ever and affected a sickly smile oh sir how should i know sir i had nothing to do with it i supposeit was mr tillington  our lawyer pounced upon him like a hawk on a titmouse dont prevaricate with me sir he said sternly if you do it may be worse for you this case has assumed quite another aspect it is you and your associates who will be placed in the dock not mr tillington you had better speak the truth it is your one chance i warn you lie to me and instead of calling you as a witness for our case i shall include you in the indictment  white looked down uneasily at his shoes and cowered oh sir i dont understand you  yes you do you understand me and you know i mean it wriggling is useless we intend to prosecute we have unravelled this vile plot we know the whole truth higginson and lord southminster forged a will between them  oh sir not lord southminster his lordship im sure  mr hayess keen eye had noted the subtle shade of distinction and admission but he said nothing openly well then higginson forged and lord southminster accepted a false will which purported to be mr marmaduke ashursts now follow me clearly that will could not have been put into the escritoire during mr ashursts life for there would have been risk of his discovering it it must therefore have been put there afterward the moment he was dead you or somebody else with your consent and connivance slipped it into the escritoire and you afterwards showed mr tillington the place where you had set it or seen it set leading him to believe it was mr ashursts will and so involved him in all this trouble note that that was a felonious act we accuse you of felony do you mean to confess and give evidence on our behalf or will you force me to send for a policeman to arrest you  the cur hesitated still oh sir drawing back and fumbling his hands on his breast you dont mean it  mr hayes was prompt hesslegrave go for a policeman  that curt sentence brought the rogue on his marrowbones at once he clasped his hands and debated inwardly if i tell you all i know he said at last looking about him with an air of abject terror as if he thought lord southminster or higginson would hear him will you promise not to prosecute me his tone became insinuating for a hundred pounds i could find the real will for you youd better close with me today is the last chance as soon as his lordship comes in hell hunt it up and destroy it  i flourished it before him and pointed with one hand to the broken desk which he had not yet observed in his craven agitation  we do not need your aid i answered we have found the will ourselves thanks to lady georgina it is safe till this minute  and to me he put in cringing and trying after his kind to curry favour with the winners at the last moment its all my doing my lady i wouldnt destroy it his lordship offered me a hundred pounds more to break open the back of the desk at night while your ladyship was asleep and burn the thing quietly but i told him he might do his own dirty work if he wanted it done it wasnt good enough while your ladyship was here in possession besides i wanted the right will preserved for i thought things might turn up so and i wouldnt stand by and see a gentleman like mr tillington as has always behaved well to me deprived of his inheritance  which is why you conspired with lord southminster to rob him of it and to send him to prison for higginsons crime i interposed calmly  then you confess you put the forged will there mr hayes said getting to business  white looked about him helplessly he missed his headpiece the instigator of the plot well it was like this my lady he began turning to lady georgina and wriggling to gain time you see his lordship and mr higginson he twirled his thumbs and tried to invent something plausible  lady georgina swooped no rigmarole she said sharply do you confess you put it there or do you notreptile her vehemence startled him  yes i confess i put it there he said at last blinking as soon as the breath was out of mr ashursts body i put it there he began to whimper im a poor man with a wife and family sir he went on though in mr ashursts time i always kep that quiet and his lordship offered to pay me well for the job and when youre paid well for a job yourself sir  mr hayes waved him off with one imperious hand sit down in the corner there man and dont move or utter another word he said sternly until i order you you will be in time still for me to produce at bow street  just at that moment lord southminster swaggered back accompanied by a couple of unwilling policemen oh i say he cried bursting in and staring around him jubilant look heah georgey are you going quietly or must i ask these coppahs to evict you he was wreathed in smiles now and had evidently been fortifying himself with brandies and soda  lady georgina rose in her wrath yes ill go if you wish it bertie she answered with calm irony ill leave the house as soon as you likefor the presenttill we come back again with harold and his policemen to evict you this house is harolds your game is played boy she spoke slowly we have found the other willwe have discovered higginsons present address in parisand we know from white how he and you arranged this little conspiracy  illustration well this is a fair knockout he ejaculated  she rapped out each clause in this last accusing sentence with deliberate effect like so many pistolshots each bullet hit home the peagreen young man drawing back and staring stroked his shadowy moustache with feeble fingers in undisguised astonishment then he dropped into a chair and fixed his gaze blankly on lady georgina well this is a fair knockout he ejaculated fatuously disconcerted i wish higginson was heah i really dont quite know what to do without him that fellah had squared it all up so neatly dont yah know that i thought there couldnt be any sort of hitch in the proceedings  you reckoned without lois lady georgina said calmly  ah miss cayleythats true i mean mrs tillington yaas yaas i know shes a doosid clevah personfor a womannow isnt she  it was impossible to take this flabby creature seriously even as a criminal lady georginas lips relaxed doosid clever she admitted looking at me almost tenderly  but not quite so clevah dont yah know as higginson  there you make your blooming little erraw mr hayes burst in adopting one of lord southminsters favourite witticismsthe sort of witticism that improves like poetry by frequent repetition policemen you may go into the next room and wait this is a family affair we have no immediate need of you  oh certainly lord southminster echoed much relieved very propah sentiment most undesirable that the constables should mix themselves up in a family mattah like this not the place for inferiahs  then why introduce them lady georgina burst out turning on him  he smiled his fatuous smile thats just what i say he answered why the jooce introduce them but dont snap my head off  the policemen withdrew respectfully glad to be relieved of this unpleasant business where they could gain no credit and might possibly involve themselves in a charge of assault lord southminster rose with a benevolent grin and looked about him pleasantly the brandies and soda had endowed him with irrepressible cheerfulness  well lady georgina murmured  well i think ill leave now georgey youve trumped my ace yah know nasty trick of white to go and round on a fellah i dont like the turn this business is taking seems to me the only way i have left to get out of it isto turn queens evidence  lady georgina planted herself firmly against the door bertie she cried no you dontnot till weve got what we want out of you  he gazed at her blandly his face broke once more into an imbecile smile you were always a rough un georgey your hand did sting well what do you want now weve each played our cards and you neednt cut up rusty over itespecially when youre winning hang it all i wish i had higginson heah to tackle you  if you go to see the treasury people or the solicitorgeneral or the public prosecutor or whoever else it may be lady georgina said stoutly mr hayes must go with you weve trumped your ace as you say and we mean to take advantage of it and then you must trundle yourself down to bow street afterwards confess the whole truth and set harold at liberty  oh i say now georgey the whole truth the whole blooming truth thats really what i call humiliating a fellah  if you dont we arrest you this minutefourteen years imprisonment  fourteen yeahs he wiped his forehead oh i say how doosid uncomfortable i was nevah much good at doing anything by the sweat of my brow i ought to have lived in the garden of eden georgey youre hard on a chap when hes down on his luck it would be confounded cruel to send me to fourteen yeahs at portland  you would have sent my husband to it i broke in angrily confronting him  what you too miss cayley i mean mrs tillington dont look at me like that tigahs arent in it  his jauntiness disarmed us however wicked he might be one felt it would be ridiculous to imprison this schoolboy a sound flogging and a months deprivation of wine and cigarettes was the obvious punishment designed for him by nature  you must go down to the policecourt and confess this whole conspiracy lady georgina went on after a pause as sternly as she was able i prefer if we can to save the familyeven you bertie but i cant any longer save the family honour i can only save harolds you must help me to do that and then you must give me your solemn promisein writingto leave england for ever and go to live in south africa  he stroked the invisible moustache more nervously than before that penalty came home to him what leave england for evah newmarketascotthe clubthe musichalls  or fourteen years imprisonment  georgey you spank as hard as evah  decide at once or we arrest you  he glanced about him feebly i could see he was longing for his lost confederate well ill go he said at last sobering down and your solicitaw can trot round with me ill do all that you wish though i call it most unfriendly hang it all fourteen yeahs would be so beastly unpleasant  we drove forthwith to the proper authorities who on hearing the facts at once arranged to accept lord southminster and white as queens evidence neither being the actual forger we also telegraphed to paris to have higginson arrested lord southminster giving us up his assumed name with the utmost cheerfulness and without one moments compunction mr hayes was quite right each conspirator was only too ready to save himself by betraying his fellows then we drove on to bow street lord southminster consoling himself with a cigarette on the way just in time for harolds case which was to be taken by special arrangement at 330  a very few minutes sufficed to turn the tables completely on the conspirators harold was discharged and a warrant was issued for the arrest of higginson the actual forger he had drawn up the false will and signed it with mr ashursts name after which he had presented it for lord southminsters approval the peagreen young man told his tale with engaging frankness berties a simple simon lady georgina commented to me but hes also a rogue and higginson saw his way to make excellent capital of him in both capacitiesfirst use him as a catspaw and then blackmail him  illustration harold your wife has bested me  on the steps of the policecourt as we emerged triumphant lord southminster met usstill radiant as ever he seemed wholly unaware of the depths of his iniquity a fresh dose of brandy had restored his composure look heah he said harold your wife has bested me jolly good thing for you that you managed to get hold of such a clevah woman if you hadnt deah boy youd have found yourself in queeah street but i say lois i call yah lois because youre my cousin now yah knowyou were backing the wrong man aftah all as i told yah for if youd backed me all this wouldnt have come out youd have got the tin and been a countess as well aftah the governahs dead and gone dont yah see youd have landed the double event so youd have pulled off a bettah thing for yourself in the end as i said if youd laid your bottom dollah on me for winnah  higginson is now doing fourteen years at portland harold and i are happy in the sweetest place in gloucestershire and lord southminster blissfully unaware of the contempt with which the rest of the world regards him is shooting big game among his boys in south africa indeed he bears so little malice that he sent us a present of a trophy of horns for our hall last winter   the end     the winchester edition of the novels of jane austen   10 vols demy 8vo cloth 5s net each vol       the

class of people the tourists have often been taunted with their ignorance and want of culture and the perfunctory manner in which they hurry through and do the art galleries of europe there is a large amount of truth no doubt in the charge but they might very well retort on their critics that no one had come forward to meet their wants or to assist in dispelling their ignorance no doubt there are guidebooks very excellent ones in their way but on all matters of art very little better than mere indices something fuller was required to enable the average man intelligently to appreciate the treasures submitted to his views mr grant allen has undertaken to meet their wants and offers these handbooks to the public at a price which ought to be within the reach of every one who can afford to
