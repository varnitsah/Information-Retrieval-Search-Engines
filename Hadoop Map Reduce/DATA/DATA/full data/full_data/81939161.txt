81939161	the canterville ghost  by  wilde  an amusing chronicle of the tribulations of the ghost of canterville chase when his ancestral halls became the home of the american minister to the court of st james  illustrated by wallace goldsmith  john w luce and company boston and london  1906        list of illustrations   miss virginia e otis  had once raced old lord bilton on her pony  blood has been spilled on that spot  i really must insist on your oiling those chains  the twins  at once discharged two pellets on him  its head was bald and burnished  he met with a severe fall  a heavy jug of water fell right down on him  making satirical remarks on the photographs  suddenly there leaped out two figures  poor poor ghost she murmured have you no place where you can sleep  the ghost glided on more swiftly  he heard somebody galloping after him  out on the landing stepped virginia  chained to it was a gaunt skeleton  by the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the servants with lighted torches  the moon came out from behind a cloud     i   when mr hiram b otis the american minister bought canterville chase every one told him he was doing a very foolish thing as there was no doubt at all that the place was haunted indeed lord canterville himself who was a man of the most punctilious honour had felt it his duty to mention the fact to mr otis when they came to discuss terms  we have not cared to live in the place ourselves said lord canterville since my grandaunt the dowager duchess of bolton was frightened into a fit from which she never really recovered by two skeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for dinner and i feel bound to tell you mr otis that the ghost has been seen by several living members of my family as well as by the rector of the parish the rev augustus dampier who is a fellow of kings college cambridge after the unfortunate accident to the duchess none of our younger servants would stay with us and lady canterville often got very little sleep at night in consequence of the mysterious noises that came from the corridor and the library  my lord answered the minister i will take the furniture and the ghost at a valuation i have come from a modern country where we have everything that money can buy and with all our spry young fellows painting the old world red and carrying off your best actors and primadonnas i reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in europe wed have it at home in a very short time in one of our public museums or on the road as a show  i fear that the ghost exists said lord canterville smiling though it may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios it has been well known for three centuries since 1584 in fact and always makes its appearance before the death of any member of our family  well so does the family doctor for that matter lord canterville but there is no such thing sir as a ghost and i guess the laws of nature are not going to be suspended for the british aristocracy  you are certainly very natural in america answered lord canterville who did not quite understand mr otiss last observation and if you dont mind a ghost in the house it is all right only you must remember i warned you  illustration miss virginia e otis  a few weeks after this the purchase was concluded and at the close of the season the minister and his family went down to canterville chase mrs otis who as miss lucretia r tappan of west 53d street had been a celebrated new york belle was now a very handsome middleaged woman with fine eyes and a superb profile many american ladies on leaving their native land adopt an appearance of chronic illhealth under the impression that it is a form of european refinement but mrs otis had never fallen into this error she had a magnificent constitution and a really wonderful amount of animal spirits indeed in many respects she was quite english and was an excellent example of the fact that we have really everything in common with america nowadays except of course language her eldest son christened washington by his parents in a moment of patriotism which he never ceased to regret was a fairhaired rather goodlooking young man who had qualified himself for american diplomacy by leading the german at the newport casino for three successive seasons and even in london was well known as an excellent dancer gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses otherwise he was extremely sensible miss virginia e otis was a little girl of fifteen lithe and lovely as a fawn and with a fine freedom in her large blue eyes she was a wonderful amazon and had once raced old lord bilton on her pony twice round the park winning by a length and a half just in front of the achilles statue to the huge delight of the young duke of cheshire who proposed for her on the spot and was sent back to eton that very night by his guardians in floods of tears after virginia came the twins who were usually called the star and stripes as they were always getting swished they were delightful boys and with the exception of the worthy minister the only true republicans of the family  illustration had once raced old lord bilton on her pony  as canterville chase is seven miles from ascot the nearest railway station mr otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them and they started on their drive in high spirits it was a lovely july evening and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods now and then they heard a woodpigeon brooding over its own sweet voice or saw deep in the rustling fern the burnished breast of the pheasant little squirrels peered at them from the beechtrees as they went by and the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy knolls with their white tails in the air as they entered the avenue of canterville chase however the sky became suddenly overcast with clouds a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere a great flight of rooks passed silently over their heads and before they reached the house some big drops of rain had fallen  standing on the steps to receive them was an old woman neatly dressed in black silk with a white cap and apron this was mrs umney the housekeeper whom mrs otis at lady cantervilles earnest request had consented to keep in her former position she made them each a low curtsey as they alighted and said in a quaint oldfashioned manner i bid you welcome to canterville chase following her they passed through the fine tudor hall into the library a long low room panelled in black oak at the end of which was a large stained glass window here they found tea laid out for them and after taking off their wraps they sat down and began to look round while mrs umney waited on them  suddenly mrs otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by the fireplace and quite unconscious of what it really signified said to mrs umney i am afraid something has been spilt there  yes madam replied the old housekeeper in a low voice blood has been spilt on that spot  illustration blood has been spilled on that spot  how horrid cried mrs otis i dont at all care for bloodstains in a sittingroom it must be removed at once  the old woman smiled and answered in the same low mysterious voice it is the blood of lady eleanore de canterville who was murdered on that very spot by her own husband sir simon de canterville in 1575 sir simon survived her nine years and disappeared suddenly under very mysterious circumstances his body has never been discovered but his guilty spirit still haunts the chase the bloodstain has been much admired by tourists and others and cannot be removed  that is all nonsense cried washington otis pinkertons champion stain remover and paragon detergent will clean it up in no time and before the terrified housekeeper could interfere he had fallen upon his knees and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what looked like a black cosmetic in a few moments no trace of the bloodstain could be seen  i knew pinkerton would do it he exclaimed triumphantly as he looked round at his admiring family but no sooner had he said these words than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room a fearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet and mrs umney fainted  what a monstrous climate said the american minister calmly as he lit a long cheroot i guess the old country is so overpopulated that they have not enough decent weather for everybody i have always been of opinion that emigration is the only thing for england  my dear hiram cried mrs otis what can we do with a woman who faints  charge it to her like breakages answered the minister she wont faint after that and in a few moments mrs umney certainly came to there was no doubt however that she was extremely upset and she sternly warned mr otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house  i have seen things with my own eyes sir she said that would make any christians hair stand on end and many and many a night i have not closed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here mr otis however and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they were not afraid of ghosts and after invoking the blessings of providence on her new master and mistress and making arrangements for an increase of salary the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room     ii   the storm raged fiercely all that night but nothing of particular note occurred the next morning however when they came down to breakfast they found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor i dont think it can be the fault of the paragon detergent said washington for i have tried it with everything it must be the ghost he accordingly rubbed out the stain a second time but the second morning it appeared again the third morning also it was there though the library had been locked up at night by mr otis himself and the key carried upstairs the whole family were now quite interested mr otis began to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the existence of ghosts mrs otis expressed her intention of joining the psychical society and washington prepared a long letter to messrs myers and podmore on the subject of the permanence of sanguineous stains when connected with crime that night all doubts about the objective existence of phantasmata were removed for ever  the day had been warm and sunny and in the cool of the evening the whole family went out to drive they did not return home till nine oclock when they had a light supper the conversation in no way turned upon ghosts so there were not even those primary conditions of receptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of psychical phenomena the subjects discussed as i have since learned from mr otis were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of cultured americans of the better class such as the immense superiority of miss fanny devonport over sarah bernhardt as an actress the difficulty of obtaining green corn buckwheat cakes and hominy even in the best english houses the importance of boston in the development of the worldsoul the advantages of the baggagecheck system in railway travelling and the sweetness of the new york accent as compared to the london drawl no mention at all was made of the supernatural nor was sir simon de canterville alluded to in any way at eleven oclock the family retired and by halfpast all the lights were out some time after mr otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor outside his room it sounded like the clank of metal and seemed to be coming nearer every moment he got up at once struck a match and looked at the time it was exactly one oclock he was quite calm and felt his pulse which was not at all feverish the strange noise still continued and with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps he put on his slippers took a small oblong phial out of his dressingcase and opened the door right in front of him he saw in the wan moonlight an old man of terrible aspect his eyes were as red burning coals long grey hair fell over his shoulders in matted coils his garments which were of antique cut were soiled and ragged and from his wrists and ankles hung heavy manacles and rusty gyves  my dear sir said mr otis i really must insist on your oiling those chains and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the tammany rising sun lubricator it is said to be completely efficacious upon one application and there are several testimonials to that effect on the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines i shall leave it here for you by the bedroom candles and will be happy to supply you with more should you require it with these words the united states minister laid the bottle down on a marble table and closing his door retired to rest  illustration i really must insist on your oiling those chains  for a moment the canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural indignation then dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor he fled down the corridor uttering hollow groans and emitting a ghastly green light just however as he reached the top of the great oak staircase a door was flung open two little whiterobed figures appeared and a large pillow whizzed past his head there was evidently no time to be lost so hastily adopting the fourth dimension of space as a means of escape he vanished through the wainscoting and the house became quite quiet  on reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing he leaned up against a moonbeam to recover his breath and began to try and realize his position never in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three hundred years had he been so grossly insulted he thought of the dowager duchess whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before the glass in her lace and diamonds of the four housemaids who had gone into hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on one of the spare bedrooms of the rector of the parish whose candle he had blown out as he was coming late one night from the library and who had been under the care of sir william gull ever since a perfect martyr to nervous disorders and of old madame de tremouillac who having wakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair by the fire reading her diary had been confined to her bed for six weeks with an attack of brain fever and on her recovery had become reconciled to the church and broken off her connection with that notorious sceptic monsieur de voltaire he remembered the terrible night when the wicked lord canterville was found choking in his dressingroom with the knave of diamonds halfway down his throat and confessed just before he died that he had cheated charles james fox out of £50000 at crockfords by means of that very card and swore that the ghost had made him swallow it all his great achievements came back to him again from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because he had seen a green hand tapping at the windowpane to the beautiful lady stutfield who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round her throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin and who drowned herself at last in the carppond at the end of the kings walk with the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist he went over his most celebrated performances and smiled bitterly to himself as he recalled to mind his last appearance as red reuben or the strangled babe his début as guant gibeon the bloodsucker of bexley moor and the furore he had excited one lovely june evening by merely playing ninepins with his own bones upon the lawntennis ground and after all this some wretched modern americans were to come and offer him the rising sun lubricator and throw pillows at his head it was quite unbearable besides no ghost in history had ever been treated in this manner accordingly he determined to have vengeance and remained till daylight in an attitude of deep thought     iii   the next morning when the otis family met at breakfast they discussed the ghost at some length the united states minister was naturally a little annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted i have no wish he said to do the ghost any personal injury and i must say that considering the length of time he has been in the house i dont think it is at all polite to throw pillows at hima very just remark at which i am sorry to say the twins burst into shouts of laughter upon the other hand he continued if he really declines to use the rising sun lubricator we shall have to take his chains from him it would be quite impossible to sleep with such a noise going on outside the bedrooms  for the rest of the week however they were undisturbed the only thing that excited any attention being the continual renewal of the bloodstain on the library floor this certainly was very strange as the door was always locked at night by mr otis and the windows kept closely barred the chameleonlike colour also of the stain excited a good deal of comment some mornings it was a dull almost indian red then it would be vermilion then a rich purple and once when they came down for family prayers according to the simple rites of the free american reformed episcopalian church they found it a bright emeraldgreen these kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party very much and bets on the subject were freely made every evening the only person who did not enter into the joke was little virginia who for some unexplained reason was always a good deal distressed at the sight of the bloodstain and very nearly cried the morning it was emeraldgreen  the second appearance of the ghost was on sunday night shortly after they had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in the hall rushing downstairs they found that a large suit of old armour had become detached from its stand and had fallen on the stone floor while seated in a highbacked chair was the canterville ghost rubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face the twins having brought their peashooters with them at once discharged two pellets on him with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained by long and careful practice on a writingmaster while the united states minister covered him with his revolver and called upon him in accordance with californian etiquette to hold up his hands the ghost started up with a wild shriek of rage and swept through them like a mist extinguishing washington otiss candle as he passed and so leaving them all in total darkness on reaching the top of the staircase he recovered himself and determined to give his celebrated peal of demoniac laughter this he had on more than one occasion found extremely useful it was said to have turned lord rakers wig grey in a single night and had certainly made three of lady cantervilles french governesses give warning before their month was up he accordingly laughed his most horrible laugh till the old vaulted roof rang and rang again but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door opened and mrs otis came out in a light blue dressinggown i am afraid you are far from well she said and have brought you a bottle of doctor dobells tincture if it is indigestion you will find it a most excellent remedy the ghost glared at her in fury and began at once to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog an accomplishment for which he was justly renowned and to which the family doctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of lord cantervilles uncle the hon thomas horton the sound of approaching footsteps however made him hesitate in his fell purpose so he contented himself with becoming faintly phosphorescent and vanished with a deep churchyard groan just as the twins had come up to him  illustration the twins  at once discharged two pellets on him  on reaching his room he entirely broke down and became a prey to the most violent agitation the vulgarity of the twins and the gross materialism of mrs otis were naturally extremely annoying but what really distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit of mail he had hoped that even modern americans would be thrilled by the sight of a spectre in armour if for no more sensible reason at least out of respect for their natural poet longfellow over whose graceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary hour when the cantervilles were up in town besides it was his own suit he had worn it with great success at the kenilworth tournament and had been highly complimented on it by no less a person than the virgin queen herself yet when he had put it on he had been completely overpowered by the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque and had fallen heavily on the stone pavement barking both his knees severely and bruising the knuckles of his right hand  for some days after this he was extremely ill and hardly stirred out of his room at all except to keep the bloodstain in proper repair however by taking great care of himself he recovered and resolved to make a third attempt to frighten the united states minister and his family he selected friday august 17th for his appearance and spent most of that day in looking over his wardrobe ultimately deciding in favour of a large slouched hat with a red feather a windingsheet frilled at the wrists and neck and a rusty dagger towards evening a violent storm of rain came on and the wind was so high that all the windows and doors in the old house shook and rattled in fact it was just such weather as he loved his plan of action was this he was to make his way quietly to washington otiss room gibber at him from the foot of the bed and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound of low music he bore washington a special grudge being quite aware that it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous canterville bloodstain by means of pinkertons paragon detergent having reduced the reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror he was then to proceed to the room occupied by the united states minister and his wife and there to place a clammy hand on mrs otiss forehead while he hissed into her trembling husbands ear the awful secrets of the charnelhouse with regard to little virginia he had not quite made up his mind she had never insulted him in any way and was pretty and gentle a few hollow groans from the wardrobe he thought would be more than sufficient or if that failed to wake her he might grabble at the counterpane with palsytwitching fingers as for the twins he was quite determined to teach them a lesson the first thing to be done was of course to sit upon their chests so as to produce the stifling sensation of nightmare then as their beds were quite close to each other to stand between them in the form of a green icycold corpse till they became paralyzed with fear and finally to throw off the windingsheet and crawl round the room with white bleached bones and one rolling eyeball in the character of dumb daniel or the suicides skeleton a rôle in which he had on more than one occasion produced a great effect and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of martin the maniac or the masked mystery  at halfpast ten he heard the family going to bed for some time he was disturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins who with the lighthearted gaiety of schoolboys were evidently amusing themselves before they retired to rest but at a quarterpast eleven all was still and as midnight sounded he sallied forth the owl beat against the windowpanes the raven croaked from the old yewtree and the wind wandered moaning round the house like a lost soul but the otis family slept unconscious of their doom and high above the rain and storm he could hear the steady snoring of the minister for the united states he stepped stealthily out of the wainscoting with an evil smile on his cruel wrinkled mouth and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole past the great oriel window where his own arms and those of his murdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold on and on he glided like an evil shadow the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed once he thought he heard something call and stopped but it was only the baying of a dog from the red farm and he went on muttering strange sixteenthcentury curses and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger in the midnight air finally he reached the corner of the passage that led to luckless washingtons room for a moment he paused there the wind blowing his long grey locks about his head and twisting into grotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead mans shroud then the clock struck the quarter and he felt the time was come he chuckled to himself and turned the corner but no sooner had he done so than with a piteous wail of terror he fell back and hid his blanched face in his long bony hands right in front of him was standing a horrible spectre motionless as a carven image and monstrous as a madmans dream its head was bald and burnished its face round and fat and white and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its features into an eternal grin from the eyes streamed rays of scarlet light the mouth was a wide well of fire and a hideous garment like to his own swathed with its silent snows the titan form on its breast was a placard with strange writing in antique characters some scroll of shame it seemed some record of wild sins some awful calendar of crime and with its right hand it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel  illustration its head was bald and burnished  never having seen a ghost before he naturally was terribly frightened and after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom he fled back to his room tripping up in his long windingsheet as he sped down the corridor and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the ministers jackboots where it was found in the morning by the butler once in the privacy of his own apartment he flung himself down on a small palletbed and hid his face under the clothes after a time however the brave old canterville spirit asserted itself and he determined to go and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight accordingly just as the dawn was touching the hills with silver he returned towards the spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom feeling that after all two ghosts were better than one and that by the aid of his new friend he might safely grapple with the twins on reaching the spot however a terrible sight met his gaze something had evidently happened to the spectre for the light had entirely faded from its hollow eyes the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand and it was leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable attitude he rushed forward and seized it in his arms when to his horror the head slipped off and rolled on the floor the body assumed a recumbent posture and he found himself clasping a white dimity bedcurtain with a sweepingbrush a kitchen cleaver and a hollow turnip lying at his feet unable to understand this curious transformation he clutched the placard with feverish haste and there in the grey morning light he read these fearful words                            ye otis ghoste                       ye onlie true and originale spook              beware of ye imitationes                   all others are counterfeite                the whole thing flashed across him he had been tricked foiled and outwitted the old canterville look came into his eyes he ground his toothless gums together and raising his withered hands high above his head swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique school that when chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn deeds of blood would be wrought and murder walk abroad with silent feet  hardly had he finished this awful oath when from the redtiled roof of a distant homestead a cock crew he laughed a long low bitter laugh and waited hour after hour he waited but the cock for some strange reason did not crow again finally at halfpast seven the arrival of the housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil and he stalked back to his room thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose there he consulted several books of ancient chivalry of which he was exceedingly fond and found that on every occasion on which this oath had been used chanticleer had always crowed a second time perdition seize the naughty fowl he muttered i have seen the day when with my stout spear i would have run him through the gorge and made him crow for me an twere in death he then retired to a comfortable lead coffin and stayed there till evening     iv   illustration he met with a severe fall  the next day the ghost was very weak and tired the terrible excitement of the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect his nerves were completely shattered and he started at the slightest noise for five days he kept his room and at last made up his mind to give up the point of the bloodstain on the library floor if the otis family did not want it they clearly did not deserve it they were evidently people on a low material plane of existence and quite incapable of appreciating the symbolic value of sensuous phenomena the question of phantasmic apparitions and the development of astral bodies was of course quite a different matter and really not under his control it was his solemn duty to appear in the corridor once a week and to gibber from the large oriel window on the first and third wednesdays in every month and he did not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations it is quite true that his life had been very evil but upon the other hand he was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural for the next three saturdays accordingly he traversed the corridor as usual between midnight and three oclock taking every possible precaution against being either heard or seen he removed his boots trod as lightly as possible on the old wormeaten boards wore a large black velvet cloak and was careful to use the rising sun lubricator for oiling his chains i am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good deal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of protection however one night while the family were at dinner he slipped into mr otiss bedroom and carried off the bottle he felt a little humiliated at first but afterwards was sensible enough to see that there was a great deal to be said for the invention and to a certain degree it served his purpose still in spite of everything he was not left unmolested strings were continually being stretched across the corridor over which he tripped in the dark and on one occasion while dressed for the part of black isaac or the huntsman of hogley woods he met with a severe fall through treading on a butterslide which the twins had constructed from the entrance of the tapestry chamber to the top of the oak staircase this last insult so enraged him that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and social position and determined to visit the insolent young etonians the next night in his celebrated character of reckless rupert or the headless earl  illustration a heavy jug of water fell right down on him  he had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years in fact not since he had so frightened pretty lady barbara modish by means of it that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present lord cantervilles grandfather and ran away to gretna green with handsome jack castletown declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to marry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and down the terrace at twilight poor jack was afterwards shot in a duel by lord canterville on wandsworth common and lady barbara died of a broken heart at tunbridge wells before the year was out so in every way it had been a great success it was however an extremely difficult makeup if i may use such a theatrical expression in connection with one of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural or to employ a more scientific term the highernatural world and it took him fully three hours to make his preparations at last everything was ready and he was very pleased with his appearance the big leather ridingboots that went with the dress were just a little too large for him and he could only find one of the two horsepistols but on the whole he was quite satisfied and at a quarterpast one he glided out of the wainscoting and crept down the corridor on reaching the room occupied by the twins which i should mention was called the blue bed chamber on account of the colour of its hangings he found the door just ajar wishing to make an effective entrance he flung it wide open when a heavy jug of water fell right down on him wetting him to the skin and just missing his left shoulder by a couple of inches at the same moment he heard stifled shrieks of laughter proceeding from the fourpost bed the shock to his nervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he could go and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold the only thing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he had not brought his head with him for had he done so the consequences might have been very serious  illustration making satirical remarks on the photographs  he now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude american family and contented himself as a rule with creeping about the passages in list slippers with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of draughts and a small arquebuse in case he should be attacked by the twins the final blow he received occurred on the 19th of september he had gone downstairs to the great entrancehall feeling sure that there at any rate he would be quite unmolested and was amusing himself by making satirical remarks on the large saroni photographs of the united states minister and his wife which had now taken the place of the canterville family pictures he was simply but neatly clad in a long shroud spotted with churchyard mould had tied up his jaw with a strip of yellow linen and carried a small lantern and a sextons spade in fact he was dressed for the character of jonas the graveless or the corpsesnatcher of chertsey barn one of his most remarkable impersonations and one which the cantervilles had every reason to remember as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their neighbour lord rufford it was about a quarterpast two oclock in the morning and as far as he could ascertain no one was stirring as he was strolling towards the library however to see if there were any traces left of the bloodstain suddenly there leaped out on him from a dark corner two figures who waved their arms wildly above their heads and shrieked out boo in his ear  illustration suddenly there leaped out two figures  seized with a panic which under the circumstances was only natural he rushed for the staircase but found washington otis waiting for him there with the big gardensyringe and being thus hemmed in by his enemies on every side and driven almost to bay he vanished into the great iron stove which fortunately for him was not lit and had to make his way home through the flues and chimneys arriving at his own room in a terrible state of dirt disorder and despair  after this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition the twins lay in wait for him on several occasions and strewed the passages with nutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the servants but it was of no avail it was quite evident that his feelings were so wounded that he would not appear mr otis consequently resumed his great work on the history of the democratic party on which he had been engaged for some years mrs otis organized a wonderful clambake which amazed the whole county the boys took to lacrosse euchre poker and other american national games and virginia rode about the lanes on her pony accompanied by the young duke of cheshire who had come to spend the last week of his holidays at canterville chase it was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away and in fact mr otis wrote a letter to that effect to lord canterville who in reply expressed his great pleasure at the news and sent his best congratulations to the ministers worthy wife  the otises however were deceived for the ghost was still in the house and though now almost an invalid was by no means ready to let matters rest particularly as he heard that among the guests was the young duke of cheshire whose granduncle lord francis stilton had once bet a hundred guineas with colonel carbury that he would play dice with the canterville ghost and was found the next morning lying on the floor of the cardroom in such a helpless paralytic state that though he lived on to a great age he was never able to say anything again but double sixes the story was well known at the time though of course out of respect to the feelings of the two noble families every attempt was made to hush it up and a full account of all the circumstances connected with it will be found in the third volume of lord tattles recollections of the prince regent and his friends the ghost then was naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence over the stiltons with whom indeed he was distantly connected his own first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the sieur de bulkeley from whom as every one knows the dukes of cheshire are lineally descended accordingly he made arrangements for appearing to virginias little lover in his celebrated impersonation of the vampire monk or the bloodless benedictine a performance so horrible that when old lady startup saw it which she did on one fatal new years eve in the year 1764 she went off into the most piercing shrieks which culminated in violent apoplexy and died in three days after disinheriting the cantervilles who were her nearest relations and leaving all her money to her london apothecary at the last moment however his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room and the little duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the royal bedchamber and dreamed of virginia     v   a few days after this virginia and her curlyhaired cavalier went out riding on brockley meadows where she tore her habit so badly in getting through a hedge that on their return home she made up her mind to go up by the back staircase so as not to be seen as she was running past the tapestry chamber the door of which happened to be open she fancied she saw some one inside and thinking it was her mothers maid who sometimes used to bring her work there looked in to ask her to mend her habit to her immense surprise however it was the canterville ghost himself he was sitting by the window watching the ruined gold of the yellowing trees fly through the air and the red leaves dancing madly down the long avenue his head was leaning on his hand and his whole attitude was one of extreme depression indeed so forlorn and so much out of repair did he look that little virginia whose first idea had been to run away and lock herself in her room was filled with pity and determined to try and comfort him so light was her footfall and so deep his melancholy that he was not aware of her presence till she spoke to him  i am so sorry for you she said but my brothers are going back to eton tomorrow and then if you behave yourself no one will annoy you  it is absurd asking me to behave myself he answered looking round in astonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him quite absurd i must rattle my chains and groan through keyholes and walk about at night if that is what you mean it is my only reason for existing  it is no reason at all for existing and you know you have been very wicked mrs umney told us the first day we arrived here that you had killed your wife  well i quite admit it said the ghost petulantly but it was a purely family matter and concerned no one else  it is very wrong to kill any one said virginia who at times had a sweet puritan gravity caught from some old new england ancestor  oh i hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics my wife was very plain never had my ruffs properly starched and knew nothing about cookery why there was a buck i had shot in hogley woods a magnificent pricket and do you know how she had it sent to table however it is no matter now for it is all over and i dont think it was very nice of her brothers to starve me to death though i did kill her  starve you to death oh mr ghosti mean sir simon are you hungry i have a sandwich in my case would you like it  no thank you i never eat anything now but it is very kind of you all the same and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid rude vulgar dishonest family  stop cried virginia stamping her foot it is you who are rude and horrid and vulgar and as for dishonesty you know you stole the paints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous bloodstain in the library first you took all my reds including the vermilion and i couldnt do any more sunsets then you took the emeraldgreen and the chromeyellow and finally i had nothing left but indigo and chinese white and could only do moonlight scenes which are always depressing to look at and not at all easy to paint i never told on you though i was very much annoyed and it was most ridiculous the whole thing for who ever heard of emeraldgreen blood  well really said the ghost rather meekly what was i to do it is a very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays and as your brother began it all with his paragon detergent i certainly saw no reason why i should not have your paints as for colour that is always a matter of taste the cantervilles have blue blood for instance the very bluest in england but i know you americans dont care for things of this kind  you know nothing about it and the best thing you can do is to emigrate and improve your mind my father will be only too happy to give you a free passage and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind there will be no difficulty about the custom house as the officers are all democrats once in new york you are sure to be a great success i know lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to have a grandfather and much more than that to have a family ghost  i dont think i should like america  i suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities said virginia satirically  no ruins no curiosities answered the ghost you have your navy and your manners  good evening i will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra weeks holiday  please dont go miss virginia he cried i am so lonely and so unhappy and i really dont know what to do i want to go to sleep and i cannot  thats quite absurd you have merely to go to bed and blow out the candle it is very difficult sometimes to keep awake especially at church but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping why even babies know how to do that and they are not very clever  i have not slept for three hundred years he said sadly and virginias beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder for three hundred years i have not slept and i am so tired  virginia grew quite grave and her little lips trembled like roseleaves she came towards him and kneeling down at his side looked up into his old withered face  poor poor ghost she murmured have you no place where you can sleep  illustration poor poor ghost she murmured have you no place where you can sleep  far away beyond the pinewoods he answered in a low dreamy voice there is a little garden there the grass grows long and deep there are the great white stars of the hemlock flower there the nightingale sings all night long all night long he sings and the cold crystal moon looks down and the yewtree spreads out its giant arms over the sleepers  virginias eyes grew dim with tears and she hid her face in her hands  you mean the garden of death she whispered  yes death death must be so beautiful to lie in the soft brown earth with the grasses waving above ones head and listen to silence to have no yesterday and no tomorrow to forget time to forget life to be at peace you can help me you can open for me the portals of deaths house for love is always with you and love is stronger than death is  virginia trembled a cold shudder ran through her and for a few moments there was silence she felt as if she was in a terrible dream  then the ghost spoke again and his voice sounded like the sighing of the wind  have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window  oh often cried the little girl looking up i know it quite well it is painted in curious black letters and is difficult to read there are only six lines      when a golden girl can win     prayer from out the lips of sin     when the barren almond bears     and a little child gives away its tears     then shall all the house be still     and peace come to canterville  but i dont know what they mean  they mean he said sadly that you must weep with me for my sins because i have no tears and pray with me for my soul because i have no faith and then if you have always been sweet and good and gentle the angel of death will have mercy on me you will see fearful shapes in darkness and wicked voices will whisper in your ear but they will not harm you for against the purity of a little child the powers of hell cannot prevail  virginia made no answer and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair as he looked down at her bowed golden head suddenly she stood up very pale and with a strange light in her eyes i am not afraid she said firmly and i will ask the angel to have mercy on you  he rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy and taking her hand bent over it with oldfashioned grace and kissed it his fingers were as cold as ice and his lips burned like fire but virginia did not falter as he led her across the dusky room on the faded green tapestry were broidered little huntsmen they blew their tasselled horns and with their tiny hands waved to her to go back go back little virginia they cried go back but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly and she shut her eyes against them horrible animals with lizard tails and goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece and murmured beware little virginia beware we may never see you again but the ghost glided on more swiftly and virginia did not listen when they reached the end of the room he stopped and muttered some words she could not understand she opened her eyes and saw the wall slowly fading away like a mist and a great black cavern in front of her a bitter cold wind swept round them and she felt something pulling at her dress quick quick cried the ghost or it will be too late and in a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them and the tapestry chamber was empty  illustration the ghost glided on more swiftly     vi   about ten minutes later the bell rang for tea and as virginia did not come down mrs otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her after a little time he returned and said that he could not find miss virginia anywhere as she was in the habit of going out to the garden every evening to get flowers for the dinnertable mrs otis was not at all alarmed at first but when six oclock struck and virginia did not appear she became really agitated and sent the boys out to look for her while she herself and mr otis searched every room in the house at halfpast six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace of their sister anywhere they were all now in the greatest state of excitement and did not know what to do when mr otis suddenly remembered that some few days before he had given a band of gipsies permission to camp in the park he accordingly at once set off for blackfell hollow where he knew they were accompanied by his eldest son and two of the farmservants the little duke of cheshire who was perfectly frantic with anxiety begged hard to be allowed to go too but mr otis would not allow him as he was afraid there might be a scuffle on arriving at the spot however he found that the gipsies had gone and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden as the fire was still burning and some plates were lying on the grass having sent off washington and the two men to scour the district he ran home and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the county telling them to look out for a little girl who had been kidnapped by tramps or gipsies he then ordered his horse to be brought round and after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down to dinner rode off down the ascot road with a groom he had hardly however gone a couple of miles when he heard somebody galloping after him and looking round saw the little duke coming up on his pony with his face very flushed and no hat im awfully sorry mr otis gasped out the boy but i cant eat any dinner as long as virginia is lost please dont be angry with me if you had let us be engaged last year there would never have been all this trouble you wont send me back will you i cant go i wont go  illustration he heard somebody galloping after him  the minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace and was a good deal touched at his devotion to virginia so leaning down from his horse he patted him kindly on the shoulders and said well cecil if you wont go back i suppose you must come with me but i must get you a hat at ascot  oh bother my hat i want virginia cried the little duke laughing and they galloped on to the railway station there mr otis inquired of the stationmaster if any one answering to the description of virginia had been seen on the platform but could get no news of her the stationmaster however wired up and down the line and assured him that a strict watch would be kept for her and after having bought a hat for the little duke from a linendraper who was just putting up his shutters mr otis rode off to bexley a village about four miles away which he was told was a wellknown haunt of the gipsies as there was a large common next to it here they roused up the rural policeman but could get no information from him and after riding all over the common they turned their horses heads homewards and reached the chase about eleven oclock deadtired and almost heartbroken they found washington and the twins waiting for them at the gatehouse with lanterns as the avenue was very dark not the slightest trace of virginia had been discovered the gipsies had been caught on brockley meadows but she was not with them and they had explained their sudden departure by saying that they had mistaken the date of chorton fair and had gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late indeed they had been quite distressed at hearing of virginias disappearance as they were very grateful to mr otis for having allowed them to camp in his park and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search the carppond had been dragged and the whole chase thoroughly gone over but without any result it was evident that for that night at any rate virginia was lost to them and it was in a state of the deepest depression that mr otis and the boys walked up to the house the groom following behind with the two horses and the pony in the hall they found a group of frightened servants and lying on a sofa in the library was poor mrs otis almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety and having her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper mr otis at once insisted on her having something to eat and ordered up supper for the whole party it was a melancholy meal as hardly any one spoke and even the twins were awestruck and subdued as they were very fond of their sister when they had finished mr otis in spite of the entreaties of the little duke ordered them all to bed saying that nothing more could be done that night and that he would telegraph in the morning to scotland yard for some detectives to be sent down immediately just as they were passing out of the diningroom midnight began to boom from the clock tower and when the last stroke sounded they heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry a dreadful peal of thunder shook the house a strain of unearthly music floated through the air a panel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise and out on the landing looking very pale and white with a little casket in her hand stepped virginia in a moment they had all rushed up to her mrs otis clasped her passionately in her arms the duke smothered her with violent kisses and the twins executed a wild wardance round the group  illustration out on the landing stepped virginia  good heavens child where have you been said mr otis rather angrily thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them cecil and i have been riding all over the country looking for you and your mother has been frightened to death you must never play these practical jokes any more  except on the ghost except on the ghost shrieked the twins as they capered about  my own darling thank god you are found you must never leave my side again murmured mrs otis as she kissed the trembling child and smoothed the tangled gold of her hair  papa said virginia quietly i have been with the ghost he is dead and you must come and see him he had been very wicked but he was really sorry for all that he had done and he gave me this box of beautiful jewels before he died  the whole family gazed at her in mute amazement but she was quite grave and serious and turning round she led them through the opening in the wainscoting down a narrow secret corridor washington following with a lighted candle which he had caught up from the table finally they came to a great oak door studded with rusty nails when virginia touched it it swung back on its heavy hinges and they found themselves in a little low room with a vaulted ceiling and one tiny grated window imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring and chained to it was a gaunt skeleton that was stretched out at full length on the stone floor and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers an oldfashioned trencher and ewer that were placed just out of its reach the jug had evidently been once filled with water as it was covered inside with green mould there was nothing on the trencher but a pile of dust virginia knelt down beside the skeleton and folding her little hands together began to pray silently while the rest of the party looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now disclosed to them  illustration chained to it was a gaunt skeleton  hallo suddenly exclaimed one of the twins who had been looking out of the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was situated hallo the old withered almondtree has blossomed i can see the flowers quite plainly in the moonlight  god has forgiven him said virginia gravely as she rose to her feet and a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face  what an angel you are cried the young duke and he put his arm round her neck and kissed her      vii   illustration by the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the servants with lighted torches  four days after these curious incidents a funeral started from canterville chase at about eleven oclock at night the hearse was drawn by eight black horses each of which carried on its head a great tuft of nodding ostrichplumes and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich purple pall on which was embroidered in gold the canterville coatofarms by the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the servants with lighted torches and the whole procession was wonderfully impressive lord canterville was the chief mourner having come up specially from wales to attend the funeral and sat in the first carriage along with little virginia then came the united states minister and his wife then washington and the three boys and in the last carriage was mrs umney it was generally felt that as she had been frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life she had a right to see the last of him a deep grave had been dug in the corner of the churchyard just under the old yewtree and the service was read in the most impressive manner by the rev augustus dampier when the ceremony was over the servants according to an old custom observed in the canterville family extinguished their torches and as the coffin was being lowered into the grave virginia stepped forward and laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almondblossoms as she did so the moon came out from behind a cloud and flooded with its silent silver the little churchyard and from a distant copse a nightingale began to sing she thought of the ghosts description of the garden of death her eyes became dim with tears and she hardly spoke a word during the drive home  illustration the moon came out from behind a cloud  the next morning before lord canterville went up to town mr otis had an interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given to virginia they were perfectly magnificent especially a certain ruby necklace with old venetian setting which was really a superb specimen of sixteenthcentury work and their value was so great that mr otis felt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them  my lord he said i know that in this country mortmain is held to apply to trinkets as well as to land and it is quite clear to me that these jewels are or should be heirlooms in your family i must beg you accordingly to take them to london with you and to regard them simply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you under certain strange conditions as for my daughter she is merely a child and has as yet i am glad to say but little interest in such appurtenances of idle luxury i am also informed by mrs otis who i may say is no mean authority upon arthaving had the privilege of spending several winters in boston when she was a girlthat these gems are of great monetary worth and if offered for sale would fetch a tall price under these circumstances lord canterville i feel sure that you will recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain in the possession of any member of my family and indeed all such vain gauds and toys however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the british aristocracy would be completely out of place among those who have been brought up on the severe and i believe immortal principles of republican simplicity perhaps i should mention that virginia is very anxious that you should allow her to retain the box as a memento of your unfortunate but misguided ancestor as it is extremely old and consequently a good deal out of repair you may perhaps think fit to comply with her request for my own part i confess i am a good deal surprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with mediævalism in any form and can only account for it by the fact that virginia was born in one of your london suburbs shortly after mrs otis had returned from a trip to athens  lord canterville listened very gravely to the worthy ministers speech pulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile and when mr otis had ended he shook him cordially by the hand and said my dear sir your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky ancestor sir simon a very important service and i and my family are much indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck the jewels are clearly hers and egad i believe that if i were heartless enough to take them from her the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave in a fortnight leading me the devil of a life as for their being heirlooms nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or legal document and the existence of these jewels has been quite unknown i assure you i have no more claim on them than your butler and when miss virginia grows up i dare say she will be pleased to have pretty things to wear besides you forget mr otis that you took the furniture and the ghost at a valuation and anything that belonged to the ghost passed at once into your possession as whatever activity sir simon may have shown in the corridor at night in point of law he was really dead and you acquired his property by purchase  mr otis was a good deal distressed at lord cantervilles refusal and begged him to reconsider his decision but the goodnatured peer was quite firm and finally induced the minister to allow his daughter to retain the present the ghost had given her and when in the spring of 1890 the young duchess of cheshire was presented at the queens first drawingroom on the occasion of her marriage her jewels were the universal theme of admiration for virginia received the coronet which is the reward of all good little american girls and was married to her boylover as soon as he came of age they were both so charming and they loved each other so much that every one was delighted at the match except the old marchioness of dumbleton who had tried to catch the duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters and had given no less than three expensive dinnerparties for that purpose and strange to say mr otis himself mr otis was extremely fond of the young duke personally but theoretically he objected to titles and to use his own words was not without apprehension lest amid the enervating influences of a pleasureloving aristocracy the true principles of republican simplicity should be forgotten his objections however were completely overruled and i believe that when he walked up the aisle of st georges hanover square with his daughter leaning on his arm there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of england  the duke and duchess after the honeymoon was over went down to canterville chase and on the day after their arrival they walked over in the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pinewoods there had been a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on sir simons tombstone but finally it had been decided to engrave on it simply the initials of the old gentlemans name and the verse from the library window the duchess had brought with her some lovely roses which she strewed upon the grave and after they had stood by it for some time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey there the duchess sat down on a fallen pillar while her husband lay at her feet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes suddenly he threw his cigarette away took hold of her hand and said to her virginia a wife should have no secrets from her husband  dear cecil i have no secrets from you  yes you have he answered smiling you have never told me what happened to you when you were locked up with the ghost  i have never told any one cecil said virginia gravely  i know that but you might tell me  please dont ask me cecil i cannot tell you poor sir simon i owe him a great deal yes dont laugh cecil i really do he made me see what life is and what death signifies and why love is stronger than both  the duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly  you can have your secret as long as i have your heart he murmured  you have always had that cecil  and you will tell our children some day wont you  virginia blushed
