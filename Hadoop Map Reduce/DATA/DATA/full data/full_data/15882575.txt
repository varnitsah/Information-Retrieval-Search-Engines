15882575	the register  by william d howells     i    scene  in an upper chamber of a boardinghouse in melanchthon place boston a mature plain young lady with every appearance of establishing herself in the room for the first time moves about bestowing little touches of decoration here and there and talking with another young lady whose voice comes through the open doorway of an inner room   miss ethel reed from within  what in the world are you doing nettie  miss henrietta spaulding  oh sticking up a household god or two what are you doing  miss reed  despairing  miss spaulding  still  miss

be everlastingly disgraced  miss reed  im that now  i cant be more sotheres that comfort what makes you think hell call  miss spaulding  because hes a gentleman and will want to apologize  he behaved very rudely to you  miss reed  no nettie i behaved rudely to him  yes  besides if he behaved rudely he was no gentleman  its a contradiction in terms dont you see  but ill tell you what im going to do if he comes  im going to show a proper spirit for once in my life  im going to refuse to see him  youve got to see him  miss spaulding  nonsense  miss reed  why nonsense  oh why  expound  miss spaulding  because he wasnt rude to me and he doesnt want to see me  because im plain and youre pretty  miss reed  im not  you know it perfectly well  im hideous  miss spaulding  because im poor and youre a person of independent property  miss reed  dependent property i should call it  just enough to be useless on  but thats insulting to him  how can you say its because i have a little money  miss spaulding  well then i wont  i take it back  ill say its because youre young and im old  miss reed  youre not old  youre as young as anybody nettie spaulding  and you know im not young im twentyseven if im a day  im just dropping into the grave  but i cant argue with you miles off so any longer miss reed appears at the open door dragging languidly after her the shawl which she had evidently drawn round her on the sofa her fair hair is a little disordered and she presses it into shape with one hand as she comes forward a lovely flush vies with a heavenly pallor in her cheeks she looks a little pensive in the arching eyebrows and a little humorous about the dimpled mouth  now i can prove that you are entirely wrong  where were youthis room is rather an improvement over the one we had last winter  there is more of a viewshe goes to the windowof the houses across the place and i always think the swell front gives a pretty shape to a room  im sorry theyve stopped building them your piano goes very nicely into that little alcove  yes were quite palatial  and on the whole im glad theres no fireplace its a pleasure at times but for the most part its a vanity and a vexation getting dust and ashes over everything  yes after all give me the good oldfashioned clean convenient register  ugh  my feet are like ice  she pulls an easychair up to the register in the corner of the room and pushes open its valves with the toe of her slipper  as she settles herself luxuriously in the chair and poises her feet daintily over the register  ah this is something like  henrietta spaulding maam  did i ever tell you that you were the best friend i have in the world  miss spaulding who continues her work of arranging the room often  miss reed  did you ever believe it  miss spaulding  never  miss reed  why  miss spaulding thoughtfully regarding a vase which she holds in her hand after several times shifting it from a bracket to the corner of her piano and back  i wish i could tell where you do look best  miss reed leaning forward wistfully with her hands clasped and resting on her knees  i wish you would tell me why you dont believe youre the best friend i have in the world  miss spaulding finally placing the vase on the bracket  because youve said so too often  miss reed  oh thats no reason  i can prove to you that you are who else but you would have taken in a homeless and friendless creature like me and let her stay bothering round in demoralizing idleness while you were seriously teaching the young idea how to drub the piano  miss spaulding  anybody who wanted a roommate as much as i did and could have found one willing to pay more than her share of the lodging  miss reed thoughtfully  do you think so henrietta  miss spaulding  i know so  miss reed  and youre not afraid that you wrong yourself  miss spaulding  not the least  miss reed  well be it soas they say in novels  i will not contradict you i will not say you are my best friend i will merely say that you are my only friend  come here henrietta  draw up your chair and put your little hand in mine  miss spaulding with severe distrust  what do you want ethel reed  miss reed  i wanti wantto talk it over with you  miss spaulding recoiling  i knew it  well now weve talked it over enough weve talked it over till theres nothing left of it  miss reed  oh theres everything left  it remains in all its original enormity  perhaps we shall get some new light upon it she extends a pleading hand towards miss spaulding  come henrietta my only friend shakeas the good indians say  let your ethel pour her hackneyed sorrows into your bosom  such an uncomfortable image it always seems doesnt it pouring sorrows into bosoms  come  miss spaulding decidedly  no i wont  and you neednt try wheedling any longer  i wont sympathize with you on that basis at all  miss reed  what shall i try then if you wont let me try wheedling  miss spaulding going to the piano and opening it  try courage try selfrespect  miss reed  oh dear when i havent a morsel of either  are you going to practise you cruel maid  miss spaulding  of course i am  its halfpast four and if i dont do it now i shant be prepared tomorrow for miss robins  she takes this piece  miss reed  well well perhaps its all for the best  if music be the food ofumphumpyou know whatplay on  they both laugh and miss spaulding pushes back a little from the piano and wheels toward her friend letting one hand rest slightly on the keys  miss spaulding  ethel reed youre the most ridiculous girl in the world  miss reed  correct  miss spaulding  and i dont believe you ever were in love or ever will be  miss reed  ah there you wrong me henrietta  i have been and i shall belots of times  miss spaulding  well what do you want to say now  you must hurry for i cant lose any more time  miss reed  i will free my mind with neatness and despatch  i simply wish to go over the whole affair from alfred to omaha and youve got to let me talk as much slang and nonsense as i want  and then ill skip all the details i can  will you  miss spaulding with impatient patience  oh i suppose so  miss reed  thats very sweet of you though you dont look it now where was i  oh yes do you think it was forthputting at all to ask him if he would give me the lessons  miss spaulding  it depends upon why you asked him  miss reed  i asked him fromfromlet me see i asked him because fromyes i say it boldly i asked him from an enthusiasm for art and a sincere wish to learn the use of oil as he called it  yes  miss spaulding  are you sure  miss reed  sure  well we will say that i am for the sake of argument  and having secured this basis the question is whether i wasnt bound to offer him pay at the end and whether he wasnt wrong to take my doing so in dudgeon  miss spaulding  yes i think he was wrong  and the terms of his refusal were very ungentlemanly  he ought to apologize most amply and humbly  at a certain expression in miss reeds face she adds with severity  unless youre keeping back the main point  you usually do  are you  miss reed  no no  ive told you everythingeverything  miss spaulding  then i say as i said from the beginning that he behaved very badly  it was very awkward and very painful but youve really nothing to blame yourself for  miss reed ruefully  nooo  miss spaulding  what do you mean by that sort of no  miss reed  nothing  miss spaulding sternly  yes you do ethel  miss reed  i dont really  what makes you think i do  miss spaulding  it sounded very dishonest  miss reed  did it  i didnt mean it to  her friend breaks down with a laugh while miss reed preserves a demure countenance  miss spaulding  what are you keeping back  miss reed  nothing at allless than nothing  i never thought it was worth mentioning  miss spaulding  are you telling me the truth  miss reed  im telling you the truth and something more  you cant ask better than that can you  miss spaulding turning to her music again  certainly not  miss reed  in a pathetic wail  o henrietta do you abandon me thus  well i will tell you heartless girl  ive only kept it back till now because it was so extremely mortifying to my pride as an artistas a student of oil  will you hear me  miss spaulding beginning to play  no  miss reed with burlesque wildness  you shall  miss spaulding involuntarily desists  there was a momenta fatal momentwhen he said he thought he ought to tell me that if i found oil amusing i could go on but that he didnt believe i should ever learn to use it and he couldnt let me take lessons from him with the expectation that i should  there  miss spaulding with awful reproach  and you call that less than nothing  ive almost a mind never to speak to you again ethel  how could you deceive me so  miss reed  was it really deceiving  i shouldnt call it so  and i needed your sympathy so much and i knew i shouldnt get it unless you thought i was altogether in the right  miss spaulding  you are altogether in the wrong  and its you that ought to apologize to himon your bended knees  how could you offer him money after that  i wonder at you ethel  miss reed  whydont you see nettiei did keep on taking the lessons of him  i did find oil amusingor the oilistand i kept on  of course i had to off there in a farmhouse full of lady boarders and he the only gentleman short of crawfords  strike but hear me henrietta spaulding  what was i to do about the halfdozen lessons i had taken before he told me i should never learn to use oil  was i to offer to pay him for these and not for the rest or was i to treat the whole series as gratuitous  i used to lie awake thinking about it  ive got little tact but i couldnt find any way out of the trouble  it was a boxyes a box of the deepest dye and the whole affair having got to besomething else dont you knowmade it all the worse  and if hed onlyonlybut he didnt not a syllable not a breath  and there i was  i had to offer him the money  and its almost killed methe way he took my offering it and now the way you take it  and its all of a piece  miss reed suddenly snatches her handkerchief from her pocket and buries her face in itoh dearoh dear  ohhu hu hu  miss spaulding relenting  it was awkward  miss reed  awkward  you seem to think that because i carry things off lightly i have no feeling  miss spaulding  you know i dont think that ethel  miss reed pursuing her advantage  i dont know it from you nettie  ive tried and tried to pass it off as a joke and to treat it as something funny but i can tell you its no joke at all  miss spaulding sympathetically  i see dear  miss reed  its not that i care for him   miss spaulding  why of course  miss reed  for i dont in the least  he is horrid every way blunt and rude and horrid  i never cared for him  but i care for myself  he has put me in the position of having done an unkind thingan unladylike thingwhen i was only doing what i had to do why need he have taken it the way he did  why couldnt he have said politely that he couldnt accept the money because he hadnt earned it  even that would have been mortifying enough  but he must go and be so violent and rush off andoh i never could have treated anybody so  miss spaulding  not unless you were very fond of them  miss reed  what  miss spaulding  not unless you were very fond of them  miss reed putting away her handkerchief  oh nonsense nettie  he never cared anything for me or he couldnt have acted so  but no matter for that  he has fixed everything so that it can never be got straightnever in the world  it will just have to remain a hideous mass ofofi dont know what and i have simply got to on withering with despair at the point where i left off  but i dont care  thats one comfort  miss spaulding  i dont believe hell let you wither long ethel  miss reed  hes let me wither for twentyfour hours already  but its nothing to me now how long he lets me wither  im perfectly satisfied to have the affair remain as it is  i am in the right and if he comes i shall refuse to see him  miss spaulding  oh no you wont ethel  miss reed  yes i shall  i shall receive him very coldly  i wont listen to any excuse from him  miss spaulding  oh yes you will ethel  miss reed  no i shall not  if he wishes me to listen he must begin by humbling himself in the dustyes the dust nettie  i wont take anything short of it  i insist that he shall realize that i have suffered  miss spaulding  perhaps he has suffered too  miss reed  oh he suffered  miss spaulding  you know that he was perfectly devoted to you  miss reed  he never said so  miss spaulding  perhaps he didnt dare  miss reed  he dared to be very insolent to me  miss spaulding  and you know you liked him very much  miss reed  i wont let you say that nettie spaulding  i didnt like him  i respected and admired him but i didnt like him  he will come near me but if he does he has to begin bybylet me see what shall i make him begin by doing  she casts up her eyes for inspiration while she leans forward over the register  yes i will he has got to begin by taking that money  miss spaulding  ethel you wouldnt put that affront upon a sensitive and highspirited man  miss reed  wouldnt i  you wait and see miss spaulding  he shall take the money and he shall sign a receipt for it  ill draw up the receipt now so as to have it ready and i shall ask him to sign it the very moment he enters this doorthe very instant  she takes a portfolio from the table near her without rising and writes received from miss ethel reed one hundred and twentyfive dollars in full for twentyfive lessons in oilpainting  therewhen mr oliver ransom has signed this little document he may begin to talk not before she leans back in her chair with an air of pitiless determination  miss spaulding  but ethel you dont mean to make him take money for the lessons he gave you after he told you you couldnt learn anything  miss reed after a moments pause  yes i do  this is to punish him  i dont wish for justice now i wish for vengeance  at first i would have compromised on the six lessons or on none at all if he had behaved nicely but after whats happened i shall insist upon paying him for every lesson so as to make him feel that the whole thing from first to last was a purely business transaction on my part  yes a purelybusinesstransaction  miss spaulding turning to her music  then ive got nothing more to say to you ethel reed  miss reed  i dont say but what after hes taken the money and signed the receipt ill listen to anything else hes got to say very willingly  miss spaulding makes no answer but begins to play with a scientific absorption feeling her way fitfully through the new piece while miss reed seated by the register trifles with the book she has taken from the table    ii    the interior of the room of miss spaulding and miss reed remains in view while the scene discloses on the other side of the partition wall in the same house the bachelor apartment of mr samuel grinnidge  mr grinnidge in his dressinggown and slippers with his pipe in his mouth has the effect of having just come in his friend mr oliver ransom stands at the window staring out into the november weather   grinnidge  how long have you been waiting here  ransom  ten minutesten years  how should i know  grinnidge  well i dont know who else should  get back today  ransom  last night  grinnidge  well take off your coat and pull up to the register and warm your poor feet  he puts his hand out over the register confound it somebodys got the register open in the next room  you see one pipe comes up from the furnace and branches into a v just under the floor and professes to heat both rooms  but it dont there was a fellow in there last winter who used to get all my heat used to go out and leave his register open and id come in here just before dinner and find this place as cold as a barn  we had a running fight of it all winter  the man who got his register open first in the morning got all the heat for the day for it never turned the other way when it started in one direction  used to almost suffocatewarm muggy daysmaintaining my rights  some pianopounder in there this winter it seems  hear  and she hasnt lost any time in learning the trick of the register  what kept you so late in the country  ransom after an absentminded pause  grinnidge i wish you would give me some advice  grinnidge  you can have all you want of it at the market price  ransom  i dont mean your legal advice  grinnidge  im sorry  what have you been doing  ransom  ive been making an ass of myself  grinnidge  wasnt that rather superfluous  ransom  if you please yes  but now it youre capable of listening to me without any further display of your crossexamination wit i should like to tell you how it happened  grinnidge  i will do my best to veil my brilliancy  go on  ransom  i went up to ponkwasset early in september for the foliage  grinnidge  and staid till late in october  there must have been a reason for that  what was her name  foliage  ransom coming up to the corner of the chimneypiece near which his friend sits and talking to him directly over the register  i think youll have to get along without the name for the present  ill tell you by and by  as mr ransom pronounces these words miss reed on her side of the partition lifts her head with a startled air and after a moment of vague circumspection listens keenly  but she was beautiful  she was a blonde and she had the loveliest eyeseyes you know that could be funny or tender just as she chosethe kind of eyes i always liked  miss reed leads forward over the register she had one of those faces that always leave you in doubt whether theyre laughing at you and so keep you in wholesome subjection but you feel certain that theyre good and that if they did hurt you by laughing at you theyd look sorry for you afterward  when she walked you saw what an exquisite creature she was  it always made me mad to think i couldnt paint her walk  grinnidge  i suppose you saw a good deal of her walk  ransom  yes we were off in the woods and fields half the time together  he takes a turn towards the window  miss reed suddenly shutting the register on her side  oh  miss spaulding looking up from her music  what is it ethel  miss reed  nothing nothing iithought it was getting too warm go on dear dont let me interrupt you  after a moment of heroic selfdenial she softly presses the register open with her foot  ransom coming back to the register  it all began in that way  i had the good fortune one day to rescue her from acow  miss reed  oh for shame  miss spaulding desisting from her piano  what is the matter  miss reed clapping the register to  this ridiculous book  but dontdont mind me nettie  breathlessly  gogoon  miss spaulding resumes and again miss reed softly presses the register open  ransom after a pause  the cow was grazing and had no more thought of hooking miss  miss reed  oh i didnt suppose he wouldgo on nettie go on the herosuch a goose  ransom  i drove her away with my campstool and missthe young ladywas as grateful as if i had rescued her from a menagerie of wild animals  i walked home with her to the farm house and the trouble began at once  pantomime of indignant protest and burlesque menace on the part of miss reed  there wasnt another well woman in the house except her friend miss spaulding who was rather old and rather plain  he takes another turn to the window  miss reed  oh  she shuts the register but instantly opens it again  louder nettie  miss spaulding in astonishment  what  miss reed  did i speak  i didnt know it  i   miss spaulding desisting from practice  what is that strange hollow rumbling mumbling kind of noise  miss reed softly closing the register with her foot  i dont hear any strange hollow rumbling mumbling kind of noise  do you hear it now  miss spaulding  no  it was the brighton whistle probably  miss reed  oh very likely  as miss spaulding turns again to her practice miss reed reopens the register and listens again  a little interval of silence ensues while ransom lights a cigarette  grinnidge  so you sought opportunities of rescuing her from other cows  ransom returning  that wasnt necessary  the young lady was so impressed by my behavior that she asked if i would give her some lessons in the use of oil  grinnidge  she thought if she knew how to paint pictures like yours she wouldnt need any one to drive the cows away  ransom  dont be farcical grinnidge  that sort of thing will do with some victim on the witnessstand who cant help himself  of course i said i would and we were off half the time together painting the loveliest and loneliest bits around ponkwasset  it all went on very well till one day i felt bound in conscience to tell her that i didnt think she would ever learn to paint and thatif she was serious about it shed better drop it at once for she was wasting her time  grinnidge getting up to fill his pipe  that was a pleasant thing to do  ransom  i told her that if it amused her to keep on i would be only too glad to give her allthe hints i could but that i oughtnt to encourage her  she seemed a good deal hurt  i fancied at the time that she thought i was tired of having her with me so much  miss reed  oh did you indeed  to miss spaulding who bends an astonished glance upon her from the piano  the man in this book is the most conceited creature nettie  play chordssomething very subduedah  miss spaulding  what are you talking about ethel  ransom  that was at night but the next day she came up smiling and said that if i didnt mind she would keep onfor amusement she wasnt a bit discouraged  miss reed  ohgo on nettie dont let my outbursts interrupt you  ransom  i used to fancy sometimes that she was a little sweet on me  miss reed  you wretchoh scales nettie  play scales  miss spaulding  ethel reed are you crazy  ransom after a thoughtful moment  well so it went on for the next seven or eight weeks   when we werent sketching in the meadows or on the mountainside or in the old punt on the pond we were walking up and down the farmhouse piazza together  she used to read to me when i was at work  she had a heavenly voice grinnidge  miss reed  oh you silly silly thingreally this book makes me sick nettie  ransom  well the long and the short of it was i was hithard and i lost all courage  you know how i am grinnidge  miss reed softly  oh poor fellow  ransom  so i let the time go by and at the end i hadnt said anything  miss reed  no sir  you hadnt  miss spaulding gradually ceases to play and fixes her attention wholly upon miss reed who bends forward over the register with an intensely excited face  ransom  then something happened that made me glad for twentyfour hours at least that i hadnt spoken  she sent me the money for twentyfive lessons  imagine how i felt grinnidge  what could i suppose but that she had been quietly biding her time and storing up her resentment for my having told her she couldnt learn to paint till she could pay me back with interest in one supreme insult  miss reed in a low voice  oh how could you think such a cruel vulgar thing  miss spaulding leaves the piano and softly approaches her where she has sunk on her knees beside the register  ransom  it was tantamount to telling me that she had been amusing herself with me instead of my lessons  it remanded our whole association which i had got to thinking so romantic to the relation of teacher and pupil  it was a snuba heartless killing snub and i couldnt see it in any other light  ransom walks away to the window and looks out  miss reed flinging herself backward from the register and hiding her face in her hands  oh it wasnt it wasnt it wasnt  how could you think so  miss spaulding rushing forward and catching her friend in her arms what is the matter with you ethel reed  what are you doing here over the register  are you trying to suffocate yourself  have you taken leave of your senses  grinnidge  our fair friend on the other side of the wall seems to be on the rampage  miss spaulding shutting the register with a violent clash  ugh how hot it is here  grinnidge  doesnt like your conversation apparently  miss reed frantically pressing forward to open the register  oh dont shut it nettie dear  if you do i shall die  doont shut the register  miss spaulding  dont shut it  why weve got all the heat of the furnace in the room now  surely you dont want any more  miss reed  no no not any more  butbutoh dear what shall i do  she still struggles in the embrace of her friend  grinnidge remaining quietly at the register while ransom walks away to the window  well  what did you do  miss reed  there there  theyre commencing again  do open it nettie  i will have it open  she wrenches herself free and dashes the register open  grinnidge  ah shes opened it again  miss reed in a stagewhisper  thats the other one  ransom from the window  do  ill tell you what i did  miss reed  thats olmr ransom  and oh i cant make out what hes saying  he must have gone away to the other side of the room and its at the most important point  miss spaulding in an awful undertone  was that the hollow rumbling i heard  and have you been listening at the register to what theyve been saying  o ethel  miss reed  i havent been listening exactly  miss spaulding  you have  you have been eavesdropping  miss reed  eavesdropping is listening through a keyhole or around a corner  this is very different  besides its oliver and hes been talking about me  hark  she clutches her friends hand where they have crouched upon the floor together and pulls her forward to the register  oh dear how hot it is  i wish they would cut off the heat down below  grinnidge smoking peacefully through the silence which his friend has absentmindedly let follow upon his last words  well you seem disposed to take your time about it  ransom  about what  oh yes  well   miss reed  sh  listen  miss spaulding  i wont listen  its shameful  its wicked  i dont see how you can do it ethel  she remains however kneeling near the register and she involuntarily inclines a little more toward it  ransom  it isnt a thing that i care to shout from the house tops  he returns from the window to the chimneypiece  i wrote the rudest kind of note and sent back her letter and her money in it  she had said that she hoped our acquaintance was not to end with the summer but that we might sometimes meet in boston and i answered that our acquaintance had ended already and that i should be sorry to meet her anywhere again  grinnidge  well if you wanted to make an ass of yourself you did it pretty completely  miss reed whispering  how witty he is  those men are always so humorous with each other  ransom  yes i didnt do it by halves  miss reed whispering  oh thats funny too  grinnidge  it didnt occur to you that she might feel bound to pay you for the first halfdozen and was embarrassed how to offer to pay for them alone  miss reed  how he does go to the heart of the matter  she presses miss spauldings hand in an ecstasy of approval  ransom  yes it didafterward  miss reed in a tender murmur  oh poor oliver  ransom  and it occurred to me that she was perfectly right in the whole affair  miss reed  oh how generous how noble  ransom  i had had a thousand opportunities and i hadnt been man enough to tell her that i was in love with her  miss reed  how can he say it right out so bluntly  but if its true   ransom  i couldnt speak  i was afraid of putting an end to the affairof frightening herdisgusting her  miss reed  oh how little they know us nettie  ransom  she seemed so much above me in every wayso sensitive so refined so gentle so good so angelic  miss reed  there  now do you call it eavesdropping  if listeners never hear any good of themselves what do you say to that  it proves that i havent been listening  miss spaulding  sh  theyre saying something else  ransom  but all thats neither here nor there  i can see now that under the circumstances she couldnt as a lady have acted otherwise than she did  she was forced to treat our whole acquaintance as a business matter and i had forced her to do it  miss reed  you had you poor thing  grinnidge  well what do you intend to do about it  ransom  well   miss reed  sh  miss spaulding  sh  ransom  thats what i want to submit to you grinnidge  i must see her  grinnidge  yes  im glad i mustnt  miss reed stifling a laugh on miss spauldings shoulder  theyre actually afraid of us nettie  ransom  see her and go down in the dust  miss reed  my very words  ransom  i have been trying to think what was the very humblest pie i could eat by way of penance and it appears to me that i had better begin by saying that i have come to ask her for the money i refused  miss reed enraptured  oh doesnt it seem just likelike inspiration nettie  miss spaulding  sh  be quiet do  youll frighten them away  grinnidge  and then what  ransom  what then  i dont know what then  but it appears to me that as a gentleman ive got nothing to do with the result  all that ive got to do is to submit to my fate whatever it is  miss reed breathlessly  what princely courage  what delicate magnanimity  oh he neednt have the least fear  if i could only tell him that  grinnidge after an interval of meditative smoking  yes i guess thats the best thing you can do  it will strike her fancy if shes an imaginative girl and shell think you a fine fellow  miss reed  oh the horrid thing  grinnidge  if you humble yourself to a woman at all do it thoroughly  if you go halfway down shell be tempted to push you the rest of the way  if you flatten out at her feet to begin with ten to one but she will pick you up  ransom  yes that was my idea  miss reed  oh was it indeed  well  ransom  but ive nothing to do with her picking me up or pushing me down  all that ive got to do is to go and surrender myself  grinnidge  yes  well i guess you cant go too soon  i like your company but i advise you as a friend not to lose time  where does she live  ransom  thats the remarkable part of it  she lives in this house  miss reed and miss spaulding in subdued chorus  oh  grinnidge taking his pipe out of his mouth in astonishment  no  ransom  i just came in here to give my good resolutions a rest while i was screwing my courage up to ask for her  miss reed  dont you think hes very humorous  give his good resolutions a rest  thats the way he always talks  miss spaulding  sh  grinnidge  you said you came for my advice  ransom  so i did  but i didnt promise to act upon it  well  he goes toward the door  grinnidge without troubling himself to rise  well good luck to you  miss reed  how droll they are with each other  dont you like to hear them talk  oh i could listen all day  grinnidge calling after ransom  you havent told me your ducks name  miss reed  is that what they call us

iii    scene  miss reed opens the door and receives mr ransom with well affected surprise and state suffering him to stand awkwardly on the threshold for a moment   she coldly  ohmr ransom  he abruptly  ive come   she  wont you come in  he advancing a few paces into the room  ive come   she indicating a chair  will you sit down  he  i must stand for the present  ive come to ask you for that money miss reed which i refused yesterday in terms that i blush to think of  i was altogether and wholly in the wrong and im ready to offer any imaginable apology or reparation  im ready to take the money and to sign a receipt and then to be dismissed with whatever ignominy you please  i deserve anythingeverything  she  the money  excuse me i dont knowim afraid that im not prepared to pay you the whole sum today  he hastily  oh no matter no matter  i dont care for the money now  i merely wish toto assure you that i thought you were perfectly right in offering it and toto   she  what  he  nothing  that isahah   she  its extremely embarrassing to have people refuse their money when its offered them and then come the next day for it when perhaps it isnt so convenient to pay itvery embarrassing  he hotly  but i tell you i dont want the money  i never wanted it and wouldnt take it on any account  she  oh  i thought you said you came to get it  he  i saidi didnt sayi meantthat isahihe stops open mouthed  she quietly  i could give you part of the money now  he  oh whatever you like its indifferent   she  please sit down while i write a receipt  she places herself deliberately at the table and opens her portfolio  i will pay you now mr ransom for the first six lessons you gave methe ones before you told me that i could never learn to do anything  he sinking mechanically into the chair she indicates  oh just as you like  he looks up at the ceiling in hopeless bewilderment while she writes  she blotting the paper  there  and now let me offer you a little piece of advice mr ransom which may be useful to you in taking pupils hereafter  he bursting out  i never take pupils  she  never take pupils  i dont understand  you took me  he confusedly  i took youyes  you seemed to wishyou seemed the case was peculiarpeculiar circumstances  she with severity  may i ask why the circumstances were peculiar i saw nothing peculiar about the circumstances  it seemed to me it was a very simple matter  i told you that i had always had a great curiosity to see whether i could use oil paints and i asked you a very plain question whether you would let me study with you  didnt i  he  yes  she  was there anything wronganything queer about my asking you  he  no no  not at allnot in the least  she  didnt you wish me to take the lessons of you  if you didnt it wasnt kind of you to let me  he  oh i was perfectly willingvery glad indeed very much so certainly  she  if it wasnt your custom to take pupils you ought to have told me and i wouldnt have forced myself upon you  he desperately  it wasnt forcing yourself upon me  the lord knows how humbly grateful i was  it was like a hope of heaven  she  really mr ransom this is very strange talk  what am i to understand by it  why should you be grateful to teach me  why should giving me lessons be like a hope of heaven  he  oh i will tell you  she  well  he after a moment of agony  because to be with you   she  yes  he  because i wished to be with you  becausethose days in the woods when you read and i   she  painted on my pictures   he  were the happiest of my life  becausei loved you  she  mr ransom  he  yes i must tell you so  i loved you i love you still  i shall always love you no matter what   she  you forget yourself mr ransom  has there been anything in my mannerconductto justify you in using such language to me  he  nono   she  did you suppose that because i first took lessons of you from froman enthusiasm for art and then continued them forfor amusement that i wished you to make love to me  he  no i never supposed such a thing  im incapable of it  i beseech you to believe that no one could have more respect reverencehe twirls his hat between his hands and casts an imploring glance at her  she  oh respectreverence  i know what they mean in the mouths of men  if you respected if you reverenced me could you dare to tell me after my unguarded trust of you during the past months that you had been all the time secretly in love with me  he plucking up a little courage  i dont see that the three things are incompatible  she  oh then you acknowledge that you did presume upon something you thought you saw in me to tell me that you loved me and that you were in love with me all the time  he contritely  i have no right to suppose that you encouraged me and yeti cant deny it nowi was in love with you all the time  she  and you never said a word to let me believe that you had any such feeling toward me  he  ii   she  you would have parted from me without a syllable to suggest itperhaps parted from me forever  after a pause of silent humiliation for him  do you call that brave or generous  do you call it manlysupposing as you hoped that i had any such feeling  he  no it was cowardly it was mean it was unmanly  i see it now but i will spend my life in repairing the wrong if you will only let me  he impetuously advances some paces toward her and then stops arrested by her irresponsive attitude  she with a light sigh and looking down at the paper which she has continued to hold between her hands  there was a timea moment when i might have answered as you wish  he  oh then there will be again  if you have changed once you may change once more  let me hope that some timeany time dearest   she quenching him with a look  mr ransom i shall never change toward you  you confess that you had your opportunity and that you despised it  he  oh not despised it  she  neglected it  he  not wilfullyno  i confess that i was stupidly vilely pusillanpusillanillani   she  monsly   he  thanksmously unworthy of it but i didnt despise it i didnt neglect it and if you will only let me show by a lifetime of devotion how dearly and truly i have loved you from the first moment i drove that cow away   she  mr ransom i have told you that i should never change toward you  that cow was nothing when weighed in the balance against your being willing to leave a poor girl whom you supposed interested in you and to whom you had paid the most marked attention without a word to show her that you cared for her  what is a cow or a whole herd of cows as compared with obliging a young lady to offer you money that you hadnt earned and then savagely flinging it back in her face  a yoke of oxen would be nothingor a mad bull  he  oh i acknowledge it  i confess it  she  and you own that i am right in refusing to listen to you now  he desolately  yes yes  she  it seems that you gave me lessons in order to be with me and if possible to interest me in you and then you were going away without a word  he with a groan  it was only because i was afraid to speak  she  oh is that any excuse  he  no none  she  a man ought always to have courage  after a pause in which he stands before her with bowed head  then theres nothing for me but to give you this money  he with sudden energy  this is too much  i   she offering him the banknotes  no it is the exact sum  i counted it very carefully  he  i wont take it i cant  ill never take it  she standing with the money in her outstretched hand  i have your word as a gentleman that you will take it  he gasping  oh welli will take iti willhe clutches the money and rushes toward the door  goodevening ahgoodby   she calling after him  the receipt mr ransom  please sign this receipt  she waves the paper in the air  he  oh yes certainly  where is itwhatwhichhe rushes back to her and seizing the receipt feels blindly about for the pen and ink  where shall i sign  she  read it first  he  oh its allall right   she  i insist upon your reading it  its a business transaction read it aloud  he desperately  well well  he reads  received from miss ethel reed in full for twentyfive lessons in oilpainting one hundred and twentyfive dollars and her hand heart and dearest love forever  he looks up at her  ethel  she smiling  sign it sign it  he catching her in his arms and kissing her  oh yeshere  she pulling a little away from him and laughing  oh oh  i only wanted one signature  twenty autographs are too many unless youll let me trade them off as the collectors do  he  no keep them all  i couldnt think of letting any one else have them  one more  she  no its quite enough  she frees herself and retires beyond the table  this unexpected affection   he  is it unexpectedseriously  she  what do you mean  he  oh nothing  she  yes tell me  he  i hopedi thoughtperhapsthat you might have been prepared for some such demonstration on my part  she  and why did you thinkhopeperhapsthat mr ransom may i ask  he  if i hadnt how should i have dared to speak  she  dared  you were obliged to speak  well since its all over i dont mind saying that i did have some slight apprehensions that something in the way of a declaration might be extorted from you  he  extorted  oh  he makes an impassioned rush toward her  she keeping the table between them  no no  he  oh i merely wished to ask why you chose to make me suffer so after i had come to the point  she  ask it across the table then  after a moments reflection i made you sufferi made you sufferso that you might have a realizing sense of what you had made me suffer  he enraptured by this confession  oh you angel  she with tender magnanimity  no only a womana poor trusting foolish woman  she permits him to surround the table with imaginable results  then with her head on his shoulder  youll never let me regret it will you darling  youll never oblige me to punish you again dearest will you  oh it hurt me far worse to see your pain than it did you totofeel it  on the other side of the partition mr grinnidges pipe falls from his lips parted in slumber and shivers to atoms on the register  oh  she flies at the register with a shriek of dismay and is about to close it that wretch has been listening and has heard every word  he preventing her  what wretch  where  she  dont you hear him mumbling and grumbling there  grinnidge  well i swear  cash value of twentyfive dollars and untold toil in coloring it  ransom listening with an air of mystification  whos that  she  gummidge grimmidgewhatever you called him  oh  she arrests herself in consternation  now i have done it  he  done what  she  ohnothing  he  i dont understand  do you mean to say that my friend grinnidges room is on the other aide of the wall and that you can hear him talk through the register  she preserves the silence of abject terror  he stoops over the register and calls down it  grinnidge  hallo  grinnidge  hallo yourself  ransom to miss reed  sounds like the ghostly squeak of the phonograph  to grinnidge  whats the trouble  grinnidge  smashed my pipe  dozed off and let it drop on this infernal register  ransom turning from the register with impressive deliberation miss reed may i ask how you came to know that his name was gummidge or grimmidge or whatever i called him  she  oh dearest i cant tell you  oryes i had better impulsively  i will judge you by myself  i could forgive you anything  he doubtfully  oh could you  she  everything  i hadi had better make a clean breast of it yes i had  though i dont like to  ii listened  he  listened  she  through the register totowhatyouwere saying before youcame in here  her head droops  he  then you heard everything  she  kill me but dont look so at me  it was accidental at first indeed it was and then i recognized your voice and then i knew you were talking about me and i had so much at stake and i did love you so dearly  you will forgive me darling  it wasnt as if i were listening with any bad motive  he taking her in his arms  forgive you  of course i do  but you must change this room at once ethel you see you hear everything on the other side too  she  oh not if you whisper on this  you couldnt hear us  at a dubious expression of his  you didnt hear us  if you did i can never forgive you  he  it was accidental at firstindeed it was and then i recognized your voice and then i knew you were talking about me and i had so much at stake and i did love you so dearly  she  all that has nothing whatever to do with it  how much did you hear  he with exemplary meekness  only what you were saying before grinnidge came in  you didnt whisper then  i had to wait there for him while   she  while you were giving your good resolutions a rest  he  while i was giving my good resolutions a rest  she  and that accounts for your determination to humble yourself so  he  it seemed perfectly providential that i should have known just what conditions you were going to exact of me  she  oh dont make light of it  i can tell you its a very serious matter  he  it was very serious for me when you didnt meet my self abasement as you had led me to expect you would  she  dont make fun  im trying to think whether i can forgive you  he with insinuation  dont you believe you could think better if you put your head on my shoulder  she  nonsense  then i should forgive you without thinking  after a season of reflection  no i cant forgive you  i never could forgive eavesdropping  its too low  he in astonishment  why you did it yourself  she  but you began it  besides its very different for a man women are weak poor helpless creatures  they have to use finesse but a man should be above it  he  you said you could forgive me anything  she  ah but i didnt know what youd been doing  he with pensive resignation and a feint of going  then i suppose its all over between us  she relenting  if you could think of any reason why i should forgive you   he  i cant  she after consideration  do you suppose mr grumage or grimidge heard too  he  no grinnidge is a very highprincipled fellow and wouldnt listen besides he wasnt there you know  she  well then i will forgive you on these grounds  he instantly catches her to his heart  but these alone remember  he rapturously  oh on any  she tenderly  and youll always be devoted  and nice  and not try to provoke me  or neglect me  or anything  he  always  never  she  oh you dear sweet simple old thinghow i do love you  grinnidge who has been listening attentively to every word at the register at his side  ransom if you dont want me to go stark mad shut the register  ransom about to comply  oh poor old man  i forgot it was open  miss reed preventing him  no  if he has been vile enough to listen at a register let him suffer  come sit down here and ill tell you just when i began to care for you  it was long before the cow  do you remember that first morning after you arrivedshe drags him close to the register so that every word may tell upon the envious grinnidge on whose manifestations of acute despair a rapid curtain descends
