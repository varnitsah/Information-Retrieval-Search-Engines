     these memories and portraits  ss “ludgate hill”       within sight of cape race     note   this volume of papers unconnected as they are it will be better to read through from the beginning rather than dip into at random  a certain thread of meaning binds them  memories of childhood and youth portraits of those who have gone before us in the battle—taken together they build up a face that “i have loved long since and lost awhile” the face of what was once myself  this has come by accident i had no design at first to be autobiographical i was but led away by the charm of beloved memories and by regret for the irrevocable dead and when my own young face which is a face of the dead also began to appear in the well as by a kind of magic i was the first to be surprised at the occurrence  my grandfather the pious child my father the idle eager sentimental youth i have thus unconsciously exposed  of their descendant the person of today i wish to keep the secret not because i love him better but because with him i am still in a business partnership and cannot divide interests  of the papers which make up the volume some have appeared already in the cornhill longman’s scribner the english illustrated the magazine of art the contemporary review three are here in print for the first time and two others have enjoyed only what may he regarded as a private circulation

mr hillebrand may well have set people thinking on the divisions of races and nations  such thoughts should arise with particular congruity and force to inhabitants of that united kingdom peopled from so many different stocks babbling so many different dialects and offering in its extent such singular contrasts from the busiest overpopulation to the unkindliest desert from the black country to the moor of rannoch  it is not only when we cross the seas that we go abroad there are foreign parts of england and the race that has conquered so wide an empire has not yet managed to assimilate the islands whence she sprang  ireland wales and the scottish mountains still cling in part to their old gaelic speech  it was but the other day that english triumphed in cornwall and they still show in mousehole on st michael’s bay the house of the last cornishspeaking woman  english itself which will now frank the traveller through the most of north america through the greater south sea islands in india along much of the coast of africa and in the ports of china and japan is still to be heard in its home country in half a hundred varying stages of transition  you may go all over the states and—setting aside the actual intrusion and influence of foreigners negro french or chinese—you shall scarce meet with so marked a difference of accent as in the forty miles between edinburgh and glasgow or of dialect as in the hundred miles between edinburgh and aberdeen  book english has gone round the world but at home we still preserve the racy idioms of our fathers and every county in some parts every dale has its own quality of speech vocal or verbal  in like manner local custom and prejudice even local religion and local law linger on into the latter end of the nineteenth century—imperia in imperio foreign things at home  in spite of these promptings to reflection ignorance of his neighbours is the character of the typical john bull  his is a domineering nature steady in fight imperious to command but neither curious nor quick about the life of others  in french colonies and still more in the dutch i have read that there is an immediate and lively contact between the dominant and the dominated race that a certain sympathy is begotten or at the least a transfusion of prejudices making life easier for both but the englishman sits apart bursting with pride and ignorance  he figures among his vassals in the hour of peace with the same disdainful air that led him on to victory  a passing enthusiasm for some foreign art or fashion may deceive the world it cannot impose upon his intimates  he may be amused by a foreigner as by a monkey but he will never condescend to study him with any patience  miss bird an authoress with whom i profess myself in love declares all the viands of japan to be uneatable—a staggering pretension  so when the prince of wales’s marriage was celebrated at mentone by a dinner to the mentonese it was proposed to give them solid english fare—roast beef and plum pudding and no tomfoolery  here we have either pole of the britannic folly  we will not eat the food of any foreigner nor when we have the chance will we suffer him to eat of it himself  the same spirit inspired miss bird’s american missionaries who had come thousands of miles to change the faith of japan and openly professed their ignorance of the religions they were trying to supplant  i quote an american in this connection without scruple  uncle sam is better than john bull but he is tarred with the english stick  for mr grant white the states are the new england states and nothing more  he wonders at the amount of drinking in london let him try san francisco he wittily reproves english ignorance as to the status of women in america but has he not himself forgotten wyoming  the name yankee of which he is so tenacious is used over the most of the great union as a term of reproach  the yankee states of which he is so staunch a subject are but a drop in the bucket  and we find in his book a vast virgin ignorance of the life and prospects of america every view partial parochial not raised to the horizon the moral feeling proper at the largest to a clique of states and the whole scope and atmosphere not american but merely yankee  i will go far beyond him in reprobating the assumption and the incivility of my countryfolk to their cousins from beyond the sea i grill in my blood over the silly rudeness of our newspaper articles and i do not know where to look when i find myself in company with an american and see my countrymen unbending to him as to a performing dog  but in the case of mr grant white example were better than precept  wyoming is after all more readily accessible to mr white than boston to the english and the new england selfsufficiency no better justified than the britannic  it is so perhaps in all countries perhaps in all men are most ignorant of the foreigners at home  john bull is ignorant of the states he is probably ignorant of india but considering his opportunities he is far more ignorant of countries nearer his own door  there is one country for instance—its frontier not so far from london its people closely akin its language the same in all essentials with the english—of which i will go bail he knows nothing  his ignorance of the sister kingdom cannot be described it can only be illustrated by anecdote  i once travelled with a man of plausible manners and good intelligence—a university man as the phrase goes—a man besides who had taken his degree in life and knew a thing or two about the age we live in  we were deep in talk whirling between peterborough and london among other things he began to describe some piece of legal injustice he had recently encountered and i observed in my innocence that things were not so in scotland  “i beg your pardon” said he “this is a matter of law” he had never heard of the scots law nor did he choose to be informed the law was the same for the whole country he told me roundly every child knew that  at last to settle matters i explained to him that i was a member of a scottish legal body and had stood the brunt of an examination in the very law in question  thereupon he looked me for a moment full in the face and dropped the conversation  this is a monstrous instance if you like but it does not stand alone in the experience of scots  england and scotland differ indeed in law in history in religion in education and in the very look of nature and men’s faces not always widely but always trenchantly  many particulars that struck mr grant white a yankee struck me a scot no less forcibly he and i felt ourselves foreigners on many common provocations  a scotchman may tramp the better part of europe and the united states and never again receive so vivid an impression of foreign travel and strange lands and manners as on his first excursion into england  the change from a hilly to a level country strikes him with delighted wonder  along the flat horizon there arise the frequent venerable towers of churches  he sees at the end of airy vistas the revolution of the windmill sails  he may go where he pleases in the future he may see alps and pyramids and lions but it will be hard to beat the pleasure of that moment  there are indeed few merrier spectacles than that of many windmills bickering together in a fresh breeze over a woody country their halting alacrity of movement their pleasant business making bread all day with uncouth gesticulations their air gigantically human as of a creature half alive put a spirit of romance into the tamest landscape  when the scotch child sees them first he falls immediately in love and from that time forward windmills keep turning in his dreams  and so in their degree with every feature of the life and landscape  the warm habitable age of towns and hamlets the green settled ancient look of the country the lush hedgerows stiles and privy pathways in the fields the sluggish brimming rivers chalk and smockfrocks chimes of bells and the rapid pertlysounding english speech—they are all new to the curiosity they are all set to english airs in the child’s story that he tells himself at night  the sharp edge of novelty wears off the feeling is scotched but i doubt whether it is ever killed  rather it keeps returning ever the more rarely and strangely and even in scenes to which you have been long accustomed suddenly awakes and gives a relish to enjoyment or heightens the sense of isolation  one thing especially continues unfamiliar to the scotchman’s eye—the domestic architecture the look of streets and buildings the quaint venerable age of many and the thin walls and warm colouring of all  we have in scotland far fewer ancient buildings above all in country places and those that we have are all of hewn or harled masonry  wood has been sparingly used in their construction the windowframes are sunken in the wall not flat to the front as in england the roofs are steeperpitched even a hill farm will have a massy square cold and permanent appearance  english houses in comparison have the look of cardboard toys such as a puff might shatter  and to this the scotchman never becomes used  his eye can never rest consciously on one of these brick houses—rickles of brick as he might call them—or on one of these flatchested streets but he is instantly reminded where he is and instantly travels back in fancy to his home  “this is no my ain house i ken by the biggin’ o’t”  and yet perhaps it is his own bought with his own money the key of it long polished in his pocket but it has not yet and never will be thoroughly adopted by his imagination nor does he cease to remember that in the whole length and breadth of his native country there was no building even distantly resembling it  but it is not alone in scenery and architecture that we count england foreign  the constitution of society the very pillars of the empire surprise and even pain us  the dull neglected peasant sunk in matter insolent gross and servile makes a startling contrast with our own longlegged longheaded thoughtful biblequoting ploughman  a week or two in such a place as suffolk leaves the scotchman gasping  it seems incredible that within the boundaries of his own island a class should have been thus forgotten  even the educated and intelligent who hold our own opinions and speak in our own words yet seem to hold them with a difference or from another reason and to speak on all things with less interest and conviction  the first shock of english society is like a cold plunge  it is possible that the scot comes looking for too much and to be sure his first experiment will be in the wrong direction  yet surely his complaint is grounded surely the speech of englishmen is too often lacking in generous ardour the better part of the man too often withheld from the social commerce and the contact of mind with mind evaded as with terror  a scotch peasant will talk more liberally out of his own experience  he will not put you by with conversational counters and small jests he will give you the best of himself like one interested in life and man’s chief end  a scotchman is vain interested in himself and others eager for sympathy setting forth his thoughts and experience in the best light  the egoism of the englishman is selfcontained  he does not seek to proselytise  he takes no interest in scotland or the scotch and what is the unkindest cut of all he does not care to justify his indifference  give him the wages of going on and being an englishman that is all he asks and in the meantime while you continue to associate he would rather not be reminded of your baser origin  compared with the grand treelike selfsufficiency of his demeanour the vanity and curiosity of the scot seem uneasy vulgar and immodest  that you should continually try to establish human and serious relations that you should actually feel an interest in john bull and desire and invite a return of interest from him may argue something more awake and lively in your mind but it still puts you in the attitude of a suitor and a poor relation  thus even the lowest class of the educated english towers over a scotchman by the head and shoulders  different indeed is the atmosphere in which scotch and english youth begin to look about them come to themselves in life and gather up those first apprehensions which are the material of future thought and to a great extent the rule of future conduct  i have been to school in both countries and i found in the boys of the north something at once rougher and more tender at once more reserve and more expansion a greater habitual distance chequered by glimpses of a nearer intimacy and on the whole wider extremes of temperament and sensibility  the boy of the south seems more wholesome but less thoughtful he gives himself to games as to a business striving to excel but is not readily transported by imagination the type remains with me as cleaner in mind and body more active fonder of eating endowed with a lesser and a less romantic sense of life and of the future and more immersed in present circumstances  and certainly for one thing english boys are younger for their age  sabbath observance makes a series of grim and perhaps serviceable pauses in the tenor of scotch boyhood—days of great stillness and solitude for the rebellious mind when in the dearth of books and play and in the intervals of studying the shorter catechism the intellect and senses prey upon and test each other  the typical english sunday with the huge midday dinner and the plethoric afternoon leads perhaps to different results  about the very cradle of the scot there goes a hum of metaphysical divinity and the whole of two divergent systems is summed up not merely speciously in the two first questions of the rival catechisms the english tritely inquiring “what is your name” the scottish striking at the very roots of life with “what is the chief end of man” and answering nobly if obscurely “to glorify god and to enjoy him for ever”  i do not wish to make an idol of the shorter catechism but the fact of such a question being asked opens to us scotch a great field of speculation and the fact that it is asked of all of us from the peer to the ploughboy binds us more nearly together  no englishman of byron’s age character and history would have had patience for long theological discussions on the way to fight for greece but the daft gordon blood and the aberdonian schooldays kept their influence to the end  we have spoken of the material conditions nor need much more be said of these of the land lying everywhere more exposed of the wind always louder and bleaker of the black roaring winters of the gloom of highlying old stone cities imminent on the windy seaboard compared with the level streets the warm colouring of the brick the domestic quaintness of the architecture among which english children begin to grow up and come to themselves in life  as the stage of the university approaches the contrast becomes more express  the english lad goes to oxford or cambridge there in an ideal world of gardens to lead a semiscenic life costumed disciplined and drilled by proctors  nor is this to be regarded merely as a stage of education it is a piece of privilege besides and a step that separates him further from the bulk of his compatriots  at an earlier age the scottish lad begins his greatly different experience of crowded classrooms of a gaunt quadrangle of a bell hourly booming over the traffic of the city to recall him from the publichouse where he has been lunching or the streets where he has been wandering fancyfree  his college life has little of restraint and nothing of necessary gentility  he will find no quiet clique of the exclusive studious and cultured no rotten borough of the arts  all classes rub shoulders on the greasy benches  the raffish young gentleman in gloves must measure his scholarship with the plain clownish laddie from the parish school  they separate at the session’s end one to smoke cigars about a wateringplace the other to resume the labours of the field beside his peasant family  the first muster of a college class in scotland is a scene of curious and painful interest so many lads fresh from the heather hang round the stove in cloddish embarrassment ruffled by the presence of their smarter comrades and afraid of the sound of their own rustic voices  it was in these early days i think that professor blackie won the affection of his pupils putting these uncouth umbrageous students at their ease with ready human geniality thus at least we have a healthy democratic atmosphere to breathe in while at work even when there is no cordiality there is always a juxtaposition of the different classes and in the competition of study the intellectual power of each is plainly demonstrated to the other  our tasks ended we of the north go forth as freemen into the humming lamplit city  at five o’clock you may see the last of us hiving from the college gates in the glare of the shop windows under the green glimmer of the winter sunset  the frost tingles in our blood no proctor lies in wait to intercept us till the bell sounds again we are the masters of the world and some portion of our lives is always saturday la trêve de dieu  nor must we omit the sense of the nature of his country and his country’s history gradually growing in the child’s mind from story and from observation  a scottish child hears much of shipwreck outlying iron skerries pitiless breakers and great sealights much of heathery mountains wild clans and hunted covenanters  breaths come to him in song of the distant cheviots and the ring of foraying hoofs  he glories in his hardfisted forefathers of the iron girdle and the handful of oatmeal who rode so swiftly and lived so sparely on their raids poverty illluck enterprise and constant resolution are the fibres of the legend of his country’s history  the heroes and kings of scotland have been tragically fated the most marking incidents in scottish history—flodden darien or the fortyfive—were still either failures or defeats and the fall of wallace and the repeated reverses of the bruce combine with the very smallness of the country to teach rather a moral than a material criterion for life  britain is altogether small the mere taproot of her extended empire scotland again which alone the scottish boy adopts in his imagination is but a little part of that and avowedly cold sterile and unpopulous  it is not so for nothing  i once seemed to have perceived in an american boy a greater readiness of sympathy for lands that are great and rich and growing like his own it proved to be quite otherwise a mere dumb piece of boyish romance that i had lacked penetration to divine  but the error serves the purpose of my argument for i am sure at least that the heart of young scotland will be always touched more nearly by paucity of number and spartan poverty of life  so we may argue and yet the difference is not explained  that shorter catechism which i took as being so typical of scotland was yet composed in the city of westminster  the division of races is more sharply marked within the borders of scotland itself than between the countries galloway and buchan lothian and lochaber are like foreign parts yet you may choose a man from any of them and ten to one he shall prove to have the headmark of a scot  a century and a half ago the highlander wore a different costume spoke a different language worshipped in another church held different morals and obeyed a different social constitution from his fellowcountrymen either of the south or north even the english it is recorded did not loathe the highlander and the highland costume as they were loathed by the remainder of the scotch yet the highlander felt himself a scot  he would willingly raid into the scotch lowlands but his courage failed him at the border and he regarded england as a perilous unhomely land  when the black watch after years of foreign service returned to scotland veterans leaped out and kissed the earth at port patrick  they had been in ireland stationed among men of their own race and language where they were well liked and treated with affection but it was the soil of galloway that they kissed at the extreme end of the hostile lowlands among a people who did not understand their speech and who had hated harried and hanged them since the dawn of history  last and perhaps most curious the sons of chieftains were often educated on the continent of europe they went abroad speaking gaelic they returned speaking not english but the broad dialect of scotland  now what idea had they in their minds when they thus in thought identified themselves with their ancestral enemies  what was the sense in which they were scotch and not english or scotch and not irish  can a bare name be thus influential on the minds and affections of men and a political aggregation blind them to the nature of facts  the story of the austrian empire would seem to answer no the far more galling business of ireland clenches the negative from nearer home  is it common education common morals a common language or a common faith that join men into nations  there were practically none of these in the case we are considering  the fact remains in spite of the difference of blood and language the lowlander feels himself the sentimental countryman of the highlander when they meet abroad they fall upon each other’s necks in spirit even at home there is a kind of clannish intimacy in their talk  but from his compatriot in the south the lowlander stands consciously apart  he has had a different training he obeys different laws he makes his will in other terms is otherwise divorced and married his eyes are not at home in an english landscape or with english houses his ear continues to remark the english speech and even though his tongue acquire the southern knack he will still have a strong scotch accent of the mind     chapter ii some college memories 15   i am asked to write something it is not specifically stated what to the profit and glory of my alma mater and the fact is i seem to be in very nearly the same case with those who addressed me for while i am willing enough to write something i know not what to write  only one point i see that if i am to write at all it should be of the university itself and my own days under its shadow of the things that are still the same and of those that are already changed such talk in short as would pass naturally between a student of today and one of yesterday supposing them to meet and grow confidential  the generations pass away swiftly enough on the high seas of life more swiftly still in the little bubbling backwater of the quadrangle so that we see there on a scale startlingly diminished the flight of time and the succession of men  i looked for my name the other day in last year’s casebook of the speculative  naturally enough i looked for it near the end it was not there nor yet in the next column so that i began to think it had been dropped at press and when at last i found it mounted on the shoulders of so many successors and looking in that posture like the name of a man of ninety i was conscious of some of the dignity of years  this kind of dignity of temporal precession is likely with prolonged life to become more familiar possibly less welcome but i felt it strongly then it is strongly on me now and i am the more emboldened to speak with my successors in the tone of a parent and a praiser of things past  for indeed that which they attend is but a fallen university it has doubtless some remains of good for human institutions decline by gradual stages but decline in spite of all seeming embellishments it does and what is perhaps more singular began to do so when i ceased to be a student  thus by an odd chance i had the very last of the very best of alma mater the same thing i hear which makes it the more strange had previously happened to my father and if they are good and do not die something not at all unsimilar will be found in time to have befallen my successors of today  of the specific points of change of advantage in the past of shortcoming in the present i must own that on a near examination they look wondrous cloudy  the chief and far the most lamentable change is the absence of a certain lean ugly idle unpopular student whose presence was for me the gist and heart of the whole matter whose changing humours fine occasional purposes of good flinching acceptance of evil shiverings on wet eastwindy morning journeys up to class infinite yawnings during lecture and unquenchable gusto in the delights of truantry made up the sunshine and shadow of my college life  you cannot fancy what you missed in missing him his virtues i make sure are inconceivable to his successors just as they were apparently concealed from his contemporaries for i was practically alone in the pleasure i had in his society  poor soul i remember how much he was cast down at times and how life which had not yet begun seemed to be already at an end and hope quite dead and misfortune and dishonour like physical presences dogging him as he went  and it may be worth while to add that these clouds rolled away in their season and that all clouds roll away at last and the troubles of youth in particular are things but of a moment  so this student whom i have in my eye took his full share of these concerns and that very largely by his own fault but he still clung to his fortune and in the midst of much misconduct kept on in his own way learning how to work and at last to his wonder escaped out of the stage of studentship not openly shamed leaving behind him the university of edinburgh shorn of a good deal of its interest for myself  but while he is in more senses than one the first person he is by no means the only one whom i regret or whom the students of today if they knew what they had lost would regret also  they have still tait to be sure—long may they have him—and they have still tait’s classroom cupola and all but think of what a different place it was when this youth of mine at least on roll days would be present on the benches and at the near end of the platform lindsay senior 17 was airing his robust old age  it is possible my successors may have never even heard of old lindsay but when he went a link snapped with the last century he had something of a rustic air sturdy and fresh and plain he spoke with a ripe eastcountry accent which i used to admire his reminiscences were all of journeys on foot or highways busy with postchaises—a scotland before steam he had seen the coal fire on the isle of may and he regaled me with tales of my own grandfather  thus he was for me a mirror of things perished it was only in his memory that i could see the huge shock of flames of the may beacon stream to leeward and the watchers as they fed the fire lay hold unscorched of the windward bars of the furnace it was only thus that i could see my grandfather driving swiftly in a gig along the seaboard road from pittenweem to crail and for all his business hurry drawing up to speak goodhumouredly with those he met  and now in his turn lindsay is gone also inhabits only the memories of other men till these shall follow him and figures in my reminiscences as my grandfather figured in his  today again they have professor butcher and i hear he has a prodigious deal of greek and they have professor chrystal who is a man filled with the mathematics  and doubtless these are setoffs  but they cannot change the fact that professor blackie has retired and that professor kelland is dead  no man’s education is complete or truly liberal who knew not kelland  there were unutterable lessons in the mere sight of that frail old clerical gentleman lively as a boy kind like a fairy godfather and keeping perfect order in his class by the spell of that very kindness  i have heard him drift into reminiscences in class time though not for long and give us glimpses of oldworld life in outoftheway english parishes when he was young thus playing the same part as lindsay—the part of the surviving memory signalling out of the dark backward and abysm of time the images of perished things  but it was a part that scarce became him he somehow lacked the means for all his silver hair and worn face he was not truly old and he had too much of the unrest and petulant fire of youth and too much invincible innocence of mind to play the veteran well  the time to measure him best to taste in the old phrase his gracious nature was when he received his class at home  what a pretty simplicity would he then show trying to amuse us like children with toys and what an engaging nervousness of manner as fearing that his efforts might not succeed truly he made us all feel like children and like children embarrassed but at the same time filled with sympathy for the conscientious troubled elderboy who was working so hard to entertain us  a theorist has held the view that there is no feature in man so telltale as his spectacles that the mouth may be compressed and the brow smoothed artificially but the sheen of the barnacles is diagnostic  and truly it must have been thus with kelland for as i still fancy i behold him frisking actively about the platform pointer in hand that which i seem to see most clearly is the way his glasses glittered with affection  i never knew but one other man who had if you will permit the phrase so kind a spectacle and that was dr appleton  but the light in his case was tempered and passive in kelland’s it danced and changed and flashed vivaciously among the students like a perpetual challenge to goodwill  i cannot say so much about professor blackie for a good reason kelland’s class i attended once even gained there a certificate of merit the only distinction of my university career  but although i am the holder of a certificate of attendance in the professor’s own hand i cannot remember to have been present in the greek class above a dozen times  professor blackie was even kind enough to remark more than once while in the very act of writing the document above referred to that he did not know my face  indeed i denied myself many opportunities acting upon an extensive and highly rational system of truantry which cost me a great deal of trouble to put in exercise—perhaps as much as would have taught me greek—and sent me forth into the world and the profession of letters with the merest shadow of an education  but they say it is always a good thing to have taken pains and that success is its own reward whatever be its nature so that perhaps even upon this i should plume myself that no one ever played the truant with more deliberate care and none ever had more certificates for less education  one consequence however of my system is that i have much less to say of professor blackie than i had of professor kelland and as he is still alive and will long i hope continue to be so it will not surprise you very much that i have no intention of saying it  meanwhile how many others have gone—jenkin hodgson and i know not who besides and of that tide of students that used to throng the arch and blacken the quadrangle how many are scattered into the remotest parts of the earth and how many more have lain down beside their fathers in their “restinggraves”  and again how many of these last have not found their way there all too early through the stress of education  that was one thing at least from which my truantry protected me  i am sorry indeed that i have no greek but i should be sorrier still if i were dead nor do i know the name of that branch of knowledge which is worth acquiring at the price of a brain fever  there are many sordid tragedies in the life of the student above all if he be poor or drunken or both but nothing more moves a wise man’s pity than the case of the lad who is in too much hurry to be learned  and so for the sake of a moral at the end i will call up one more figure and have done  a student ambitious of success by that hot intemperate manner of study that now grows so common read night and day for an examination  as he went on the task became more easy to him sleep was more easily banished his brain grew hot and clear and more capacious the necessary knowledge daily fuller and more orderly  it came to the eve of the trial and he watched all night in his high chamber reviewing what he knew and already secure of success  his window looked eastward and being as i said high up and the house itself standing on a hill commanded a view over dwindling suburbs to a country horizon  at last my student drew up his blind and still in quite a jocund humour looked abroad  day was breaking the east was tinging with strange fires the clouds breaking up for the coming of the sun and at the sight nameless terror seized upon his mind  he was sane his senses were undisturbed he saw clearly and knew what he was seeing and knew that it was normal but he could neither bear to see it nor find the strength to look away and fled in panic from his chamber into the enclosure of the street  in the cool air and silence and among the sleeping houses his strength was renewed nothing troubled him but the memory of what had passed and an abject fear of its return      “gallo canente spes redit     aegris salus refunditur     lapsis fides revertitur”  as they sang of old in portugal in the morning office  but to him that good hour of cockcrow and the changes of the dawn had brought panic and lasting doubt and such terror as he still shook to think of  he dared not return to his lodging he could not eat he sat down he rose up he wandered the city woke about him with its cheerful bustle the sun climbed overhead and still he grew but the more absorbed in the distress of his recollection and the fear of his past fear  at the appointed hour he came to the door of the place of examination but when he was asked he had forgotten his name  seeing him so disordered they had not the heart to send him away but gave him a paper and admitted him still nameless to the hall  vain kindness vain efforts  he could only sit in a still growing horror writing nothing ignorant of all his mind filled with a single memory of the breaking day and his own intolerable fear  and that same night he was tossing in a brain fever  people are afraid of war and wounds and dentists all with excellent reason but these are not to be compared with such chaotic terrors of the mind as fell on this young man and made him cover his eyes from the innocent morning  we all have by our bedsides the box of the merchant abudah thank god securely enough shut but when a young man sacrifices sleep to labour let him have a care for he is playing with the lock     chapter iii old mortality   i   there is a certain graveyard looked upon on the one side by a prison on the other by the windows of a quiet hotel below under a steep cliff it beholds the traffic of many lines of rail and the scream of the engine and the shock of meeting buffers mount to it all day long  the aisles are lined with the inclosed sepulchres of families door beyond door like houses in a street and in the morning the shadow of the prison turrets and of many tall memorials fall upon the graves  there in the hot fits of youth i came to be unhappy  pleasant incidents are woven with my memory of the place  i here made friends with a plain old gentleman a visitor on sunny mornings gravely cheerful who with one eye upon the place that awaited him chirped about his youth like winter sparrows a beautiful housemaid of the hotel once for some days together dumbly flirted with me from a window and kept my wild heart flying and once—she possibly remembers—the wise eugenia followed me to that austere inclosure  her hair came down and in the shelter of the tomb my trembling fingers helped her to repair the braid  but for the most part i went there solitary and with irrevocable emotion pored on the names of the forgotten  name after name and to each the conventional attributions and the idle dates a regiment of the unknown that had been the joy of mothers and had thrilled with the illusions of youth and at last in the dim sickroom wrestled with the pangs of old mortality  in that whole crew of the silenced there was but one of whom my fancy had received a picture and he with his comely florid countenance bewigged and habited in scarlet and in his day combining fame and popularity stood forth like a taunt among that company of phantom appellations  it was then possible to leave behind us something more explicit than these severe monotonous and lying epitaphs and the thing left the memory of a painted picture and what we call the immortality of a name was hardly more desirable than mere oblivion even david hume as he lay composed beneath that “circular idea” was fainter than a dream and when the housemaid broom in hand smiled and beckoned from the open window the fame of that bewigged philosopher melted like a raindrop in the sea  and yet in soberness i cared as little for the housemaid as for david hume  the interests of youth are rarely frank his passions like noah’s dove come home to roost  the fire sensibility and volume of his own nature that is all that he has learned to recognise  the tumultuary and gray tide of life the empire of routine the unrejoicing faces of his elders fill him with contemptuous surprise there also he seems to walk among the tombs of spirits and it is only in the course of years and after much rubbing with his fellowmen that he begins by glimpses to see himself from without and his fellows from within to know his own for one among the thousand undenoted countenances of the city street and to divine in others the throb of human agony and hope  in the meantime he will avoid the hospital doors the pale faces the cripple the sweet whiff of chloroform—for there on the most thoughtless the pains of others are burned home but he will continue to walk in a divine selfpity the aisles of the forgotten graveyard  the length of man’s life which is endless to the brave and busy is scorned by his ambitious thought  he cannot bear to have come for so little and to go again so wholly  he cannot bear above all in that brief scene to be still idle and by way of cure neglects the little that he has to do  the parable of the talent is the brief epitome of youth  to believe in immortality is one thing but it is first needful to believe in life denunciatory preachers seem not to suspect that they may be taken gravely and in evil part that young men may come to think of time as of a moment and with the pride of satan wave back the inadequate gift  yet here is a true peril this it is that sets them to pace the graveyard alleys and to read with strange extremes of pity and derision the memorials of the dead  books were the proper remedy books of vivid human import forcing upon their minds the issues pleasures busyness importance and immediacy of that life in which they stand books of smiling or heroic temper to excite or to console books of a large design shadowing the complexity of that game of consequences to which we all sit down the hangerback not least  but the average sermon flees the point disporting itself in that eternity of which we know and need to know so little avoiding the bright crowded and momentous fields of life where destiny awaits us upon the average book a writer may be silent he may set it down to his illhap that when his own youth was in the acrid fermentation he should have fallen and fed upon the cheerless fields of obermann  yet to mr arnold who led him to these pastures he still bears a grudge  the day is perhaps not far off when people will begin to count moll flanders ay or the country wife more wholesome and more pious diet than these guidebooks to consistent egoism  but the most inhuman of boys soon wearies of the inhumanity of obermann and even while i still continued to be a haunter of the graveyard i began insensibly to turn my attention to the gravediggers and was weaned out of myself to observe the conduct of visitors  this was dayspring indeed to a lad in such great darkness  not that i began to see men or to try to see them from within nor to learn charity and modesty and justice from the sight but still stared at them externally from the prison windows of my affectation  once i remember to have observed two workingwomen with a baby halting by a grave there was something monumental in the grouping one upright carrying the child the other with bowed face crouching by her side  a wreath of immortelles under a glass dome had thus attracted them and drawing near i overheard their judgment on that wonder  “eh what extravagance”  to a youth afflicted with the callosity of sentiment this quaint and pregnant saying appeared merely base  my acquaintance with gravediggers considering its length was unremarkable  one indeed whom i found plying his spade in the red evening high above allan water and in the shadow of dunblane cathedral told me of his acquaintance with the birds that still attended on his labours how some would even perch about him waiting for their prey and in a true sexton’s calendar how the species varied with the season of the year  but this was the very poetry of the profession  the others whom i knew were somewhat dry  a faint flavour of the gardener hung about them but sophisticated and disbloomed  they had engagements to keep not alone with the deliberate series of the seasons but with mankind’s clocks and hourlong measurement of time  and thus there was no leisure for the relishing pinch or the hourlong gossip foot on spade  they were men wrapped up in their grim business they liked well to open longclosed family vaults blowing in the key and throwing wide the grating and they carried in their minds a calendar of names and dates  it would be “in fiftytwa” that such a tomb was last opened for “miss jemimy”  it was thus they spoke of their past patients—familiarly but not without respect like old family servants  here is indeed a servant whom we forget that we possess who does not wait at the bright table or run at the bell’s summons but patiently smokes his pipe beside the mortuary fire and in his faithful memory notches the burials of our race  to suspect shakespeare in his maturity of a superficial touch savours of paradox yet he was surely in error when he attributed insensibility to the digger of the grave  but perhaps it is on hamlet that the charge should lie or perhaps the english sexton differs from the scotch  the “goodman delver” reckoning up his years of office might have at least suggested other thoughts  it is a pride common among sextons  a cabinetmaker does not count his cabinets nor even an author his volumes save when they stare upon him from the shelves but the gravedigger numbers his graves  he would indeed be something different from human if his solitary openair and tragic labours left not a broad mark upon his mind  there in his tranquil aisle apart from city clamour among the cats and robins and the ancient effigies and legends of the tomb he waits the continual passage of his contemporaries falling like minute drops into eternity  as they fall he counts them and this enumeration which was at first perhaps appalling to his soul in the process of years and by the kindly influence of habit grows to be his pride and pleasure  there are many common stories telling how he piques himself on crowded cemeteries  but i will rather tell of the old gravedigger of monkton to whose unsuffering bedside the minister was summoned  he dwelt in a cottage built into the wall of the churchyard and through a bull’seye pane above his bed he could see as he lay dying the rank grasses and the upright and recumbent stones  dr laurie was i think a moderate ’tis certain at least that he took a very roman view of deathbed dispositions for he told the old man that he had lived beyond man’s natural years that his life had been easy and reputable that his family had all grown up and been a credit to his care and that it now behoved him unregretfully to gird his loins and follow the majority  the gravedigger heard him out then he raised himself upon one elbow and with the other hand pointed through the window to the scene of his lifelong labours  “doctor” he said “i ha’e laid three hunner and fowerscore in that kirkyaird an it had been his wull” indicating heaven “i would ha’e likit weel to ha’e made out the fower hunner”  but it was not to be this tragedian of the fifth act had now another part to play and the time had come when others were to gird and carry him    ii   i would fain strike a note that should be more heroical but the ground of all youth’s suffering solitude hysteria and haunting of the grave is nothing else than naked ignorant selfishness  it is himself that he sees dead those are his virtues that are forgotten his is the vague epitaph  pity him but the more if pity be your cue for where a man is all pride vanity and personal aspiration he goes through fire unshielded  in every part and corner of our life to lose oneself is to be gainer to forget oneself is to be happy and this poor laughable and tragic fool has not yet learned the rudiments himself giant prometheus is still ironed on the peaks of caucasus  but byandby his truant interests will leave that tortured body slip abroad and gather flowers then shall death appear before him in an altered guise no longer as a doom peculiar to himself whether fate’s crowning injustice or his own last vengeance upon those who fail to value him but now as a power that wounds him far more tenderly not without solemn compensations taking and giving bereaving and yet storing up  the first step for all is to learn to the dregs our own ignoble fallibility  when we have fallen through storey after storey of our vanity and aspiration and sit rueful among the ruins then it is that we begin to measure the stature of our friends how they stand between us and our own contempt believing in our best how linking us with others and still spreading wide the influential circle they weave us in and in with the fabric of contemporary life and to what petty size they dwarf the virtues and the vices that appeared gigantic in our youth  so that at the last when such a pin falls out—when there vanishes in the least breath of time one of those rich magazines of life on which we drew for our supply—when he who had first dawned upon us as a face among the faces of the city and still growing came to bulk on our regard with those clear features of the loved and living man falls in a breath to memory and shadow there falls along with him a whole wing of the palace of our life    iii   one such face i now remember one such blank some halfadozen of us labour to dissemble  in his youth he was most beautiful in person most serene and genial by disposition full of racy words and quaint thoughts laughter attended on his coming  he had the air of a great gentleman jovial and royal with his equals and to the poorest student gentle and attentive  power seemed to reside in him exhaustless we saw him stoop to play with us but held him marked for higher destinies we loved his notice and i have rarely had my pride more gratified than when he sat at my father’s table my acknowledged friend  so he walked among us both hands full of gifts carrying with nonchalance the seeds of a most influential life  the powers and the ground of friendship is a mystery but looking back i can discern that in part we loved the thing he was for some shadow of what he was to be  for with all his beauty power breeding urbanity and mirth there was in those days something soulless in our friend  he would astonish us by sallies witty innocent and inhumane and by a misapplied johnsonian pleasantry demolish honest sentiment  i can still see and hear him as he went his way along the lamplit streets là ci darem la mano on his lips a noble figure of a youth but following vanity and incredulous of good and sure enough somewhere on the high seas of life with his health his hopes his patrimony and his selfrespect miserably went down  from this disaster like a spent swimmer he came desperately ashore bankrupt of money and consideration creeping to the family he had deserted with broken wing never more to rise  but in his face there was a light of knowledge that was new to it  of the wounds of his body he was never healed died of them gradually with cleareyed resignation of his wounded pride we knew only from his silence  he returned to that city where he had lorded it in his ambitious youth lived there alone seeing few striving to retrieve the irretrievable at times still grappling with that mortal frailty that had brought him down still joying in his friend’s successes his laugh still ready but with kindlier music and over all his thoughts the shadow of that unalterable law which he had disavowed and which had brought him low  lastly when his bodily evils had quite disabled him he lay a great while dying still without complaint still finding interests to his last step gentle urbane and with the will to smile  the tale of this great failure is to those who remained true to him the tale of a success  in his youth he took thought for no one but himself when he came ashore again his whole armada lost he seemed to think of none but others  such was his tenderness for others such his instinct of fine courtesy and pride that of that impure passion of remorse he never breathed a syllable even regret was rare with him and pointed with a jest  you would not have dreamed if you had known him then that this was that great failure that beacon to young men over whose fall a whole society had hissed and pointed fingers  often have we gone to him redhot with our own hopeful sorrows railing on the roseleaves in our princely bed of life and he would patiently give ear and wisely counsel and it was only upon some return of our own thoughts that we were reminded what manner of man this was to whom we disembosomed a man by his own fault ruined shut out of the garden of his gifts his whole city of hope both ploughed and salted silently awaiting the deliverer then something took us by the throat and to see him there so gentle patient brave and pious oppressed but not cast down sorrow was so swallowed up in admiration that we could not dare to pity him  even if the old fault flashed out again it but awoke our wonder that in that lost battle he should have still the energy to fight  he had gone to ruin with a kind of kingly abandon like one who condescended but once ruined with the lights all out he fought as for a kingdom  most men finding themselves the authors of their own disgrace rail the louder against god or destiny  most men when they repent oblige their friends to share the bitterness of that repentance  but he had held an inquest and passed sentence mene mene and condemned himself to smiling silence  he had given trouble enough had earned misfortune amply and foregone the right to murmur  thus was our old comrade like samson careless in his days of strength but on the coming of adversity and when that strength was gone that had betrayed him—“for our strength is weakness”—he began to blossom and bring forth  well now he is out of the fight the burden that he bore thrown down before the great deliverer  we         “in the vast cathedral leave him     god accept him     christ receive him”    iv   if we go now and look on these innumerable epitaphs the pathos and the irony are strangely fled  they do not stand merely to the dead these foolish monuments they are pillars and legends set up to glorify the difficult but not desperate life of man  this ground is hallowed by the heroes of defeat  i see the indifferent pass before my friend’s last restingplace pause with a shrug of pity marvelling that so rich an argosy had sunk  a pity now that he is done with suffering a pity most uncalled for and an ignorant wonder  before those who loved him his memory shines like a reproach they honour him for silent lessons they cherish his example and in what remains before them of their toil fear to be unworthy of the dead  for this proud man was one of those who prospered in the valley of humiliation—of whom bunyan wrote that “though christian had the hard hap to meet in the valley with apollyon yet i must tell you that in former times men have met with angels here have found pearls here and have in this place found the words of life”     chapter iv a college magazine   i   all through my boyhood and youth i was known and pointed out for the pattern of an idler and yet i was always busy on my own private end which was to learn to write  i kept always two books in my pocket one to read one to write in  as i walked my mind was busy fitting what i saw with appropriate words when i sat by the roadside i would either read or a pencil and a penny versionbook would be in my hand to note down the features of the scene or commemorate some halting stanzas  thus i lived with words  and what i thus wrote was for no ulterior use it was written consciously for practice  it was not so much that i wished to be an author though i wished that too as that i had vowed that i would learn to write  that was a proficiency that tempted me and i practised to acquire it as men learn to whittle in a wager with myself description was the principal field of my exercise for to any one with senses there is always something worth describing and town and country are but one continuous subject  but i worked in other ways also often accompanied my walks with dramatic dialogues in which i played many parts and often exercised myself in writing down conversations from memory  this was all excellent no doubt so were the diaries i sometimes tried to keep but always and very speedily discarded finding them a school of posturing and melancholy selfdeception  and yet this was not the most efficient part of my training  good though it was it only taught me so far as i have learned them at all the lower and less intellectual elements of the art the choice of the essential note and the right word things that to a happier constitution had perhaps come by nature  and regarded as training it had one grave defect for it set me no standard of achievement  so that there was perhaps more profit as there was certainly more effort in my secret labours at home  whenever i read a book or a passage that particularly pleased me in which a thing was said or an effect rendered with propriety in which there was either some conspicuous force or some happy distinction in the style i must sit down at once and set myself to ape that quality  i was unsuccessful and i knew it and tried again and was again unsuccessful and always unsuccessful but at least in these vain bouts i got some practice in rhythm in harmony in construction and the coordination of parts  i have thus played the sedulous ape to hazlitt to lamb to wordsworth to sir thomas browne to defoe to hawthorne to montaigne to baudelaire and to obermann  i remember one of these monkey tricks which was called the vanity of morals it was to have had a second part the vanity of knowledge and as i had neither morality nor scholarship the names were apt but the second part was never attempted and the first part was written which is my reason for recalling it ghostlike from its ashes no less than three times first in the manner of hazlitt second in the manner of ruskin who had cast on me a passing spell and third in a laborious pasticcio of sir thomas browne  so with my other works cain an epic was save the mark an imitation of sordello robin hood a tale in verse took an eclectic middle course among the fields of keats chaucer and morris in monmouth a tragedy i reclined on the bosom of mr swinburne in my innumerable goutyfooted lyrics i followed many masters in the first draft of the king’s pardon a tragedy i was on the trail of no lesser man than john webster in the second draft of the same piece with staggering versatility i had shifted my allegiance to congreve and of course conceived my fable in a less serious vein—for it was not congreve’s verse it was his exquisite prose that i admired and sought to copy  even at the age of thirteen i had tried to do justice to the inhabitants of the famous city of peebles in the style of the book of snobs  so i might go on for ever through all my abortive novels and down to my later plays of which i think more tenderly for they were not only conceived at first under the bracing influence of old dumas but have met with resurrection one strangely bettered by another hand came on the stage itself and was played by bodily actors the other originally known as semiramis a tragedy i have observed on bookstalls under the alias of prince otto  but enough has been said to show by what arts of impersonation and in what purely ventriloquial efforts i first saw my words on paper  that like it or not is the way to learn to write whether i have profited or not that is the way  it was so keats learned and there was never a finer temperament for literature than keats’s it was so if we could trace it out that all men have learned and that is why a revival of letters is always accompanied or heralded by a cast back to earlier and fresher models  perhaps i hear some one cry out but this is not the way to be original  it is not nor is there any way but to be born so nor yet if you are born original is there anything in this training that shall clip the wings of your originality  there can be none more original than montaigne neither could any be more unlike cicero yet no craftsman can fail to see how much the one must have tried in his time to imitate the other  burns is the very type of a prime force in letters he was of all men the most imitative  shakespeare himself the imperial proceeds directly from a school  it is only from a school that we can expect to have good writers it is almost invariably from a school that great writers these lawless exceptions issue  nor is there anything here that should astonish the considerate  before he can tell what cadences he truly prefers the student should have tried all that are possible before he can choose and preserve a fitting key of words he should long have practised the literary scales and it is only after years of such gymnastic that he can sit down at last legions of words swarming to his call dozens of turns of phrase simultaneously bidding for his choice and he himself knowing what he wants to do and within the narrow limit of a man’s ability able to do it  and it is the great point of these imitations that there still shines beyond the student’s reach his inimitable model  let him try as he please he is still sure of failure and it is a very old and a very true saying that failure is the only highroad to success  i must have had some disposition to learn for i clearsightedly condemned my own performances  i liked doing them indeed but when they were done i could see they were rubbish  in consequence i very rarely showed them even to my friends and such friends as i chose to be my confidants i must have chosen well for they had the friendliness to be quite plain with me “padding” said one  another wrote “i cannot understand why you do lyrics so badly”  no more could i  thrice i put myself in the way of a more authoritative rebuff by sending a paper to a magazine these were returned and i was not surprised nor even pained  if they had not been looked at as like all amateurs i suspected was the case there was no good in repeating the experiment if they had been looked at—well then i had not yet learned to write and i must keep on learning and living  lastly i had a piece of good fortune which is the occasion of this paper and by which i was able to see my literature in print and to measure experimentally how far i stood from the favour of the public    ii   the speculative society is a body of some antiquity and has counted among its members scott brougham jeffrey horner benjamin constant robert emmet and many a legal and local celebrity besides  by an accident variously explained it has its rooms in the very buildings of the university of edinburgh a hall turkeycarpeted hung with pictures looking when lighted up at night with fire and candle like some goodly diningroom a passagelike library walled with books in their wire cages and a corridor with a fireplace benches a table many prints of famous members and a mural tablet to the virtues of a former secretary here a member can warm himself and loaf and read here in defiance of senatusconsults he can smoke  the senatus looks askance at these privileges looks even with a somewhat vinegar aspect on the whole society which argues a lack of proportion in the learned mind for the world we may be sure will prize far higher this haunt of dead lions than all the living dogs of the professorate  i sat one december morning in the library of the speculative a very humbleminded youth though it was a virtue i never had much credit for yet proud of my privileges as a member of the spec proud of the pipe i was smoking in the teeth of the senatus and in particular proud of being in the next room to three very distinguished students who were then conversing beside the corridor fire  one of these has now his name on the back of several volumes and his voice i learn is influential in the law courts  of the death of the second you have just been reading what i had to say  and the third also has escaped out of that battle of life in which he fought so hard it may be so unwisely  they were all three as i have said notable students but this was the most conspicuous  wealthy handsome ambitious adventurous diplomatic a reader of balzac and of all men that i have known the most like to one of balzac’s characters he led a life and was attended by an ill fortune that could be properly set forth only in the comédie humaine he had then his eye on parliament and soon after the time of which i write he made a showy speech at a political dinner was cried up to heaven next day in the courant and the day after was dashed lower than earth with a charge of plagiarism in the scotsman  report would have it i daresay very wrongly that he was betrayed by one in whom he particularly trusted and that the author of the charge had learned its truth from his own lips  thus at least he was up one day on a pinnacle admired and envied by all and the next though still but a boy he was publicly disgraced  the blow would have broken a less finely tempered spirit and even him i suppose it rendered reckless for he took flight to london and there in a fast club disposed of the bulk of his considerable patrimony in the space of one winter  for years thereafter he lived i know not how always well dressed always in good hotels and good society always with empty pockets  the charm of his manner may have stood him in good stead but though my own manners are very agreeable i have never found in them a source of livelihood and to explain the miracle of his continued existence i must fall back upon the theory of the philosopher that in his case as in all of the same kind “there was a suffering relative in the background”  from this genteel eclipse he reappeared upon the scene and presently sought me out in the character of a generous editor  it is in this part that i best remember him tall slender with a not ungraceful stoop looking quite like a refined gentleman and quite like an urbane adventurer smiling with an engaging ambiguity cocking at you one peaked eyebrow with a great appearance of finesse speaking low and sweet and thick with a touch of burr telling strange tales with singular deliberation and to a patient listener excellent effect  after all these ups and downs he seemed still like the rich student that he was of yore to breathe of money seemed still perfectly sure of himself and certain of his end  yet he was then upon the brink of his last overthrow  he had set himself to found the strangest thing in our society one of those periodical sheets from which men suppose themselves to learn opinions in which young gentlemen from the universities are encouraged at so much a line to garble facts insult foreign nations and calumniate private individuals and which are now the source of glory so that if a man’s name be often enough printed there he becomes a kind of demigod and people will pardon him when he talks back and forth as they do for mr gladstone and crowd him to suffocation on railway platforms as they did the other day to general boulanger and buy his literary works as i hope you have just done for me  our fathers when they were upon some great enterprise would sacrifice a life building it may be a favourite slave into the foundations of their palace  it was with his own life that my companion disarmed the envy of the gods  he fought his paper singlehanded trusting no one for he was something of a cynic up early and down late for he was nothing of a sluggard daily earwigging influential men for he was a master of ingratiation  in that slender and silken fellow there must have been a rare vein of courage that he should thus have died at his employment and doubtless ambition spoke loudly in his ear and doubtless love also for it seems there was a marriage in his view had he succeeded  but he died and his paper died after him and of all this grace and tact and courage it must seem to our blind eyes as if there had come literally nothing  these three students sat as i was saying in the corridor under the mural tablet that records the virtues of macbean the former secretary we would often smile at that ineloquent memorial and thought it a poor thing to come into the world at all and have no more behind one than macbean  and yet of these three two are gone and have left less and this book perhaps when it is old and foxy and some one picks it up in a corner of a bookshop and glances through it smiling at the old graceless turns of speech and perhaps for the love of alma mater which may be still extant and flourishing buys it not without haggling for some pence—this book may alone preserve a memory of james walter ferrier and robert glasgow brown  their thoughts ran very differently on that december morning they were all on fire with ambition and when they had called me in to them and made me a sharer in their design i too became drunken with pride and hope  we were to found a university magazine  a pair of little active brothers—livingstone by name great skippers on the foot great rubbers of the hands who kept a bookshop over against the university building—had been debauched to play the part of publishers  we four were to be conjunct editors and what was the main point of the concern to print our own works while by every rule of arithmetic—that flatterer of credulity—the adventure must succeed and bring great profit  well well it was a bright vision  i went home that morning walking upon air  to have been chosen by these three distinguished students was to me the most unspeakable advance it was my first draught of consideration it reconciled me to myself and to my fellowmen and as i steered round the railings at the tron i could not withhold my lips from smiling publicly yet in the bottom of my heart i knew that magazine would be a grim fiasco i knew it would not be worth reading i knew even if it were that nobody would read it and i kept wondering how i should be able upon my compact income of twelve pounds per annum payable monthly to meet my share in the expense  it was a comfortable thought to me that i had a father  the magazine appeared in a yellow cover which was the best part of it for at least it was unassuming it ran four months in undisturbed obscurity and died without a gasp  the first number was edited by all four of us with prodigious bustle the second fell principally into the hands of ferrier and me the third i edited alone and it has long been a solemn question who it was that edited the fourth  it would perhaps be still more difficult to say who read it  poor yellow sheet that looked so hopefully livingtones’ window  poor harmless paper that might have gone to print a shakespeare on and was instead so clumsily defaced with nonsense and shall i say poor editors  i cannot pity myself to whom it was all pure gain  it was no news to me but only the wholesome confirmation of my judgment when the magazine struggled into halfbirth and instantly sickened and subsided into night  i had sent a copy to the lady with whom my heart was at that time somewhat engaged and who did all that in her lay to break it and she with some tact passed over the gift and my cherished contributions in silence  i will not say that i was pleased at this but i will tell her now if by any chance she takes up the work of her former servant that i thought the better of her taste  i cleared the decks after this lost engagement had the necessary interview with my father which passed off not amiss paid over my share of the expense to the two little active brothers who rubbed their hands as much but methought skipped rather less than formerly having perhaps these two also embarked upon the enterprise with some graceful illusions and then reviewing the whole episode i told myself that the time was not yet ripe nor the man ready and to work i went again with my penny versionbooks having fallen back in one day from the printed author to the manuscript student    iii   from this defunct periodical i am going to reprint one of my own papers the poor little piece is all tailforemost  i have done my best to straighten its array i have pruned it fearlessly and it remains invertebrate and wordy  no selfrespecting magazine would print the thing and here you behold it in a bound volume not for any worth of its own but for the sake of the man whom it purports dimly to represent and some of whose sayings it preserves so that in this volume of memories and portraits robert young the swanston gardener may stand alongside of john todd the swanston shepherd  not that john and robert drew very close together in their lives for john was rough he smelt of the windy brae and robert was gentle and smacked of the garden in the hollow perhaps it is to my shame that i liked john the better of the two he had grit and dash and that salt of the old adam that pleases men with any savage inheritance of blood and he was a wayfarer besides and took my gipsy fancy  but however that may be and however robert’s profile may be blurred in the boyish sketch that follows he was a man of a most quaint and beautiful nature whom if it were possible to recast a piece of work so old i should like well to draw again with a maturer touch and as i think of him and of john i wonder in what other country two such men would be found dwelling together in a hamlet of some twenty cottages in the woody fold of a green hill     chapter v an old scotch gardener   i think i might almost have said the last somewhere indeed in the uttermost glens of the lammermuir or among the southwestern hills there may yet linger a decrepid representative of this bygone good fellowship but as far as actual experience goes i have only met one man in my life who might fitly be quoted in the same breath with andrew fairservice—though without his vices  he was a man whose very presence could impart a savour of quaint antiquity to the baldest and most modern flowerplots  there was a dignity about his tall stooping form and an earnestness in his wrinkled face that recalled don quixote but a don quixote who had come through the training of the covenant and been nourished in his youth on walker’s lives and the hind let loose  now as i could not bear to let such a man pass away with no sketch preserved of his oldfashioned virtues i hope the reader will take this as an excuse for the present paper and judge as kindly as he can the infirmities of my description  to me who find it so difficult to tell the little that i know he stands essentially as a genius loci  it is impossible to separate his spare form and old straw hat from the garden in the lap of the hill with its rocks overgrown with clematis its shadowy walks and the splendid breadth of champaign that one saw from the northwest corner  the garden and gardener seem part and parcel of each other  when i take him from his right surroundings and try to make him appear for me on paper he looks unreal and phantasmal the best that i can say may convey some notion to those that never saw him but to me it will be ever impotent  the first time that i saw him i fancy robert was pretty old already he had certainly begun to use his years as a stalking horse  latterly he was beyond all the impudencies of logic considering a reference to the parish register worth all the reasons in the world “i am old and well stricken in years” he was wont to say and i never found any one bold enough to answer the argument  apart from this vantage that he kept over all who were not yet octogenarian he had some other drawbacks as a gardener  he shrank the very place he cultivated  the dignity and reduced gentility of his appearance made the small garden cut a sorry figure  he was full of tales of greater situations in his younger days he spoke of castles and parks with a humbling familiarity  he told of places where undergardeners had trembled at his looks where there were meres and swanneries labyrinths of walk and wildernesses of sad shrubbery in his control till you could not help feeling that it was condescension on his part to dress your humbler garden plots  you were thrown at once into an invidious position  you felt that you were profiting by the needs of dignity and that his poverty and not his will consented to your vulgar rule  involuntarily you compared yourself with the swineherd that made alfred watch his cakes or some bloated citizen who may have given his sons and his condescension to the fallen dionysius  nor were the disagreeables purely fanciful and metaphysical for the sway that he exercised over your feelings he extended to your garden and through the garden to your diet  he would trim a hedge throw away a favourite plant or fill the most favoured and fertile section of the garden with a vegetable that none of us could eat in supreme contempt for our opinion  if you asked him to send you in one of your own artichokes “that i wull mem” he would say “with pleasure for it is mair blessed to give than to receive”  ay and even when by extra twisting of the screw we prevailed on him to prefer our commands to his own inclination and he went away stately and sad professing that “our wull was his pleasure” but yet reminding us that he would do it “with feelin’s”—even then i say the triumphant master felt humbled in his triumph felt that he ruled on sufferance only that he was taking a mean advantage of the other’s low estate and that the whole scene had been one of those “slights that patient merit of the unworthy takes”  in flowers his taste was oldfashioned and catholic affecting sunflowers and dahlias wallflowers and roses and holding in supreme aversion whatsoever was fantastic newfashioned or wild  there was one exception to this sweeping ban  foxgloves though undoubtedly guilty on the last count he not only spared but loved and when the shrubbery was being thinned he stayed his hand and dexterously manipulated his bill in order to save every stately stem  in boyhood as he told me once speaking in that tone that only actors and the oldfashioned common folk can use nowadays his heart grew “proud” within him when he came on a burncourse among the braes of manor that shone purple with their graceful trophies and not all his apprenticeship and practice for so many years of precise gardening had banished these boyish recollections from his heart  indeed he was a man keenly alive to the beauty of all that was bygone  he abounded in old stories of his boyhood and kept pious account of all his former pleasures and when he went on a holiday to visit one of the fabled great places of the earth where he had served before he came back full of little preraphaelite reminiscences that showed real passion for the past such as might have shaken hands with hazlitt or jeanjacques  but however his sympathy with his old feelings might affect his liking for the foxgloves the very truth was that he scorned all flowers together  they were but garnishings childish toys trifling ornaments for ladies’ chimneyshelves  it was towards his cauliflowers and peas and cabbage that his heart grew warm  his preference for the more useful growths was such that cabbages were found invading the flowerpots and an outpost of savoys was once discovered in the centre of the lawn  he would prelect over some thriving plant with wonderful enthusiasm piling reminiscence on reminiscence of former and perhaps yet finer specimens yet even then he did not let the credit leave himself  he had indeed raised “finer o’ them” but it seemed that no one else had been favoured with a like success  all other gardeners in fact were mere foils to his own superior attainments and he would recount with perfect soberness of voice and visage how so and so had wondered and such another could scarcely give credit to his eyes  nor was it with his rivals only that he parted praise and blame  if you remarked how well a plant was looking he would gravely touch his hat and thank you with solemn unction all credit in the matter falling to him  if on the other hand you called his attention to some backgoing vegetable he would quote scripture “paul may plant and apollos may water” all blame being left to providence on the score of deficient rain or untimely frosts  there was one thing in the garden that shared his preference with his favourite cabbages and rhubarb and that other was the beehive  their sound their industry perhaps their sweet product also had taken hold of his imagination and heart whether by way of memory or no i cannot say although perhaps the bees too were linked to him by some recollection of manor braes and his country childhood  nevertheless he was too chary of his personal safety or let me rather say his personal dignity to mingle in any active office towards them  but he could stand by while one of the contemned rivals did the work for him and protest that it was quite safe in spite of his own considerate distance and the cries of the distressed assistant  in regard to bees he was rather a man of word than deed and some of his most striking sentences had the bees for text  “they are indeed wonderfu’ creatures mem” he said once  “they just mind me o’ what the queen of sheba said to solomon—and i think she said it wi’ a sigh—‘the half of it hath not been told unto me’”  as far as the bible goes he was deeply read  like the old covenanters of whom he was the worthy representative his mouth was full of sacred quotations it was the book that he had studied most and thought upon most deeply  to many people in his station the bible and perhaps burns are the only books of any vital literary merit that they read feeding themselves for the rest on the draff of country newspapers and the very instructive but not very palatable pabulum of some cheap educational series  this was robert’s position  all day long he had dreamed of the hebrew stories and his head had been full of hebrew poetry and gospel ethics until they had struck deep root into his heart and the very expressions had become a part of him so that he rarely spoke without some antique idiom or scripture mannerism that gave a raciness to the merest trivialities of talk  but the influence of the bible did not stop here  there was more in robert than quaint phrase and ready store of reference  he was imbued with a spirit of peace and love he interposed between man and wife he threw himself between the angry touching his hat the while with all the ceremony of an usher he protected the birds from everybody but himself seeing i suppose a great difference between official execution and wanton sport  his mistress telling him one day to put some ferns into his master’s particular corner and adding “though indeed robert he doesn’t deserve them for he wouldn’t help me to gather them” “eh mem” replies robert “but i wouldnae say that for i think he’s just a most deservin’ gentleman”  again two of our friends who were on intimate terms and accustomed to use language to each other somewhat without the bounds of the parliamentary happened to differ about the position of a seat in the garden  the discussion as was usual when these two were at it soon waxed tolerably insulting on both sides  every one accustomed to such controversies several times a day was quietly enjoying this prizefight of somewhat abusive wit—every one but robert to whom the perfect good faith of the whole quarrel seemed unquestionable and who after having waited till his conscience would suffer him to wait no more and till he expected every moment that the disputants would fall to blows cut suddenly in with tones of almost tearful entreaty “eh but gentlemen i wad hae nae mair words about it”  one thing was noticeable about robert’s religion it was neither dogmatic nor sectarian  he never expatiated at least in my hearing on the doctrines of his creed and he never condemned anybody else  i have no doubt that he held all roman catholics atheists and mahometans as considerably out of it i don’t believe he had any sympathy for prelacy and the natural feelings of man must have made him a little sore about freechurchism but at least he never talked about these views never grew controversially noisy and never openly aspersed the belief or practice of anybody  now all this is not generally characteristic of scotch piety scotch sects being churches militant with a vengeance and scotch believers perpetual crusaders the one against the other and missionaries the one to the other  perhaps robert’s originally tender heart was what made the difference or perhaps his solitary and pleasant labour among fruits and flowers had taught him a more sunshiny creed than those whose work is among the tares of fallen humanity and the soft influences of the garden had entered deep into his spirit      “annihilating all that’s made     to a green thought in a green shade”  but i could go on for ever chronicling his golden sayings or telling of his innocent and living piety  i had meant to tell of his cottage with the german pipe hung reverently above the fire and the shell box that he had made for his son and of which he would say pathetically  “he was real pleased wi’ it at first but i think he’s got a kind o’ tired o’ it now”—the son being then a man of about forty  but i will let all these pass  “’tis more significant he’s dead”  the earth that he had digged so much in his life was dug out by another for himself and the flowers that he had tended drew their life still from him but in a new and nearer way  a bird flew about the open grave as if it too wished to honour the obsequies of one who had so often quoted scripture in favour of its kind  “are not two sparrows sold for one farthing and yet not one of them falleth to the ground”  yes he is dead  but the kings did not rise in the place of death to greet him “with taunting proverbs” as they rose to greet the haughty babylonian for in his life he was lowly and a peacemaker and a servant of god     chapter vi pastoral   to leave home in early life is to be stunned and quickened with novelties but when years have come it only casts a more endearing light upon the past  as in those composite photographs of mr galton’s the image of each new sitter brings out but the more clearly the central features of the race when once youth has flown each new impression only deepens the sense of nationality and the desire of native places  so may some cadet of royal Écossais or the albany regiment as he mounted guard about french citadels so may some officer marching his company of the scotsdutch among the polders have felt the soft rains of the hebrides upon his brow or started in the ranks at the remembered aroma of peatsmoke  and the rivers of home are dear in particular to all men this is as old as naaman who was jealous for abana and pharpar it is confined to no race nor country for i know one of scottish blood but a child of suffolk whose fancy still lingers about the lilied lowland waters of that shire  but the streams of scotland are incomparable in themselves—or i am only the more scottish to suppose so—and their sound and colour dwell for ever in the memory  how often and willingly do i not look again in fancy on tummel or manor or the talking airdle or dee swirling in its lynn on the bright burn of kinnaird or the golden burn that pours and sulks in the den behind kingussie  i think shame to leave out one of these enchantresses but the list would grow too long if i remembered all only i may not forget allan water nor birchwetting rogie nor yet almond nor for all its pollutions that water of leith of the many and wellnamed mills—bell’s mills and canon mills and silver mills nor redford burn of pleasant memories nor yet for all its smallness that nameless trickle that springs in the green bosom of allermuir and is fed from halkerside with a perennial teacupful and threads the moss under the shearer’s knowe and makes one pool there overhung by a rock where i loved to sit and make bad verses and is then kidnapped in its infancy by subterranean pipes for the service of the seabeholding city in the plain  from many points in the moss you may see at one glance its whole course and that of all its tributaries the geographer of this lilliput may visit all its corners without sitting down and not yet begin to be breathed shearer’s knowe and halkerside are but names of adjacent cantons on a single shoulder of a hill as names are squandered it would seem to the inexpert in superfluity upon these upland sheepwalks a bucket would receive the whole discharge of the toy river it would take it an appreciable time to fill your morning bath for the most part besides it soaks unseen through the moss and yet for the sake of auld lang syne and the figure of a certain genius loci i am condemned to linger awhile in fancy by its shores and if the nymph who cannot be above a span in stature will but inspire my pen i would gladly carry the reader along with me  john todd when i knew him was already “the oldest herd on the pentlands” and had been all his days faithful to that curlewscattering sheepcollecting life  he remembered the droving days when the drove roads that now lie green and solitary through the heather were thronged thoroughfares  he had himself often marched flocks into england sleeping on the hillsides with his caravan and by his account it was a rough business not without danger  the drove roads lay apart from habitation the drovers met in the wilderness as today the deepsea fishers meet off the banks in the solitude of the atlantic and in the one as in the other case rough habits and fistlaw were the rule  crimes were committed sheep filched and drovers robbed and beaten most of which offences had a moorland burial and were never heard of in the courts of justice  john in those days was at least once attacked—by two men after his watch—and at least once betrayed by his habitual anger fell under the danger of the law and was clapped into some rustic prisonhouse the doors of which he burst in the night and was no more heard of in that quarter  when i knew him his life had fallen in quieter places and he had no cares beyond the dulness of his dogs and the inroads of pedestrians from town  but for a man of his propensity to wrath these were enough he knew neither rest nor peace except by snatches in the gray of the summer morning and already from far up the hill he would wake the “toun” with the sound of his shoutings and in the lambing time his cries were not yet silenced late at night  this wrathful voice of a man unseen might be said to haunt that quarter of the pentlands an audible bogie and no doubt it added to the fear in which men stood of john a touch of something legendary  for my own part he was at first my enemy and i in my character of a rambling boy his natural abhorrence  it was long before i saw him near at hand knowing him only by some sudden blast of bellowing from far above bidding me “c’way oot amang the sheep”  the quietest recesses of the hill harboured this ogre i skulked in my favourite wilderness like a cameronian of the killing time and john todd was my claverhouse and his dogs my questing dragoons  little by little we dropped into civilities his hail at sight of me began to have less of the ring of a warslogan soon we never met but he produced his snuffbox which was with him like the calumet with the red indian a part of the heraldry of peace and at length in the ripeness of time we grew to be a pair of friends and when i lived alone in these parts in the winter it was a settled thing for john to “give me a cry” over the garden wall as he set forth upon his evening round and for me to overtake and bear him company  that dread voice of his that shook the hills when he was angry fell in ordinary talk very pleasantly upon the ear with a kind of honied friendly whine not far off singing that was eminently scottish  he laughed not very often and when he did with a sudden loud hawhaw hearty but somehow joyless like an echo from a rock  his face was permanently set and coloured ruddy and stiff with weathering more like a picture than a face yet with a certain strain and a threat of latent anger in the expression like that of a man trained too fine and harassed with perpetual vigilance  he spoke in the richest dialect of scotch i ever heard the words in themselves were a pleasure and often a surprise to me so that i often came back from one of our patrols with new acquisitions and this vocabulary he would handle like a master stalking a little before me “beard on shoulder” the plaid hanging loosely about him the yellow staff clapped under his arm and guiding me uphill by that devious tactical ascent which seems peculiar to men of his trade i might count him with the best talkers only that talking scotch and talking english seem incomparable acts  he touched on nothing at least but he adorned it when he narrated the scene was before you when he spoke as he did mostly of his own antique business the thing took on a colour of romance and curiosity that was surprising  the clans of sheep with their particular territories on the hill and how in the yearly killings and purchases each must be proportionally thinned and strengthened the midnight busyness of animals the signs of the weather the cares of the snowy season the exquisite stupidity of sheep the exquisite cunning of dogs all these he could present so humanly and with so much old experience and living gusto that weariness was excluded  and in the midst he would suddenly straighten his bowed back the stick would fly abroad in demonstration and the sharp thunder of his voice roll out a long itinerary for the dogs so that you saw at last the use of that great wealth of names for every knowe and howe upon the hillside and the dogs having hearkened with lowered tails and raised faces would run up their flags again to the masthead and spread themselves upon the indicated circuit  it used to fill me with wonder how they could follow and retain so long a story  but john denied these creatures all intelligence they were the constant butt of his passion and contempt it was just possible to work with the like of them he said—not more than possible  and then he would expand upon the subject of the really good dogs that he had known and the one really good dog that he had himself possessed  he had been offered forty pounds for it but a good collie was worth more than that more than anything to a “herd” he did the herd’s work for him  “as for the like of them” he would cry and scornfully indicate the scouring tails of his assistants  once—i translate john’s lallan for i cannot do it justice being born britannis in montibus indeed but alas inerudito sæculo—once in the days of his good dog he had bought some sheep in edinburgh and on the way out the road being crowded two were lost  this was a reproach to john and a slur upon the dog and both were alive to their misfortune  word came after some days that a farmer about braid had found a pair of sheep and thither went john and the dog to ask for restitution  but the farmer was a hard man and stood upon his rights “how were they marked” he asked and since john had bought right and left from many sellers and had no notion of the marks—“very well” said the farmer “then it’s only right that i should keep them”—“well” said john “it’s a fact that i cannae tell the sheep but if my dog can will ye let me have them”  the farmer was honest as well as hard and besides i daresay he had little fear of the ordeal so he had all the sheep upon his farm into one large park and turned john’s dog into their midst that hairy man of business knew his errand well he knew that john and he had bought two sheep and to their shame lost them about boroughmuirhead he knew besides the lord knows how unless by listening that they were come to braid for their recovery and without pause or blunder singled out first one and then another the two waifs it was that afternoon the forty pounds were offered and refused  and the shepherd and his dog—what do i say the true shepherd and his man—set off together by fairmilehead in jocund humour and “smiled to ither” all the way home with the two recovered ones before them  so far so good but intelligence may be abused  the dog as he is by little man’s inferior in mind is only by little his superior in virtue and john had another collie tale of quite a different complexion  at the foot of the moss behind kirk yetton caer ketton wise men say there is a scrog of low wood and a pool with a dam for washing sheep  john was one day lying under a bush in the scrog when he was aware of a collie on the far hillside skulking down through the deepest of the heather with obtrusive stealth  he knew the dog knew him for a clever rising practitioner from quite a distant farm one whom perhaps he had coveted as he saw him masterfully steering flocks to market  but what did the practitioner so far from home and why this guilty and secret manoeuvring towards the pool—for it was towards the pool that he was heading  john lay the closer under his bush and presently saw the dog come forth upon the margin look all about him to see if he were anywhere observed plunge in and repeatedly wash himself over head and ears and then but now openly and with tail in air strike homeward over the hills  that same night word was sent his master and the rising practitioner shaken up from where he lay all innocence before the fire was had out to a dykeside and promptly shot for alas he was that foulest of criminals under trust a sheepeater and it was from the maculation of sheep’s blood that he had come so far to cleanse himself in the pool behind kirk yetton  a trade that touches nature one that lies at the foundations of life in which we have all had ancestors employed so that on a hint of it ancestral memories revive lends itself to literary use vocal or written  the fortune of a tale lies not alone in the skill of him that writes but as much perhaps in the inherited experience of him who reads and when i hear with a particular thrill of things that i have never done or seen it is one of that innumerable army of my ancestors rejoicing in past deeds  thus novels begin to touch not the fine dilettanti but the gross mass of mankind when they leave off to speak of parlours and shades of manner and stillborn niceties of motive and begin to deal with fighting sailoring adventure death or childbirth and thus ancient outdoor crafts and occupations whether mr hardy wields the shepherd’s crook or count tolstoi swings the scythe lift romance into a near neighbourhood with epic  these aged things have on them the dew of man’s morning they lie near not so much to us the semiartificial flowerets as to the trunk and aboriginal taproot of the race  a thousand interests spring up in the process of the ages and a thousand perish that is now an eccentricity or a lost art which was once the fashion of an empire and those only are perennial matters that rouse us today and that roused men in all epochs of the past  there is a certain critic not indeed of execution but of matter whom i dare be known to set before the best a certain lowbrowed hairy gentleman at first a percher in the fork of trees next as they relate a dweller in caves and whom i think i see squatting in cavemouths of a pleasant afternoon to munch his berries—his wife that accomplished lady squatting by his side his name i never heard but he is often described as probably arboreal which may serve for recognition  each has his own tree of ancestors but at the top of all sits probably arboreal in all our veins there run some minims of his old wild treetop blood our civilised nerves still tingle with his rude terrors and pleasures and to that which would have moved our common ancestor all must obediently thrill  we have not so far to climb to come to shepherds and it may be i had one for an ascendant who has largely moulded me  but yet i think i owe my taste for that hillside business rather to the art and interest of john todd  he it was that made it live for me as the artist can make all things live  it was through him the simple strategy of massing sheep upon a snowy evening with its attendant scampering of earnest shaggy aidesdecamp was an affair that i never wearied of seeing and that i never weary of recalling to mind the shadow of the night darkening on the hills inscrutable black blots of snow shower moving here and there like night already come huddles of yellow sheep and dartings of black dogs upon the snow a bitter air that took you by the throat unearthly harpings of the wind along the moors and for centre piece to all these features and influences john winding up the brae keeping his captain’s eye upon all sides and breaking ever and again into a spasm of bellowing that seemed to make the evening bleaker  it is thus that i still see him in my mind’s eye perched on a hump of the declivity not far from halkerside his staff in airy flourish his great voice taking hold upon the hills and echoing terror to the lowlands i meanwhile standing somewhat back until the fit should be over and with a pinch of snuff my friend relapse into his easy even conversation     chapter vii the manse   i have named among many rivers that make music in my memory that dirty water of leith  often and often i desire to look upon it again and the choice of a point of view is easy to me  it should be at a certain waterdoor embowered in shrubbery  the river is there dammed back for the service of the flourmill just below so that it lies deep and darkling and the sand slopes into brown obscurity with a glint of gold and it has but newly been recruited by the borrowings of the snuffmill just above and these tumbling merrily in shake the pool to its black heart fill it with drowsy eddies and set the curded froth of many other mills solemnly steering to and fro upon the surface  or so it was when i was young for change and the masons and the pruningknife have been busy and if i could hope to repeat a cherished experience it must be on many and impossible conditions  i must choose as well as the point of view a certain moment in my growth so that the scale may be exaggerated and the trees on the steep opposite side may seem to climb to heaven and the sand by the waterdoor where i am standing seem as low as styx  and i must choose the season also so that the valley may be brimmed like a cup with sunshine and the songs of birds—and the year of grace so that when i turn to leave the riverside i may find the old manse and its inhabitants unchanged  it was a place in that time like no other the garden cut into provinces by a great hedge of beech and overlooked by the church and the terrace of the churchyard where the tombstones were thick and after nightfall “spunkies” might be seen to dance at least by children flowerplots lying warm in sunshine laurels and the great yew making elsewhere a pleasing horror of shade the smell of water rising from all round with an added tang of papermills the sound of water everywhere and the sound of mills—the wheel and the dam singing their alternate strain the birds on every bush and from every corner of the overhanging woods pealing out their notes until the air throbbed with them and in the midst of this the manse  i see it by the standard of my childish stature as a great and roomy house  in truth it was not so large as i supposed nor yet so convenient and standing where it did it is difficult to suppose that it was healthful  yet a large family of stalwart sons and tall daughters were housed and reared and came to man and womanhood in that nest of little chambers so that the face of the earth was peppered with the children of the manse and letters with outlandish stamps became familiar to the local postman and the walls of the little chambers brightened with the wonders of the east  the dullest could see this was a house that had a pair of hands in divers foreign places a wellbeloved house—its image fondly dwelt on by many travellers  here lived an ancestor of mine who was a herd of men  i read him judging with older criticism the report of childish observation as a man of singular simplicity of nature unemotional and hating the display of what he felt standing contented on the old ways a lover of his life and innocent habits to the end  we children admired him partly for his beautiful face and silver hair for none more than children are concerned for beauty and above all for beauty in the old partly for the solemn light in which we beheld him once a week the observed of all observers in the pulpit  but his strictness and distance the effect i now fancy of old age slow blood and settled habit oppressed us with a kind of terror  when not abroad he sat much alone writing sermons or letters to his scattered family in a dark and cold room with a library of bloodless books—or so they seemed in those days although i have some of them now on my own shelves and like well enough to read them and these lonely hours wrapped him in the greater gloom for our imaginations  but the study had a redeeming grace in many indian pictures gaudily coloured and dear to young eyes  i cannot depict for i have no such passions now the greed with which i beheld them and when i was once sent in to say a psalm to my grandfather i went quaking indeed with fear but at the same time glowing with hope that if i said it well he might reward me with an indian picture      “thy foot he’ll not let slide nor will        he slumber that thee keeps”  it ran a strange conglomerate of the unpronounceable a sad model to set in childhood before one who was himself to be a versifier and a task in recitation that really merited reward  and i must suppose the old man thought so too and was either touched or amused by the performance for he took me in his arms with most unwonted tenderness and kissed me and gave me a little kindly sermon for my psalm so that for that day we were clerk and parson  i was struck by this reception into so tender a surprise that i forgot my disappointment  and indeed the hope was one of those that childhood forges for a pastime and with no design upon reality  nothing was more unlikely than that my grandfather should strip himself of one of those pictures lovegifts and reminders of his absent sons nothing more unlikely than that he should bestow it upon me  he had no idea of spoiling children leaving all that to my aunt he had fared hard himself and blubbered under the rod in the last century and his ways were still spartan for the young  the last word i heard upon his lips was in this spartan key  he had overwalked in the teeth of an east wind and was now near the end of his many days  he sat by the diningroom fire with his white hair pale face and bloodshot eyes a somewhat awful figure and my aunt had given him a dose of our good old scotch medicine dr gregory’s powder  now that remedy as the work of a near kinsman of rob roy himself may have a savour of romance for the imagination but it comes uncouthly to the palate  the old gentleman had taken it with a wry face and that being accomplished sat with perfect simplicity like a child’s munching a “barleysugar kiss”  but when my aunt having the canister open in her hands proposed to let me share in the sweets he interfered at once  i had had no gregory then i should have no barleysugar kiss so he decided with a touch of irritation  and just then the phaeton coming opportunely to the kitchen door—for such was our unlordly fashion—i was taken for the last time from the presence of my grandfather  now i often wonder what i have inherited from this old minister  i must suppose indeed that he was fond of preaching sermons and so am i though i never heard it maintained that either of us loved to hear them he sought health in his youth in the isle of wight and i have sought it in both hemispheres but whereas he found and kept it i am still on the quest  he was a great lover of shakespeare whom he read aloud i have been told with taste well i love my shakespeare also and am persuaded i can read him well though i own i never have been told so  he made embroidery designing his own patterns and in that kind of work i never made anything but a kettleholder in berlin wool and an odd garter of knitting which was as black as the chimney before i had done with it he loved port and nuts and porter and so do i but they agreed better with my grandfather which seems to me a breach of contract  he had chalkstones in his fingers and these in good time i may possibly inherit but i would much rather have inherited his noble presence  try as i please i cannot join myself on with the reverend doctor and all the while no doubt and even as i write the phrase he moves in my blood and whispers words to me and sits efficient in the very knot and centre of my being  in his garden as i played there i learned the love of mills—or had i an ancestor a miller—and a kindness for the neighbourhood of graves as homely things not without their poetry—or had i an ancestor a sexton  but what of the garden where he played himself—for that too was a scene of my education  some part of me played there in the eighteenth century and ran races under the green avenue at pilrig some part of me trudged up leith walk which was still a country place and sat on the high school benches and was thrashed perhaps by dr adam  the house where i spent my youth was not yet thought upon but we made holiday parties among the cornfields on its site and ate strawberries and cream near by at a gardener’s  all this i had forgotten only my grandfather remembered and once reminded me  i have forgotten too how we grew up and took orders and went to our first ayrshire parish and fell in love with and married a daughter of burns’s dr smith—“smith opens out his cauld harangues”  i have forgotten but i was there all the same and heard stories of burns at first hand  and there is a thing stranger than all that for this homunculus or partman of mine that walked about the eighteenth century with dr balfour in his youth was in the way of meeting other homunculos or partmen in the persons of my other ancestors  these were of a lower order and doubtless we looked down upon them duly  but as i went to college with dr balfour i may have seen the lamp and oil man taking down the shutters from his shop beside the tron—we may have had a rabbithutch or a bookshelf made for us by a certain carpenter in i know not what wynd of the old smoky city or upon some holiday excursion we may have looked into the windows of a cottage in a flowergarden and seen a certain weaver plying his shuttle  and these were all kinsmen of mine upon the other side and from the eyes of the lamp and oil man onehalf of my unborn father and onequarter of myself looked out upon us as we went by to college  nothing of all this would cross the mind of the young student as he posted up the bridges with trim stockinged legs in that city of cocked hats and good scotch still unadulterated  it would not cross his mind that he should have a daughter and the lamp and oil man just then beginning by a not unnatural metastasis to bloom into a lighthouseengineer should have a grandson and that these two in the fulness of time should wed and some portion of that student himself should survive yet a year or two longer in the person of their child  but our ancestral adventures are beyond even the arithmetic of fancy and it is the chief recommendation of long pedigrees that we can follow backward the careers of our homunculos and be reminded of our antenatal lives  our conscious years are but a moment in the history of the elements that build us  are you a bankclerk and do you live at peckham  it was not always so  and though today i am only a man of letters either tradition errs or i was present when there landed at st andrews a french barbersurgeon to tend the health and the beard of the great cardinal beaton i have shaken a spear in the debateable land and shouted the slogan of the elliots i was present when a skipper plying from dundee smuggled jacobites to france after the ’15 i was in a west india merchant’s office perhaps next door to bailie nicol jarvie’s and managed the business of a plantation in st kitt’s i was with my engineergrandfather the soninlaw of the lamp and oil man when he sailed north about scotland on the famous cruise that gave us the pirate and the lord of the isles i was with him too on the bell rock in the fog when the smeaton had drifted from her moorings and the aberdeen men pick in hand had seized upon the only boats and he must stoop and lap seawater before his tongue could utter audible words and once more with him when the bell rock beacon took a “thrawe” and his workmen fled into the tower then nearly finished and he sat unmoved reading in his bible—or affecting to read—till one after another slunk back with confusion of countenance to their engineer  yes parts of me have seen life and met adventures and sometimes met them well  and away in the still cloudier past the threads that make me up can be traced by fancy into the bosoms of thousands and millions of ascendants picts who rallied round macbeth and the old and highly preferable system of descent by females fleërs from before the legions of agricola marchers in pannonian morasses stargazers on chaldæan plateaus and furthest of all what face is this that fancy can see peering through the disparted branches  what sleeper in green treetops what muncher of nuts concludes my pedigree  probably arboreal in his habits     and i know not which is the more strange that i should carry about with me some fibres of my ministergrandfather or that in him as he sat in his cool study grave reverend contented gentleman there was an aboriginal frisking of the blood that was not his treetop memories like undeveloped negatives lay dormant in his mind treetop instincts awoke and were trod down and probably arboreal scarce to be distinguished from a monkey gambolled and chattered in the brain of the old divine     chapter viii memoirs of an islet   those who try to be artists use time after time the matter of their recollections setting and resetting little coloured memories of men and scenes rigging up it may be some especial friend in the attire of a buccaneer and decreeing armies to manœuvre or murder to be done on the playground of their youth  but the memories are a fairy gift which cannot be worn out in using  after a dozen services in various tales the little sunbright pictures of the past still shine in the mind’s eye with not a lineament defaced not a tint impaired  glück und unglück wird gesang if goethe pleases yet only by endless avatars the original reembodying after each  so that a writer in time begins to wonder at the perdurable life of these impressions begins perhaps to fancy that he wrongs them when he weaves them in with fiction and looking back on them with evergrowing kindness puts them at last substantive jewels in a setting of their own  one or two of these pleasant spectres i think i have laid  i used one but the other day a little eyot of dense freshwater sand where i once waded deep in butterburrs delighting to hear the song of the river on both sides and to tell myself that i was indeed and at last upon an island  two of my puppets lay there a summer’s day hearkening to the shearers at work in riverside fields and to the drums of the gray old garrison upon the neighbouring hill  and this was i think done rightly the place was rightly peopled—and now belongs not to me but to my puppets—for a time at least  in time perhaps the puppets will grow faint the original memory swim up instant as ever and i shall once more lie in bed and see the little sandy isle in allan water as it is in nature and the child that once was me wading there in butterburrs and wonder at the instancy and virgin freshness of that memory and be pricked again in season and out of season by the desire to weave it into art  there is another isle in my collection the memory of which besieges me i put a whole family there in one of my tales and later on threw upon its shores and condemned to several days of rain and shellfish on its tumbled boulders the hero of another  the ink is not yet faded the sound of the sentences is still in my mind’s ear and i am under a spell to write of that island again    i   the little isle of earraid lies close in to the southwest corner of the ross of mull the sound of iona on one side across which you may see the isle and church of columba the open sea to the other where you shall be able to mark on a clear surfy day the breakers running white on many sunken rocks  i first saw it or first remembered seeing it framed in the round bull’seye of a cabin port the sea lying smooth along its shores like the waters of a lake the colourless clear light of the early morning making plain its heathery and rocky hummocks  there stood upon it in these days a single rude house of uncemented stones approached by a pier of wreckwood  it must have been very early for it was then summer and in summer in that latitude day scarcely withdraws but even at that hour the house was making a sweet smoke of peats which came to me over the bay and the barelegged daughters of the cotter were wading by the pier  the same day we visited the shores of the isle in the ship’s boats rowed deep into fiddler’s hole sounding as we went and having taken stock of all possible accommodation pitched on the northern inlet as the scene of operations  for it was no accident that had brought the lighthouse steamer to anchor in the bay of earraid  fifteen miles away to seaward a certain black rock stood environed by the atlantic rollers the outpost of the torran reefs  here was a tower to be built and a star lighted for the conduct of seamen  but as the rock was small and hard of access and far from land the work would be one of years and my father was now looking for a shore station where the stones might be quarried and dressed the men live and the tender with some degree of safety lie at anchor  i saw earraid next from the stern thwart of an iona lugger sam bough and i sitting there cheek by jowl with our feet upon our baggage in a beautiful clear northern summer eve  and behold there was now a pier of stone there were rows of sheds railways travellingcranes a street of cottages an iron house for the resident engineer wooden bothies for the men a stage where the courses of the tower were put together experimentally and behind the settlement a great gash in the hillside where granite was quarried  in the bay the steamer lay at her moorings all day long there hung about the place the music of chinking tools and even in the dead of night the watchman carried his lantern to and fro in the dark settlement and could light the pipe of any midnight muser  it was above all strange to see earraid on the sunday when the sound of the tools ceased and there fell a crystal quiet  all about the green compound men would be sauntering in their sunday’s best walking with those lax joints of the reposing toiler thoughtfully smoking talking small as if in honour of the stillness or hearkening to the wailing of the gulls  and it was strange to see our sabbath services held as they were in one of the bothies with mr brebner reading at a table and the congregation perched about in the double tier of sleeping bunks and to hear the singing of the psalms “the chapters” the inevitable spurgeon’s sermon and the old eloquent lighthouse prayer  in fine weather when by the spyglass on the hill the sea was observed to run low upon the reef there would be a sound of preparation in the very early morning and before the sun had risen from behind ben more the tender would steam out of the bay  over fifteen seamiles of the great blue atlantic rollers she ploughed her way trailing at her tail a brace of wallowing stonelighters  the open ocean widened upon either board and the hills of the mainland began to go down on the horizon before she came to her unhomely destination and layto at last where the rock clapped its black head above the swell with the tall iron barrack on its spider legs and the truncated tower and the cranes waving their arms and the smoke of the enginefire rising in the midsea  an ugly reef is this of the dhu heartach no pleasant assemblage of shelves and pools and creeks about which a child might play for a whole summer without weariness like the bell rock or the skerryvore but one oval nodule of blacktrap sparsely bedabbled with an inconspicuous fucus and alive in every crevice with a dingy insect between a slater and a bug no other life was there but that of seabirds and of the sea itself that here ran like a millrace and growled about the outer reef for ever and ever and again in the calmest weather roared and spouted on the rock itself  times were different upon dhuheartach when it blew and the night fell dark and the neighbour lights of skerryvore and rhuval were quenched in fog and the men sat prisoned high up in their iron drum that then resounded with the lashing of the sprays  fear sat with them in their seabeleaguered dwelling and the colour changed in anxious faces when some greater billow struck the barrack and its pillars quivered and sprang under the blow  it was then that the foreman builder mr goodwillie whom i see before me still in his rockhabit of undecipherable rags would get his fiddle down and strike up human minstrelsy amid the music of the storm  but it was in sunshine only that i saw dhuheartach and it was in sunshine or the yet lovelier summer afterglow that the steamer would return to earraid ploughing an enchanted sea the obedient lighters relieved of their deck cargo riding in her wake more quietly and the steersman upon each as she rose on the long swell standing tall and dark against the shining west  but it was in earraid itself that i delighted chiefly  the lighthouse settlement scarce encroached beyond its fences over the top of the first brae the ground was all virgin the world all shut out the face of things unchanged by any of man’s doings  here was no living presence save for the limpets on the rocks for some old gray rainbeaten ram that i might rouse out of a ferny den betwixt two boulders or for the haunting and the piping of the gulls  it was older than man it was found so by incoming celts and seafaring norsemen and columba’s priests  the earthy savour of the bogplants the rude disorder of the boulders the inimitable seaside brightness of the air the brine and the iodine the lap of the billows among the weedy reefs the sudden springing up of a great run of dashing surf along the seafront of the isle all that i saw and felt my predecessors must have seen and felt with scarce a difference  i steeped myself in open air and in past ages      “delightful would it be to me to be in uchd ailiun        on the pinnacle of a rock     that i might often see        the face of the ocean     that i might hear the song of the wonderful birds        source of happiness     that i might hear the thunder of the crowding waves        upon the rocks     at times at work without compulsion—        this would be delightful     at times plucking dulse from the rocks        at times at fishing”  so about the next island of iona sang columba himself twelve hundred years before  and so might i have sung of earraid  and all the while i was aware that this life of seabathing and sunburning was for me but a holiday  in that year cannon were roaring for days together on french battlefields and i would sit in my isle i call it mine after the use of lovers and think upon the war and the loudness of these faraway battles and the pain of the men’s wounds and the weariness of their marching  and i would think too of that other war which is as old as mankind and is indeed the life of man the unsparing war the grinding slavery of competition the toil of seventy years dearbought bread precarious honour the perils and pitfalls and the poor rewards  it was a long look forward the future summoned me as with trumpet calls it warned me back as with a voice of weeping and beseeching and i thrilled and trembled on the brink of life like a childish bather on the beach  there was another young man on earraid in these days and we were much together bathing clambering on the boulders trying to sail a boat and spinning round instead in the oily whirlpools of the roost  but the most part of the time we spoke of the great uncharted desert of our futures wondering together what should there befall us hearing with surprise the sound of our own voices in the empty vestibule of youth  as far and as hard as it seemed then to look forward to the grave so far it seems now to look backward upon these emotions so hard to recall justly that loath submission as of the sacrificial bull with which we stooped our necks under the yoke of destiny  i met my old companion but the other day i cannot tell of course what he was thinking but upon my part i was wondering to see us both so much at home and so composed and sedentary in the world and how much we had gained and how much we had lost to attain to that composure and which had been upon the whole our best estate when we sat there prating sensibly like men of some experience or when we shared our timorous and hopeful counsels in a western islet    chapter ix thomas stevenson—civil engineer   the death of thomas stevenson will mean not very much to the general reader  his service to mankind took on forms of which the public knows little and understands less  he came seldom to london and then only as a task remaining always a stranger and a convinced provincial putting up for years at the same hotel where his father had gone before him faithful for long to the same restaurant the same church and the same theatre chosen simply for propinquity steadfastly refusing to dine out he had a circle of his own indeed at home few men were more beloved in edinburgh where he breathed an air that pleased him and wherever he went in railway carriages or hotel smokingrooms his strange humorous vein of talk and his transparent honesty raised him up friends and admirers  but to the general public and the world of london except about the parliamentary committeerooms he remained unknown  all the time his lights were in every part of the world guiding the mariner his firm were consulting engineers to the indian the new zealand and the japanese lighthouse boards so that edinburgh was a world centre for that branch of applied science in germany he had been called “the nestor of lighthouse illumination” even in france where his claims were long denied he was at last on the occasion of the late exposition recognised and medalled  and to show by one instance the inverted nature of his reputation comparatively small at home yet filling the world a friend of mine was this winter on a visit to the spanish main and was asked by a peruvian if he “knew mr stevenson the author because his works were much esteemed in peru”  my friend supposed the reference was to the writer of tales but the peruvian had never heard of dr jekyll what he had in his eye what was esteemed in peru where the volumes of the engineer  thomas stevenson was born at edinburgh in the year 1818 the grandson of thomas smith first engineer to the board of northern lights son of robert stevenson brother of alan and david so that his nephew david alan stevenson joined with him at the time of his death in the engineership is the sixth of the family who has held successively or conjointly that office  the bell rock his father’s great triumph was finished before he was born but he served under his brother alan in the building of skerryvore the noblest of all extant deepsea lights and in conjunction with his brother david he added two—the chickens and dhu heartach—to that small number of man’s extreme outposts in the ocean  of shore lights the two brothers last named erected no fewer than twentyseven of beacons 84 about twentyfive  many harbours were successfully carried out one the harbour of wick the chief disaster of my father’s life was a failure the sea proved too strong for man’s arts and after expedients hitherto unthought of and on a scale hypercyclopean the work must be deserted and now stands a ruin in that bleak godforsaken bay ten miles from johno’groat’s  in the improvement of rivers the brothers were likewise in a large way of practice over both england and scotland nor had any british engineer anything approaching their experience  it was about this nucleus of his professional labours that all my father’s scientific inquiries and inventions centred these proceeded from and acted back upon his daily business  thus it was as a harbour engineer that he became interested in the propagation and reduction of waves a difficult subject in regard to which he has left behind him much suggestive matter and some valuable approximate results  storms were his sworn adversaries and it was through the study of storms that he approached that of meteorology at large  many who knew him not otherwise knew—perhaps have in their gardens—his louvreboarded screen for instruments  but the great achievement of his life was of course in optics as applied to lighthouse illumination  fresnel had done much fresnel had settled the fixed light apparatus on a principle that still seems unimprovable and when thomas stevenson stepped in and brought to a comparable perfection the revolving light a not unnatural jealousy and much painful controversy rose in france  it had its hour and as i have told already even in france it has blown by  had it not it would have mattered the less since all through his life my father continued to justify his claim by fresh advances  new apparatus for lights in new situations was continually being designed with the same unwearied search after perfection the same nice ingenuity of means and though the holophotal revolving light perhaps still remains his most elegant contrivance it is difficult to give it the palm over the much later condensing system with its thousand possible modifications  the number and the value of these improvements entitle their author to the name of one of mankind’s benefactors  in all parts of the world a safer landfall awaits the mariner  two things must be said and first that thomas stevenson was no mathematician  natural shrewdness a sentiment of optical laws and a great intensity of consideration led him to just conclusions but to calculate the necessary formulæ for the instruments he had conceived was often beyond him and he must fall back on the help of others notably on that of his cousin and lifelong intimate friend emeritus professor swan of st andrews and his later friend professor p g tait  it is a curious enough circumstance and a great encouragement to others that a man so ill equipped should have succeeded in one of the most abstract and arduous walks of applied science  the second remark is one that applies to the whole family and only particularly to thomas stevenson from the great number and importance of his inventions holding as the stevensons did a government appointment they regarded their original work as something due already to the nation and none of them has ever taken out a patent  it is another cause of the comparative obscurity of the name for a patent not only brings in money it infallibly spreads reputation and my father’s instruments enter anonymously into a hundred lightrooms and are passed anonymously over in a hundred reports where the least considerable patent would stand out and tell its author’s story  but the lifework of thomas stevenson remains what we have lost what we now rather try to recall is the friend and companion  he was a man of a somewhat antique strain with a blended sternness and softness that was wholly scottish and at first somewhat bewildering with a profound essential melancholy of disposition and what often accompanies it the most humorous geniality in company shrewd and childish passionately attached passionately prejudiced a man of many extremes many faults of temper and no very stable foothold for himself among life’s troubles yet he was a wise adviser many men and these not inconsiderable took counsel with him habitually  “i sat at his feet” writes one of these “when i asked his advice and when the broad brow was set in thought and the firm mouth said his say i always knew that no man could add to the worth of the conclusion”  he had excellent taste though whimsical and partial collected old furniture and delighted specially in sunflowers long before the days of mr wilde took a lasting pleasure in prints and pictures was a devout admirer of thomson of duddingston at a time when few shared the taste and though he read little was constant to his favourite books  he had never any greek latin he happily retaught himself after he had left school where he was a mere consistent idler happily i say for lactantius vossius and cardinal bona were his chief authors  the first he must have read for twenty years uninterruptedly keeping it near him in his study and carrying it in his bag on journeys another old theologian brown of wamphray was often in his hands  when he was indisposed he had two books guy mannering and the parent’s assistant of which he never wearied  he was a strong conservative or as he preferred to call himself a tory except in so far as his views were modified by a hotheaded chivalrous sentiment for women  he was actually in favour of a marriage law under which any woman might have a divorce for the asking and no man on any ground whatever and the same sentiment found another expression in a magdalen mission in edinburgh founded and largely supported by himself  this was but one of the many channels of his public generosity his private was equally unstrained the church of scotland of which he held the doctrines though in a sense of his own and to which he bore a clansman’s loyalty profited often by his time and money and though from a morbid sense of his own unworthiness he would never consent to be an officebearer his advice was often sought and he served the church on many committees  what he perhaps valued highest in his work were his contributions to the defence of christianity one of which in particular was praised by hutchinson stirling and reprinted at the request of professor crawford  his sense of his own unworthiness i have called morbid morbid too were his sense of the fleetingness of life and his concern for death  he had never accepted the conditions of man’s life or his own character and his inmost thoughts were ever tinged with the celtic melancholy  cases of conscience were sometimes grievous to him and that delicate employment of a scientific witness cost him many qualms  but he found respite from these troublesome humours in his work in his lifelong study of natural science in the society of those he loved and in his daily walks which now would carry him far into the country with some congenial friend and now keep him dangling about the town from one old bookshop to another and scraping romantic acquaintance with every dog that passed  his talk compounded of so much sterling sense and so much freakish humour and clothed in language so apt droll and emphatic was a perpetual delight to all who knew him before the clouds began to settle on his mind  his use of language was both just and picturesque and when at the beginning of his illness he began to feel the ebbing of this power it was strange and painful to hear him reject one word after another as inadequate and at length desist from the search and leave his phrase unfinished rather than finish it without propriety  it was perhaps another celtic trait that his affections and emotions passionate as these were and liable to passionate ups and downs found the most eloquent expression both in words and gestures  love anger and indignation shone through him and broke forth in imagery like what we read of southern races  for all these emotional extremes and in spite of the melancholy ground of his character he had upon the whole a happy life nor was he less fortunate in his death which at the last came to him unaware    chapter x talk and talkers       sir we had a good talk—johnson      as we must account for every idle word so we must for every idle     silence—franklin  there can be no fairer ambition than to excel in talk to be affable gay ready clear and welcome to have a fact a thought or an illustration pat to every subject and not only to cheer the flight of time among our intimates but bear our part in that great international congress always sitting where public wrongs are first declared public errors first corrected and the course of public opinion shaped day by day a little nearer to the right  no measure comes before parliament but it has been long ago prepared by the grand jury of the talkers no book is written that has not been largely composed by their assistance literature in many of its branches is no other than the shadow of good talk but the imitation falls far short of the original in life freedom and effect  there are always two to a talk giving and taking comparing experience and according conclusions  talk is fluid tentative continually “in further search and progress” while written words remain fixed become idols even to the writer found wooden dogmatisms and preserve flies of obvious error in the amber of the truth  last and chief while literature gagged with linseywoolsey can only deal with a fraction of the life of man talk goes fancy free and may call a spade a spade  talk has none of the freezing immunities of the pulpit  it cannot even if it would become merely æsthetic or merely classical like literature  a jest intervenes the solemn humbug is dissolved in laughter and speech runs forth out of the contemporary groove into the open fields of nature cheery and cheering like schoolboys out of school  and it is in talk alone that we can learn our period and ourselves  in short the first duty of a man is to speak that is his chief business in this world and talk which is the harmonious speech of two or more is by far the most accessible of pleasures  it costs nothing in money it is all profit it completes our education founds and fosters our friendships and can be enjoyed at any age and in almost any state of health  the spice of life is battle the friendliest relations are still a kind of contest and if we would not forego all that is valuable in our lot we must continually face some other person eye to eye and wrestle a fall whether in love or enmity  it is still by force of body or power of character or intellect that we attain to worthy pleasures  men and women contend for each other in the lists of love like rival mesmerists the active and adroit decide their challenges in the sports of the body and the sedentary sit down to chess or conversation  all sluggish and pacific pleasures are to the same degree solitary and selfish and every durable bond between human beings is founded in or heightened by some element of competition  now the relation that has the least root in matter is undoubtedly that airy one of friendship and hence i suppose it is that good talk most commonly arises among friends  talk is indeed both the scene and instrument of friendship  it is in talk alone that the friends can measure strength and enjoy that amicable counterassertion of personality which is the gauge of relations and the sport of life  a good talk is not to be had for the asking  humours must first be accorded in a kind of overture or prologue hour company and circumstance be suited and then at a fit juncture the subject the quarry of two heated minds spring up like a deer out of the wood  not that the talker has any of the hunter’s pride though he has all and more than all his ardour  the genuine artist follows the stream of conversation as an angler follows the windings of a brook not dallying where he fails to “kill”  he trusts implicitly to hazard and he is rewarded by continual variety continual pleasure and those changing prospects of the truth that are the best of education  there is nothing in a subject so called that we should regard it as an idol or follow it beyond the promptings of desire  indeed there are few subjects and so far as they are truly talkable more than the half of them may be reduced to three that i am i that you are you and that there are other people dimly understood to be not quite the same as either  wherever talk may range it still runs half the time on these eternal lines  the theme being set each plays on himself as on an instrument asserts and justifies himself ransacks his brain for instances and opinions and brings them forth newminted to his own surprise and the admiration of his adversary  all natural talk is a festival of ostentation and by the laws of the game each accepts and fans the vanity of the other  it is from that reason that we venture to lay ourselves so open that we dare to be so warmly eloquent and that we swell in each other’s eyes to such a vast proportion  for talkers once launched begin to overflow the limits of their ordinary selves tower up to the height of their secret pretensions and give themselves out for the heroes brave pious musical and wise that in their most shining moments they aspire to be so they weave for themselves with words and for a while inhabit a palace of delights temple at once and theatre where they fill the round of the world’s dignities and feast with the gods exulting in kudos  and when the talk is over each goes his way still flushed with vanity and admiration still trailing clouds of glory each declines from the height of his ideal orgie not in a moment but by slow declension  i remember in the entr’acte of an afternoon performance coming forth into the sunshine in a beautiful green gardened corner of a romantic city and as i sat and smoked the music moving in my blood i seemed to sit there and evaporate the flying dutchman for it was that i had been hearing with a wonderful sense of life warmth wellbeing and pride and the noises of the city voices bells and marching feet fell together in my ears like a symphonious orchestra  in the same way the excitement of a good talk lives for a long while after in the blood the heart still hot within you the brain still simmering and the physical earth swimming around you with the colours of the sunset  natural talk like ploughing should turn up a large surface of life rather than dig mines into geological strata  masses of experience anecdote incident crosslights quotation historical instances the whole flotsam and jetsam of two minds forced in and in upon the matter in hand from every point of the compass and from every degree of mental elevation and abasement—these are the material with which talk is fortified the food on which the talkers thrive  such argument as is proper to the exercise should still be brief and seizing  talk should proceed by instances by the apposite not the expository  it should keep close along the lines of humanity near the bosoms and businesses of men at the level where history fiction and experience intersect and illuminate each other  i am i and you are you with all my heart but conceive how these lean propositions change and brighten when instead of words the actual you and i sit cheek by jowl the spirit housed in the live body and the very clothes uttering voices to corroborate the story in the face  not less surprising is the change when we leave off to speak of generalities—the bad the good the miser and all the characters of theophrastus—and call up other men by anecdote or instance in their very trick and feature or trading on a common knowledge toss each other famous names still glowing with the hues of life  communication is no longer by words but by the instancing of whole biographies epics systems of philosophy and epochs of history in bulk  that which is understood excels that which is spoken in quantity and quality alike ideas thus figured and personified change hands as we may say like coin and the speakers imply without effort the most obscure and intricate thoughts  strangers who have a large common ground of reading will for this reason come the sooner to the grapple of genuine converse  if they know othello and napoleon consuelo and clarissa harlowe vautrin and steenie steenson they can leave generalities and begin at once to speak by figures  conduct and art are the two subjects that arise most frequently and that embrace the widest range of facts  a few pleasures bear discussion for their own sake but only those which are most social or most radically human and even these can only be discussed among their devotees  a technicality is always welcome to the expert whether in athletics art or law i have heard the best kind of talk on technicalities from such rare and happy persons as both know and love their business  no human being ever spoke of scenery for above two minutes at a time which makes me suspect we hear too much of it in literature  the weather is regarded as the very nadir and scoff of conversational topics  and yet the weather the dramatic element in scenery is far more tractable in language and far more human both in import and suggestion than the stable features of the landscape  sailors and shepherds and the people generally of coast and mountain talk well of it and it is often excitingly presented in literature  but the tendency of all living talk draws it back and back into the common focus of humanity  talk is a creature of the street and marketplace feeding on gossip and its last resort is still in a discussion on morals  that is the heroic form of gossip heroic in virtue of its high pretensions but still gossip because it turns on personalities  you can keep no men long nor scotchmen at all off moral or theological discussion  these are to all the world what law is to lawyers they are everybody’s technicalities the medium through which all consider life and the dialect in which they express their judgments  i knew three young men who walked together daily for some two months in a solemn and beautiful forest and in cloudless summer weather daily they talked with unabated zest and yet scarce wandered that whole time beyond two subjects—theology and love and perhaps neither a court of love nor an assembly of divines would have granted their premisses or welcomed their conclusions  conclusions indeed are not often reached by talk any more than by private thinking  that is not the profit  the profit is in the exercise and above all in the experience for when we reason at large on any subject we review our state and history in life  from time to time however and specially i think in talking art talk becomes effective conquering like war widening the boundaries of knowledge like an exploration  a point arises the question takes a problematical a baffling yet a likely air the talkers begin to feel lively presentiments of some conclusion near at hand towards this they strive with emulous ardour each by his own path and struggling for first utterance and then one leaps upon the summit of that matter with a shout and almost at the same moment the other is beside him and behold they are agreed  like enough the progress is illusory a mere cat’s cradle having been wound and unwound out of words  but the sense of joint discovery is none the less giddy and inspiriting  and in the life of the talker such triumphs though imaginary are neither few nor far apart they are attained with speed and pleasure in the hour of mirth and by the nature of the process they are always worthily shared  there is a certain attitude combative at once and deferential eager to fight yet most averse to quarrel which marks out at once the talkable man  it is not eloquence not fairness not obstinacy but a certain proportion of all of these that i love to encounter in my amicable adversaries  they must not be pontiffs holding doctrine but huntsmen questing after elements of truth  neither must they be boys to be instructed but fellowteachers with whom i may wrangle and agree on equal terms  we must reach some solution some shadow of consent for without that eager talk becomes a torture  but we do not wish to reach it cheaply or quickly or without the tussle and effort wherein pleasure lies  the very best talker with me is one whom i shall call springheel’d jack  i say so because i never knew any one who mingled so largely the possible ingredients of converse  in the spanish proverb the fourth man necessary to compound a salad is a madman to mix it jack is that madman  i know not which is more remarkable the insane lucidity of his conclusions the humorous eloquence of his language or his power of method bringing the whole of life into the focus of the subject treated mixing the conversational salad like a drunken god  he doubles like the serpent changes and flashes like the shaken kaleidoscope transmigrates bodily into the views of others and so in the twinkling of an eye and with a heady rapture turns questions inside out and flings them empty before you on the ground like a triumphant conjuror  it is my common practice when a piece of conduct puzzles me to attack it in the presence of jack with such grossness such partiality and such wearing iteration as at length shall spur him up in its defence  in a moment he transmigrates dons the required character and with moonstruck philosophy justifies the act in question  i can fancy nothing to compare with the vim of these impersonations the strange scale of language flying from shakespeare to kant and from kant to major dyngwell—      “as fast as a musician scatters sounds     out of an instrument”  the sudden sweeping generalisations the absurd irrelevant particularities the wit wisdom folly humour eloquence and bathos each startling in its kind and yet all luminous in the admired disorder of their combination  a talker of a different calibre though belonging to the same school is burly  burly is a man of a great presence he commands a larger atmosphere gives the impression of a grosser mass of character than most men  it has been said of him that his presence could be felt in a room you entered blindfold and the same i think has been said of other powerful constitutions condemned to much physical inaction there is something boisterous and piratic in burly’s manner of talk which suits well enough with this impression  he will roar you down he will bury his face in his hands he will undergo passions of revolt and agony and meanwhile his attitude of mind is really both conciliatory and receptive and after pistol has been out pistol’d and the welkin rung for hours you begin to perceive a certain subsidence in these spring torrents points of agreement issue and you end arminarm and in a glow of mutual admiration  the outcry only serves to make your final union the more unexpected and precious  throughout there has been perfect sincerity perfect intelligence a desire to hear although not always to listen and an unaffected eagerness to meet concessions  you have with burly none of the dangers that attend debate with springheel’d jack who may at any moment turn his powers of transmigration on yourself create for you a view you never held and then furiously fall on you for holding it  these at least are my two favourites and both are loud copious intolerant talkers  this argues that i myself am in the same category for if we love talking at all we love a bright fierce adversary who will hold his ground foot by foot in much our own manner sell his attention dearly and give us our full measure of the dust and exertion of battle  both these men can be beat from a position but it takes six hours to do it a high and hard adventure worth attempting  with both you can pass days in an enchanted country of the mind with people scenery and manners of its own live a life apart more arduous active and glowing than any real existence and come forth again when the talk is over as out of a theatre or a dream to find the east wind still blowing and the chimneypots of the old battered city still around you  jack has the far finer mind burly the far more honest jack gives us the animated poetry burly the romantic prose of similar themes the one glances high like a meteor and makes a light in darkness the other with many changing hues of fire burns at the sealevel like a conflagration but both have the same humour and artistic interests the same unquenched ardour in pursuit the same gusts of talk and thunderclaps of contradiction  cockshot 100 is a different article but vastly entertaining and has been meat and drink to me for many a long evening  his manner is dry brisk and pertinacious and the choice of words not much  the point about him is his extraordinary readiness and spirit  you can propound nothing but he has either a theory about it readymade or will have one instantly on the stocks and proceed to lay its timbers and launch it in your presence  “let me see” he will say  “give me a moment  i should have some theory for that”  a blither spectacle than the vigour with which he sets about the task it were hard to fancy  he is possessed by a demoniac energy welding the elements for his life and bending ideas as an athlete bends a horseshoe with a visible and lively effort  he has in theorising a compass an art what i would call the synthetic gusto something of a herbert spencer who should see the fun of the thing  you are not bound and no more is he to place your faith in these brandnew opinions  but some of them are right enough durable even for life and the poorest serve for a cock shy—as when idle people after picnics float a bottle on a pond and have an hour’s diversion ere it sinks  whichever they are serious opinions or humours of the moment he still defends his ventures with indefatigable wit and spirit hitting savagely himself but taking punishment like a man  he knows and never forgets that people talk first of all for the sake of talking conducts himself in the ring to use the old slang like a thorough “glutton” and honestly enjoys a telling facer from his adversary  cockshot is bottled effervescency the sworn foe of sleep threeinthemorning cockshot says a victim  his talk is like the driest of all imaginable dry champagnes  sleight of hand and inimitable quickness are the qualities by which he lives  athelred on the other hand presents you with the spectacle of a sincere and somewhat slow nature thinking aloud  he is the most unready man i ever knew to shine in conversation  you may see him sometimes wrestle with a refractory jest for a minute or two together and perhaps fail to throw it in the end  and there is something singularly engaging often instructive in the simplicity with which he thus exposes the process as well as the result the works as well as the dial of the clock  withal he has his hours of inspiration  apt words come to him as if by accident and coming from deeper down they smack the more personally they have the more of fine old crusted humanity rich in sediment and humour  there are sayings of his in which he has stamped himself into the very grain of the language you would think he must have worn the words next his skin and slept with them  yet it is not as a sayer of particular good things that athelred is most to be regarded rather as the stalwart woodman of thought  i have pulled on a light cord often enough while he has been wielding the broadaxe and between us on this unequal division many a specious fallacy has fallen  i have known him to battle the same question night after night for years keeping it in the reign of talk constantly applying it and reapplying it to life with humorous or grave intention and all the while never hurrying nor flagging nor taking an unfair advantage of the facts  jack at a given moment when arising as it were from the tripod can be more radiantly just to those from whom he differs but then the tenor of his thoughts is even calumnious while athelred slower to forge excuses is yet slower to condemn and sits over the welter of the world vacillating but still judicial and still faithfully contending with his doubts  both the last talkers deal much in points of conduct and religion studied in the “dry light” of prose  indirectly and as if against his will the same elements from time to time appear in the troubled and poetic talk of opalstein  his various and exotic knowledge complete although unready sympathies and fine full discriminative flow of language fit him out to be the best of talkers so perhaps he is with some not quite with me—proxime accessit i should say  he sings the praises of the earth and the arts flowers and jewels wine and music in a moonlight serenading manner as to the light guitar even wisdom comes from his tongue like singing no one is indeed more tuneful in the upper notes but even while he sings the song of the sirens he still hearkens to the barking of the sphinx  jarring byronic notes interrupt the flow of his horatian humours  his mirth has something of the tragedy of the world for its perpetual background and he feasts like don giovanni to a double orchestra one lightly sounding for the dance one pealing beethoven in the distance  he is not truly reconciled either with life or with himself and this instant war in his members sometimes divides the man’s attention  he does not always perhaps not often frankly surrender himself in conversation  he brings into the talk other thoughts than those which he expresses you are conscious that he keeps an eye on something else that he does not shake off the world nor quite forget himself  hence arise occasional disappointments even an occasional unfairness for his companions who find themselves one day giving too much and the next when they are wary out of season giving perhaps too little  purcel is in another class from any i have mentioned  he is no debater but appears in conversation as occasion rises in two distinct characters one of which i admire and fear and the other love  in the first he is radiantly civil and rather silent sits on a high courtly hilltop and from that vantageground drops you his remarks like favours he seems not to share in our sublunary contentions he wears no sign of interest when on a sudden there falls in a crystal of wit so polished that the dull do not perceive it but so right that the sensitive are silenced  true talk should have more body and blood should be louder vainer and more declaratory of the man the true talker should not hold so steady an advantage over whom he speaks with and that is one reason out of a score why i prefer my purcel in his second character when he unbends into a strain of graceful gossip singing like the fireside kettle  in these moods he has an elegant homeliness that rings of the true queen anne  i know another person who attains in his moments to the insolence of a restoration comedy speaking i declare as congreve wrote but that is a sport of nature and scarce falls under the rubric for there is none alas to give him answer  one last remark occurs it is the mark of genuine conversation that the sayings can scarce be quoted with their full effect beyond the circle of common friends  to have their proper weight they should appear in a biography and with the portrait of the speaker  good talk is dramatic it is like an impromptu piece of acting where each should represent himself to the greatest advantage and that is the best kind of talk where each speaker is most fully and candidly himself and where if you were to shift the speeches round from one to another there would be the greatest loss in significance and perspicuity  it is for this reason that talk depends so wholly on our company  we should like to introduce falstaff and mercutio or falstaff and sir toby but falstaff in talk with cordelia seems even painful  most of us by the protean quality of man can talk to some degree with all but the true talk that strikes out all the slumbering best of us comes only with the peculiar brethren of our spirits is founded as deep as love in the constitution of our being and is a thing to relish with all our energy while yet we have it and to be grateful for forever     chapter xi talk and talkers 105   ii   in the last paper there was perhaps too much about mere debate and there was nothing said at all about that kind of talk which is merely luminous and restful a higher power of silence the quiet of the evening shared by ruminating friends  there is something aside from personal preference to be alleged in support of this omission  those who are no chimneycornerers who rejoice in the social thunderstorm have a ground in reason for their choice  they get little rest indeed but restfulness is a quality for cattle the virtues are all active life is alert and it is in repose that men prepare themselves for evil  on the other hand they are bruised into a knowledge of themselves and others they have in a high degree the fencer’s pleasure in dexterity displayed and proved what they get they get upon life’s terms paying for it as they go and once the talk is launched they are assured of honest dealing from an adversary eager like themselves  the aboriginal man within us the cavedweller still lusty as when he fought tooth and nail for roots and berries scents this kind of equal battle from afar it is like his old primæval days upon the crags a return to the sincerity of savage life from the comfortable fictions of the civilised  and if it be delightful to the old man it is none the less profitable to his younger brother the conscientious gentleman i feel never quite sure of your urbane and smiling coteries i fear they indulge a man’s vanities in silence suffer him to encroach encourage him on to be an ass and send him forth again not merely contemned for the moment but radically more contemptible than when he entered  but if i have a flushed blustering fellow for my opposite bent on carrying a point my vanity is sure to have its ears rubbed once at least in the course of the debate  he will not spare me when we differ he will not fear to demonstrate my folly to my face  for many natures there is not much charm in the still chambered society the circle of bland countenances the digestive silence the admired remark the flutter of affectionate approval  they demand more atmosphere and exercise “a gale upon their spirits” as our pious ancestors would phrase it to have their wits well breathed in an uproarious valhalla  and i suspect that the choice given their character and faults is one to be defended  the purely wise are silenced by facts they talk in a clear atmosphere problems lying around them like a view in nature if they can be shown to be somewhat in the wrong they digest the reproof like a thrashing and make better intellectual blood  they stand corrected by a whisper a word or a glance reminds them of the great eternal law  but it is not so with all others in conversation seek rather contact with their fellowmen than increase of knowledge or clarity of thought  the drama not the philosophy of life is the sphere of their intellectual activity  even when they pursue truth they desire as much as possible of what we may call human scenery along the road they follow  they dwell in the heart of life the blood sounding in their ears their eyes laying hold of what delights them with a brutal avidity that makes them blind to all besides their interest riveted on people living loving talking tangible people  to a man of this description the sphere of argument seems very pale and ghostly  by a strong expression a perturbed countenance floods of tears an insult which his conscience obliges him to swallow he is brought round to knowledge which no syllogism would have conveyed to him  his own experience is so vivid he is so superlatively conscious of himself that if day after day he is allowed to hector and hear nothing but approving echoes he will lose his hold on the soberness of things and take himself in earnest for a god  talk might be to such an one the very way of moral ruin the school where he might learn to be at once intolerable and ridiculous  this character is perhaps commoner than philosophers suppose  and for persons of that stamp to learn much by conversation they must speak with their superiors not in intellect for that is a superiority that must be proved but in station  if they cannot find a friend to bully them for their good they must find either an old man a woman or some one so far below them in the artificial order of society that courtesy may be particularly exercised  the best teachers are the aged  to the old our mouths are always partly closed we must swallow our obvious retorts and listen  they sit above our heads on life’s raised dais and appeal at once to our respect and pity  a flavour of the old school a touch of something different in their manner—which is freer and rounder if they come of what is called a good family and often more timid and precise if they are of the middle class—serves in these days to accentuate the difference of age and add a distinction to gray hairs  but their superiority is founded more deeply than by outward marks or gestures  they are before us in the march of man they have more or less solved the irking problem they have battled through the equinox of life in good and evil they have held their course and now without open shame they near the crown and harbour  it may be we have been struck with one of fortune’s darts we can scarce be civil so cruelly is our spirit tossed  yet long before we were so much as thought upon the like calamity befell the old man or woman that now with pleasant humour rallies us upon our inattention sitting composed in the holy evening of man’s life in the clear shining after rain  we grow ashamed of our distresses new and hot and coarse like villainous roadside brandy we see life in aerial perspective under the heavens of faith and out of the worst in the mere presence of contented elders look forward and take patience  fear shrinks before them “like a thing reproved” not the flitting and ineffectual fear of death but the instant dwelling terror of the responsibilities and revenges of life  their speech indeed is timid they report lions in the path they counsel a meticulous footing but their serene marred faces are more eloquent and tell another story  where they have gone we will go also not very greatly fearing what they have endured unbroken we also god helping us will make a shift to bear  not only is the presence of the aged in itself remedial but their minds are stored with antidotes wisdom’s simples plain considerations overlooked by youth  they have matter to communicate be they never so stupid  their talk is not merely literature it is great literature classic in virtue of the speaker’s detachment studded like a book of travel with things we should not otherwise have learnt  in virtue i have said of the speaker’s detachment—and this is why of two old men the one who is not your father speaks to you with the more sensible authority for in the paternal relation the oldest have lively interests and remain still young  thus i have known two young men great friends each swore by the other’s father the father of each swore by the other lad and yet each pair of parent and child were perpetually by the ears this is typical it reads like the germ of some kindly comedy  the old appear in conversation in two characters the critically silent and the garrulous anecdotic  the last is perhaps what we look for it is perhaps the more instructive  an old gentleman well on in years sits handsomely and naturally in the bowwindow of his age scanning experience with reverted eye and chirping and smiling communicates the accidents and reads the lesson of his long career  opinions are strengthened indeed but they are also weeded out in the course of years  what remains steadily present to the eye of the retired veteran in his hermitage what still ministers to his content what still quickens his old honest heart—these are “the real longlived things” that whitman tells us to prefer  where youth agrees with age not where they differ wisdom lies and it is when the young disciple finds his heart to beat in tune with his graybearded teacher’s that a lesson may be learned  i have known one old gentleman whom i may name for he is now gathered to his stock—robert hunter sheriff of dumbarton and author of an excellent lawbook still reedited and republished  whether he was originally big or little is more than i can guess  when i knew him he was all fallen away and fallen in crooked and shrunken buckled into a stiff waistcoat for support troubled by ailments which kept him hobbling in and out of the room one foot gouty a wig for decency not for deception on his head close shaved except under his chin—and for that he never failed to apologise for it went sore against the traditions of his life  you can imagine how he would fare in a novel by miss mather yet this rag of a chelsea veteran lived to his last year in the plenitude of all that is best in man brimming with human kindness and staunch as a roman soldier under his manifold infirmities  you could not say that he had lost his memory for he would repeat shakespeare and webster and jeremy taylor and burke by the page together but the parchment was filled up there was no room for fresh inscriptions and he was capable of repeating the same anecdote on many successive visits his voice survived in its full power and he took a pride in using it on his last voyage as commissioner of lighthouses he hailed a ship at sea and made himself clearly audible without a speaking trumpet ruffling the while with a proper vanity in his achievement  he had a habit of eking out his words with interrogative hems which was puzzling and a little wearisome suited ill with his appearance and seemed a survival from some former stage of bodily portliness  of yore when he was a great pedestrian and no enemy to good claret he may have pointed with these minute guns his allocutions to the bench  his humour was perfectly equable set beyond the reach of fate gout rheumatism stone and gravel might have combined their forces against that frail tabernacle but when i came round on sunday evening he would lay aside jeremy taylor’s life of christ and greet me with the same open brow the same kind formality of manner  his opinions and sympathies dated the man almost to a decade he had begun life under his mother’s influence as an admirer of junius but on maturer knowledge had transferred his admiration to burke  he cautioned me with entire gravity to be punctilious in writing english never to forget that i was a scotchman that english was a foreign tongue and that if i attempted the colloquial i should certainly be shamed the remark was apposite i suppose in the days of david hume scott was too new for him he had known the author—known him too for a tory and to the genuine classic a contemporary is always something of a trouble  he had the old serious love of the play had even as he was proud to tell played a certain part in the history of shakespearian revivals for he had successfully pressed on murray of the old edinburgh theatre the idea of producing shakespeare’s fairy pieces with great scenic display  a moderate in religion he was much struck in the last years of his life by a conversation with two young lads revivalists “h’m” he would say—“new to me  i have had—h’m—no such experience”  it struck him not with pain rather with a solemn philosophic interest that he a christian as he hoped and a christian of so old a standing should hear these young fellows talking of his own subject his own weapons that he had fought the battle of life with—“and—h’m—not understand”  in this wise and graceful attitude he did justice to himself and others reposed unshaken in his old beliefs and recognised their limits without anger or alarm  his last recorded remark on the last night of his life was after he had been arguing against calvinism with his minister and was interrupted by an intolerable pang  “after all” he said “of all the ’isms i know none so bad as rheumatism”  my own last sight of him was some time before when we dined together at an inn he had been on circuit for he stuck to his duties like a chief part of his existence and i remember it as the only occasion on which he ever soiled his lips with slang—a thing he loathed  we were both roberts and as we took our places at table he addressed me with a twinkle “we are just what you would call two bob”  he offered me port i remember as the proper milk of youth spoke of “twentyshilling notes” and throughout the meal was full of oldworld pleasantry and quaintness like an ancient boy on a holiday  but what i recall chiefly was his confession that he had never read othello to an end  shakespeare was his continual study  he loved nothing better than to display his knowledge and memory by adducing parallel passages from shakespeare passages where the same word was employed or the same idea differently treated  but othello had beaten him  “that noble gentleman and that noble lady—h’m—too painful for me”  the same night the hoardings were covered with posters “burlesque of othello” and the contrast blazed up in my mind like a bonfire  an unforgettable look it gave me into that kind man’s soul  his acquaintance was indeed a liberal and pious education  all the humanities were taught in that bare diningroom beside his gouty footstool  he was a piece of good advice he was himself the instance that pointed and adorned his various talk  nor could a young man have found elsewhere a place so set apart from envy fear discontent or any of the passions that debase a life so honest and composed a soul like an ancient violin so subdued to harmony responding to a touch in music—as in that diningroom with mr hunter chatting at the eleventh hour under the shadow of eternity fearless and gentle  the second class of old people are not anecdotic they are rather hearers than talkers listening to the young with an amused and critical attention  to have this sort of intercourse to perfection i think we must go to old ladies  women are better hearers than men to begin with they learn i fear in anguish to bear with the tedious and infantile vanity of the other sex and we will take more from a woman than even from the oldest man in the way of biting comment  biting comment is the chief part whether for profit or amusement in this business  the old lady that i have in my eye is a very caustic speaker her tongue after years of practice in absolute command whether for silence or attack if she chance to dislike you you will be tempted to curse the malignity of age  but if you chance to please even slightly you will be listened to with a particular laughing grace of sympathy and from time to time chastised as if in play with a parasol as heavy as a poleaxe  it requires a singular art as well as the vantageground of age to deal these stunning corrections among the coxcombs of the young  the pill is disguised in sugar of wit it is administered as a compliment—if you had not pleased you would not have been censured it is a personal affair—a hyphen a trait d’union between you and your censor age’s philandering for her pleasure and your good  incontestably the young man feels very much of a fool but he must be a perfect malvolio sick with selflove if he cannot take an open buffet and still smile  the correction of silence is what kills when you know you have transgressed and your friend says nothing and avoids your eye  if a man were made of guttapercha his heart would quail at such a moment  but when the word is out the worst is over and a fellow with any goodhumour at all may pass through a perfect hail of witty criticism every bare place on his soul hit to the quick with a shrewd missile and reappear as if after a dive tingling with a fine moral reaction and ready with a shrinking readiness onethird loath for a repetition of the discipline  there are few women not well sunned and ripened and perhaps toughened who can thus stand apart from a man and say the true thing with a kind of genial cruelty  still there are some—and i doubt if there be any man who can return the compliment  the class of man represented by vernon whitford in the egoist says indeed the true thing but he says it stockishly  vernon is a noble fellow and makes by the way a noble and instructive contrast to daniel deronda his conduct is the conduct of a man of honour but we agree with him against our consciences when he remorsefully considers “its astonishing dryness”  he is the best of men but the best of women manage to combine all that and something more their very faults assist them they are helped even by the falseness of their position in life  they can retire into the fortified camp of the proprieties  they can touch a subject and suppress it  the most adroit employ a somewhat elaborate reserve as a means to be frank much as they wear gloves when they shake hands  but a man has the full responsibility of his freedom cannot evade a question can scarce be silent without rudeness must answer for his words upon the moment and is not seldom left face to face with a damning choice between the more or less dishonourable wriggling of deronda and the downright woodenness of vernon whitford  but the superiority of women is perpetually menaced they do not sit throned on infirmities like the old they are suitors as well as sovereigns their vanity is engaged their affections are too apt to follow and hence much of the talk between the sexes degenerates into something unworthy of the name  the desire to please to shine with a certain softness of lustre and to draw a fascinating picture of oneself banishes from conversation all that is sterling and most of what is humorous  as soon as a strong current of mutual admiration begins to flow the human interest triumphs entirely over the intellectual and the commerce of words consciously or not becomes secondary to the commercing of eyes  but even where this ridiculous danger is avoided and a man and woman converse equally and honestly something in their nature or their education falsifies the strain  an instinct prompts them to agree and where that is impossible to agree to differ  should they neglect the warning at the first suspicion of an argument they find themselves in different hemispheres  about any point of business or conduct any actual affair demanding settlement a woman will speak and listen hear and answer arguments not only with natural wisdom but with candour and logical honesty  but if the subject of debate be something in the air an abstraction an excuse for talk a logical aunt sally then may the male debater instantly abandon hope he may employ reason adduce facts be supple be smiling be angry all shall avail him nothing what the woman said first that unless she has forgotten it she will repeat at the end  hence at the very junctures when a talk between men grows brighter and quicker and begins to promise to bear fruit talk between the sexes is menaced with dissolution  the point of difference the point of interest is evaded by the brilliant woman under a shower of irrelevant conversational rockets it is bridged by the discreet woman with a rustle of silk as she passes smoothly forward to the nearest point of safety  and this sort of prestidigitation juggling the dangerous topic out of sight until it can be reintroduced with safety in an altered shape is a piece of tactics among the true drawingroom queens  the drawingroom is indeed an artificial place it is so by our choice and for our sins  the subjection of women the ideal imposed upon them from the cradle and worn like a hairshirt with so much constancy their motherly superior tenderness to man’s vanity and selfimportance their managing arts—the arts of a civilised slave among goodnatured barbarians—are all painful ingredients and all help to falsify relations it is not till we get clear of that amusing artificial scene that genuine relations are founded or ideas honestly compared  in the garden on the road or the hillside or têteàtête and apart from interruptions occasions arise when we may learn much from any single woman and nowhere more often than in married life  marriage is one long conversation chequered by disputes  the disputes are valueless they but ingrain the difference the heroic heart of woman prompting her at once to nail her colours to the mast  but in the intervals almost unconsciously and with no desire to shine the whole material of life is turned over and over ideas are struck out and shared the two persons more and more adapt their notions one to suit the other and in process of time without sound of trumpet they conduct each other into new worlds of thought     chapter xii the character of dogs   the civilisation the manners and the morals of dogkind are to a great extent subordinated to those of his ancestral master man  this animal in many ways so superior has accepted a position of inferiority shares the domestic life and humours the caprices of the tyrant  but the potentate like the british in india pays small regard to the character of his willing client judges him with listless glances and condemns him in a byword  listless have been the looks of his admirers who have exhausted idle terms of praise and buried the poor soul below exaggerations  and yet more idle and if possible more unintelligent has been the attitude of his express detractors those who are very fond of dogs “but in their proper place” who say “poo’ fellow poo’ fellow” and are themselves far poorer who whet the knife of the vivisectionist or heat his oven who are not ashamed to admire “the creature’s instinct” and flying far beyond folly have dared to resuscitate the theory of animal machines  the “dog’s instinct” and the “automatondog” in this age of psychology and science sound like strange anachronisms an automaton he certainly is a machine working independently of his control the heart like the millwheel keeping all in motion and the consciousness like a person shut in the mill garret enjoying the view out of the window and shaken by the thunder of the stones an automaton in one corner of which a living spirit is confined an automaton like man  instinct again he certainly possesses  inherited aptitudes are his inherited frailties  some things he at once views and understands as though he were awakened from a sleep as though he came “trailing clouds of glory”  but with him as with man the field of instinct is limited its utterances are obscure and occasional and about the far larger part of life both the dog and his master must conduct their steps by deduction and observation  the leading distinction between dog and man after and perhaps before the different duration of their lives is that the one can speak and that the other cannot  the absence of the power of speech confines the dog in the development of his intellect  it hinders him from many speculations for words are the beginning of metaphysic  at the same blow it saves him from many superstitions and his silence has won for him a higher name for virtue than his conduct justifies  the faults of the dog are many he is vainer than man singularly greedy of notice singularly intolerant of ridicule suspicious like the deaf jealous to the degree of frenzy and radically devoid of truth  the day of an intelligent small dog is passed in the manufacture and the laborious communication of falsehood he lies with his tail he lies with his eye he lies with his protesting paw and when he rattles his dish or scratches at the door his purpose is other than appears  but he has some apology to offer for the vice  many of the signs which form his dialect have come to bear an arbitrary meaning clearly understood both by his master and himself yet when a new want arises he must either invent a new vehicle of meaning or wrest an old one to a different purpose and this necessity frequently recurring must tend to lessen his idea of the sanctity of symbols meanwhile the dog is clear in his own conscience and draws with a human nicety the distinction between formal and essential truth  of his punning perversions his legitimate dexterity with symbols he is even vain but when he has told and been detected in a lie there is not a hair upon his body but confesses guilt  to a dog of gentlemanly feeling theft and falsehood are disgraceful vices  the canine like the human gentleman demands in his misdemeanours montaigne’s “je ne sais quoi de généreux”  he is never more than half ashamed of having barked or bitten and for those faults into which he has been led by the desire to shine before a lady of his race he retains even under physical correction a share of pride  but to be caught lying if he understands it instantly uncurls his fleece  just as among dull observers he preserves a name for truth the dog has been credited with modesty  it is amazing how the use of language blunts the faculties of man—that because vain glory finds no vent in words creatures supplied with eyes have been unable to detect a fault so gross and obvious  if a small spoiled dog were suddenly to be endowed with speech he would prate interminably and still about himself when we had friends we should be forced to lock him in a garret and what with his whining jealousies and his foible for falsehood in a year’s time he would have gone far to weary out our love  i was about to compare him to sir willoughby patterne but the patternes have a manlier sense of their own merits and the parallel besides is ready  hans christian andersen as we behold him in his startling memoirs thrilling from top to toe with an excruciating vanity and scouting even along the street for shadows of offence—here was the talking dog  it is just this rage for consideration that has betrayed the dog into his satellite position as the friend of man  the cat an animal of franker appetites preserves his independence  but the dog with one eye ever on the audience has been wheedled into slavery and praised and patted into the renunciation of his nature  once he ceased hunting and became man’s platelicker the rubicon was crossed  thenceforth he was a gentleman of leisure and except the few whom we keep working the whole race grew more and more selfconscious mannered and affected  the number of things that a small dog does naturally is strangely small  enjoying better spirits and not crushed under material cares he is far more theatrical than average man  his whole life if he be a dog of any pretension to gallantry is spent in a vain show and in the hot pursuit of admiration  take out your puppy for a walk and you will find the little ball of fur clumsy stupid bewildered but natural  let but a few months pass and when you repeat the process you will find nature buried in convention  he will do nothing plainly but the simplest processes of our material life will all be bent into the forms of an elaborate and mysterious etiquette  instinct says the fool has awakened  but it is not so  some dogs—some at the very least—if they be kept separate from others remain quite natural and these when at length they meet with a companion of experience and have the game explained to them distinguish themselves by the severity of their devotion to its rules  i wish i were allowed to tell a story which would radiantly illuminate the point but men like dogs have an elaborate and mysterious etiquette  it is their bond of sympathy that both are the children of convention  the person man or dog who has a conscience is eternally condemned to some degree of humbug the sense of the law in their members fatally precipitates either towards a frozen and affected bearing  and the converse is true and in the elaborate and conscious manners of the dog moral opinions and the love of the ideal stand confessed  to follow for ten minutes in the street some swaggering canine cavalier is to receive a lesson in dramatic art and the cultured conduct of the body in every act and gesture you see him true to a refined conception and the dullest cur beholding him pricks up his ear and proceeds to imitate and parody that charming ease  for to be a highmannered and highminded gentleman careless affable and gay is the inborn pretension of the dog  the large dog so much lazier so much more weighed upon with matter so majestic in repose so beautiful in effort is born with the dramatic means to wholly represent the part  and it is more pathetic and perhaps more instructive to consider the small dog in his conscientious and imperfect efforts to outdo sir philip sidney  for the ideal of the dog is feudal and religious the everpresent polytheism the whipbearing olympus of mankind rules them on the one hand on the other their singular difference of size and strength among themselves effectually prevents the appearance of the democratic notion  or we might more exactly compare their society to the curious spectacle presented by a school—ushers monitors and big and little boys—qualified by one circumstance the introduction of the other sex  in each we should observe a somewhat similar tension of manner and somewhat similar points of honour  in each the larger animal keeps a contemptuous good humour in each the smaller annoys him with wasplike impudence certain of practical immunity in each we shall find a double life producing double characters and an excursive and noisy heroism combined with a fair amount of practical timidity  i have known dogs and i have known school heroes that set aside the fur could hardly have been told apart and if we desire to understand the chivalry of old we must turn to the school playfields or the dungheap where the dogs are trooping  woman with the dog has been long enfranchised  incessant massacre of female innocents has changed the proportions of the sexes and perverted their relations  thus when we regard the manners of the dog we see a romantic and monogamous animal once perhaps as delicate as the cat at war with impossible conditions  man has much to answer for and the part he plays is yet more damnable and parlous than corin’s in the eyes of touchstone  but his intervention has at least created an imperial situation for the rare surviving ladies  in that society they reign without a rival conscious queens and in the only instance of a canine wifebeater that has ever fallen under my notice the criminal was somewhat excused by the circumstances of his story  he is a little very alert wellbred intelligent skye as black as a hat with a wet bramble for a nose and two cairngorms for eyes  to the human observer he is decidedly welllooking but to the ladies of his race he seems abhorrent a thorough elaborate gentleman of the plume and swordknot order he was born with a nice sense of gallantry to women  he took at their hands the most outrageous treatment i have heard him bleating like a sheep i have seen him streaming blood and his ear tattered like a regimental banner and yet he would scorn to make reprisals  nay more when a human lady upraised the contumelious whip against the very dame who had been so cruelly misusing him my little greatheart gave but one hoarse cry and fell upon the tyrant tooth and nail  this is the tale of a soul’s tragedy  after three years of unavailing chivalry he suddenly in one hour threw off the yoke of obligation had he been shakespeare he would then have written troilus and cressida to brand the offending sex but being only a little dog he began to bite them  the surprise of the ladies whom he attacked indicated the monstrosity of his offence but he had fairly beaten off his better angel fairly committed moral suicide for almost in the same hour throwing aside the last rags of decency he proceeded to attack the aged also  the fact is worth remark showing as it does that ethical laws are common both to dogs and men and that with both a single deliberate violation of the conscience loosens all  “but while the lamp holds on to burn” says the paraphrase “the greatest sinner may return”  i have been cheered to see symptoms of effectual penitence in my sweet ruffian and by the handling that he accepted uncomplainingly the other day from an indignant fair one i begin to hope the period of sturm und drang is closed  all these little gentlemen are subtle casuists  the duty to the female dog is plain but where competing duties rise down they will sit and study them out like jesuit confessors  i knew another little skye somewhat plain in manner and appearance but a creature compact of amiability and solid wisdom  his family going abroad for a winter he was received for that period by an uncle in the same city  the winter over his own family home again and his own house of which he was very proud reopened he found himself in a dilemma between two conflicting duties of loyalty and gratitude  his old friends were not to be neglected but it seemed hardly decent to desert the new  this was how he solved the problem  every morning as soon as the door was opened off posted coolin to his uncle’s visited the children in the nursery saluted the whole family and was back at home in time for breakfast and his bit of fish  nor was this done without a sacrifice on his part sharply felt for he had to forego the particular honour and jewel of his day—his morning’s walk with my father  and perhaps from this cause he gradually wearied of and relaxed the practice and at length returned entirely to his ancient habits  but the same decision served him in another and more distressing case of divided duty which happened not long after  he was not at all a kitchen dog but the cook had nursed him with unusual kindness during the distemper and though he did not adore her as he adored my father—although born snob he was critically conscious of her position as “only a servant”—he still cherished for her a special gratitude  well the cook left and retired some streets away to lodgings of her own and there was coolin in precisely the same situation with any young gentleman who has had the inestimable benefit of a faithful nurse  the canine conscience did not solve the problem with a pound of tea at christmas  no longer content to pay a flying visit it was the whole forenoon that he dedicated to his solitary friend  and so day by day he continued to comfort her solitude until for some reason which i could never understand and cannot approve he was kept locked up to break him of the graceful habit  here it is not the similarity it is the difference that is worthy of remark the clearly marked degrees of gratitude and the proportional duration of his visits  anything further removed from instinct it were hard to fancy and one is even stirred to a certain impatience with a character so destitute of spontaneity so passionless in justice and so priggishly obedient to the voice of reason  there are not many dogs like this good coolin and not many people  but the type is one well marked both in the human and the canine family gallantry was not his aim but a solid and somewhat oppressive respectability  he was a sworn foe to the unusual and the conspicuous a praiser of the golden mean a kind of city uncle modified by cheeryble and as he was precise and conscientious in all the steps of his own blameless course he looked for the same precision and an even greater gravity in the bearing of his deity my father  it was no sinecure to be coolin’s idol he was exacting like a rigid parent and at every sign of levity in the man whom he respected he announced loudly the death of virtue and the proximate fall of the pillars of the earth  i have called him a snob but all dogs are so though in varying degrees it is hard to follow their snobbery among themselves for though i think we can perceive distinctions of rank we cannot grasp what is the criterion  thus in edinburgh in a good part of the town there were several distinct societies or clubs that met in the morning to—the phrase is technical—to “rake the backets” in a troop  a friend of mine the master of three dogs was one day surprised to observe that they had left one club and joined another but whether it was a rise or a fall and the result of an invitation or an expulsion was more than he could guess and this illustrates pointedly our ignorance of the real life of dogs their social ambitions and their social hierarchies  at least in their dealings with men they are not only conscious of sex but of the difference of station  and that in the most snobbish manner for the poor man’s dog is not offended by the notice of the rich and keeps all his ugly feeling for those poorer or more ragged than his master  and again for every station they have an ideal of behaviour to which the master under pain of derogation will do wisely to conform  how often has not a cold glance of an eye informed me that my dog was disappointed and how much more gladly would he not have taken a beating than to be thus wounded in the seat of piety  i knew one disrespectable dog  he was far liker a cat cared little or nothing for men with whom he merely coexisted as we do with cattle and was entirely devoted to the art of poaching  a house would not hold him and to live in a town was what he refused  he led i believe a life of troubled but genuine pleasure and perished beyond all question in a trap  but this was an exception a marked reversion to the ancestral type like the hairy human infant  the true dog of the nineteenth century to judge by the remainder of my fairly large acquaintance is in love with respectability  a streetdog was once adopted by a lady while still an arab he had done as arabs do gambolling in the mud charging into butchers’ stalls a cathunter a sturdy beggar a common rogue and vagabond but with his rise into society he laid aside these inconsistent pleasures  he stole no more he hunted no more cats and conscious of his collar he ignored his old companions  yet the canine upper class was never brought to recognise the upstart and from that hour except for human countenance he was alone  friendless shorn of his sports and the habits of a lifetime he still lived in a glory of happiness content with his acquired respectability and with no care but to support it solemnly  are we to condemn or praise this selfmade dog we praise his human brother  and thus to conquer vicious habits is as rare with dogs as with men  with the more part for all their scruplemongering and moral thought the vices that are born with them remain invincible throughout and they live all their years glorying in their virtues but still the slaves of their defects  thus the sage coolin was a thief to the last among a thousand peccadilloes a whole goose and a whole cold leg of mutton lay upon his conscience but woggs 128 whose soul’s shipwreck in the matter of gallantry i have recounted above has only twice been known to steal and has often nobly conquered the temptation  the eighth is his favourite commandment  there is something painfully human in these unequal virtues and mortal frailties of the best  still more painful is the bearing of those “stammering professors” in the house of sickness and under the terror of death  it is beyond a doubt to me that somehow or other the dog connects together or confounds the uneasiness of sickness and the consciousness of guilt  to the pains of the body he often adds the tortures of the conscience and at these times his haggard protestations form in regard to the human deathbed a dreadful parody or parallel  i once supposed that i had found an inverse relation between the double etiquette which dogs obey and that those who were most addicted to the showy street life among other dogs were less careful in the practice of home virtues for the tyrant man  but the female dog that mass of carneying affectations shines equally in either sphere rules her rough posse of attendant swains with unwearying tact and gusto and with her master and mistress pushes the arts of insinuation to their crowning point  the attention of man and the regard of other dogs flatter it would thus appear the same sensibility but perhaps if we could read the canine heart they would be found to flatter it in very different degrees  dogs live with man as courtiers round a monarch steeped in the flattery of his notice and enriched with sinecures  to push their favour in this world of pickings and caresses is perhaps the business of their lives and their joys may lie outside  i am in despair at our persistent ignorance  i read in the lives of our companions the same processes of reason the same antique and fatal conflicts of the right against the wrong and of unbitted nature with too rigid custom i see them with our weaknesses vain false inconstant against appetite and with our one stalk of virtue devoted to the dream of an ideal and yet as they hurry by me on the street with tail in air or come singly to solicit my regard i must own the secret purport of their lives is still inscrutable to man  is man the friend or is he the patron only  have they indeed forgotten nature’s voice or are those moments snatched from courtiership when they touch noses with the tinker’s mongrel the brief reward and pleasure of their artificial lives  doubtless when man shares with his dog the toils of a profession and the pleasures of an art as with the shepherd or the poacher the affection warms and strengthens till it fills the soul  but doubtless also the masters are in many cases the object of a merely interested cultus sitting aloft like louis quatorze giving and receiving flattery and favour and the dogs like the majority of men have but foregone their true existence and become the dupes of their ambition     chapter xiii a penny plain and twopence coloured   these words will be familiar to all students of skelt’s juvenile drama that national monument after having changed its name to park’s to webb’s to redington’s and last of all to pollock’s has now become for the most part a memory  some of its pillars like stonehenge are still afoot the rest clean vanished  it may be the museum numbers a full set and mr ionides perhaps or else her gracious majesty may boast their great collections but to the plain private person they are become like raphaels unattainable  i have at different times possessed aladdin the red rover the blind boy the old oak chest the wood dæmon jack sheppard the miller and his men der freischütz the smuggler the forest of bondy robin hood the waterman richard i my poll and my partner joe the inchcape bell imperfect and threefingered jack the terror of jamaica and i have assisted others in the illumination of maid of the inn and the battle of waterloo  in this rollcall of stirring names you read the evidences of a happy childhood and though not half of them are still to be procured of any living stationer in the mind of their once happy owner all survive kaleidoscopes of changing pictures echoes of the past  there stands i fancy to this day but now how fallen a certain stationer’s shop at a corner of the wide thoroughfare that joins the city of my childhood with the sea  when upon any saturday we made a party to behold the ships we passed that corner and since in those days i loved a ship as a man loves burgundy or daybreak this of itself had been enough to hallow it  but there was more than that  in the leith walk window all the year round there stood displayed a theatre in working order with a “forest set” a “combat” and a few “robbers carousing” in the slides and below and about dearer tenfold to me the plays themselves those budgets of romance lay tumbled one upon another  long and often have i lingered there with empty pockets  one figure we shall say was visible in the first plate of characters bearded pistol in hand or drawing to his ear the clothyard arrow i would spell the name was it macaire or long tom coffin or grindoff 2d dress  o how i would long to see the rest how—if the name by chance were hidden—i would wonder in what play he figured and what immortal legend justified his attitude and strange apparel  and then to go within to announce yourself as an intending purchaser and closely watched be suffered to undo those bundles and breathlessly devour those pages of gesticulating villains epileptic combats bosky forests palaces and warships frowning fortresses and prison vaults—it was a giddy joy  that shop which was dark and smelt of bibles was a loadstone rock for all that bore the name of boy  they could not pass it by nor having entered leave it  it was a place besieged the shopmen like the jews rebuilding salem had a double task  they kept us at the stick’s end frowned us down snatched each play out of our hand ere we were trusted with another and increditable as it may sound used to demand of us upon our entrance like banditti if we came with money or with empty hand  old mr smith himself worn out with my eternal vacillation once swept the treasures from before me with the cry “i do not believe child that you are an intending purchaser at all”  these were the dragons of the garden but for such joys of paradise we could have faced the terror of jamaica himself  every sheet we fingered was another lightning glance into obscure delicious story it was like wallowing in the raw stuff of storybooks  i know nothing to compare with it save now and then in dreams when i am privileged to read in certain unwrit stories of adventure from which i awake to find the world all vanity  the crux of buridan’s donkey was as nothing to the uncertainty of the boy as he handled and lingered and doated on these bundles of delight there was a physical pleasure in the sight and touch of them which he would jealously prolong and when at length the deed was done the play selected and the impatient shopman had brushed the rest into the gray portfolio and the boy was forth again a little late for dinner the lamps springing into light in the blue winter’s even and the miller or the rover or some kindred drama clutched against his side—on what gay feet he ran and how he laughed aloud in exultation  i can hear that laughter still  out of all the years of my life i can recall but one homecoming to compare with these and that was on the night when i brought back with me the arabian entertainments in the fat old doublecolumned volume with the prints  i was just well into the story of the hunchback i remember when my clergymangrandfather a man we counted pretty stiff came in behind me  i grew blind with terror  but instead of ordering the book away he said he envied me  ah well he might  the purchase and the first halfhour at home that was the summit thenceforth the interest declined by little and little  the fable as set forth in the playbook proved to be not worthy of the scenes and characters what fable would not  such passages as “scene 6 the hermitage  night set scene  place back of scene 1 no 2 at back of stage and hermitage fig 2 out of set piece r h in a slanting direction”—such passages i say though very practical are hardly to be called good reading  indeed as literature these dramas did not much appeal to me  i forget the very outline of the plots  of the blind boy beyond the fact that he was a most injured prince and once i think abducted i know nothing  and the old oak chest what was it all about that proscript 1st dress that prodigious number of banditti that old woman with the broom and the magnificent kitchen in the third act was it in the third—they are all fallen in a deliquium swim faintly in my brain and mix and vanish  i cannot deny that joy attended the illumination nor can i quite forget that child who wilfully foregoing pleasure stoops to “twopence coloured”  with crimson lake hark to the sound of it—crimson lake—the horns of elfland are not richer on the ear—with crimson lake and prussian blue a certain purple is to be compounded which for cloaks especially titian could not equal  the latter colour with gamboge a hated name although an exquisite pigment supplied a green of such a savoury greenness that today my heart regrets it  nor can i recall without a tender weakness the very aspect of the water where i dipped my brush  yes there was pleasure in the painting  but when all was painted it is needless to deny it all was spoiled  you might indeed set up a scene or two to look at but to cut the figures out was simply sacrilege nor could any child twice court the tedium the worry and the longdrawn disenchantment of an actual performance  two days after the purchase the honey had been sucked  parents used to complain they thought i wearied of my play  it was not so no more than a person can be said to have wearied of his dinner when he leaves the bones and dishes i had got the marrow of it and said grace  then was the time to turn to the back of the playbook and to study that enticing double file of names where poetry for the true child of skelt reigned happy and glorious like her majesty the queen  much as i have travelled in these realms of gold i have yet seen upon that map or abstract names of el dorados that still haunt the ear of memory and are still but names  the floating beacon—why was that denied me or the wreck ashore  sixteenstring jack whom i did not even guess to be a highwayman troubled me awake and haunted my slumbers and there is one sequence of three from that enchanted calender that i still at times recall like a loved verse of poetry lodoiska silver palace echo of westminster bridge  names bare names are surely more to children than we poor grownup obliterated fools remember  the name of skelt itself has always seemed a part and parcel of the charm of his productions  it may be different with the rose but the attraction of this paper drama sensibly declined when webb had crept into the rubric a poor cuckoo flaunting in skelt’s nest  and now we have reached pollock sounding deeper gulfs  indeed this name of skelt appears so stagey and piratic that i will adopt it boldly to design these qualities  skeltery then is a quality of much art  it is even to be found with reverence be it said among the works of nature  the stagey is its generic name but it is an old insular homebred staginess not french domestically british not of today but smacking of o smith fitzball and the great age of melodrama a peculiar fragrance haunting it uttering its unimportant message in a tone of voice that has the charm of fresh antiquity  i will not insist upon the art of skelt’s purveyors  these wonderful characters that once so thrilled our soul with their bold attitude array of deadly engines and incomparable costume today look somewhat pallidly the extreme hard favour of the heroine strikes me i had almost said with pain the villain’s scowl no longer thrills me like a trumpet and the scenes themselves those once unparalleled landscapes seem the efforts of a prentice hand  so much of fault we find but on the other side the impartial critic rejoices to remark the presence of a great unity of gusto of those direct claptrap appeals which a man is dead and buriable when he fails to answer of the footlight glamour the readymade barefaced transpontine picturesque a thing not one with cold reality but how much dearer to the mind  the scenery of skeltdom—or shall we say the kingdom of transpontus—had a prevailing character  whether it set forth poland as in the blind boy or bohemia with the miller and his men or italy with the old oak chest still it was transpontus  a botanist could tell it by the plants  the hollyhock was all pervasive running wild in deserts the dock was common and the bending reed and overshadowing these were poplar palm potato tree and quercus skeltica—brave growths  the caves were all embowelled in the surreyside formation the soil was all betrodden by the light pump of t p cooke  skelt to be sure had yet another an oriental string he held the gorgeous east in fee and in the new quarter of hyères say in the garden of the hotel des iles d’or you may behold these blessed visions realised  but on these i will not dwell they were an outwork it was in the occidental scenery that skelt was all himself  it had a strong flavour of england it was a sort of indigestion of england and dropscenes and i am bound to say was charming  how the roads wander how the castle sits upon the hill how the sun eradiates from behind the cloud and how the congregated clouds themselves uproll as stiff as bolsters  here is the cottage interior the usual first flat with the cloak upon the nail the rosaries of onions the gun and powderhorn and cornercupboard here is the inn this drama must be nautical i foresee captain luff and bold bob bowsprit with the red curtain pipes spittoons and eightday clock and there again is that impressive dungeon with the chains which was so dull to colour  england the hedgerow elms the thin brick houses windmills glimpses of the navigable thames—england when at last i came to visit it was only skelt made evident to cross the border was for the scotsman to come home to skelt there was the innsign and there the horsetrough all foreshadowed in the faithful skelt  if at the ripe age of fourteen years i bought a certain cudgel got a friend to load it and thenceforward walked the tame ways of the earth my own ideal radiating pure romance—still i was but a puppet in the hand of skelt the original of that regretted bludgeon and surely the antitype of all the bludgeon kind greatly improved from cruikshank had adorned the hand of jonathan wild pl i  “this is mastering me” as whitman cries upon some lesser provocation  what am i what are life art letters the world but what my skelt has made them  he stamped himself upon my immaturity  the world was plain before i knew him a poor penny world but soon it was all coloured with romance  if i go to the theatre to see a good old melodrama ’tis but skelt a little faded  if i visit a bold scene in nature skelt would have been bolder there had been certainly a castle on that mountain and the hollow tree—that set piece—i seem to miss it in the foreground  indeed out of this cutanddry dull swaggering obtrusive and infantile art i seem to have learned the very spirit of my life’s enjoyment met there the shadows of the characters i was to read about and love in a late future got the romance of der freischütz long ere i was to hear of weber or the mighty formes acquired a gallery of scenes and characters with which in the silent theatre of the brain i might enact all novels and romances and took from these rude cuts an enduring and transforming pleasure  reader—and yourself  a word of moral it appears that b pollock late j redington no 73 hoxton street not only publishes twentythree of these old stage favourites but owns the necessary plates and displays a modest readiness to issue other thirtythree  if you love art folly or the bright eyes of children speed to pollock’s or to clarke’s of garrick street  in pollock’s list of publicanda i perceive a pair of my ancient aspirations wreck ashore and sixteenstring jack and i cherish the belief that when these shall see once more the light of day b pollock will remember this apologist  but indeed i have a dream at times that is not all a dream  i seem to myself to wander in a ghostly street—e w i think the postal district—close below the fool’scap of st paul’s and yet within easy hearing of the echo of the abbey bridge  there in a dim shop low in the roof and smelling strong of glue and footlights i find myself in quaking treaty with great skelt himself the aboriginal all dusty from the tomb  i buy with what a choking heart—i buy them all all but the pantomimes i pay my mental money and go forth and lo the packets are dust     chapter xiv a gossip on a novel of dumas’s   the books that we reread the oftenest are not always those that we admire the most we choose and we revisit them for many and various reasons as we choose and revisit human friends  one or two of scott’s novels shakespeare molière montaigne the egoist and the vicomte de bragelonne form the inner circle of my intimates  behind these comes a good troop of dear acquaintances the pilgrim’s progress in the front rank the bible in spain not far behind  there are besides a certain number that look at me with reproach as i pass them by on my shelves books that i once thumbed and studied houses which were once like home to me but where i now rarely visit  i am on these sad terms and blush to confess it with wordsworth horace burns and hazlitt last of all there is the class of book that has its hour of brilliancy—glows sings charms and then fades again into insignificance until the fit return  chief of those who thus smile and frown on me by turns i must name virgil and herrick who were they but      “their sometime selves the same throughout the year”  must have stood in the first company with the six names of my continual literary intimates  to these six incongruous as they seem i have long been faithful and hope to be faithful to the day of death  i have never read the whole of montaigne but i do not like to be long without reading some of him and my delight in what i do read never lessens  of shakespeare i have read all but richard iii henry vi titus andronicus and all’s well that ends well and these having already made all suitable endeavour i now know that i shall never read—to make up for which unfaithfulness i could read much of the rest for ever  of molière—surely the next greatest name of christendom—i could tell a very similar story but in a little corner of a little essay these princes are too much out of place and i prefer to pay my fealty and pass on  how often i have read guy mannering rob roy or redgauntlet i have no means of guessing having begun young  but it is either four or five times that i have read the egoist and either five or six that i have read the vicomte de bragelonne  some who would accept the others may wonder that i should have spent so much of this brief life of ours over a work so little famous as the last and indeed i am surprised myself not at my own devotion but the coldness of the world  my acquaintance with the vicomte began somewhat indirectly in the year of grace 1863 when i had the advantage of studying certain illustrated dessert plates in a hotel at nice  the name of d’artagnan in the legends i already saluted like an old friend for i had met it the year before in a work of miss yonge’s  my first perusal was in one of those pirated editions that swarmed at that time out of brussels and ran to such a troop of neat and dwarfish volumes  i understood but little of the merits of the book my strongest memory is of the execution of d’eyméric and lyodot—a strange testimony to the dulness of a boy who could enjoy the roughandtumble in the place de grêve and forget d’artagnan’s visits to the two financiers  my next reading was in wintertime when i lived alone upon the pentlands  i would return in the early night from one of my patrols with the shepherd a friendly face would meet me in the door a friendly retriever scurry upstairs to fetch my slippers and i would sit down with the vicomte for a long silent solitary lamplight evening by the fire  and yet i know not why i call it silent when it was enlivened with such a clatter of horseshoes and such a rattle of musketry and such a stir of talk or why i call those evenings solitary in which i gained so many friends i would rise from my book and pull the blind aside and see the snow and the glittering hollies chequer a scotch garden and the winter moonlight brighten the white hills  thence i would turn again to that crowded and sunny field of life in which it was so easy to forget myself my cares and my surroundings a place busy as a city bright as a theatre thronged with memorable faces and sounding with delightful speech  i carried the thread of that epic into my slumbers i woke with it unbroken i rejoiced to plunge into the book again at breakfast it was with a pang that i must lay it down and turn to my own labours for no part of the world has ever seemed to me so charming as these pages and not even my friends are quite so real perhaps quite so dear as d’artagnan  since then i have been going to and fro at very brief intervals in my favourite book and i have now just risen from my last let me call it my fifth perusal having liked it better and admired it more seriously than ever  perhaps i have a sense of ownership being so well known in these six volumes  perhaps i think that d’artagnan delights to have me read of him and louis quatorze is gratified and fouquet throws me a look and aramis although he knows i do not love him yet plays to me with his best graces as to an old patron of the show  perhaps if i am not careful something may befall me like what befell george iv about the battle of waterloo and i may come to fancy the vicomte one of the first and heaven knows the best of my own works  at least i avow myself a partisan and when i compare the popularity of the vicomte with that of monte cristo or its own elder brother the trois mousquetaires i confess i am both pained and puzzled  to those who have already made acquaintance with the titular hero in the pages of vingt ans après perhaps the name may act as a deterrent  a man might well stand back if he supposed he were to follow for six volumes so wellconducted so finespoken and withal so dreary a cavalier as bragelonne  but the fear is idle  i may be said to have passed the best years of my life in these six volumes and my acquaintance with raoul has never gone beyond a bow and when he who has so long pretended to be alive is at last suffered to pretend to be dead i am sometimes reminded of a saying in an earlier volume “enfin dit miss stewart”—and it was of bragelonne she spoke—“enfin il a fait quelquechose c’est ma foi bien heureux”  i am reminded of it as i say and the next moment when athos dies of his death and my dear d’artagnan bursts into his storm of sobbing i can but deplore my flippancy  or perhaps it is la vallière that the reader of vingt ans après is inclined to flee  well he is right there too though not so right louise is no success  her creator has spared no pains she is wellmeant not illdesigned sometimes has a word that rings out true sometimes if only for a breath she may even engage our sympathies  but i have never envied the king his triumph  and so far from pitying bragelonne for his defeat i could wish him no worse not for lack of malice but imagination than to be wedded to that lady  madame enchants me i can forgive that royal minx her most serious offences i can thrill and soften with the king on that memorable occasion when he goes to upbraid and remains to flirt and when it comes to the “allons aimezmoi donc” it is my heart that melts in the bosom of de guiche not so with louise  readers cannot fail to have remarked that what an author tells us of the beauty or the charm of his creatures goes for nought that we know instantly better that the heroine cannot open her mouth but what all in a moment the fine phrases of preparation fall from round her like the robes from cinderella and she stands before us selfbetrayed as a poor ugly sickly wench or perhaps a strapping marketwoman  authors at least know it well a heroine will too often start the trick of “getting ugly” and no disease is more difficult to cure  i said authors but indeed i had a side eye to one author in particular with whose works i am very well acquainted though i cannot read them and who has spent many vigils in this cause sitting beside his ailing puppets and like a magician wearying his art to restore them to youth and beauty  there are others who ride too high for these misfortunes  who doubts the loveliness of rosalind  arden itself was not more lovely  who ever questioned the perennial charm of rose jocelyn lucy desborough or clara middleton fair women with fair names the daughters of george meredith  elizabeth bennet has but to speak and i am at her knees  ah these are the creators of desirable women  they would never have fallen in the mud with dumas and poor la vallière  it is my only consolation that not one of all of them except the first could have plucked at the moustache of d’artagnan  or perhaps again a proportion of readers stumble at the threshold  in so vast a mansion there were sure to be back stairs and kitchen offices where no one would delight to linger but it was at least unhappy that the vestibule should be so badly lighted and until in the seventeenth chapter d’artagnan sets off to seek his friends i must confess the book goes heavily enough  but from thenceforward what a feast is spread  monk kidnapped d’artagnan enriched mazarin’s death the ever delectable adventure of belle isle wherein aramis outwits d’artagnan with its epilogue vol v chap xxviii where d’artagnan regains the moral superiority the love adventures at fontainebleau with st aignan’s story of the dryad and the business of de guiche de wardes and manicamp aramis made general of the jesuits aramis at the bastille the night talk in the forest of sénart belle isle again with the death of porthos and last but not least the taming of d’artagnan the untamable under the lash of the young king  what other novel has such epic variety and nobility of incident often if you will impossible often of the order of an arabian story and yet all based in human nature  for if you come to that what novel has more human nature not studied with the microscope but seen largely in plain daylight with the natural eye what novel has more good sense and gaiety and wit and unflagging admirable literary skill  good souls i suppose must sometimes read it in the blackguard travesty of a translation  but there is no style so untranslatable light as a whipped trifle strong as silk wordy like a village tale pat like a general’s despatch with every fault yet never tedious with no merit yet inimitably right  and once more to make an end of commendations what novel is inspired with a more unstrained or a more wholesome morality  yes in spite of miss yonge who introduced me to the name of d’artagnan only to dissuade me from a nearer knowledge of the man i have to add morality  there is no quite good book without a good morality but the world is wide and so are morals  out of two people who have dipped into sir richard burton’s thousand and one nights one shall have been offended by the animal details another to whom these were harmless perhaps even pleasing shall yet have been shocked in his turn by the rascality and cruelty of all the characters  of two readers again one shall have been pained by the morality of a religious memoir one by that of the vicomte de bragelonne  and the point is that neither need be wrong  we shall always shock each other both in life and art we cannot get the sun into our pictures nor the abstract right if there be such a thing into our books enough if in the one there glimmer some hint of the great light that blinds us from heaven enough if in the other there shine even upon foul details a spirit of magnanimity  i would scarce send to the vicomte a reader who was in quest of what we may call puritan morality  the ventripotent mulatto the great eater worker earner and waster the man of much and witty laughter the man of the great heart and alas of the doubtful honesty is a figure not yet clearly set before the world he still awaits a sober and yet genial portrait but with whatever art that may be touched and whatever indulgence it will not be the portrait of a precisian  dumas was certainly not thinking of himself but of planchet when he put into the mouth of d’artagnan’s old servant this excellent profession “monsieur j’étais une de ces bonnes pâtes d’hommes que dieu a fait pour s’animer pendant un certain temps et pour trouver bonnes toutes choses qui accompagnent leur séjour sur la terre”  he was thinking as i say of planchet to whom the words are aptly fitted but they were fitted also to planchet’s creator and perhaps this struck him as he wrote for observe what follows “d’artagnan s’assit alors près de la fenêtre et cette philosophie de planchet lui ayant paru solide il y rêva”  in a man who finds all things good you will scarce expect much zeal for negative virtues the active alone will have a charm for him abstinence however wise however kind will always seem to such a judge entirely mean and partly impious  so with dumas  chastity is not near his heart nor yet to his own sore cost that virtue of frugality which is the armour of the artist  now in the vicomte he had much to do with the contest of fouquet and colbert  historic justice should be all upon the side of colbert of official honesty and fiscal competence and dumas knew it well three times at least he shows his knowledge once it is but flashed upon us and received with the laughter of fouquet himself in the jesting controversy in the gardens of saint mandé once it is touched on by aramis in the forest of sénart in the end it is set before us clearly in one dignified speech of the triumphant colbert  but in fouquet the waster the lover of good cheer and wit and art the swift transactor of much business “l’homme de bruit l’homme de plaisir l’homme qui n’est que parceque les autres sont” dumas saw something of himself and drew the figure the more tenderly  it is to me even touching to see how he insists on fouquet’s honour not seeing you might think that unflawed honour is impossible to spendthrifts but rather perhaps in the light of his own life seeing it too well and clinging the more to what was left  honour can survive a wound it can live and thrive without a member  the man rebounds from his disgrace he begins fresh foundations on the ruins of the old and when his sword is broken he will do valiantly with his dagger  so it is with fouquet in the book so it was with dumas on the battlefield of life  to cling to what is left of any damaged quality is virtue in the man but perhaps to sing its praises is scarcely to be called morality in the writer  and it is elsewhere it is in the character of d’artagnan that we must look for that spirit of morality which is one of the chief merits of the book makes one of the main joys of its perusal and sets it high above more popular rivals  athos with the coming of years has declined too much into the preacher and the preacher of a sapless creed but d’artagnan has mellowed into a man so witty rough kind and upright that he takes the heart by storm  there is nothing of the copybook about his virtues nothing of the drawingroom in his fine natural civility he will sail near the wind he is no district visitor—no wesley or robespierre his conscience is void of all refinement whether for good or evil but the whole man rings true like a good sovereign  readers who have approached the vicomte not across country but by the legitimate fivevolumed avenue of the mousquetaires and vingt ans après will not have forgotten d’artagnan’s ungentlemanly and perfectly improbable trick upon milady  what a pleasure it is then what a reward and how agreeable a lesson to see the old captain humble himself to the son of the man whom he had personated  here and throughout if i am to choose virtues for myself or my friends let me choose the virtues of d’artagnan  i do not say there is no character as well drawn in shakespeare i do say there is none that i love so wholly  there are many spiritual eyes that seem to spy upon our actions—eyes of the dead and the absent whom we imagine to behold us in our most private hours and whom we fear and scruple to offend our witnesses and judges  and among these even if you should think me childish i must count my d’artagnan—not d’artagnan of the memoirs whom thackeray pretended to prefer—a preference i take the freedom of saying in which he stands alone not the d’artagnan of flesh and blood but him of the ink and paper not nature’s but dumas’s  and this is the particular crown and triumph of the artist—not to be true merely but to be lovable not simply to convince but to enchant  there is yet another point in the vicomte which i find incomparable  i can recall no other work of the imagination in which the end of life is represented with so nice a tact  i was asked the other day if dumas made me laugh or cry  well in this my late fifth reading of the vicomte i did laugh once at the small coquelin de volière business and was perhaps a thought surprised at having done so to make up for it i smiled continually  but for tears i do not know  if you put a pistol to my throat i must own the tale trips upon a very airy foot—within a measurable distance of unreality and for those who like the big guns to be discharged and the great passions to appear authentically it may even seem inadequate from first to last  not so to me i cannot count that a poor dinner or a poor book where i meet with those i love and above all in this last volume i find a singular charm of spirit  it breathes a pleasant and a tonic sadness always brave never hysterical  upon the crowded noisy life of this long tale evening gradually falls and the lights are extinguished and the heroes pass away one by one  one by one they go and not a regret embitters their departure the young succeed them in their places louis quatorze is swelling larger and shining broader another generation and another france dawn on the horizon but for us and these old men whom we have loved so long the inevitable end draws near and is welcome  to read this well is to anticipate experience  ah if only when these hours of the long shadows fall for us in reality and not in figure we may hope to face them with a mind as quiet  but my paper is running out the siege guns are firing on the dutch frontier and i must say adieu for the fifth time to my old comrade fallen on the field of glory  adieu—rather au revoir  yet a sixth time dearest d’artagnan we shall kidnap monk and take horse together for belle isle     chapter xv a gossip on romance   in anything fit to be called by the name of reading the process itself should be absorbing and voluptuous we should gloat over a book be rapt clean out of ourselves and rise from the perusal our mind filled with the busiest kaleidoscopic dance of images incapable of sleep or of continuous thought  the words if the book be eloquent should run thenceforward in our ears like the noise of breakers and the story if it be a story repeat itself in a thousand coloured pictures to the eye it was for this last pleasure that we read so closely and loved our books so dearly in the bright troubled period of boyhood  eloquence and thought character and conversation were but obstacles to brush aside as we dug blithely after a certain sort of incident like a pig for truffles  for my part i liked a story to begin with an old wayside inn where “towards the close of the year 17” several gentlemen in threecocked hats were playing bowls  a friend of mine preferred the malabar coast in a storm with a ship beating to windward and a scowling fellow of herculean proportions striding along the beach he to be sure was a pirate  this was further afield than my homekeeping fancy loved to travel and designed altogether for a larger canvas than the tales that i affected  give me a highwayman and i was full to the brim a jacobite would do but the highwayman was my favourite dish  i can still hear that merry clatter of the hoofs along the moonlit lane night and the coming of day are still related in my mind with the doings of john rann or jerry abershaw and the words “postchaise” the “great north road” “ostler” and “nag” still sound in my ears like poetry  one and all at least and each with his particular fancy we read storybooks in childhood not for eloquence or character or thought but for some quality of the brute incident  that quality was not mere bloodshed or wonder  although each of these was welcome in its place the charm for the sake of which we read depended on something different from either my elders used to read novels aloud and i can still remember four different passages which i heard before i was ten with the same keen and lasting pleasure  one i discovered long afterwards to be the admirable opening of what will he do with it it was no wonder i was pleased with that  the other three still remain unidentified  one is a little vague it was about a dark tall house at night and people groping on the stairs by the light that escaped from the open door of a sickroom  in another a lover left a ball and went walking in a cool dewy park whence he could watch the lighted windows and the figures of the dancers as they moved  this was the most sentimental impression i think i had yet received for a child is somewhat deaf to the sentimental  in the last a poet who had been tragically wrangling with his wife walked forth on the seabeach on a tempestuous night and witnessed the horrors of a wreck 153  different as they are all these early favourites have a common note—they have all a touch of the romantic  drama is the poetry of conduct romance the poetry of circumstance  the pleasure that we take in life is of two sorts—the active and the passive now we are conscious of a great command over our destiny anon we are lifted up by circumstance as by a breaking wave and dashed we know not how into the future  now we are pleased by our conduct anon merely pleased by our surroundings  it would be hard to say which of these modes of satisfaction is the more effective but the latter is surely the more constant  conduct is three parts of life they say but i think they put it high  there is a vast deal in life and letters both which is not immoral but simply amoral which either does not regard the human will at all or deals with it in obvious and healthy relations where the interest turns not upon what a man shall choose to do but on how he manages to do it not on the passionate slips and hesitations of the conscience but on the problems of the body and of the practical intelligence in clean openair adventure the shock of arms or the diplomacy of life  with such material as this it is impossible to build a play for the serious theatre exists solely on moral grounds and is a standing proof of the dissemination of the human conscience  but it is possible to build upon this ground the most joyous of verses and the most lively beautiful and buoyant tales  one thing in life calls for another there is a fitness in events and places  the sight of a pleasant arbour puts it in our mind to sit there one place suggests work another idleness a third early rising and long rambles in the dew  the effect of night of any flowing water of lighted cities of the peep of day of ships of the open ocean calls up in the mind an army of anonymous desires and pleasures  something we feel should happen we know not what yet we proceed in quest of it and many of the happiest hours of life fleet by us in this vain attendance on the genius of the place and moment  it is thus that tracts of young fir and low rocks that reach into deep soundings particularly torture and delight me  something must have happened in such places and perhaps ages back to members of my race and when i was a child i tried in vain to invent appropriate games for them as i still try just as vainly to fit them with the proper story  some places speak distinctly certain dank gardens cry aloud for a murder certain old houses demand to be haunted certain coasts are set apart for shipwreck  other spots again seem to abide their destiny suggestive and impenetrable “miching mallecho”  the inn at burford bridge with its arbours and green garden and silent eddying river—though it is known already as the place where keats wrote some of his endymion and nelson parted from his emma—still seems to wait the coming of the appropriate legend  within these ivied walls behind these old green shutters some further business smoulders waiting for its hour  the old hawes inn at the queen’s ferry makes a similar call upon my fancy  there it stands apart from the town beside the pier in a climate of its own half inland half marine—in front the ferry bubbling with the tide and the guardship swinging to her anchor behind the old garden with the trees  americans seek it already for the sake of lovel and oldbuck who dined there at the beginning of the antiquary  but you need not tell me—that is not all there is some story unrecorded or not yet complete which must express the meaning of that inn more fully  so it is with names and faces so it is with incidents that are idle and inconclusive in themselves and yet seem like the beginning of some quaint romance which the allcareless author leaves untold  how many of these romances have we not seen determine at their birth how many people have met us with a look of meaning in their eye and sunk at once into trivial acquaintances to how many places have we not drawn near with express intimations—“here my destiny awaits me”—and we have but dined there and passed on  i have lived both at the hawes and burford in a perpetual flutter on the heels as it seemed of some adventure that should justify the place but though the feeling had me to bed at night and called me again at morning in one unbroken round of pleasure and suspense nothing befell me in either worth remark  the man or the hour had not yet come but some day i think a boat shall put off from the queen’s ferry fraught with a dear cargo and some frosty night a horseman on a tragic errand rattle with his whip upon the green shutters of the inn at burford 155  now this is one of the natural appetites with which any lively literature has to count  the desire for knowledge i had almost added the desire for meat is not more deeply seated than this demand for fit and striking incident  the dullest of clowns tells or tries to tell himself a story as the feeblest of children uses invention in his play and even as the imaginative grown person joining in the game at once enriches it with many delightful circumstances the great creative writer shows us the realisation and the apotheosis of the daydreams of common men  his stories may be nourished with the realities of life but their true mark is to satisfy the nameless longings of the reader and to obey the ideal laws of the daydream  the right kind of thing should fall out in the right kind of place the right kind of thing should follow and not only the characters talk aptly and think naturally but all the circumstances in a tale answer one to another like notes in music  the threads of a story come from time to time together and make a picture in the web the characters fall from time to time into some attitude to each other or to nature which stamps the story home like an illustration crusoe recoiling from the footprint achilles shouting over against the trojans ulysses bending the great bow christian running with his fingers in his ears these are each culminating moments in the legend and each has been printed on the mind’s eye for ever  other things we may forget we may forget the words although they are beautiful we may forget the author’s comment although perhaps it was ingenious and true but these epochmaking scenes which put the last mark of truth upon a story and fill up at one blow our capacity for sympathetic pleasure we so adopt into the very bosom of our mind that neither time nor tide can efface or weaken the impression  this then is the plastic part of literature to embody character thought or emotion in some act or attitude that shall be remarkably striking to the mind’s eye  this is the highest and hardest thing to do in words the thing which once accomplished equally delights the schoolboy and the sage and makes in its own right the quality of epics  compared with this all other purposes in literature except the purely lyrical or the purely philosophic are bastard in nature facile of execution and feeble in result  it is one thing to write about the inn at burford or to describe scenery with the wordpainters it is quite another to seize on the heart of the suggestion and make a country famous with a legend  it is one thing to remark and to dissect with the most cutting logic the complications of life and of the human spirit it is quite another to give them body and blood in the story of ajax or of hamlet  the first is literature but the second is something besides for it is likewise art  english people of the present day 157 are apt i know not why to look somewhat down on incident and reserve their admiration for the clink of teaspoons and the accents of the curate  it is thought clever to write a novel with no story at all or at least with a very dull one  reduced even to the lowest terms a certain interest can be communicated by the art of narrative a sense of human kinship stirred and a kind of monotonous fitness comparable to the words and air of sandy’s mull preserved among the infinitesimal occurrences recorded  some people work in this manner with even a strong touch  mr trollope’s inimitable clergymen naturally arise to the mind in this connection  but even mr trollope does not confine himself to chronicling small beer mr crawley’s collision with the bishop’s wife mr melnotte dallying in the deserted banquetroom are typical incidents epically conceived fitly embodying a crisis  or again look at thackeray  if rawdon crawley’s blow were not delivered vanity fair would cease to be a work of art  that scene is the chief ganglion of the tale and the discharge of energy from rawdon’s fist is the reward and consolation of the reader the end of esmond is a yet wider excursion from the author’s customary fields the scene at castlewood is pure dumas the great and wily english borrower has here borrowed from the great unblushing french thief as usual he has borrowed admirably well and the breaking of the sword rounds off the best of all his books with a manly martial note  but perhaps nothing can more strongly illustrate the necessity for marking incident than to compare the living fame of robinson crusoe with the discredit of clarissa harlowe  clarissa is a book of a far more startling import worked out on a great canvas with inimitable courage and unflagging art  it contains wit character passion plot conversations full of spirit and insight letters sparkling with unstrained humanity and if the death of the heroine be somewhat frigid and artificial the last days of the hero strike the only note of what we now call byronism between the elizabethans and byron himself  and yet a little story of a shipwrecked sailor with not a tenth part of the style nor a thousandth part of the wisdom exploring none of the arcana of humanity and deprived of the perennial interest of love goes on from edition to edition ever young while clarissa lies upon the shelves unread  a friend of mine a welsh blacksmith was twentyfive years old and could neither read nor write when he heard a chapter of robinson read aloud in a farm kitchen  up to that moment he had sat content huddled in his ignorance but he left that farm another man  there were daydreams it appeared divine daydreams written and printed and bound and to be bought for money and enjoyed at pleasure  down he sat that day painfully learned to read welsh and returned to borrow the book  it had been lost nor could he find another copy but one that was in english  down he sat once more learned english and at length and with entire delight read robinson  it is like the story of a lovechase  if he had heard a letter from clarissa would he have been fired with the same chivalrous ardour  i wonder  yet clarissa has every quality that can be shown in prose one alone excepted—pictorial or picturemaking romance  while robinson depends for the most part and with the overwhelming majority of its readers on the charm of circumstance  in the highest achievements of the art of words the dramatic and the pictorial the moral and romantic interest rise and fall together by a common and organic law  situation is animated with passion passion clothed upon with situation  neither exists for itself but each inheres indissolubly with the other  this is high art and not only the highest art possible in words but the highest art of all since it combines the greatest mass and diversity of the elements of truth and pleasure  such are epics and the few prose tales that have the epic weight  but as from a school of works aping the creative incident and romance are ruthlessly discarded so may character and drama be omitted or subordinated to romance  there is one book for example more generally loved than shakespeare that captivates in childhood and still delights in age—i mean the arabian nights—where you shall look in vain for moral or for intellectual interest  no human face or voice greets us among that wooden crowd of kings and genies sorcerers and beggarmen adventure on the most naked terms furnishes forth the entertainment and is found enough  dumas approaches perhaps nearest of any modern to these arabian authors in the purely material charm of some of his romances the early part of monte cristo down to the finding of the treasure is a piece of perfect storytelling the man never breathed who shared these moving incidents without a tremor and yet faria is a thing of packthread and dantès little more than a name  the sequel is one longdrawn error gloomy bloody unnatural and dull but as for these early chapters i do not believe there is another volume extant where you can breathe the same unmingled atmosphere of romance  it is very thin and light to be sure as on a high mountain but it is brisk and clear and sunny in proportion i saw the other day with envy an old and a very clever lady setting forth on a second or third voyage into monte cristo  here are stories which powerfully affect the reader which can be reperused at any age and where the characters are no more than puppets  the bony fist of the showman visibly propels them their springs are an open secret their faces are of wood their bellies filled with bran and yet we thrillingly partake of their adventures  and the point may be illustrated still further  the last interview between lucy and richard feveril is pure drama more than that it is the strongest scene since shakespeare in the english tongue  their first meeting by the river on the other hand is pure romance it has nothing to do with character it might happen to any other boy or maiden and be none the less delightful for the change and yet i think he would be a bold man who should choose between these passages  thus in the same book we may have two scenes each capital in its order in the one human passion deep calling unto deep shall utter its genuine voice in the second according circumstances like instruments in tune shall build up a trivial but desirable incident such as we love to prefigure for ourselves and in the end in spite of the critics we may hesitate to give the preference to either  the one may ask more genius—i do not say it does but at least the other dwells as clearly in the memory  true romantic art again makes a romance of all things  it reaches into the highest abstraction of the ideal it does not refuse the most pedestrian realism  robinson crusoe is as realistic as it is romantic both qualities are pushed to an extreme and neither suffers  nor does romance depend upon the material importance of the incidents  to deal with strong and deadly elements banditti pirates war and murder is to conjure with great names and in the event of failure to double the disgrace  the arrival of haydn and consuelo at the canon’s villa is a very trifling incident yet we may read a dozen boisterous stories from beginning to end and not receive so fresh and stirring an impression of adventure  it was the scene of crusoe at the wreck if i remember rightly that so bewitched my blacksmith  nor is the fact surprising every single article the castaway recovers from the hulk is “a joy for ever” to the man who reads of them  they are the things that should be found and the bare enumeration stirs the blood  i found a glimmer of the same interest the other day in a new book the sailor’s sweetheart by mr clark russell  the whole business of the brig morning star is very rightly felt and spiritedly written but the clothes the books and the money satisfy the reader’s mind like things to eat  we are dealing here with the old cutanddry legitimate interest of treasure trove but even treasure trove can be made dull  there are few people who have not groaned under the plethora of goods that fell to the lot of the swiss family robinson that dreary family  they found article after article creature after creature from milk kine to pieces of ordnance a whole consignment but no informing taste had presided over the selection there was no smack or relish in the invoice and these riches left the fancy cold  the box of goods in verne’s mysterious island is another case in point there was no gusto and no glamour about that it might have come from a shop  but the two hundred and seventyeight australian sovereigns on board the morning star fell upon me like a surprise that i had expected whole vistas of secondary stories besides the one in hand radiated forth from that discovery as they radiate from a striking particular in life and i was made for the moment as happy as a reader has the right to be  to come at all at the nature of this quality of romance we must bear in mind the peculiarity of our attitude to any art  no art produces illusion in the theatre we never forget that we are in the theatre and while we read a story we sit wavering between two minds now merely clapping our hands at the merit of the performance now condescending to take an active part in fancy with the characters  this last is the triumph of romantic storytelling when the reader consciously plays at being the hero the scene is a good scene  now in characterstudies the pleasure that we take is critical we watch we approve we smile at incongruities we are moved to sudden heats of sympathy with courage suffering or virtue  but the characters are still themselves they are not us the more clearly they are depicted the more widely do they stand away from us the more imperiously do they thrust us back into our place as a spectator  i cannot identify myself with rawdon crawley or with eugène de rastignac for i have scarce a hope or fear in common with them  it is not character but incident that woos us out of our reserve something happens as we desire to have it happen to ourselves some situation that we have long dallied with in fancy is realised in the story with enticing and appropriate details  then we forget the characters then we push the hero aside then we plunge into the tale in our own person and bathe in fresh experience and then and then only do we say we have been reading a romance  it is not only pleasurable things that we imagine in our daydreams there are lights in which we are willing to contemplate even the idea of our own death ways in which it seems as if it would amuse us to be cheated wounded or calumniated  it is thus possible to construct a story even of tragic import in which every incident detail and trick of circumstance shall be welcome to the reader’s thoughts  fiction is to the grown man what play is to the child it is there that he changes the atmosphere and tenor of his life and when the game so chimes with his fancy that he can join in it with all his heart when it pleases him with every turn when he loves to recall it and dwells upon its recollection with entire delight fiction is called romance  walter scott is out and away the king of the romantics  the lady of the lake has no indisputable claim to be a poem beyond the inherent fitness and desirability of the tale  it is just such a story as a man would make up for himself walking in the best health and temper through just such scenes as it is laid in  hence it is that a charm dwells undefinable among these slovenly verses as the unseen cuckoo fills the mountains with his note hence even after we have flung the book aside the scenery and adventures remain present to the mind a new and green possession not unworthy of that beautiful name the lady of the lake or that direct romantic opening—one of the most spirited and poetical in literature—“the stag at eve had drunk his fill”  the same strength and the same weaknesses adorn and disfigure the novels  in that illwritten ragged book the pirate the figure of cleveland—cast up by the sea on the resounding foreland of dunrossness—moving with the blood on his hands and the spanish words on his tongue among the simple islanders—singing a serenade under the window of his shetland mistress—is conceived in the very highest manner of romantic invention  the words of his song “through groves of palm” sung in such a scene and by such a lover clench as in a nutshell the emphatic contrast upon which the tale is built  in guy mannering again every incident is delightful to the imagination and the scene when harry bertram lands at ellangowan is a model instance of romantic method  “‘i remember the tune well’ he says ‘though i cannot guess what should at present so strongly recall it to my memory”  he took his flageolet from his pocket and played a simple melody  apparently the tune awoke the corresponding associations of a damsel  she immediately took up the song—      “‘are these the links of forth she said        or are they the crooks of dee     or the bonny woods of warroch head        that i so fain would see’  “‘by heaven’ said bertram ‘it is the very ballad’”  on this quotation two remarks fall to be made  first as an instance of modern feeling for romance this famous touch of the flageolet and the old song is selected by miss braddon for omission  miss braddon’s idea of a story like mrs todgers’s idea of a wooden leg were something strange to have expounded  as a matter of personal experience meg’s appearance to old mr bertram on the road the ruins of derncleugh the scene of the flageolet and the dominie’s recognition of harry are the four strong notes that continue to ring in the mind after the book is laid aside  the second point is still more curious  the reader will observe a mark of excision in the passage as quoted by me  well here is how it runs in the original “a damsel who close behind a fine spring about halfway down the descent and which had once supplied the castle with water was engaged in bleaching linen”  a man who gave in such copy would be discharged from the staff of a daily paper  scott has forgotten to prepare the reader for the presence of the “damsel” he has forgotten to mention the spring and its relation to the ruin and now face to face with his omission instead of trying back and starting fair crams all this matter tail foremost into a single shambling sentence  it is not merely bad english or bad style it is abominably bad narrative besides  certainly the contrast is remarkable and it is one that throws a strong light upon the subject of this paper  for here we have a man of the finest creative instinct touching with perfect certainty and charm the romantic junctures of his story and we find him utterly careless almost it would seem incapable in the technical matter of style and not only frequently weak but frequently wrong in points of drama  in character parts indeed and particularly in the scotch he was delicate strong and truthful but the trite obliterated features of too many of his heroes have already wearied two generations of readers  at times his characters will speak with something far beyond propriety with a true heroic note but on the next page they will be wading wearily forward with an ungrammatical and undramatic rigmarole of words  the man who could conceive and write the character of elspeth of the craigburnfoot as scott has conceived and written it had not only splendid romantic but splendid tragic gifts  how comes it then that he could so often fob us off with languid inarticulate twaddle  it seems to me that the explanation is to be found in the very quality of his surprising merits  as his books are play to the reader so were they play to him  he conjured up the romantic with delight but he had hardly patience to describe it  he was a great daydreamer a seer of fit and beautiful and humorous visions but hardly a great artist hardly in the manful sense an artist at all  he pleased himself and so he pleases us  of the pleasures of his art he tasted fully but of its toils and vigils and distresses never man knew less  a great romantic—an idle child     chapter xvi a humble remonstrance 168a   we have recently 168b enjoyed a quite peculiar pleasure hearing in some detail the opinions about the art they practise of mr walter besant and mr henry james two men certainly of very different calibre mr james so precise of outline so cunning of fence so scrupulous of finish and mr besant so genial so friendly with so persuasive and humorous a vein of whim mr james the very type of the deliberate artist mr besant the impersonation of good nature  that such doctors should differ will excite no great surprise but one point in which they seem to agree fills me i confess with wonder  for they are both content to talk about the “art of fiction” and mr besant waxing exceedingly bold goes on to oppose this socalled “art of fiction” to the “art of poetry”  by the art of poetry he can mean nothing but the art of verse an art of handicraft and only comparable with the art of prose  for that heat and height of sane emotion which we agree to call by the name of poetry is but a libertine and vagrant quality present at times in any art more often absent from them all too seldom present in the prose novel too frequently absent from the ode and epic  fiction is the same case it is no substantive art but an element which enters largely into all the arts but architecture  homer wordsworth phidias hogarth and salvini all deal in fiction and yet i do not suppose that either hogarth or salvini to mention but these two entered in any degree into the scope of mr besant’s interesting lecture or mr james’s charming essay  the art of fiction then regarded as a definition is both too ample and too scanty  let me suggest another let me suggest that what both mr james and mr besant had in view was neither more nor less than the art of narrative  but mr besant is anxious to speak solely of “the modern english novel” the stay and breadwinner of mr mudie and in the author of the most pleasing novel on that roll all sorts and conditions of men the desire is natural enough  i can conceive then that he would hasten to propose two additions and read thus the art of fictitious narrative in prose  now the fact of the existence of the modern english novel is not to be denied materially with its three volumes leaded type and gilded lettering it is easily distinguishable from other forms of literature but to talk at all fruitfully of any branch of art it is needful to build our definitions on some more fundamental ground then binding  why then are we to add “in prose”  the odyssey appears to me the best of romances the lady of the lake to stand high in the second order and chaucer’s tales and prologues to contain more of the matter and art of the modern english novel than the whole treasury of mr mudie  whether a narrative be written in blank verse or the spenserian stanza in the long period of gibbon or the chipped phrase of charles reade the principles of the art of narrative must be equally observed  the choice of a noble and swelling style in prose affects the problem of narration in the same way if not to the same degree as the choice of measured verse for both imply a closer synthesis of events a higher key of dialogue and a more picked and stately strain of words  if you are to refuse don juan it is hard to see why you should include zanoni or to bracket works of very different value the scarlet letter and by what discrimination are you to open your doors to the pilgrim’s progress and close them on the faery queen  to bring things closer home i will here propound to mr besant a conundrum  a narrative called paradise lost was written in english verse by one john milton what was it then  it was next translated by chateaubriand into french prose and what was it then lastly the french translation was by some inspired compatriot of george gilfillan and of mine turned bodily into an english novel and in the name of clearness what was it then  but once more why should we add “fictitious”  the reason why is obvious  the reason why not if something more recondite does not want for weight  the art of narrative in fact is the same whether it is applied to the selection and illustration of a real series of events or of an imaginary series  boswell’s life of johnson a work of cunning and inimitable art owes its success to the same technical manœuvres as let us say tom jones the clear conception of certain characters of man the choice and presentation of certain incidents out of a great number that offered and the invention yes invention and preservation of a certain key in dialogue  in which these things are done with the more art—in which with the greater air of nature—readers will differently judge  boswell’s is indeed a very special case and almost a generic but it is not only in boswell it is in every biography with any salt of life it is in every history where events and men rather than ideas are presented—in tacitus in carlyle in michelet in macaulay—that the novelist will find many of his own methods most conspicuously and adroitly handled  he will find besides that he who is free—who has the right to invent or steal a missing incident who has the right more precious still of wholesale omission—is frequently defeated and with all his advantages leaves a less strong impression of reality and passion  mr james utters his mind with a becoming fervour on the sanctity of truth to the novelist on a more careful examination truth will seem a word of very debateable propriety not only for the labours of the novelist but for those of the historian  no art—to use the daring phrase of mr james—can successfully “compete with life” and the art that seeks to do so is condemned to perish montibus aviis  life goes before us infinite in complication attended by the most various and surprising meteors appealing at once to the eye to the ear to the mind—the seat of wonder to the touch—so thrillingly delicate and to the belly—so imperious when starved  it combines and employs in its manifestation the method and material not of one art only but of all the arts music is but an arbitrary trifling with a few of life’s majestic chords painting is but a shadow of its pageantry of light and colour literature does but drily indicate that wealth of incident of moral obligation of virtue vice action rapture and agony with which it teems  to “compete with life” whose sun we cannot look upon whose passions and diseases waste and slay us—to compete with the flavour of wine the beauty of the dawn the scorching of fire the bitterness of death and separation—here is indeed a projected escalade of heaven here are indeed labours for a hercules in a dress coat armed with a pen and a dictionary to depict the passions armed with a tube of superior flakewhite to paint the portrait of the insufferable sun  no art is true in this sense none can “compete with life” not even history built indeed of indisputable facts but these facts robbed of their vivacity and sting so that even when we read of the sack of a city or the fall of an empire we are surprised and justly commend the author’s talent if our pulse be quickened  and mark for a last differentia that this quickening of the pulse is in almost every case purely agreeable that these phantom reproductions of experience even at their most acute convey decided pleasure while experience itself in the cockpit of life can torture and slay  what then is the object what the method of an art and what the source of its power  the whole secret is that no art does “compete with life”  man’s one method whether he reasons or creates is to halfshut his eyes against the dazzle and confusion of reality  the arts like arithmetic and geometry turn away their eyes from the gross coloured and mobile nature at our feet and regard instead a certain figmentary abstraction  geometry will tell us of a circle a thing never seen in nature asked about a green circle or an iron circle it lays its hand upon its mouth  so with the arts  painting ruefully comparing sunshine and flakewhite gives up truth of colour as it had already given up relief and movement and instead of vying with nature arranges a scheme of harmonious tints  literature above all in its most typical mood the mood of narrative similarly flees the direct challenge and pursues instead an independent and creative aim  so far as it imitates at all it imitates not life but speech not the facts of human destiny but the emphasis and the suppressions with which the human actor tells of them the real art that dealt with life directly was that of the first men who told their stories round the savage campfire  our art is occupied and bound to be occupied not so much in making stories true as in making them typical not so much in capturing the lineaments of each fact as in marshalling all of them towards a common end  for the welter of impressions all forcible but all discreet which life presents it substitutes a certain artificial series of impressions all indeed most feebly represented but all aiming at the same effect all eloquent of the same idea all chiming together like consonant notes in music or like the graduated tints in a good picture  from all its chapters from all its pages from all its sentences the wellwritten novel echoes and reechoes its one creative and controlling thought to this must every incident and character contribute the style must have been pitched in unison with this and if there is anywhere a word that looks another way the book would be stronger clearer and i had almost said fuller without it  life is monstrous infinite illogical abrupt and poignant a work of art in comparison is neat finite selfcontained rational flowing and emasculate  life imposes by brute energy like inarticulate thunder art catches the ear among the far louder noises of experience like an air artificially made by a discreet musician  a proposition of geometry does not compete with life and a proposition of geometry is a fair and luminous parallel for a work of art  both are reasonable both untrue to the crude fact both inhere in nature neither represents it the novel which is a work of art exists not by its resemblances to life which are forced and material as a shoe must still consist of leather but by its immeasurable difference from life which is designed and significant and is both the method and the meaning of the work  the life of man is not the subject of novels but the inexhaustible magazine from which subjects are to be selected the name of these is legion and with each new subject—for here again i must differ by the whole width of heaven from mr james—the true artist will vary his method and change the point of attack  that which was in one case an excellence will become a defect in another what was the making of one book will in the next be impertinent or dull  first each novel and then each class of novels exists by and for itself  i will take for instance three main classes which are fairly distinct first the novel of adventure which appeals to certain almost sensual and quite illogical tendencies in man second the novel of character which appeals to our intellectual appreciation of man’s foibles and mingled and inconstant motives and third the dramatic novel which deals with the same stuff as the serious theatre and appeals to our emotional nature and moral judgment  and first for the novel of adventure  mr james refers with singular generosity of praise to a little book about a quest for hidden treasure but he lets fall by the way some rather startling words  in this book he misses what he calls the “immense luxury” of being able to quarrel with his author  the luxury to most of us is to lay by our judgment to be submerged by the tale as by a billow and only to awake and begin to distinguish and find fault when the piece is over and the volume laid aside  still more remarkable is mr james’s reason  he cannot criticise the author as he goes “because” says he comparing it with another work “i have been a child but i have never been on a quest for buried treasure”  here is indeed a wilful paradox for if he has never been on a quest for buried treasure it can be demonstrated that he has never been a child  there never was a child unless master james but has hunted gold and been a pirate and a military commander and a bandit of the mountains but has fought and suffered shipwreck and prison and imbrued its little hands in gore and gallantly retrieved the lost battle and triumphantly protected innocence and beauty  elsewhere in his essay mr james has protested with excellent reason against too narrow a conception of experience for the born artist he contends the “faintest hints of life” are converted into revelations and it will be found true i believe in a majority of cases that the artist writes with more gusto and effect of those things which he has only wished to do than of those which he has done  desire is a wonderful telescope and pisgah the best observatory  now while it is true that neither mr james nor the author of the work in question has ever in the fleshly sense gone questing after gold it is probable that both have ardently desired and fondly imagined the details of such a life in youthful daydreams and the author counting upon that and well aware cunning and lowminded man that this class of interest having been frequently treated finds a readily accessible and beaten road to the sympathies of the reader addressed himself throughout to the building up and circumstantiation of this boyish dream  character to the boy is a sealed book for him a pirate is a beard a pair of wide trousers and a liberal complement of pistols  the author for the sake of circumstantiation and because he was himself more or less grown up admitted character within certain limits into his design but only within certain limits  had the same puppets figured in a scheme of another sort they had been drawn to very different purpose for in this elementary novel of adventure the characters need to be presented with but one class of qualities—the warlike and formidable  so as they appear insidious in deceit and fatal in the combat they have served their end  danger is the matter with which this class of novel deals fear the passion with which it idly trifles and the characters are portrayed only so far as they realise the sense of danger and provoke the sympathy of fear  to add more traits to be too clever to start the hare of moral or intellectual interest while we are running the fox of material interest is not to enrich but to stultify your tale  the stupid reader will only be offended and the clever reader lose the scent  the novel of character has this difference from all others that it requires no coherency of plot and for this reason as in the case of gil blas it is sometimes called the novel of adventure  it turns on the humours of the persons represented these are to be sure embodied in incidents but the incidents themselves being tributary need not march in a progression and the characters may be statically shown  as they enter so they may go out they must be consistent but they need not grow  here mr james will recognise the note of much of his own work he treats for the most part the statics of character studying it at rest or only gently moved and with his usual delicate and just artistic instinct he avoids those stronger passions which would deform the attitudes he loves to study and change his sitters from the humorists of ordinary life to the brute forces and bare types of more emotional moments  in his recent author of beltraffio so just in conception so nimble and neat in workmanship strong passion is indeed employed but observe that it is not displayed  even in the heroine the working of the passion is suppressed and the great struggle the true tragedy the scèneàfaire passes unseen behind the panels of a locked door  the delectable invention of the young visitor is introduced consciously or not to this end that mr james true to his method might avoid the scene of passion  i trust no reader will suppose me guilty of undervaluing this little masterpiece  i mean merely that it belongs to one marked class of novel and that it would have been very differently conceived and treated had it belonged to that other marked class of which i now proceed to speak  i take pleasure in calling the dramatic novel by that name because it enables me to point out by the way a strange and peculiarly english misconception  it is sometimes supposed that the drama consists of incident  it consists of passion which gives the actor his opportunity and that passion must progressively increase or the actor as the piece proceeded would be unable to carry the audience from a lower to a higher pitch of interest and emotion  a good serious play must therefore be founded on one of the passionate cruces of life where duty and inclination come nobly to the grapple and the same is true of what i call for that reason the dramatic novel  i will instance a few worthy specimens all of our own day and language meredith’s rhoda fleming that wonderful and painful book long out of print 178 and hunted for at bookstalls like an aldine hardy’s pair of blue eyes and two of charles reade’s griffith gaunt and the double marriage originally called white lies and founded by an accident quaintly favourable to my nomenclature on a play by maquet the partner of the great dumas  in this kind of novel the closed door of the author of beltraffio must be broken open passion must appear upon the scene and utter its last word passion is the beall and the endall the plot and the solution the protagonist and the deus ex machinâ in one  the characters may come anyhow upon the stage we do not care the point is that before they leave it they shall become transfigured and raised out of themselves by passion  it may be part of the design to draw them with detail to depict a fulllength character and then behold it melt and change in the furnace of emotion  but there is no obligation of the sort nice portraiture is not required and we are content to accept mere abstract types so they be strongly and sincerely moved  a novel of this class may be even great and yet contain no individual figure it may be great because it displays the workings of the perturbed heart and the impersonal utterance of passion and with an artist of the second class it is indeed even more likely to be great when the issue has thus been narrowed and the whole force of the writer’s mind directed to passion alone  cleverness again which has its fair field in the novel of character is debarred all entry upon this more solemn theatre  a farfetched motive an ingenious evasion of the issue a witty instead of a passionate turn offend us like an insincerity  all should be plain all straightforward to the end  hence it is that in rhoda fleming mrs lovell raises such resentment in the reader her motives are too flimsy her ways are too equivocal for the weight and strength of her surroundings  hence the hot indignation of the reader when balzac after having begun the duchesse de langeais in terms of strong if somewhat swollen passion cuts the knot by the derangement of the hero’s clock such personages and incidents belong to the novel of character they are out of place in the high society of the passions when the passions are introduced in art at their full height we look to see them not baffled and impotently striving as in life but towering above circumstance and acting substitutes for fate  and here i can imagine mr james with his lucid sense to intervene  to much of what i have said he would apparently demur in much he would somewhat impatiently acquiesce  it may be true but it is not what he desired to say or to hear said  he spoke of the finished picture and its worth when done i of the brushes the palette and the north light  he uttered his views in the tone and for the ear of good society i with the emphasis and technicalities of the obtrusive student  but the point i may reply is not merely to amuse the public but to offer helpful advice to the young writer  and the young writer will not so much be helped by genial pictures of what an art may aspire to at its highest as by a true idea of what it must be on the lowest terms  the best that we can say to him is this let him choose a motive whether of character or passion carefully construct his plot so that every incident is an illustration of the motive and every property employed shall bear to it a near relation of congruity or contrast avoid a subplot unless as sometimes in shakespeare the subplot be a reversion or complement of the main intrigue suffer not his style to flag below the level of the argument pitch the key of conversation not with any thought of how men talk in parlours but with a single eye to the degree of passion he may be called on to express and allow neither himself in the narrative nor any character in the course of the dialogue to utter one sentence that is not part and parcel of the business of the story or the discussion of the problem involved  let him not regret if this shortens his book it will be better so for to add irrelevant matter is not to lengthen but to bury  let him not mind if he miss a thousand qualities so that he keeps unflaggingly in pursuit of the one he has chosen  let him not care particularly if he miss the tone of conversation the pungent material detail of the day’s manners the reproduction of the atmosphere and the environment  these elements are not essential a novel may be excellent and yet have none of them a passion or a character is so much the better depicted as it rises clearer from material circumstance  in this age of the particular let him remember the ages of the abstract the great books of the past the brave men that lived before shakespeare and before balzac  and as the root of the whole matter let him bear in mind that his novel is not a transcript of life to be judged by its exactitude but a simplification of some side or point of life to stand or fall by its significant simplicity  for although in great men working upon great motives what we observe and admire is often their complexity yet underneath appearances the truth remains unchanged that simplification was their method and that simplicity is their excellence    ii   since the above was written another novelist has entered repeatedly the lists of theory one well worthy of mention mr w d howells and none ever couched a lance with narrower convictions  his own work and those of his pupils and masters singly occupy his mind he is the bondslave the zealot of his school he dreams of an advance in art like what there is in science he thinks of past things as radically dead he thinks a form can be outlived a strange immersion in his own history a strange forgetfulness of the history of the race  meanwhile by a glance at his own works could he see them with the eager eyes of his readers much of this illusion would be dispelled  for while he holds all the poor little orthodoxies of the day—no poorer and no smaller than those of yesterday or tomorrow poor and small indeed only so far as they are exclusive—the living quality of much that he has done is of a contrary i had almost said of a heretical complexion  a man as i read him of an originally strong romantic bent—a certain glow of romance still resides in many of his books and lends them their distinction  as by accident he runs out and revels in the exceptional and it is then as often as not that his reader rejoices—justly as i contend  for in all this excessive eagerness to be centrally human is there not one central human thing that mr howells is too often tempted to neglect i mean himself a poet a finished artist a man in love with the appearances of life a cunning reader of the mind he has other passions and aspirations than those he loves to draw  and why should he suppress himself and do such reverence to the lemuel barkers  the obvious is not of necessity the normal fashion rules and deforms the majority fall tamely into the contemporary shape and thus attain in the eyes of the true observer only a higher power of insignificance and the danger is lest in seeking to draw the normal a man should draw the null and write the novel of society instead of the romance of
