chamber music     i       strings in the earth and air      make music sweet      strings by the river where      the willows meet       theres music along the river      for love wanders there      pale flowers on his mantle      dark leaves on his hair       all softly playing      with head to the music bent      and fingers straying      upon an instrument     ii       the twilight turns from amethyst      to deep and deeper blue      the lamp fills with a pale green glow      the trees of the avenue       the old piano plays an air      sedate and slow and gay      she bends upon the yellow keys      her head inclines this way       shy thought and grave wide eyes and hands      that wander as they list      the twilight turns to darker blue      with lights of amethyst     iii       at that hour when all things have repose      o lonely watcher of the skies      do you hear the night wind and the sighs      of harps playing unto love to unclose      the pale gates of sunrise       when all things repose do you alone      awake to hear the sweet harps play      to love before him on his way      and the night wind answering in antiphon      till night is overgone       play on invisible harps unto love      whose way in heaven is aglow      at that hour when soft lights come and go      soft sweet music in the air above      and in the earth below     iv       when the shy star goes forth in heaven      all maidenly disconsolate      hear you amid the drowsy even      one who is singing by your gate      his song is softer than the dew      and he is come to visit

floor       i have left my book      i have left my room      for i heard you singing      through the gloom       singing and singing      a merry air      lean out of the window      goldenhair     vi       i would in that sweet bosom be      o sweet it is and fair it is      where no rude wind might visit me      because of sad austerities      i would in that sweet bosom be       i would be ever in that heart      o soft i knock and soft entreat her      where only peace might be my part      austerities were all the sweeter      so i were ever in that heart     vii       my love is in a light attire      among the appletrees      where the gay winds do most desire      to run in companies       there where the gay winds stay to woo      the young leaves as they pass      my love goes slowly bending to      her shadow on the grass       and where the skys a pale blue cup      over the laughing land      my love goes lightly holding up      her dress with dainty hand     viii       who goes amid the green wood      with springtide all adorning her      who goes amid the merry green wood      to make it merrier       who passes in the sunlight      by ways that know the light footfall      who passes in the sweet sunlight      with mien so virginal       the ways of all the woodland      gleam with a soft and golden fire      for whom does all the sunny woodland      carry so brave attire       o it is for my true love      the woods their rich apparel wear      o it is for my own true love      that is so young and fair     ix       winds of may that dance on the sea      dancing a ringaround in glee      from furrow to furrow while overhead      the foam flies up to be garlanded      in silvery arches spanning the air      saw you my true love anywhere      welladay welladay      for the winds of may      love is unhappy when love is away     x       bright cap and streamers      he sings in the hollow      come follow come follow                 all you that love      leave dreams to the dreamers      that will not after      that song and laughter                 do nothing move       with ribbons streaming      he sings the bolder      in troop at his shoulder                 the wild bees hum      and the time of dreaming      dreams is over      as lover to lover                 sweetheart i come     xi       bid adieu adieu adieu      bid adieu to girlish days      happy love is come to woo      thee and woo thy girlish ways      the zone that doth become thee fair      the snood upon thy yellow hair       when thou hast heard his name upon      the bugles of the cherubim      begin thou softly to unzone      thy girlish bosom unto him      and softly to undo the snood      that is the sign of maidenhood     xii       what counsel has the hooded moon      put in thy heart my shyly sweet      of love in ancient plenilune      glory and stars beneath his feet      a sage that is but kith and kin      with the comedian capuchin       believe me rather that am wise      in disregard of the divine      a glory kindles in those eyes      trembles to starlight mine o mine      no more be tears in moon or mist      for thee sweet sentimentalist     xiii       go seek her out all courteously      and say i come      wind of spices whose song is ever      epithalamium      o hurry over the dark lands      and run upon the sea      for seas and lands shall not divide us      my love and me       now wind of your good courtesy      i pray you go      and come into her little garden      and sing at her window      singing the bridal wind is blowing      for love is at his noon      and soon will your true love be with you      soon o soon     xiv       my dove my beautiful one      arise arise      the nightdew lies      upon my lips and eyes       the odorous winds are weaving      a music of sighs      arise arise      my dove my beautiful one       i wait by the cedar tree      my sister my love      white breast of the dove      my breast shall be your bed       the pale dew lies      like a veil on my head      my fair one my fair dove      arise arise     xv       from dewy dreams my soul arise      from loves deep slumber and from death      for lo the trees are full of sighs      whose leaves the morn admonisheth       eastward the gradual dawn prevails      where softlyburning fires appear      making to tremble all those veils      of grey and golden gossamer       while sweetly gently secretly      the flowery bells of morn are stirred      and the wise choirs of faery      begin innumerous to be heard     xvi       o cool is the valley now      and there love will we go      for many a choir is singing now      where love did sometime go      and hear you not the thrushes calling      calling us away      o cool and pleasant is the valley      and there love will we stay     xvii       because your voice was at my side      i gave him pain      because within my hand i held      your hand again       there is no word nor any sign      can make amend      he is a stranger to me now      who was my friend     xviii       o sweetheart hear you      your lovers tale      a man shall have sorrow      when friends him fail       for he shall know then      friends be untrue      and a little ashes      their words come to       but one unto him      will softly move      and softly woo him      in ways of love       his hand is under      her smooth round breast      so he who has sorrow      shall have rest     xix       be not sad because all men      prefer a lying clamour before you      sweetheart be at peace again      can they dishonour you       they are sadder than all tears      their lives ascend as a continual sigh      proudly answer to their tears      as they deny deny     xx       in the dark pinewood      i would we lay      in deep cool shadow      at noon of day       how sweet to lie there      sweet to kiss      where the great pineforest      enaisled is       thy kiss descending      sweeter were      with a soft tumult      of thy hair       o unto the pinewood      at noon of day      come with me now      sweet love away     xxi       he who hath glory lost nor hath      found any soul to fellow his      among his foes in scorn and wrath      holding to ancient nobleness      that high unconsortable one      his love is his companion     xxii       of that so sweet imprisonment      my soul dearest is fain      soft arms that woo me to relent      and woo me to detain      ah could they ever hold me there      gladly were i a prisoner       dearest through interwoven arms      by love made tremulous      that night allures me where alarms      nowise may trouble us      but sleep to dreamier sleep be wed      where soul with soul lies prisoned     xxiii       this heart that flutters near my heart      my hope and all my riches is      unhappy when we draw apart      and happy between kiss and kiss      my hope and all my richesyes      and all my happiness       for there as in some mossy nest      the wrens will divers treasures keep      i laid those treasures i possessed      ere that mine eyes had learned to weep      shall we not be as wise as they      though love live but a day     xxiv       silently shes combing      combing her long hair      silently and graciously      with many a pretty air       the sun is in the willow leaves      and on the dapplled grass      and still shes combing her long hair      before the lookingglass       i pray you cease to comb out      comb out your long hair      for i have heard of witchery      under a pretty air       that makes as one thing to the lover      staying and going hence      all fair with many a pretty air      and many a negligence     xxv       lightly come or lightly go      though thy heart presage thee woe      vales and many a wasted sun      oread let thy laughter run      till the irreverent mountain air      ripple all thy flying hair       lightly lightlyever so      clouds that wrap the vales below      at the hour of evenstar      lowliest attendants are      love and laughter songconfessed      when the heart is heaviest     xxvi       thou leanest to the shell of night      dear lady a divining ear      in that soft choiring of delight      what sound hath made thy heart to fear      seemed it of rivers rushing forth      from the grey deserts of the north       that mood of thine      is his if thou but scan it well      who a mad tale bequeaths to us      at ghosting hour conjurable      and all for some strange name he read                 in purchas or in holinshed     xxvii       though i thy mithridates were      framed to defy the poisondart      yet must thou fold me unaware      to know the rapture of thy heart      and i but render and confess      the malice of thy tenderness       for elegant and antique phrase      dearest my lips wax all too wise      nor have i known a love whose praise      our piping poets solemnize      neither a love where may not be      ever so little falsity     xxviii       gentle lady do not sing      sad songs about the end of love      lay aside sadness and sing      how love that passes is enough       sing about the long deep sleep      of lovers that are dead and how      in the grave all love shall sleep      love is aweary now     xxix       dear heart why will you use me so      dear eyes that gently me upbraid      still are you beautifulbut o      how is your beauty raimented       through the clear mirror of your eyes      through the soft sigh of kiss to kiss      desolate winds assail with cries      the shadowy garden where love is       and soon shall love dissolved be      when over us the wild winds blow      but you dear love too dear to me      alas why will you use me so     xxx       love came to us in time gone by      when one at twilight shyly played      and one in fear was standing nigh      for love at first is all afraid       we were grave lovers love is past      that had his sweet hours many a one      welcome to us now at the last      the ways that we shall go upon     xxxi       o it was out by donnycarney      when the bat flew from tree to tree      my love and i did walk together      and sweet were the words she said to me       along with us the summer wind      went murmuringo happily      but softer than the breath of summer      was the kiss she gave to me     xxxii       rain has fallen all the day      o come among the laden trees      the leaves lie thick upon the way      of memories       staying a little by the way      of memories shall we depart      come my beloved where i may      speak to your heart     xxxiii       now o now in this brown land      where love did so sweet music make      we two shall wander hand in hand      forbearing for old friendship sake      nor grieve because our love was gay      which now is ended in this way       a rogue in red and yellow dress      is knocking knocking at the tree      and all around our loneliness      the wind is whistling merrily      the leavesthey do not sigh at all      when the year takes them in the fall       now o now we hear no more      the vilanelle and roundelay      yet will we kiss sweetheart before      we take sad leave at close of day      grieve not sweetheart for anything      the year the year is gathering     xxxiv       sleep now o sleep now      o you unquiet heart      a voice crying sleep now      is heard in my heart       the voice of the winter      is heard at the door      o sleep for the winter      is crying sleep no more       my kiss will give peace now      and quiet to your heart      sleep on in peace now      o you unquiet heart     xxxv       all day i hear the noise of waters      making moan      sad as the seabird is when going      forth alone      he hears the winds cry to the waters      monotone      the grey winds the cold winds are blowing      where i go      i hear the noise of many waters      far below      all day all night i hear them flowing      to and fro     xxxvi       i hear an army charging upon the land      and the thunder of horses plunging foam about their knees      arrogant in black armour behind them stand      disdaining the reins with fluttering ships the charioteers      they cry unto the night their battlename      i moan in sleep when i hear afar their whirling laughter      they cleave the gloom of dreams a blinding flame      clanging clanging upon the heart as upon an anvil      they come shaking in triumph their long green hair      they come out of the sea and run shouting by the shore      my heart have you no wisdom thus to despair      my love my love my love why have you left me alone
