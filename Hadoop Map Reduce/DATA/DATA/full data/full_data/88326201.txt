88326201	a little dinner at timminss   by william makepeace thackeray     i   mr and mrs fitzroy timmins live in lilliput street that neat little street which runs at right angles with the park and brobdingnag gardens it is a very genteel neighborhood and i need not say they are of a good family  especially mrs timmins as her mamma is always telling mr t they are suffolk people and distantly related to the right honorable the earl of bungay  besides his house in lilliput street mr timmins has chambers in figtree court temple and goes the northern circuit  the other day when there was a slight difference about the payment of fees between the great parliamentary counsel and the solicitors stoke and pogers of great george street sent the papers of the lough foyle and lough corrib junction railway to mr fitzroy timmins who was so elated that he instantly purchased a couple of lookingglasses for his drawingrooms the front room is 16 by 12 and the back a tight but elegant apartment 10 ft 6 by 8 ft 4 a coral for the baby two new dresses for mrs timmins and a little rosewood desk at the pantechnicon for which rosa had long been sighing with crumpled legs emeraldgreen and gold morocco top and drawers all over  mrs timmins is a very pretty poetess her lines to a faded tulip and her plaint of plinlimmon appeared in one of last years keepsakes and fitzroy as he impressed a kiss on the snowy forehead of his bride pointed out to her in one of the innumerable pockets of the desk an elegant rubytipped pen and six charming little gilt blank books marked my books which mrs fitzroy might fill he said he is an oxford man and very polite with the delightful productions of her muse besides these books there was pink paper paper with crimson edges lace paper all stamped with r f t rosa fitzroy timmins and the hand and battleaxe the crest of the timminses and borne at ascalon by roaldus de timmins a crusader who is now buried in the temple church next to serjeant snooks and yellow pink lightblue and other scented sealing waxes at the service of rosa when she chose to correspond with her friends  rosa you may be sure jumped with joy at the sight of this sweet present called her charles his first name is samuel but they have sunk that the best of men embraced him a great number of times to the edification of her buttony little page who stood at the landing and as soon as he was gone to chambers took the new pen and a sweet sheet of paper and began to compose a poem  what shall it be about was naturally her first thought what should be a young mothers first inspiration her child lay on the sofa asleep before her and she began in her neatest hand                                 lines       on my son bungay de bracy gashleigh tymmyns aged ten months                                                          tuesday            how beautiful how beautiful thou seemest              my boy my precious one my rosy babe            kind angels hover round thee as thou dreamest            soft lashes hide thy beauteous azure eye which gleamest  gleamest thine eye which gleamest is that grammar thought rosa who had puzzled her little brains for some time with this absurd question when the baby woke then the cook came up to ask about dinner then mrs fundy slipped over from no 27 they are opposite neighbors and made an acquaintance through mrs fundys macaw and a thousand things happened finally there was no rhyme to babe except tippoo saib against whom major gashleigh rosas grandfather had distinguished himself and so she gave up the little poem about her de bracy  nevertheless when fitzroy returned from chambers to take a walk with his wife in the park as he peeped through the rich tapestry hanging which divided the two drawingrooms he found his dear girl still seated at the desk and writing writing away with her ruby pen as fast as it could scribble  what a genius that child has he said why she is a second mrs norton and advanced smiling to peep over her shoulder and see what pretty thing rosa was composing  it was not poetry though that she was writing and fitz read as follows   lilliput street tuesday 22nd may  mr and mr fitzroy tymmyns request the pleasure of sir thomas and lady kickleburys company at dinner on wednesday at 7 12 oclock   my dear exclaimed the barrister pulling a long face  law fitzroy cried the beloved of his bosom how you do startle one  give a dinnerparty with our means said he  aint you making a fortune you miser rosa said fifteen guineas a day is four thousand five hundred a year ive calculated it and so saying she rose and taking hold of his whiskers which are as fine as those of any man of his circuit she put her mouth close up against his and did something to his long face which quite changed the expression of it and which the little page heard outside the door  our diningroom wont hold ten he said  well only ask twenty my love ten are sure to refuse in this season when everybody is giving parties look here is the list  earl and countess of bungay and lady barbara saint marys  you are dying to get a lord into the house timmins said he had not altered his name in figtree court yet and therefore i am not so affected as to call him tymmyns  law my dear they are our cousins and must be asked rosa said  let us put down my sister and tom crowder then  blanche crowder is really so very fat fitzroy his wife said and our rooms are so very small  fitz laughed you little rogue he said lady bungay weighs two of blanche even when shes not in the f  fiddlesticks rose cried out doctor crowder really cannot be admitted he makes such a noise eating his soup that it is really quite disagreeable and she imitated the gurgling noise performed by the doctor while inhausting his soup in such a funny way that fitz saw inviting him was out of the question  besides we mustnt have too many relations rosa went on mamma of course is coming she doesnt like to be asked in the evening and shell bring her silver breadbasket and her candlesticks which are very rich and handsome  and you complain of blanche for being too stout groaned out timmins  well well dont be in a pet said little rosa the girls wont come to dinner but will bring their music afterwards and she went on with the list  sir thomas and lady kicklebury 2 no saying no we must ask them charles they are rich people and any room in their house in brobdingnag gardens would swallow up our humble cot but to people in our position in society they will be glad enough to come the city people are glad to mix with the old families  very good says fitz with a sad face of assentand mrs timmins went on reading her list  mr and mrs topham sawyer belgravine place  mrs sawyer hasnt asked you all the season she gives herself the airs of an empress and when  ones member you know my dear one must have rosa replied with much dignity as if the presence of the representative of her native place would be a protection to her dinner and a note was written and transported by the page early next morning to the mansion of the sawyers in belgravine place   the topham sawyers had just come down to breakfast mrs t in her large dustcolored morningdress and madonna front she looks rather scraggy of a morning but i promise you her ringlets and figure will stun you of an evening and having read the note the following dialogue passed  mrs topham sawyerwell upon my word i dont know where things will end mr sawyer the timminses have asked us to dinner  mr topham sawyerask us to dinner what d impudence  mrs topham sawyerthe most dangerous and insolent revolutionary principles are abroad mr sawyer and i shall write and hint as much to these persons  mr topham sawyerno d it joanna they are my constituents and we must go write a civil note and say we will come to their party he resumes the perusal of the times and mrs topham sawyer writes   my dear rosawe shall have great pleasure in joining your little party i do not reply in the third person as we are old friends you know and country neighbors i hope your mamma is well present my kindest remembrances to her and i hope we shall see much more of each other in the summer when we go down to the sawpits for going abroad is out of the question in these dreadful times with a hundred kisses to your dear little pet  believe me your attached  j t s   she said pet because she did not know whether rosas child was a girl or boy and mrs timmins was very much pleased with the kind and gracious nature of the reply to her invitation     ii   the next persons whom little mrs timmins was bent upon asking were mr and mrs john rowdy of the firm of stumpy rowdy and co of brobdingnag gardens of the prairie putney and of lombard street city  mrs timinins and mrs rowdy had been brought up at the same school together and there was always a little rivalry between them from the day when they contended for the french prize at school to last week when each had a stall at the fancy fair for the benefit of the daughters of decayed muffinmen and when mrs timmins danced against mrs rowdy in the scythe mazurka at the polish ball headed by mrs hugh slasher rowdy took twentythree pounds more than timmins in the muffin transaction for she had possession of a kettleholder worked by the hands of rylty which brought crowds to her stall but in the mazurka rosa conquered she has the prettiest little foot possible which in a red boot and silver heel looked so lovely that even the chinese ambassador remarked it whereas mrs rowdys foot is no trifle as lord cornbury acknowledged when it came down on his lordships boottip as they danced together amongst the scythes  these people are ruining themselves said mrs john rowdy to her husband on receiving the pink note it was carried round by that rogue of a buttony page in the evening and he walked to brobdingnag gardens and in the park afterwards with a young lady who is kitchenmaid at 27 and who is not more than fourteen years older than little buttons  these people are ruining themselves said mrs john to her husband rosa says she has asked the bungays  bungays indeed timmins was always a tufthunter said rowdy who had been at college with the barrister and who for his own part has no more objection to a lord than you or i have and adding hang him what business has he to be giving parties allowed mrs rowdy nevertheless to accept rosas invitation  when i go to business tomorrow i will just have a look at mr fitzs account mr rowdy thought and if it is overdrawn as it usually is why    the announcement of mrs rowdys brougham here put an end to this agreeable train of thought and the banker and his lady stepped into it to join a snug little familyparty of twoandtwenty given by mr and mrs secondchop at their great house on the other side of the park  rowdys 2 bungays 3 ourselves and mamma 3 2 sawyers calculated little rosa  general gulpin rosa continued eats a great deal and is very stupid but he looks well at table with his star and ribbon let us put him down and she noted down sir thomas and lady gulpin 2 lord castlemouldy 1  you will make your party abominably genteel and stupid groaned timmins why dont you ask some of our old friends old mrs portman has asked us twenty times i am sure within the last two years  and the last time we went there there was peasoup for dinner mrs timmins said with a look of ineffable scorn  nobody can have been kinder than the hodges have always been to us and some sort of return we might make i think  return indeed a pretty sound it is on the staircase to hear mr and mrs odge and miss odges pronounced by billiter who always leaves his hs out no no see attorneys at your chambers my dearbut what could the poor creatures do in our society and so one by one timminss old friends were tried and eliminated by mrs timmins just as if she had been an irish attorneygeneral and they so many catholics on mr mitchels jury  mrs fitzroy insisted that the party should be of her very best company funnyman the great wit was asked because of his jokes and mrs butt on whom he practises and potter who is asked because everybody else asks him and mr ranville ranville of the foreign office who might give some news of the spanish squabble and botherby who has suddenly sprung up into note because he is intimate with the french revolution and visits ledrurollin and lamartine and these with a couple more who are amis de la maison made up the twenty whom mrs timmins thought she might safely invite to her little dinner  but the deuce of it was that when the answers to the invitations came back everybody accepted here was a pretty quandary how they were to get twenty into their diningroom was a calculation which poor timmins could not solve at all and he paced up and down the little room in dismay  pooh said rosa with a laugh your sister blanche looked very well in one of my dresses last year and you know how stout she is we will find some means to accommodate them all depend upon it  mrs john rowdys note to dear rosa accepting the latters invitation was a very gracious and kind one and mrs fitz showed it to her husband when he came back from chambers but there was another note which had arrived for him by this time from mr rowdyor rather from the firm and to the effect that mr f timmins had overdrawn his account 28l 18s 6d and was requested to pay that sum to his obedient servants stumpy rowdy and co    and timmins did not like to tell his wife that the contending parties in the lough foyle and lough corrib railroad had come to a settlement and that the fifteen guineas a day had consequently determined i have had seven days of it though he thought and that will be enough to pay for the desk the dinner and the glasses and make all right with stumpy and rowdy     iii   the cards for dinner having been issued it became the duty of mrs timmins to make further arrangements respecting the invitations to the teaparty which was to follow the more substantial meal  these arrangements are difficult as any lady knows who is in the habit of entertaining her friends there are  people who are offended if you ask them to tea whilst others have been asked to dinner  people who are offended if you ask them to tea at all and cry out furiously good heavens jane my love why do these timminses suppose that i am to leave my dinnertable to attend their  soiree the dear reader may fill up the  to any strength according to his likingor upon my word william my dear it is too much to ask us to pay twelve shillings for a brougham and to spend i dont know how much in gloves just to make our curtsies in mrs timminss little drawingroom mrs moser made the latter remark about the timmins affair while the former was uttered by mr grumpley barristeratlaw to his lady in gloucester place  that there are people who are offended if you dont ask them at all is a point which i suppose nobody will question timminss earliest friend in life was simmins whose wife and family have taken a cottage at mortlake for the season  we cant ask them to come out of the country rosa said to her fitzroybetween ourselves she was delighted that mrs simmins was out of the way and was as jealous of her as every wellregulated woman should be of her husbands female friendswe cant ask them to come so far for the evening  why no certainly said fitzroy who has himself no very great opinion of a teaparty and so the simminses were cut out of the list  and what was the consequence the consequence was that simmins and timmins cut when they met at westminster that mrs simmins sent back all the books which she had borrowed from rosa with a withering note of thanks that rosa goes about saying that mrs simmins squints that mrs s on her side declares that rosa is crooked and behaved shamefully to captain hicks in marrying fitzroy over him though she was forced to do it by her mother and prefers the captain to her husband to this day if in a word these two men could be made to fight i believe their wives would not be displeased and the reason of all this misery rage and dissension lies in a poor little twopenny dinnerparty in lilliput street  well the guests both for before and after meat having been asked old mrs gashleigh rosas motherand by consequence fitzroys dear motherinlaw though i promise you that dear is particularly sarcasticmrs gashleigh of course was sent for and came with miss eliza gashleigh who plays on the guitar and emily who limps a little but plays sweetly on the concertina they live close bytrust them for that your motherinlaw is always within hearing thank our stars for the attention of the dear women the gashleighs i say live close by and came early on the morning after rosas notes had been issued for the dinner  when fitzroy who was in his little study which opens into his little diningroomone of those absurd little rooms which ought to be called a gentlemans pantry and is scarcely bigger than a showerbath or a state cabin in a shipwhen fitzroy heard his motherinlaws knock and her wellknown scuffling and chattering in the passagein which she squeezed up young buttons the page while she put questions to him regarding baby and the cooks health and whether she had taken what mrs gashleigh had sent overnight and the housemaids health and whether mr timmins had gone to chambers or notand when after this preliminary chatter buttons flung open the door announcingmrs gashleigh and the young ladies fitzroy laid down his times newspaper with an expression that had best not be printed here and took his hat and walked away  mrs gashleigh has never liked him since he left off calling her mamma and kissing her but he said he could not stand it any longerhe was hanged if he would so he went away to chambers leaving the field clear to rosa mamma and the two dear girls  or to one of them rather for before leaving the house he thought he would have a look at little fitzroy up stairs in the nursery and he found the child in the hands of his maternal aunt eliza who was holding him and pinching him as if he had been her guitar i suppose so that the little fellow bawled pitifullyand his father finally quitted the premises  no sooner was he gone although the party was still a fortnight off than the women pounced upon his little study and began to put it in order some of his papers they pushed up over the bookcase some they put behind the encyclopaedia some they crammed into the drawerswhere mrs gashleigh found three cigars which she pocketed and some letters over which she cast her eye and by fitzs return they had the room as neat as possible and the best glass and dessertservice mustered on the study table  it was a very neat and handsome service as you may be sure mrs gashleigh thought whose rich uncle had purchased it for the young couple at spode and copelands but it was only for twelve persons  it was agreed that it would be in all respects cheaper and better to purchase a dozen more dessertplates and with my silver basket in the centre mrs g said she is always bragging about that confounded breadbasket we need not have any extra china dishes and the table will look very pretty  on making a rollcall of the glass it was calculated that at least a dozen or so tumblers four or five dozen wines eight waterbottles and a proper quantity of iceplates were requisite and that as they would always be useful it would be best to purchase the articles immediately fitz tumbled over the basket containing them which stood in the hall as he came in from chambers and over the boy who had brought themand the little bill  the women had had a long debate and something like a quarrel it must be owned over the bill of fare mrs gashleigh who had lived a great part of her life in devonshire and kept house in great state there was famous for making some dishes without which she thought no dinner could be perfect when she proposed her mockturtle and stewed pigeons and gooseberrycream rosa turned up her nosea pretty little nose it was by the way and with a natural turn in that direction  mockturtle in june mamma said she  it was good enough for your grandfather rosa the mamma replied it was good enough for the lord high admiral when he was at plymouth it was good enough for the first men in the county and relished by lord fortyskewer and lord rolls sir lawrence porker ate twice of it after exeter races and i think it might be good enough for  i will not have it mamma said rosa with a stamp of her foot and mrs gashleigh knew what resolution there was in that once when she had tried to physic the baby there had been a similar fight between them  so mrs gashleigh made out a carte in which the soup was left with a dasha melancholy vacuum and in which the pigeons were certainly thrust in among the entrees but rosa determined they never should make an entree at all into her dinnerparty but that she would have the dinner her own way  when fitz returned then and after he had paid the little bill of 6l 14s 6d for the glass rosa flew to him with her sweetest smiles and the baby in her arms and after she had made him remark how the child grew every day more and more like him and after she had treated him to a number of compliments and caresses which it were positively fulsome to exhibit in public and after she had soothed him into good humor by her artless tenderness she began to speak to him about some little points which she had at heart  she pointed out with a sigh how shabby the old curtains looked since the dear new glasses which her darling fitz had given her had been put up in the drawingroom muslin curtains cost nothing and she must and would have them  the muslin curtains were accorded she and fitz went and bought them at shoolbreds when you may be sure she treated herself likewise to a neat sweet pretty halfmourning for the court you know is in mourninga neat sweet barege or calimanco or bombazine or tiffany or some such thing but madame camille of regent street made it up and rosa looked like an angel in it on the night of her little dinner  and my sweet she continued after the curtains had been accorded mamma and i have been talking about the dinner she wants to make it very expensive which i cannot allow i have been thinking of a delightful and economical plan and you my sweetest fitz must put it into execution  i have cooked a muttonchop when i was in chambers fitz said with a laugh am i to put on a cap and an apron  no but you are to go to the megatherium club where you wretch you are always going without my leave and you are to beg monsieur mirobolant your famous cook to send you one of his best aidesdecamp as i know he will and with his aid we can dress the dinner and the confectionery at home for almost nothing and we can show those purseproud topham sawyers and rowdys that the humble cottage can furnish forth an elegant entertainment as well as the gilded halls of wealth  fitz agreed to speak to monsieur mirobolant if rosa had had a fancy for the cook of the prime minister i believe the deluded creature of a husband would have asked lord john for the loan of him     iv   fitzroy timmins whose taste for wine is remarkable for so young a man is a member of the committee of the megatherium club and the great mirobolant goodnatured as all great men are was only too happy to oblige him a young friend and protege of his of considerable merit m cavalcadour happened to be disengaged through the lamented death of lord hauncher with whom young cavalcadour had made his debut as an artist he had nothing to refuse to his master mirobolant and would impress himself to be useful to a gourmet so distinguished as monsieur timmins fitz went away as pleased as punch with this encomium of the great mirobolant and was one of those who voted against the decreasing of mirobolants salary when the measure was proposed by mr parings colonel close and the screw party in the committee of the club  faithful to the promise of his great master the youthful cavalcadour called in lilliput street the next day a rich crimson velvet waistcoat with buttons of blue glass and gold a variegated blue satin stock over which a graceful mosaic chain hung in glittering folds a white hat worn on one side of his long curling ringlets redolent with the most delightful hairoilone of those white hats which looks as if it had been just skinnedand a pair of gloves not exactly of the color of beurre frais but of beurre that has been up the chimney with a natty cane with a gilt knob completed the upper part at any rate of the costume of the young fellow whom the page introduced to mrs timmins  her mamma and she had been just having a dispute about the gooseberrycream when cavalcadour arrived his presence silenced mrs gashleigh and rosa in carrying on a conversation with him in the french languagewhich she had acquired perfectly in an elegant finishing establishment in kensington squarehad a great advantage over her mother who could only pursue the dialogue with very much difficulty eying one or other interlocutor with an alarmed and suspicious look and gasping out we whenever she thought a proper opportunity arose for the use of that affirmative  i have two leetl menus weez me said cavalcadour to mrs gashleigh  minewsyesoh indeed answered the lady  two little cartes  oh two carts oh we she said coming i suppose and she looked out of the window to see if they were there  cavalcadour smiled he produced from a pocketbook a pink paper and a blue paper on which he had written two bills of farethe last two which he had composed for the lamented hauncherand he handed these over to mrs fitzroy  the poor little woman was dreadfully puzzled with these documents she has them in her possession still and began to read from the pink one as follows                          diner pour 16 personnes                         potage clair a la rigodon                        do a la prince de tombuctou                                deux poissons              saumon de severne                 rougets gratines              a la boadicee                    a la cleopatre                                 deux releves                le chapeauatroiscornes farci a la robespierre                         le tirebotte a lodalisque                                 six entrees                    saute de hannetons a lepingliere                      cotelettes a la megatherium                   bourrasque de veau a la palsambleu             laitances de carpe en goguette a la reine pomare             turban de volaille a larcheveque de cantorbery  and so on with the entremets and hors doeuvres and the rotis and the releves  madame will see that the dinners are quite simple said m cavalcadour  oh quite said rosa dreadfully puzzled  which would madame like  which would we like mamma rosa asked adding as if after a little thought i think sir we should prefer the blue one at which mrs gashleigh nodded as knowingly as she could though pink or blue i defy anybody to know what these cooks mean by their jargon  if you please madame we will go down below and examine the scene of operations monsieur cavalcadour said and so he was marshalled down the stairs to the kitchen which he didnt like to name and appeared before the cook in all his splendor  he cast a rapid glance round the premises and a smile of something like contempt lighted up his features will you bring pen and ink if you please and i will write down a few of the articles which will be necessary for us we shall require if you please eight more stewpans a couple of braisingpans eight sautepans six bainmariepans a freezingpot with accessories and a few more articles of which i will inscribe the names and mr cavalcadour did so dashing down with the rapidity of genius a tremendous list of ironmongery goods which he handed over to mrs timmins she and her mamma were quite frightened by the awful catalogue  i will call three days hence and superintend the progress of matters and we will make the stock for the soup the day before the dinner  dont you think sir here interposed mrs gashleigh that one soupa fine rich mockturtle such as i have seen in the best houses in the west of england and such as the late lord fortyskewer  you will get what is wanted for the soups if you please mr cavalcadour continued not heeding this interruption and as bold as a captain on his own quarterdeck for the stock of clear soup you will get a leg of beef a leg of veal and a ham  we munseer said the cook dropping a terrified curtsy a leg of beef a leg of veal and a ham  you cant serve a leg of veal at a party said mrs gashleigh and a leg of beef is not a company dish  madame they are to make the stock of the clear soup mr cavalcadour said  what cried mrs gashleigh and the cook repeated his former expression  never whilst i am in this house cried out mrs gashleigh indignantly never in a christian english household never shall such sinful waste be permitted by me if you wish me to dine rosa you must get a dinner less expensive the right honorable lord fortyskewer could dine sir without these wicked luxuries and i presume my daughters guests can  madame is perfectly at liberty to decide said m cavalcadour i came to oblige madame and my good friend mirobolant not myself  thank you sir i think it will be too expensive rosa stammered in a great flutter but i am very much obliged to you  il ny a point dobligation madame said monsieur alcide camille cavalcadour in his most superb manner and making a splendid bow to the lady of the house was respectfully conducted to the upper regions by little buttons leaving rosa frightened the cook amazed and silent and mrs gashleigh boiling with indignation against the dresser  up to that moment mrs blowser the cook who had come out of devonshire with mrs gashleigh of course that lady garrisoned her daughters house with servants and expected them to give her information of everything which took place there up to that moment i say the cook had been quite contented with that subterraneous station which she occupied in life and had a pride in keeping her kitchen neat bright and clean it was in her opinion the comfortablest room in the house we all thought so when we came down of a night to smoke there and the handsomest kitchen in lilliput street  but after the visit of cavalcadour the cook became quite discontented and uneasy in her mind she talked in a melancholy manner over the arearailings to the cooks at twentythree and twentyfive she stepped over the way and conferred with the cook there she made inquiries at the bakers and at other places about the kitchens in the great houses in brobdingnag gardens and how many spits bangmarrypans and stoopans they had she thought she could not do with an occasional help but must have a kitchenmaid and she was often discovered by a gentleman of the police force who was i believe her cousin and occasionally visited her when mrs gashleigh was not in the house or spying itshe was discovered seated with mrs rundell in her lap its leaves bespattered with her tears my pease be gone pelisse she said zins i zaw that ther franchman and it was all the faithful fellow could do to console her   the dinner said timmins in a rage at last having it cooked in the house is out of the question the bother of it and the row your mother makes are enough to drive one mad it wont happen again i can promise you rosa order it at fubsbys at once you can have everything from fubsbysfrom footmen to saltspoons lets go and order it at fubsbys  darling if you dont mind the expense and it will be any relief to you let us do as you wish rosa said and she put on her bonnet and they went off to the grand cook and confectioner of the brobdingnag quarter     v   on the arm of her fitzroy rosa went off to fubsbys that magnificent shop at the corner of parliament place and alicompayne squarea shop into which the rogue had often cast a glance of approbation as he passed for there are not only the most wonderful and delicious cakes and confections in the window but at the counter there are almost sure to be three or four of the prettiest women in the whole of this world with little darling caps of the last french make with beautiful wavy hair and the neatest possible waists and aprons  yes there they sit and others perhaps besides fitz have cast a sheepseye through those enormous plateglass windowpanes i suppose it is the fact of perpetually living among such a quantity of good things that makes those young ladies so beautiful they come into the place let us say like ordinary people and gradually grow handsomer and handsomer until they grow out into the perfect angels you see it cant be otherwise if you and i my dear fellow were to have a course of that place we should become beautiful too they live in an atmosphere of the most delicious pineapples blancmanges creams some whipt and some so good that of course they dont want whipping jellies tipsycakes cherrybrandyone hundred thousand sweet and lovely things look at the preserved fruits look at the golden ginger the outspreading ananas the darling little rogues of china oranges ranged in the gleaming crystal cylinders mon dieu look at the strawberries in the leaves each of them is as large nearly as a ladys reticule and looks as if it had been brought up in a nursery to itself one of those strawberries is a meal for those young ladies behind the counter they nibble off a little from the side and if they are very hungry which can scarcely ever happen they are allowed to go to the crystal canisters and take out a routcake or macaroon in the evening they sit and tell each other little riddles out of the bonbons and when they wish to amuse themselves they read the most delightful remarks in the french language about love and cupid and beauty before they place them inside the crackers they always are writing down good things into mr fubsbys ledgers it must be a perfect feast to read them talk of the garden of eden i believe it was nothing to mr fubsbys house and i have no doubt that after those young ladies have been there a certain time they get to such a pitch of loveliness at last that they become complete angels with wings sprouting out of their lovely shoulders when after giving just a preparatory balance or two they fly up to the counter and perch there for a minute hop down again and affectionately kiss the other young ladies and say goodby dears we shall meet again la haut and then with a whir of their deliciously scented wings away they fly for good whisking over the trees of brobdingnag square and up into the sky as the policeman touches his hat  it is up there that they invent the legends for the crackers and the wonderful riddles and remarks on the bonbons no mortal i am sure could write them  i never saw a man in such a state as fitzroy timmins in the presence of those ravishing houris mrs fitz having explained that they required a dinner for twenty persons the chief young lady asked what mr and mrs fitz would like and named a thousand things each better than the other to all of which fitz instantly said yes the wretch was in such a state of infatuation that i believe if that lady had proposed to him a fricasseed elephant or a boaconstrictor in jelly he would have said o yes certainly put it down  that peri wrote down in her album a list of things which it would make your mouth water to listen to but she took it all quite calmly heaven bless you they dont care about things that are no delicacies to them but whatever she chose to write down fitzroy let her  after the dinner and dessert were ordered at fubsbys they furnish everything dinner and dessert plate and china servants in your own livery and if you please guests of title too the married couple retreated from that shop of wonders rosa delighted that the trouble of the dinner was all off their hands but she was afraid it would be rather expensive  nothing can be too expensive which pleases you dear fitz said  by the way one of those young women was rather goodlooking rosa remarked the one in the cap with the blue ribbons and she cast about the shape of the cap in her mind and determined to have exactly such another  think so i didnt observe said the miserable hypocrite by her side and when he had seen rosa home he went back like an infamous fiend to order something else which he had forgotten he said at fubsbys get out of that paradise you cowardly creeping vile serpent you  until the day of the dinner the infatuated fop was always going to fubsbys he was remarked there he used to go before he went to chambers in the morning and sometimes on his return from the temple but the morning was the time which he preferred and one day when he went on one of his eternal pretexts and was chattering and flirting at the counter a lady who had been reading yesterdays paper and eating a halfpenny bun for an hour in the back shop if that paradise may be called a shopa lady stepped forward laid down the morning herald and confronted him  that lady was mrs gashleigh from that day the miserable fitzroy was in her power and she resumed a sway over his house to shake off which had been the object of his life and the result of many battles and for a mere freakfor on going into fubsbys a week afterwards he found the peris drinking tea out of blue cups and eating stale bread and butter when his absurd passion instantly vanishedi say for a mere freak the most intolerable burden of his life was put on his shoulders againhis motherinlaw  on the day before the little dinner took placeand i promise you we shall come to it in the very next chaptera tall and elegant middleaged gentleman who might have passed for an earl but that there was a slight incompleteness about his hands and feet the former being uncommonly red and the latter large and irregular was introduced to mrs timmins by the page who announced him as mr truncheon  im truncheon maam he said with a low bow  indeed said rosa  about the dinner mm from fubsbys mm as you have no butler mm i presume you will wish me to act as sich i shall bring two persons as haids tomorrow both answers to the name of john id best if you please inspect the premisis and will think you to allow your young man to show me the pantry and kitching  truncheon spoke in a low voice and with the deepest and most respectful melancholy there is not much expression in his eyes but from what there is you would fancy that he was oppressed by a secret sorrow rosa trembled as she surveyed this gentlemans size his splendid appearance and gravity i am sure she said i never shall dare to ask him to hand a glass of water even mrs gashleigh when she came on the morning of the actual dinnerparty to superintend matters was cowed and retreated from the kitchen before the calm majesty of truncheon  and yet that great man was like all the truly greataffable  he put aside his coat and waistcoat both of evening cut and looking prematurely splendid as he walked the streets in noonday and did not disdain to rub the glasses and polish the decanters and to show young buttons the proper mode of preparing these articles for a dinner and while he operated the maids and buttons and cook when she couldand what had she but the vegetables to boilcrowded round him and listened with wonder as he talked of the great families as he had lived with that man as they saw him there before them had been cabboy to lord tantallan valet to the earl of bareacres and groom of the chambers to the duchess dowager of fitzbattleaxe oh it was delightful to hear mr truncheon     vi   on the great momentous stupendous day of the dinner my beloved female reader may imagine that fitzroy timmins was sent about his business at an early hour in the morning while the women began to make preparations to receive their guests there will be no need of your going to fubsbys mrs gashleigh said to him with a look that drove him out of doors everything that we require has been ordered there you will please to be back here at six oclock and not sooner and i presume you will acquiesce in my arrangements about the wine  o yes mamma said the prostrate soninlaw  in so large a partya party beyond some folks meansexpensive wines are absurd the light sherry at 26s the champagne at 42s and you are not to go beyond 36s for the claret and port after dinner mind coffee will be served and you come up stairs after two rounds of the claret  of course of course acquiesced the wretch and hurried out of the house to his chambers and to discharge the commissions with which the womankind had intrusted him  as for mrs gashleigh you might have heard her bawling over the house the whole day long that admirable woman was everywhere in the kitchen until the arrival of truncheon before whom she would not retreat without a battle on the stairs in fitzroys dressingroom and in fitzroy minors nursery to whom she gave a dose of her own composition while the nurse was sent out on a pretext to make purchases of garnish for the dishes to be served for the little dinner garnish for the dishes as if the folks at fubsbys could not garnish dishes better than gashleigh with her stupid oldworld devices of laurelleaves parsley and cut turnips why there was not a dish served that day that was not covered over with skewers on which truffles crayfish mushrooms and forcedmeat were impaled when old gashleigh went down with her barbarian bunches of holly and greens to stick about the meats even the cook saw their incongruity and at truncheons orders flung the whole shrubbery into the dusthouse where while poking about the premises you may be sure mrs g saw it  every candle which was to be burned that night including the tallow candle which she said was a good enough bedlight for fitzroy she stuck into the candlesticks with her own hands giving her own highshouldered plated candlesticks of the year 1798 the place of honor she upset all poor rosas floral arrangements turning the nosegays from one vase into the other without any pity and was never tired of beating and pushing and patting and whapping the curtain and sofa draperies into shape in the little drawingroom  in fitzs own apartments she revelled with peculiar pleasure it has been described how she had sacked his study and pushed away his papers some of which including three cigars and the commencement of an article for the law magazine lives of the sheriffs officers he has never been able to find to this day mamma now went into the little room in the back regions which is fitzs dressingroom and was destined to be a cloakroom and here she rummaged to her hearts delight  in an incredibly short space of time she examined all his outlying pockets drawers and letters she inspected his socks and handkerchiefs in the top drawers and on the dressingtable his razors shavingstrop and hairoil she carried off his silvertopped scentbottle out of his dressingcase and a halfdozen of his favorite pills which fitz possesses in common with every wellregulated man and probably administered them to her own family his boots glossy pumps and slippers she pushed into the showerbath where the poor fellow stepped into them the next morning in the midst of a pool in which they were lying the baby was found sucking his boothooks the next day in the nursery and as for the bottle of varnish for his shoes which he generally paints upon the trees himself having a pretty taste in that way it could never be found to the present hour but it was remarked that the young master gashleighs when they came home for the holidays always wore lacquered highlows and the reader may draw his conclusions from that fact  in the course of the day all the servants gave mrs timmins warning  the cook said she coodnt abear it no longer aving mrs g always about her kitching with her fingers in all the saucepans mrs g had got her the place but she preferred one as mrs g didnt get for her  the nurse said she was come to nuss master fitzroy and knew her duty his grandmamma wasnt his nuss and was always aggrawating hermissus must shoot herself elsewhere  the housemaid gave utterance to the same sentiments in language more violent  little buttons bounced up to his mistress said he was butler of the family mrs g was always poking about his pantry and dam if hed stand it  at every moment rosa grew more and more bewildered the baby howled a great deal during the day his large china christeningbowl was cracked by mrs gashleigh altering the flowers in it and pretending to be very cool whilst her hands shook with rage  pray go on mamma rosa said with tears in her eyes should you like to break the chandelier  ungrateful unnatural child bellowed the other only that i know you couldnt do without me id leave the house this minute  as you wish said rosa but mrs g didnt wish and in this juncture truncheon arrived  that officer surveyed the diningroom laid the cloth there with admirable precision and neatness ranged the plate on the sideboard with graceful accuracy but objected to that old thing in the centre as he called mrs gashleighs silver basket as cumbrous and useless for the table where they would want all the room they could get  order was not restored to the house nor indeed any decent progress made until this great man came but where there was a revolt before and a general disposition to strike work and to yell out defiance against mrs gashleigh who was sitting bewildered and furious in the drawingroomwhere there was before commotion at the appearance of the masterspirit all was peace and unanimity the cook went back to her pans the housemaid busied herself with the china and glass cleaning some articles and breaking others buttons sprang up and down the stairs obedient to the orders of his chief and all things went well and in their season  at six the man with the wine came from binney and lathams at a quarter past six timmins himself arrived  at half past six he might have been heard shouting out for his varnished boots but we know where those had been hiddenand for his dressing things but mrs gashleigh had put them away  as in his vain inquiries for these articles he stood shouting nurse buttons rosa my dear and the most fearful execrations up and down the stairs mr truncheon came out on him  egscuse me sir says he but its impawsable we cant dine twenty at that tablenot if you set em out awinder we cant  whats to be done asked fitzroy in an agony theyve all said theyd come  cant do it said the other with two top and bottomand your table is as narrow as a benchwe cant hold more than heighteen and then each persons helbows will be into his neighbors cheer  rosa mrs gashleigh cried out timmins come down and speak to this gentlthis  truncheon sir said the man  the women descended from the drawingroom look and see ladies he said inducting them into the diningroom theres the room theres the table laid for heighteen and i defy you to squeege in more  one person in a party always fails said mrs gashleigh getting alarmed  thats nineteen mr truncheon remarked we must knock another hoff mam and he looked her hard in the face  mrs gashleigh was very red and nervous and paced or rather squeezed round the table it was as much as she could do the chairs could not be put any closer than they were it was impossible unless the convive sat as a centrepiece in the middle to put another guest at that table  look at that lady movin round sir you see now the difficklty if my men wasnt thinner they couldnt hoperate at all mr truncheon observed who seemed to have a spite to mrs gashleigh  what is to be done she said with purple accents  my dearest mamma rosa cried out you must stop at homehow sorry i am and she shot one glance at fitzroy who shot another at the great truncheon who held down his eyes we could manage with heighteen he said mildly  mrs gashleigh gave a hideous laugh    she went away at eight oclock she was pacing at the corner of the street and actually saw the company arrive first came the topham sawyers in their lightblue carriage with the white hammercloth and blue and white ribbonstheir footmen drove the house down with the knocking  then followed the ponderous and snuffcolored vehicle with faded gilt wheels and brass earls coronets all over it the conveyance of the house of bungay the countess of bungay and daughter stepped out of the carriage the fourteenth earl of bungay couldnt come  sir thomas and lady gulpins fly made its appearance from which issued the general with his star and lady gulpin in yellow satin the rowdys brougham followed next after which mrs butts handsome equipage drove up  the two friends of the house young gentlemen from the temple now arrived in cab no 9996 we tossed up in fact which should pay the fare  mr ranville ranville walked and was dusting his boots as the templars drove up lord castlemouldy came out of a twopenny omnibus funnyman the wag came last whirling up rapidly in a hansom just as mrs gashleigh with rage in her heart was counting that two people had failed and that there were only seventeen after all  mr truncheon passed our names to mr billiter who bawled them out on the stairs rosa was smiling in a pink dress and looking as fresh as an angel and received her company with that grace which has always characterized her  the moment of the dinner arrived old lady bungay scuffled off on the arm of fitzroy while the rear was brought up by rosa and lord castlemouldy of ballyshanvanvoght castle co tipperary some fellows who had the luck took down ladies to dinner i was not sorry to be out of the way of mrs rowdy with her dandified airs or of that high and mighty county princess mrs topham sawyer     vii   of course it does not become the present writer who has partaken of the best entertainment which his friends could supply to make fun of their somewhat ostentatious as it must be confessed hospitality if they gave a dinner beyond their means it is no business of mine i hate a man who goes and eats a friends meat and then blabs the secrets of the mahogany such a man deserves never to be asked to dinner again and though at the close of a london season that seems no great loss and you sicken of a whitebait as you would of a whaleyet we must always remember that theres another season coming and hold our tongues for the present  as for describing then the mere victuals on timminss table that would be absurd everybodyi mean of the genteel world of course of which i make no doubt the reader is a polite ornamenteverybody has the same everything in london you see the same coats the same dinners the same boiled fowls and mutton the same cutlets fish and cucumbers the same lumps of wenham lake ice c the waiters with white neckcloths are as like each other everywhere as the peas which they hand round with the ducks of the second course cant any one invent anything new  the only difference between timminss dinner and his neighbors was that he had hired as we have said the greater part of the plate and that his cowardly conscience magnified faults and disasters of which no one else probably took heed  but rosa thought from the supercilious air with which mrs topham sawyer was eying the plate and other arrangements that she was remarking the difference of the ciphers on the forks and spoonswhich had in fact been borrowed from every one of fitzroys friendsi know for instance that he had my six among others and only returned five along with a battered old blackpronged plated abomination which i have no doubt belongs to mrs gashleigh whom i hereby request to send back mine in exchangetheir guilty consciences i say made them fancy that every one was spying out their domestic deficiencies whereas it is probable that nobody present thought of their failings at all people never do they never see holes in their neighbors coatsthey are too indolent simple and charitable  some things however one could not help remarking for instance though fitz is my closest friend yet could i avoid seeing and being amused by his perplexity and his dismal efforts to be facetious his eye wandered all round the little room with quick uneasy glances very different from those frank and jovial looks with which he is accustomed to welcome you to a leg of mutton and rosa from the other end of the table and over the flowers entree dishes and winecoolers telegraphed him with signals of corresponding alarm poor devils why did they ever go beyond that leg of mutton  funnyman was not brilliant in conversation scarcely opening his mouth except for the purposes of feasting the fact is our friend tom dawson was at table who knew all his stories and in his presence the greatest wag is always silent and uneasy  fitz has a very pretty wit of his own and a good reputation on circuit but he is timid before great people and indeed the presence of that awful lady bungay on his right hand was enough to damp him she was in court mourning for the late prince of schlippenschloppen she had on a large black funereal turban and appurtenances and a vast breastplate of twinkling twiddling black bugles no wonder a man could not be gay in talking to her  mrs rowdy and mrs topham sawyer love each other as women do who have the same receiving nights and ask the same society they were only separated by ranville ranville who tries to be well with both and they talked at each other across him  topham and rowdy growled out a conversation about rum ireland and the navigation laws quite unfit for print sawyer never speaks three words without mentioning the house and the speaker  the irish peer said nothing which was a comfort but he ate and drank of everything which came in his way and cut his usual absurd figure in dyed whiskers and a yellow underwaistcoat  general gulpin sported his star and looked fat and florid but melancholy his wife ordered away his dinner just like honest sanchos physician at barataria  botherbys stories about lamartine are as old as the hills since the barricades of 1848 and he could not get in a word or cut the slightest figure and as for tom dawson he was carrying on an undertoned smalltalk with lady barbara st marys so that there was not much conversation worth record going on within the diningroom  outside it was different those houses in lilliput street are so uncommonly compact that you can hear everything which takes place all over the tenement and so  in the awful pauses of the banquet and the halldoor being furthermore open we had the benefit of hearing  the cook and the occasional cook below stairs exchanging rapid phrases regarding the dinner  the smash of the souptureen and swift descent of the kitchenmaid and soupladle down the stairs to the lower regions this accident created a laugh and rather amused fitzroy and the company and caused funnyman to say bowing to rosa that she was mistress of herself though china fall but she did not heed him for at that moment another noise commenced namely that of  the baby in the upper rooms who commenced a series of piercing yells which though stopped by the sudden clapping to of the nurserydoor were only more dreadful to the mother when suppressed she would have given a guinea to go up stairs and have done with the whole entertainment  a thundering knock came at the door very early after the dessert and the poor soul took a speedy opportunity of summoning the ladies to depart though you may be sure it was only old mrs gashleigh who had come with her daughtersof course the first person to come i saw her red gown whisking up the stairs which were covered with plates and dishes over which she trampled  instead of having any quiet after the retreat of the ladies the house was kept in a rattle and the glasses jingled on the table as the flymen and coachmen plied the knocker and the soiree came in from my place i could see everything the guests as they arrived i remarked very few carriages mostly cabs and flies and a little crowd of blackguard boys and children who were formed round the door and gave ironical cheers to the folks as they stepped out of their vehicles  as for the eveningparty if a crowd in the dogdays is pleasant poor mrs timmins certainly had a successful soiree you could hardly move on the stair mrs sternhold broke in the banisters and nearly fell through there was such a noise and chatter you could not hear the singing of the miss gashleighs which was no great loss lady bungay could hardly get to her carriage being entangled with colonel wedgewood in the passage an absurd attempt was made to get up a dance of some kind but before mrs crowder had got round the room the hanginglamp in the diningroom below was stove in and fell with a crash on the table now prepared for refreshment  why in fact did the timminses give that party at all it was quite beyond their means they have offended a score of their old friends and pleased none of their acquaintances so angry were many who were not asked that poor rosa says she must now give a couple more parties and take in those not previously invited and i know for a fact that fubsbys bill is not yet paid nor binney and lathams the winemerchants that the breakage and hire of glass and china cost ever so much money that every true friend of timmins has cried out against his absurd extravagance and that now when every one is going out of town fitz has hardly money to pay his circuit much more to take rosa to a wateringplace as he wished and promised  as for mrs gashleigh the only feasible plan of economy which she can suggest is that she could come and live with her daughter and soninlaw and that they should keep house together if he agrees to this she has a little sum at the bankers with which she would not mind easing his present difficulties and the poor wretch is so utterly bewildered and crestfallen that it is very likely he will become her victim  the topham sawyers when they go down into the country will represent fitz as a ruined man and reckless prodigal his uncle the attorney from whom he has expectations will most likely withdraw his business and adopt some other member of his familyblanche crowder for instance whose husband the doctor has had high words with poor fitzroy already of course at the womens instigation and all these accumulated miseries fall upon the unfortunate wretch because he was goodnatured and his wife would have a little dinner
