74985910	the adventures of sally   by p g wodehouse      chapter i sally gives a party    1  sally looked contentedly down the long table she felt happy at last everybody was talking and laughing now and her party rallying after an uncertain start was plainly the success she had hoped it would be the first atmosphere of uncomfortable restraint caused she was only too well aware by her brother fillmores white evening waistcoat had worn off and the male and female patrons of mrs meechers select boardinghouse transient and residential were themselves again  at her end of the table the conversation had turned once more to the great vital topic of sallys legacy and what she ought to do with it the next best thing to having money of ones own is to dictate the spending of somebody elses and sallys guests were finding a good deal of satisfaction in arranging a budget for her rumour having put the sum at their disposal at a high figure their suggestions had certain spaciousness  let me tell you said augustus bartlett briskly what id do if i were you augustus bartlett who occupied an intensely subordinate position in the firm of kahn morris and brown the wall street brokers always affected a brisk incisive style of speech as befitted a man in close touch with the great ones of finance id sink a couple of hundred thousand in some good safe bondissueweve just put one out which you would do well to considerand play about with the rest when i say play about i mean have a flutter in anything good that crops up multiple steels worth looking at they tell me itll be up to a hundred and fifty before next saturday  elsa doland the pretty girl with the big eyes who sat on mr bartletts left had other views  buy a theatre sally and put on good stuff  and lose every bean youve got said a mild young man with a deep voice across the table if i had a few hundred thousand said the mild young man id put every cent of it on benny whistler for the heavyweight championship ive private information that battling tuke has been got at and means to lie down in the seventh  say listen interrupted another voice lemme tell you what id do with four hundred thousand  if i had four hundred thousand said elsa doland i know what would be the first thing id do  whats that asked sally  pay my bill for last week due this morning  sally got up quickly and flitting down the table put her arm round her friends shoulder and whispered in her ear  elsa darling are you really broke if you are you know ill  elsa doland laughed  youre an angel sally theres no one like you youd give your last cent to anyone of course im not broke ive just come back from the road and ive saved a fortune i only said that to draw you  sally returned to her seat relieved and found that the company had now divided itself into two schools of thought the conservative and prudent element led by augustus bartlett had definitely decided on three hundred thousand in liberty bonds and the rest in some safe real estate while the smaller more sporting section impressed by the mild young mans inside information had already placed sallys money on benny whistler doling it out cautiously in small sums so as not to spoil the market and so solid it seemed was mr tukes reputation with those in the inner circle of knowledge that the mild young man was confident that if you went about the matter cannily and without precipitation three to one might be obtained it seemed to sally that the time had come to correct certain misapprehensions  i dont know where you get your figures she said but im afraid theyre wrong ive just twentyfive thousand dollars  the statement had a chilling effect to these jugglers with halfmillions the amount mentioned seemed for the moment almost too small to bother about it was the sort of sum which they had been mentally setting aside for the heiresss car fare then they managed to adjust their minds to it after all one could do something even with a pittance like twentyfive thousand  if id twentyfive thousand said augustus bartlett the first to rally from the shock id buy amalgamated  if i had twentyfive thousand began elsa doland  if id had twentyfive thousand in the year nineteen hundred observed a gloomylooking man with spectacles i could have started a revolution in paraguay  he brooded sombrely on what might have been  well ill tell you exactly what im going to do said sally im going to start with a trip to europe france specially ive heard france well spoken ofas soon as i can get my passport and after ive loafed there for a few weeks im coming back to look about and find some nice cosy little business which will let me put money into it and keep me in luxury are there any complaints  even a couple of thousand on benny whistler said the mild young man  i dont want your benny whistler said sally i wouldnt have him if you gave him to me if i want to lose money ill go to monte carlo and do it properly  monte carlo said the gloomy man brightening up at the magic name i was in monte carlo in the year 97 and if id had another fifty dollars just fifty id have  at the far end of the table there was a stir a cough and the grating of a chair on the floor and slowly with that easy grace which actors of the old school learned in the days when acting was acting mr maxwell faucitt the boardinghouses oldest inhabitant rose to his feet  ladies said mr faucitt bowing courteously and ceasing to bow and casting from beneath his white and venerable eyebrows a quelling glance at certain male members of the boardinghouses younger set who were showing a disposition towards restiveness  gentlemen i feel that i cannot allow this occasion to pass without saying a few words  his audience did not seem surprised it was possible that life always prolific of incident in a great city like new york might some day produce an occasion which mr faucitt would feel that he could allow to pass without saying a few words but nothing of the sort had happened as yet and they had given up hope right from the start of the meal they had felt that it would be optimism run mad to expect the old gentleman to abstain from speech on the night of sally nicholas farewell dinner party and partly because they had braced themselves to it but principally because miss nicholas hospitality had left them with a genial feeling of repletion they settled themselves to listen with something resembling equanimity a movement on the part of the marvellous murphysnew arrivals who had been playing the bushwick with their equilibristic act during the preceding weekto form a party of the extreme left and heckle the speaker broke down under a cold look from their hostess brief though their acquaintance had been both of these lissom young gentlemen admired sally immensely  and it should be set on record that this admiration of theirs was not misplaced he would have been hard to please who had not been attracted by sally she was a small trim wisp of a girl with the tiniest hands and feet the friendliest of smiles and a dimple that came and went in the curve of her rounded chin her eyes which disappeared when she laughed which was often were a bright hazel her hair a soft mass of brown she had moreover a manner an air of distinction lacking in the majority of mrs meechers guests and she carried youth like a banner in approving of sally the marvellous murphys had been guilty of no lapse from their high critical standard  i have been asked proceeded mr faucitt though i am aware that there are others here far worthier of such a taskbrutuses compared with whom i like marc antony am no oratori have been asked to propose the health  who asked you it was the smaller of the marvellous murphys who spoke he was an unpleasant youth snubnosed and spotty still he could balance himself with one hand on an inverted gingerale bottle while revolving a barrel on the soles of his feet there is good in all of us  i have been asked repeated mr faucitt ignoring the unmannerly interruption which indeed he would have found it hard to answer to propose the health of our charming hostess applause coupled with the name of her brother our old friend fillmore nicholas  the gentleman referred to who sat at the speakers end of the table acknowledged the tribute with a brief nod of the head it was a nod of condescension the nod of one who conscious of being hedged about by social inferiors nevertheless does his best to be not unkindly and sally seeing it debated in her mind for an instant the advisability of throwing an orange at her brother there was one lying ready to her hand and his glistening shirtfront offered an admirable mark but she restrained herself after all if a hostess yields to her primitive impulses what happens chaos she had just frowned down the exuberance of the rebellious murphys and she felt that if even with the highest motives she began throwing fruit her influence for good in that quarter would be weakened  she leaned back with a sigh the temptation had been hard to resist a democratic girl pomposity was a quality which she thoroughly disliked and though she loved him she could not disguise from herself that ever since affluence had descended upon him some months ago her brother fillmore had become insufferably pompous if there are any young men whom inherited wealth improves fillmore nicholas was not one of them he seemed to regard himself nowadays as a sort of man of destiny to converse with him was for the ordinary human being like being received in audience by some more than standoffish monarch it had taken sally over an hour to persuade him to leave his apartment on riverside drive and revisit the boardinghouse for this special occasion and when he had come he had entered wearing such faultless evening dress that he had made the rest of the party look like a gathering of trampcyclists his white waistcoat alone was a silent reproach to honest poverty and had caused an awkward constraint right through the soup and fish courses most of those present had known fillmore nicholas as an impecunious young man who could make a tweed suit last longer than one would have believed possible they had called him fill and helped him in more than usually lean times with small loans but tonight they had eyed the waistcoat dumbly and shrank back abashed  speaking said mr faucitt as an englishmanfor though i have long since taken out what are technically known as my papers it was as a subject of the island kingdom that i first visited this great countryi may say that the two factors in american life which have always made the profoundest impression upon me have been the lavishness of american hospitality and the charm of the american girl tonight we have been privileged to witness the american girl in the capacity of hostess and i think i am right in saying in asseverating in committing myself to the statement that his has been a night which none of us present here will ever forget miss nicholas has given us ladies and gentlemen a banquet i repeat a banquet there has been alcoholic refreshment i do not know where it came from i do not ask how it was procured but we have had it miss nicholas  mr faucitt paused to puff at his cigar sallys brother fillmore suppressed a yawn and glanced at his watch sally continued to lean forward raptly she knew how happy it made the old gentleman to deliver a formal speech and though she wished the subject had been different she was prepared to listen indefinitely  miss nicholas resumed mr faucitt lowering his cigar  but why he demanded abruptly do i call her miss nicholas  because its her name hazarded the taller murphy  mr faucitt eyed him with disfavour he disapproved of the marvellous brethren on general grounds because himself a resident of years standing he considered that these transients from the vaudeville stage lowered the tone of the boardinghouse but particularly because the one who had just spoken had on his first evening in the place addressed him as grandpa  yes sir he said severely it is her name but she has another name sweeter to those who love her those who worship her those who have watched her with the eye of sedulous affection through the three years she has spent beneath this roof though that name said mr faucitt lowering the tone of his address and descending to what might almost be termed personalities may not be familiar to a couple of dud acrobats who have only been in the place a weekend thank heaven and are off tomorrow to infest some other city that name said mr faucitt soaring once more to a loftier plane is sally our sally for three years our sally has flitted about this establishment likei choose the simile advisedlylike a ray of sunshine for three years she has made life for us a brighter sweeter thing and now a sudden access of worldly wealth happily synchronizing with her twentyfirst birthday is to remove her from our midst from our midst ladies and gentlemen but not from our hearts and i think i may venture to hope to prognosticate that whatever lofty sphere she may adorn in the future to whatever heights in the social world she may soar she will still continue to hold a corner in her own golden heart for the comrades of her bohemian days ladies and gentlemen i give you our hostess miss sally nicholas coupled with the name of our old friend her brother fillmore  sally watching her brother heave himself to his feet as the cheers died away felt her heart beat a little faster with anticipation fillmore was a fluent young man once a power in his college debating society and it was for that reason that she had insisted on his coming here tonight  she had guessed that mr faucitt the old dear would say all sorts of delightful things about her and she had mistrusted her ability to make a fitting reply and it was imperative that a fitting reply should proceed from someone she knew mr faucitt so well he looked on these occasions rather in the light of scenes from some play and sustaining his own part in them with such polished grace was certain to be pained by anything in the nature of an anticlimax after he should have ceased to take the stage eloquent himself he must be answered with eloquence or his whole evening would be spoiled  fillmore nicholas smoothed a wrinkle out of his white waistcoat and having rested one podgy hand on the tablecloth and the thumb of the other in his pocket glanced down the table with eyes so haughtily drooping that sallys fingers closed automatically about her orange as she wondered whether even now it might not be a good thing  it seems to be one of natures laws that the most attractive girls should have the least attractive brothers fillmore nicholas had not worn well at the age of seven he had been an extraordinarily beautiful child but after that he had gone all to pieces and now at the age of twentyfive it would be idle to deny that he was something of a mess for the three years preceding his twentyfifth birthday restricted means and hard work had kept his figure in check but with money there had come an everincreasing sleekness he looked as if he fed too often and too well  all this however sally was prepared to forgive him if he would only make a good speech she could see mr faucitt leaning back in his chair all courteous attention rolling periods were meat and drink to the old gentleman  fillmore spoke  im sure said fillmore you dont want a speech very good of you to drink our health thank you  he sat down  the effect of these few simple words on the company was marked but not in every case identical to the majority the emotion which they brought was one of unmixed relief there had been something so menacing so easy and practised in fillmores attitude as he had stood there that the gloomierminded had given him at least twenty minutes and even the optimists had reckoned that they would be lucky if they got off with ten as far as the bulk of the guests were concerned there was no grumbling fillmores to their thinking had been the ideal afterdinner speech  far different was it with mr maxwell faucitt the poor old man was wearing such an expression of surprise and dismay as he might have worn had somebody unexpectedly pulled the chair from under him he was feeling the sick shock which comes to those who tread on a nonexistent last stair and sally catching sight of his face uttered a sharp wordless exclamation as if she had seen a child fall down and hurt itself in the street the next moment she had run round the table and was standing behind him with her arms round his neck she spoke across him with a sob in her voice  my brother she stammered directing a malevolent look at the immaculate fillmore who avoiding her gaze glanced down his nose and smoothed another wrinkle out of his waistcoat has not said quitequite all i hoped he was going to say i cant make a speech but sally gulped  but i love you all and of course i shall never forget you and and  here sally kissed mr faucitt and burst into tears  there there said mr faucitt soothingly the kindest critic could not have claimed that sally had been eloquent nevertheless mr maxwell faucitt was conscious of no sense of anticlimax    2    sally had just finished telling her brother fillmore what a pig he was the lecture had taken place in the street outside the boardinghouse immediately on the conclusion of the festivities when fillmore who had furtively collected his hat and overcoat had stolen forth into the night had been overtaken and brought to bay by his justly indignant sister her remarks punctuated at intervals by bleating sounds from the accused had lasted some ten minutes  as she paused for breath fillmore seemed to expand like an indiarubber ball which has been sat on dignified as he was to the world he had never been able to prevent himself being intimidated by sally when in one of these moods of hers he regretted this for it hurt his selfesteem but he did not see how the fact could be altered sally had always been like that even the uncle who after the deaths of their parents had become their guardian had never though a grim man been able to cope successfully with sally in that last hectic scene three years ago which had ended in their going out into the world together like a second adam and eve the verbal victory had been hers and it had been sally who had achieved triumph in the one battle which mrs meecher apparently as a matter of duty always brought about with each of her patrons in the first week of their stay a sweettempered girl sally like most women of a generous spirit had cyclonic potentialities  as she seemed to have said her say fillmore kept on expanding till he had reached the normal when he ventured upon a speech for the defence  what have i done demanded fillmore plaintively  do you want to hear all over again  no no said fillmore hastily but listen sally you dont understand my position you dont seem to realize that all that sort of thing all that boardinghouse stuff is a thing of the past ones got beyond it one wants to drop it one wants to forget it darn it be fair look at it from my viewpoint im going to be a big man  youre going to be a fat man said sally coldly  fillmore refrained from discussing the point he was sensitive  im going to do big things he substituted ive got a deal on at this very moment which well i cant tell you about it but its going to be big well what im driving at is about all this sort of thinghe indicated the lighted front of mrs meechers homefromhome with a wide gestureis that its over finished and done with these people were all very well when   when youd lost your weeks salary at poker and wanted to borrow a few dollars for the rent  i always paid them back protested fillmore defensively  i did  well we did said fillmore accepting the amendment with the air of a man who has no time for chopping straws anyway what i mean is i dont see why just because one has known people at a certain period in ones life when one was practically down and out one should have them round ones neck for ever one cant prevent people forming an iknewhimwhen club but darn it one neednt attend the meetings  ones friends  oh friends said fillmore thats just where all this makes me so tired ones in a position where all these people are entitled to call themselves ones friends simply because father put it in his will that i wasnt to get the money till i was twentyfive instead of letting me have it at twentyone like anybody else i wonder where i should have been by now if i could have got that money when i was twentyone  in the poorhouse probably said sally  fillmore was wounded  ah you dont believe in me he sighed  oh you would be all right if you had one thing said sally  fillmore passed his qualities in swift review before his mental eye brains dash spaciousness initiative all present and correct he wondered where sally imagined the hiatus to exist  one thing he said whats that  a nurse  fillmores sense of injury deepened he supposed that this was always the way that those nearest to a man never believed in his ability till he had proved it so masterfully that it no longer required the assistance of faith still it was trying and there was not much consolation to be derived from the thought that napoleon had had to go through this sort of thing in his day i shall find my place in the world he said sulkily  oh youll find your place all right said sally and ill come round and bring you jelly and read to you on the days when visitors are allowed oh hullo  the last remark was addressed to a young man who had been swinging briskly along the sidewalk from the direction of broadway and who now coming abreast of them stopped  good evening mr foster  good evening miss nicholas  you dont know my brother do you  i dont believe i do  he left the underworld before you came to it said sally you wouldnt think it to look at him but he was once a pruneeater among the proletariat even as you and i mrs meecher looks on him as a son  the two men shook hands fillmore was not short but gerald foster with his lean wellbuilt figure seemed to tower over him he was an englishman a man in the middle twenties cleanshaven keeneyed and very good to look at fillmore who had recently been going in for one of those sumupyourfellowmanataglance courses the better to fit himself for his career of greatness was rather impressed it seemed to him that this mr foster like himself was one of those who get there if you are that kind yourself you get into the knack of recognizing the others it is a sort of gift  there was a few moments of desultory conversation of the kind that usually follows an introduction and then fillmore by no means sorry to get the chance took advantage of the coming of this new arrival to remove himself he had not enjoyed his chat with sally and it seemed probable that he would enjoy a continuation of it even less he was glad that mr foster had happened along at this particular juncture excusing himself briefly he hurried off down the street  sally stood for a minute watching him till he had disappeared round the corner she had a slightly regretful feeling that now it was too late she would think of a whole lot more good things which it would have been agreeable to say to him and it had become obvious to her that fillmore was not getting nearly enough of that kind of thing said to him nowadays then she dismissed him from her mind and turning to gerald foster slipped her arm through his  well jerry darling she said what a shame you couldnt come to the party tell me all about everything    3    it was exactly two months since sally had become engaged to gerald foster but so rigorously had they kept the secret that nobody at mrs meechers so much as suspected it to sally who all her life had hated concealing things secrecy of any kind was objectionable but in this matter gerald had shown an odd streak almost of furtiveness in his character an announced engagement complicated life people fussed about you and bothered you people either watched you or avoided you such were his arguments and sally who would have glossed over and found excuses for a disposition on his part towards homicide or arson put them down to artistic sensitiveness there is nobody so sensitive as your artist particularly if he be unsuccessful and when an artist has so little success that he cannot afford to make a home for the woman he loves his sensitiveness presumably becomes great indeed putting herself in his place sally could see that a protracted engagement known by everybody would be a standing advertisement of geralds failure to make good and she acquiesced in the policy of secrecy hoping that it would not last long it seemed absurd to think of gerald as an unsuccessful man he had in him as the recent fillmore had perceived something dynamic he was one of those men of whom one could predict that they would succeed very suddenly and rapidlyovernight as it were  the party said sally went off splendidly they had passed the boardinghouse door and were walking slowly down the street everybody enjoyed themselves i think even though fillmore did his best to spoil things by coming looking like an advertisement of what the smart men will wear this season you didnt see his waistcoat just now he had covered it up conscience i suppose it was white and bulgy and gleaming and full up of pearl buttons and everything i saw augustus bartlett curl up like a burnt feather when he caught sight of it still time seemed to heal the wound and everybody relaxed after a bit mr faucitt made a speech and i made a speech and cried andoh it was all very festive it only needed you  i wish i could have come i had to go to that dinner though sally gerald paused and sally saw that he was electric with suppressed excitement sally the plays going to be put on  sally gave a little gasp she had lived this moment in anticipation for weeks she had always known that sooner or later this would happen she had read his plays over and over again and was convinced that they were wonderful of course hers was a biased view but then elsa doland also admired them and elsas opinion was one that carried weight elsa was another of those people who were bound to succeed suddenly even old mr faucitt who was a stern judge of acting and rather inclined to consider that nowadays there was no such thing believed that she was a girl with a future who would do something big directly she got her chance  jerry she gave his arm a hug how simply terrific then goble and kohn have changed their minds after all and want it i knew they would  a slight cloud seemed to dim the sunniness of the authors mood  no not that one he said reluctantly no hope there im afraid i saw goble this morning about that and he said it didnt add up right the one thats going to be put on is the primrose way you remember its got a big part for a girl in it  of course the one elsa liked so much well thats just as good whos going to do it i thought you hadnt sent it out again  well it happens gerald hesitated once more it seems that this man i was dining with tonighta man named cracknell  cracknell not the cracknell  the cracknell  the one people are always talking about the man they call the millionaire kid  yes why do you know him  he was at harvard with fillmore i never saw him but he must be rather a painful person  oh hes all right not much brains of course butwell hes all right and anyway he wants to put the play on  well thats splendid said sally but she could not get the right ring of enthusiasm into her voice she had had ideals for gerald she had dreamed of him invading broadway triumphantly under the banner of one of the big managers whose name carried a prestige and there seemed something unworthy in this association with a man whose chief claim to eminence lay in the fact that he was credited by metropolitan gossip with possessing the largest private stock of alcohol in existence  i thought you would be pleased said gerald  oh i am said sally  with the buoyant optimism which never deserted her for long she had already begun to cast off her momentary depression after all did it matter who financed a play so long as it obtained a production a manager was simply a piece of machinery for paying the bills and if he had money for that purpose why demand asceticism and the finer sensibilities from him the real thing that mattered was the question of who was going to play the leading part that deftly drawn character which had so excited the admiration of elsa doland she sought information on this point  who will play ruth she asked you must have somebody wonderful it needs a tremendously clever woman did mr cracknell say anything about that  oh yes we discussed that of course  well  well it seems again sally noticed that odd almost stealthy embarrassment gerald appeared unable to begin a sentence tonight without feeling his way into it like a man creeping cautiously down a dark alley she noticed it the more because it was so different from his usual direct method gerald as a rule was not one of those who apologize for themselves he was forthright and masterful and inclined to talk to her from a height tonight he seemed different  he broke off was silent for a moment and began again with a question  do you know mabel hobson  mabel hobson ive seen her in the follies of course  sally started a suspicion had stung her so monstrous that its absurdity became manifest the moment it had formed and yet was it absurd most broadway gossip filtered eventually into the boardinghouse chiefly through the medium of that seasoned sport the mild young man who thought so highly of the redoubtable benny whistler and she was aware that the name of reginald cracknell which was always getting itself linked with somebody had been coupled with that of miss hobson it seemed likely that in this instance rumour spoke truth for the lady was of that compellingly blonde beauty which attracts the cracknells of this world but even so  it seems that cracknell said gerald apparently this man cracknell he was finding sallys bright horrified gaze somewhat trying well the fact is cracknell believes in mabel hobsonand well he thinks this part would suit her  oh jerry  could infatuation go to such a length could even the spacious heart of a reginald cracknell so dominate that gentlemans small size in heads as to make him entrust a part like ruth in the primrose way to one who when desired by the producer of her last revue to carry a bowl of roses across the stage and place it on a table had rebelled on the plea that she had not been engaged as a dancer surely even lovelorn reginald could perceive that this was not the stuff of which great emotional actresses are made  oh jerry she said again  there was an uncomfortable silence they turned and walked back in the direction of the boardinghouse somehow geralds arm had managed to get itself detached from sallys she was conscious of a curious dull ache that was almost like a physical pain  jerry is it worth it she burst out vehemently  the question seemed to sting the young man into something like his usual decisive speech  worth it of course its worth it its a broadway production thats all that matters good heavens ive been trying long enough to get a play on broadway and it isnt likely that im going to chuck away my chance when it comes along just because one might do better in the way of casting  but jerry mabel hobson its its murder murder in the first degree  nonsense shell be all right the part will play itself besides she has a personality and a following and cracknell will spend all the money in the world to make the thing a success and it will be a start whatever happens of course its worth it  fillmore would have been impressed by this speech he would have recognized and respected in it the unmistakable ring which characterizes even the lightest utterances of those who get there on sally it had not immediately that effect nevertheless her habit of making the best of things working together with that primary article of her creed that the man she loved could do no wrong succeeded finally in raising her spirits of course jerry was right it would have been foolish to refuse a contract because all its clauses were not ideal  you old darling she said affectionately attaching herself to the vacant arm once more and giving it a penitent squeeze youre quite right of course you are i can see it now i was only a little startled at first everythings going to be wonderful lets get all our chickens out and count em how are you going to spend the money  i know how im going to spend a dollar of it said gerald completely restored  i mean the big money whats a dollar  it pays for a marriagelicence  sally gave his arm another squeeze  ladies and gentlemen she said look at this man observe him my partner     chapter ii enter ginger    1    sally was sitting with her back against a hillock of golden sand watching with halfclosed eyes the denizens of rovillesurmer at their familiar morning occupations at roville as at most french seashore resorts the morning is the time when the visiting population assembles in force on the beach whiskered fathers of families made cheerful patches of colour in the foreground their female friends and relatives clustered in groups under gay parasols dogs roamed to and fro and children dug industriously with spades ever and anon suspending their labours in order to smite one another with these handy implements one of the dogs a poodle of military aspect wandered up to sally and discovering that she was in possession of a box of sweets decided to remain and await developments  few things are so pleasant as the anticipation of them but sallys vacation had proved an exception to this rule it had been a magic month of lazy happiness she had drifted luxuriously from one french town to another till the charm of roville with its blue sky its casino its snowwhite hotels along the promenade and its general glitter and gaiety had brought her to a halt here she could have stayed indefinitely but the voice of america was calling her back gerald had written to say that the primrose way was to be produced in detroit preliminary to its new york run so soon that if she wished to see the opening she must return at once a scrappy hurried unsatisfactory letter the letter of a busy man but one that sally could not ignore she was leaving roville tomorrow  today however was today and she sat and watched the bathers with a familiar feeling of peace revelling as usual in the still novel sensation of having nothing to do but bask in the warm sunshine and listen to the faint murmur of the little waves  but if there was one drawback she had discovered to a morning on the roville plage it was that you had a tendency to fall asleep and this is a degrading thing to do so soon after breakfast even if you are on a holiday usually sally fought stoutly against the temptation but today the sun was so warm and the whisper of the waves so insinuating that she had almost dozed off when she was aroused by voices close at hand there were many voices on the beach both near and distant but these were talking english a novelty in roville and the sound of the familiar tongue jerked sally back from the borders of sleep a few feet away two men had seated themselves on the sand  from the first moment she had set out on her travels it had been one of sallys principal amusements to examine the strangers whom chance threw in her way and to try by the light of her intuition to fit them out with characters and occupations nor had she been discouraged by an almost consistent failure to guess right out of the corner of her eye she inspected these two men  the first of the pair did not attract her he was a tall dark man whose tight precise mouth and rather high cheeks bones gave him an appearance vaguely sinister he had the dusky look of the cleanshaven man whose life is a perpetual struggle with a determined beard he certainly shaved twice a day and just as certainly had the selfcontrol not to swear when he cut himself she could picture him smiling nastily when this happened  hard diagnosed sally i shouldnt like him a lawyer or something i think  she turned to the other and found herself looking into his eyes this was because he had been staring at sally with the utmost intentness ever since his arrival his mouth had opened slightly he had the air of a man who after many disappointments has at last found something worth looking at  rather a dear decided sally  he was a sturdy thickset young man with an amiable freckled face and the reddest hair sally had ever seen he had a square chin and at one angle of the chin a slight cut and sally was convinced that however he had behaved on receipt of that wound it had not been with superior selfcontrol  a temper i should think she meditated very quick but soon over not very clever i should say but nice  she looked away finding his fascinated gaze a little embarrassing  the dark man who in the objectionably competent fashion which one felt characterized all his actions had just succeeded in lighting a cigarette in the teeth of a strong breeze threw away the match and resumed the conversation which had presumably been interrupted by the process of sitting down  and how is scrymgeour he inquired  oh all right replied the young man with red hair absently sally was looking straight in front of her but she felt that his eyes were still busy  i was surprised at his being here he told me he meant to stay in paris  there was a slight pause sally gave the attentive poodle a piece of nougat  i say observed the redhaired young man in clear penetrating tones that vibrated with intense feeling thats the prettiest girl ive seen in my life    2    at this frank revelation of the redhaired young mans personal opinions sally though considerably startled was not displeased a broadminded girl the outburst seemed to her a legitimate comment on a matter of public interest the young mans companion on the other hand was unmixedly shocked  my dear fellow he ejaculated  oh its all right said the redhaired young man unmoved she cant understand there isnt a bally soul in this dashed place that can speak a word of english if i didnt happen to remember a few odd bits of french i should have starved by this time that girl he went on returning to the subject most imperatively occupying his mind is an absolute topper i give you my solemn word ive never seen anybody to touch her look at those hands and feet you dont get them outside france of course her mouth is a bit wide he said reluctantly  sallys immobility added to the others assurance concerning the linguistic deficiencies of the inhabitants of roville seemed to reassure the dark man he breathed again at no period of his life had he ever behaved with anything but the most scrupulous correctness himself but he had quailed at the idea of being associated even remotely with incorrectness in another it had been a black moment for him when the redhaired young man had uttered those few kind words  still you ought to be careful he said austerely  he looked at sally who was now dividing her attention between the poodle and a raffishlooking mongrel who had joined the party and returned to the topic of the mysterious scrymgeour  how is scrymgeours dyspepsia  the redhaired young man seemed but faintly interested in the vicissitudes of scrymgeours interior  do you notice the way her hair sort of curls over her ears he said eh oh pretty much the same i think  what hotel are you staying at  the normandie  sally dipping into the box for another chocolate cream gave an imperceptible start she too was staying at the normandie she presumed that her admirer was a recent arrival for she had seen nothing of him at the hotel  the normandie the dark man looked puzzled i know roville pretty well by report but ive never heard of any hotel normandie where is it  its a little shanty down near the station not much of a place still its cheap and the cookings all right  his companions bewilderment increased  what on earth is a man like scrymgeour doing there he said sally was conscious of an urgent desire to know more and more about the absent scrymgeour constant repetition of his name had made him seem almost like an old friend if theres one thing hes fussy about  there are at least eleven thousand things hes fussy about interrupted the redhaired young man disapprovingly jumpy old blighter  if theres one thing hes particular about its the sort of hotel he goes to ever since ive known him he has always wanted the best i should have thought he would have gone to the splendide he mused on this problem in a dissatisfied sort of way for a moment then seemed to reconcile himself to the fact that a rich mans eccentricities must be humoured id like to see him again ask him if he will dine with me at the splendide tonight say eight sharp  sally occupied with her dogs whose numbers had now been augmented by a white terrier with a black patch over its left eye could not see the young mans face but his voice when he replied told her that something was wrong there was a false airiness in it  oh scrymgeour isnt in roville  no where is he  paris i believe  what the dark mans voice sharpened he sounded as though he were crossexamining a reluctant witness then why arent you there what are you doing here did he give you a holiday  yes he did  when do you rejoin him  i dont  what  the redhaired young mans manner was not unmistakably dogged  well if you want to know he said the old blighter fired me the day before yesterday    3    there was a shuffling of sand as the dark man sprang up sally intent on the drama which was unfolding itself beside her absentmindedly gave the poodle a piece of nougat which should by rights have gone to the terrier she shot a swift glance sideways and saw the dark man standing in an attitude rather reminiscent of the stern father of melodrama about to drive his erring daughter out into the snow the redhaired young man outwardly stolid was gazing before him down the beach at a fat bather in an orange suit who after six false starts was now actually in the water floating with the dignity of a wrecked balloon  do you mean to tell me demanded the dark man that after all the trouble the family took to get you what was practically a sinecure with endless possibilities if you only behaved yourself you have deliberately thrown away a despairing gesture completed the sentence good god youre hopeless  the redhaired young man made no reply he continued to gaze down the beach of all outdoor sports few are more stimulating than watching middleaged frenchmen bathe drama action suspense all are here from the first stealthy testing of the water with an apprehensive toe to the final seallike plunge there is never a dull moment and apart from the excitement of the thing judging it from a purely aesthetic standpoint his must be a dull soul who can fail to be uplifted by the spectacle of a series of very stout men with whiskers seen in tight bathing suits against a background of brightest blue yet the young man with red hair recently in the employment of mr scrymgeour eyed this free circus without any enjoyment whatever  its maddening what are you going to do what do you expect us to do are we to spend our whole lives getting you positions which you wont keep i can tell you were its monstrous its sickening good god  and with these words the dark man apparently feeling as sally had sometimes felt in the society of her brother fillmore the futility of mere language turned sharply and stalked away up the beach the dignity of his exit somewhat marred a moment later by the fact of his straw hat blowing off and being trodden on by a passing child  he left behind him the sort of electric calm which follows the falling of a thunderbolt that stunned calm through which the air seems still to quiver protestingly how long this would have lasted one cannot say for towards the end of the first minute it was shattered by a purely terrestrial uproar with an abruptness heralded only by one short low gurgling snarl there sprang into being the prettiest dog fight that roville had seen that season  it was the terrier with the black patch who began it that was sallys opinion and such one feels will be the verdict of history his best friend anxious to make out a case for him could not have denied that he fired the first gun of the campaign but we must be just the fault was really sallys absorbed in the scene which had just concluded and acutely inquisitive as to why the shadowy scrymgeour had seen fit to dispense with the redhaired young mans services she had thrice in succession helped the poodle out of his turn the third occasion was too much for the terrier  there is about any dog fight a wild gusty fury which affects the average mortal with something of the helplessness induced by some vast clashing of the elements it seems so outside ones jurisdiction one is oppressed with a sense of the futility of interference and this was no ordinary dog fight it was a stunning mêlée which would have excited favourable comment even among the blasé residents of a negro quarter or the not easilypleased critics of a lancashire miningvillage from all over the beach dogs of every size breed and colour were racing to the scene and while some of these merely remained in the ringside seats and barked a considerable proportion immediately started fighting one another on general principles well content to be in action without bothering about first causes the terrier had got the poodle by the left hindleg and was restating his waraims the raffish mongrel was apparently endeavouring to fletcherize a complete stranger of the sealyham family  sally was frankly unequal to the situation as were the entire crowd of spectators who had come galloping up from the waters edge she had been paralysed from the start snarling bundles bumped against her legs and bounced away again but she made no move advice in fluent french rent the air arms waved and wellfilled bathing suits leaped up and down but nobody did anything practical until in the centre of the theatre of war there suddenly appeared the redhaired young man  the only reason why dog fights do not go on for ever is that providence has decided that on each such occasion there shall always be among those present one master mind one wizard who whatever his shortcomings in other battles of life is in this single particular sphere competent and dominating at rovillesurmer it was the redhaired young man his dark companion might have turned from him in disgust his services might not have seemed worth retaining by the haughty scrymgeour he might be a pain in the neck to the family but he did know how to stop a dog fight from the first moment of his intervention calm began to steal over the scene he had the same effect on the almost inextricably entwined belligerents as in mediaeval legend the holy grail sliding down the sunbeam used to have on battling knights he did not look like a dove of peace but the most captious could not have denied that he brought home the goods there was a magic in his soothing hands a spell in his voice and in a shorter time than one would have believed possible dog after dog had been sorted out and calmed down until presently all that was left of armageddon was one solitary small scotch terrier thoughtfully licking a chewed leg the rest of the combatants once more in their right mind and wondering what all the fuss was about had been captured and haled away in a whirl of recrimination by voluble owners  having achieved this miracle the young man turned to sally gallant one might say reckless as he had been a moment before he now gave indications of a rather pleasing shyness he braced himself with that painful air of effort which announces to the world that an englishman is about to speak a language other than his own  jespère he said having swallowed once or twice to brace himself up for the journey through the jungle of a foreign tongue jespère que vous nêtes pasoh dammit whats the wordjespère que vous nêtes pas blessée  blessée  yes blessée wounded hurt dont you know bitten oh dash it jespère  oh bitten said sally dimpling oh no thanks very much i wasnt bitten and i think it was awfully brave of you to save all our lives  the compliment seemed to pass over the young mans head he stared at sally with horrified eyes over his amiable face there swept a vivid blush his jaw dropped  oh my sainted aunt he ejaculated  then as if the situation was too much for him and flights the only possible solution he spun round and disappeared at a walk so rapid that it was almost a run sally watched him go and was sorry that he had torn himself away she still wanted to know why scrymgeour had fired him    4    bedtime at roville is an hour that seems to vary according to ones proximity to the sea the gilded palaces along the front keep deplorable hours polluting the night air till dawn with indefatigable jazz but at the pensions of the economical like the normandie early to bed is the rule true jules the stout young native who combined the offices of nightclerk and lift attendant at that establishment was on duty in the hall throughout the night but few of the normandies patrons made use of his services  sally entering shortly before twelve oclock on the night of the day on which the dark man the redhaired young man and their friend scrymgeour had come into her life found the little hall dim and silent through the iron cage of the lift a single faint bulb glowed another over the desk in the far corner illuminated the upper half of jules slumbering in a chair jules seemed to sally to be on duty in some capacity or other all the time his work like womens was never done he was now restoring his tissues with a few winks of muchneeded beauty sleep sally who had been to the casino to hear the band and afterwards had strolled on the moonlit promenade had a guilty sense of intrusion  as she stood there reluctant to break in on jules restfor her sympathetic heart always at the disposal of the oppressed had long ached for this overworked peonshe was relieved to hear footsteps in the street outside followed by the opening of the front door if jules would have had to wake up anyway she felt her sense of responsibility lessened the door having opened closed again with a bang jules stirred gurgled blinked and sat up and sally turning perceived that the new arrival was the redhaired young man  oh good evening said sally welcomingly  the young man stopped and shuffled uncomfortably the mornings happenings were obviously still green in his memory he had either not ceased blushing since their last meeting or he was celebrating their reunion by beginning to blush again for his face was a familiar scarlet  ergood evening he said disentangling his feet which in the embarrassment of the moment had somehow got coiled up together  or bon soir i suppose you would say murmured sally  the young man acknowledged receipt of this thrust by dropping his hat and tripping over it as he stooped to pick it up  jules meanwhile who had been navigating in a sort of somnambulistic trance in the neighbourhood of the lift now threw back the cage with a rattle  its a shame to have woken you up said sally commiseratingly stepping in  jules did not reply for the excellent reason that he had not been woken up constant practice enabled him to do this sort of work without breaking his slumber his brain if you could call it that was working automatically he had shut up the gate with a clang and was tugging sluggishly at the correct rope so that the lift was going slowly up instead of retiring down into the basement but he was not awake  sally and the redhaired young man sat side by side on the small seat watching their conductors efforts after the first spurt conversation had languished sally had nothing of immediate interest to say and her companion seemed to be one of these strong silent men you read about only a slight snore from jules broke the silence  at the third floor sally leaned forward and prodded jules in the lower ribs all through her stay at roville she had found in dealing with the native population that actions spoke louder than words if she wanted anything in a restaurant or at a shop she pointed and when she wished the lift to stop she prodded the man in charge it was a system worth a dozen french conversation books  jules brought the machine to a halt and it was at this point that he should have done the one thing connected with his professional activities which he did really wellthe opening to wit of the iron cage there are ways of doing this jules was the right way he was accustomed to do it with a flourish and generally remarked vla in a modest but selfcongratulatory voice as though he would have liked to see another man who could have put through a job like that jules opinion was that he might not be much to look at but that he could open a lift door  tonight however it seemed as if even this not very exacting feat was beyond his powers instead of inserting his key in the lock he stood staring in an attitude of frozen horror he was a man who took most things in life pretty seriously and whatever was the little difficulty just now seemed to have broken him all up  there appears said sally turning to her companion to be a hitch would you mind asking whats the matter i dont know any french myself except oo la la  the young man thus appealed to nerved himself to the task he eyed the melancholy jules doubtfully and coughed in a strangled sort of way  oh esker esker vous  dont weaken said sally i think youve got him going  esker vous pourquoi vous ne i mean ne vous that is to say quel est le raison  he broke off here because at this point jules began to explain he explained very rapidly and at considerable length the fact that neither of his hearers understood a word of what he was saying appeared not to have impressed itself upon him or if he gave a thought to it he dismissed the objection as trifling he wanted to explain and he explained words rushed from him like water from a geyser sounds which you felt you would have been able to put a meaning to if he had detached them from the main body and repeated them slowly went swirling down the stream and were lost for ever  stop him said sally firmly  the redhaired young man looked as a native of johnstown might have looked on being requested to stop that citys celebrated flood  stop him  yes blow a whistle or something  out of the depths of the young mans memory there swam to the surface a single worda word which he must have heard somewhere or read somewhere a legacy perhaps from longvanished schooldays  zut he barked and instantaneously jules turned himself off at the main there was a moment of dazed silence such as might occur in a boilerfactory if the works suddenly shut down  quick now youve got him cried sally ask him what hes talking aboutif he knows which i doubtand tell him to speak slowly then we shall get somewhere  the young man nodded intelligently the advice was good  lentement he said parlez lentement pas siyou know what i meanpas si dashed vite  ahaah cried jules catching the idea on the fly lentement ah oui lentement  there followed a lengthy conversation which while conveying nothing to sally seemed intelligible to the redhaired linguist  the silly ass he was able to announce some few minutes later has made a bloomer apparently he was half asleep when we came in and he shoved us into the lift and slammed the door forgetting that he had left the keys on the desk  i see said sally so were shut in  im afraid so i wish to goodness said the young man i knew french well id curse him with some vim and not a little animation the chump i wonder what blighter is in french he said meditating  its the merest suggestion said sally but oughtnt we to do something  what could we do  well for one thing we might all utter a loud yell it would scare most of the people in the hotel to death but there might be a survivor or two who would come and investigate and let us out  what a ripping idea said the young man impressed  im glad you like it now tell him the main outline or hell think weve gone mad  the young man searched for words and eventually found some which expressed his meaning lamely but well enough to cause jules to nod in a depressed sort of way  fine said sally now all together at the word three onetwooh poor darling she broke off look at him  in the far corner of the lift the emotional jules was sobbing silently into the bunch of cottonwaste which served him in the office of a pockethandkerchief his brokenhearted gulps echoed hollowly down the shaft    5    in these days of cheap books of instruction on every subject under the sun we most of us know how to behave in the majority of lifes little crises we have only ourselves to blame if we are ignorant of what to do before the doctor comes of how to make a dainty winter coat for baby out of fathers last years undervest and of the best method of coping with the cold mutton but nobody yet has come forward with practical advice as to the correct method of behaviour to be adopted when a liftattendant starts crying and sally and her companion as a consequence for a few moments merely stared at each other helplessly  poor darling said sally finding speech ask him whats the matter  the young man looked at her doubtfully  you know he said i dont enjoy chatting with this blighter i mean to say its a bit of an effort i dont know why it is but talking french always makes me feel as if my nose were coming off couldnt we just leave him to have his cry out by himself  the idea said sally have you no heart are you one of those fiends in human shape  he turned reluctantly to jules and paused to overhaul his vocabulary  you ought to be thankful for this chance said sally its the only real way of learning french and youre getting a lesson for nothing what did he say then  something about losing something it seemed to me i thought i caught the word perdu  but that means a partridge doesnt it im sure ive seen it on the menus  would he talk about partridges at a time like this  he might the french are extraordinary people  well ill have another go at him but hes a difficult chap to chat with if you give him the least encouragement he sort of goes off like a rocket he addressed another question to the sufferer and listened attentively to the voluble reply  oh he said with sudden enlightenment your job he turned to sally i got it that time he said the trouble is he says that if we yell and rouse the house well get out all right but he will lose his job because this is the second time this sort of thing has happened and they warned him last time that once more would mean the push  then we mustnt dream of yelling said sally decidedly it means a pretty long wait you know as far as i can gather theres just a chance of somebody else coming in later in which case he could let us out but its doubtful he rather thinks that everybody has gone to roost  well we must try it i wouldnt think of losing the poor man his job tell him to take the car down to the groundfloor and then well just sit and amuse ourselves till something happens weve lots to talk about we can tell each other the story of our lives  jules cheered by his victims kindly forbearance lowered the car to the ground floor where after a glance of infinite longing at the keys on the distant desk the sort of glance which moses must have cast at the promised land from the summit of mount pisgah he sagged down in a heap and resumed his slumbers sally settled herself as comfortably as possible in her corner  youd better smoke she said it will be something to do  thanks awfully  and now said sally tell me why scrymgeour fired you  little by little under the stimulating influence of this nocturnal adventure the redhaired young man had lost that shy confusion which had rendered him so ill at ease when he had encountered sally in the hall of the hotel but at this question embarrassment gripped him once more another of those comprehensive blushes of his raced over his face and he stammered  i say im glad im fearfully sorry about that you know  about scrymgeour  you know what i mean i mean about making such a most ghastly ass of myself this morning i i never dreamed you understood english  why i didnt object i thought you were very nice and complimentary of course i dont know how many girls youve seen in your life but  no i say dont it makes me feel such a chump  and im sorry about my mouth it is wide but i know youre a fairminded man and realize that it isnt my fault  dont rub it in pleaded the young man as a matter of fact if you want to know i think your mouth is absolutely perfect i think he proceeded a little feverishly that you are the most indescribable topper that ever  you were going to tell me about scrymgeour said sally  the young man blinked as if he had collided with some hard object while sleepwalking eloquence had carried him away  scrymgeour he said oh that would bore you  dont be silly said sally reprovingly cant you realize that were practically castaways on a desert island theres nothing to do till tomorrow but talk about ourselves i want to hear all about you and then ill tell you all about myself if you feel diffident about starting the revelations ill begin better start with names mine is sally nicholas whats yours  mine oh ah yes i see what you mean  i thought you would i put it as clearly as i could well what is it  kemp  and the first name  well as a matter of fact said the young man ive always rather hushed up my first name because when i was christened they worked a lowdown trick on me  you cant shock me said sally encouragingly my fathers name was ezekiel and ive a brother who was christened fillmore  mr kemp brightened well mine isnt as bad as that no i dont mean that he broke off apologetically both awfully jolly names of course  get on said sally  well they called me lancelot and of course the thing is that i dont look like a lancelot and never shall my pals he added in a more cheerful strain call me ginger  i dont blame them said sally  perhaps you wouldnt mind thinking of me as ginger suggested the young man diffidently  certainly  thats awfully good of you  not at all  jules stirred in his sleep and grunted no other sound came to disturb the stillness of the night  you were going to tell me about yourself said mr lancelot ginger kemp  im going to tell you all about myself said sally not because i think it will interest you  oh it will  not i say because i think it will interest you  it will really  sally looked at him coldly  is this a duet she inquired or have i the floor  im awfully sorry  not i repeat for the third time because i think it will interest you but because if i do you wont have any excuse for not telling me your lifehistory and you wouldnt believe how inquisitive i am well in the first place i live in america im over here on a holiday and its the first real holiday ive had in three yearssince i left home in fact sally paused i ran away from home she said  good egg said ginger kemp  i beg your pardon  i mean quite right i bet you were quite right  when i say home sally went on it was only a sort of imitation home you know one of those justasgood homes which are never as satisfactory as the real kind my father and mother both died a good many years ago my brother and i were dumped down on the reluctant doorstep of an uncle  uncles said ginger kemp feelingly are the devil ive got an but im interrupting you  my uncle was our trustee he had control of all my brothers money and mine till i was twentyone my brother was to get his when he was twentyfive my poor father trusted him blindly and what do you think happened  good lord the blighter embezzled the lot  no not a cent wasnt it extraordinary have you ever heard of a blindly trusted uncle who was perfectly honest well mine was but the trouble was that while an excellent man to have looking after ones money he wasnt a very lovable character he was very hard hard he was as hard aswell nearly as hard as this seat he hated poor fill  phil  i broke it to you just now that my brothers name was fillmore  oh your brother oh ah yes  he was always picking on poor fill and im bound to say that fill rather laid himself out as what you might call a pickee he was always getting into trouble one day about three years ago he was expelled from harvard and my uncle vowed he would have nothing more to do with him so i said if fill left i would leave and as this seemed to be my uncles idea of a large evening no objection was raised and fill and i departed we went to new york and there weve been ever since about six months ago fill passed the twentyfive mark and collected his money and last month i marched past the given point and got mine so it all ends happily you see now tell me about yourself  but i say you know dash it youve skipped a lot i mean to say you must have had an awful time in new york didnt you how on earth did you get along  oh we found work my brother tried one or two things and finally became an assistant stagemanager with some theatre people the only thing i could do having been raised in enervating luxury was ballroom dancing so i ballroom danced i got a job at a place in broadway called the flower garden as what is humorously called an instructress as if anybody could instruct the men who came there one was lucky if one saved ones life and wasnt quashed to death  how perfectly foul  oh i dont know it was rather fun for a while still said sally meditatively im not saying i could have held out much longer i was beginning to give i suppose ive been trampled underfoot by more fat men than any other girl of my age in america i dont know why it was but every man who came in who was a bit overweight seemed to make for me by instinct thats why i like to sit on the sands here and watch these frenchmen bathing its just heavenly to lie back and watch a two hundred and fifty pound man coming along and feel that he isnt going to dance with me  but i say how absolutely rotten it must have been for you  well ill tell you one thing its going to make me a very domesticated wife one of these days you wont find me gadding about in gilded jazzpalaces for me a little place in the country somewhere with my knitting and an elsie book and bed at halfpast nine and now tell me the story of your life and make it long because im perfectly certain theres going to be no reliefexpedition im sure the last dweller under this roof came in years ago we shall be here till morning  i really think we had better shout you know  and lose jules his job never  well of course im sorry for poor old jules troubles but i hate to think of you having to  now get on with the story said sally    6    ginger kemp exhibited some of the symptoms of a young bridegroom called upon at a weddingbreakfast to respond to the toast he moved his feet restlessly and twisted his fingers  i hate talking about myself you know he said  so i supposed said sally thats why i gave you my autobiography first to give you no chance of backing out dont be such a shrinking violet were all shipwrecked mariners here i am intensely interested in your narrative and even if i wasnt id much rather listen to it than to jules snoring  he is snoring a bit what does it annoy you shall i stir him  you seem to have an extraordinary brutal streak in your nature said sally you appear to think of nothing else but schemes for harassing poor jules leave him alone for a second and start telling me about yourself  where shall i start  well not with your childhood i think well skip that  well ginger kemp knitted his brow searching for a dramatic opening well im more or less what you might call an orphan like you i mean to say both my people are dead and all that sort of thing  thanks for explaining that has made it quite clear  i cant remember my mother my father died when i was in my last year at cambridge id been having a most awfully good time at the varsity said ginger warming to his theme not thick you know but good id got my rugger and boxing blues and id just been picked for scrumhalf for england against the north in the first trial match and between ourselves it really did look as if i was more or less of a snip for my international  sally gazed at him wide eyed  is that good or bad she asked  eh  are you reciting a catalogue of your crimes or do you expect me to get up and cheer what is a rugger blue to start with  well its its a rugger blue you know  oh i see said sally you mean a rugger blue  i mean to say i played ruggerfooterthats to say footballrugby footballfor cambridge against oxford i was scrumhalf  and what is a scrumhalf asked sally patiently yes i know youre going to say its a scrumhalf but cant you make it easier  the scrumhalf said ginger is the half who works the scrum he slings the pill out to the flyhalf who starts the threequarters going i dont know if you understand  i dont  its dashed hard to explain said ginger kemp unhappily i mean i dont think ive ever met anyone before who didnt know what a scrumhalf was  well i can see that it has something to do with football so well leave it at that i suppose its something like our quarterback and whats an international  its called getting your international when you play for england you know england plays wales france ireland and scotland if it hadnt been for the smash i think i should have played for england against wales  i see at last what youre trying to tell me is that you were very good at football  ginger kemp blushed warmly  oh i dont say that england was pretty short of scrumhalves that year  what a horrible thing to happen to a country still you were likely to be picked on the allengland team when the smash came what was the smash  well it turned out that the poor old pater hadnt left a penny i never understood the process exactly but id always supposed that we were pretty well off and then it turned out that i hadnt anything at all im bound to say it was a bit of a jar i had to come down from cambridge and go to work in my uncles office of course i made an absolute hash of it  why of course  well im not a very clever sort of chap you see i somehow didnt seem able to grasp the workings after about a year my uncle getting a bit fedup hoofed me out and got me a mastership at a school and i made a hash of that he got me one or two other jobs and i made a hash of those  you certainly do seem to be one of our most prominent young hashers gasped sally  i am said ginger modestly  there was a silence  and what about scrymgeour sally asked  that was the last of the jobs said ginger scrymgeour is a pompous old ass who thinks hes going to be prime minister some day hes a big bug at the bar and has just got into parliament my cousin used to devil for him thats how i got mixed up with the blighter  your cousin used i wish you would talk english  that was my cousin who was with me on the beach this morning  and what did you say he used to do for mr scrymgeour  oh its called devilling my cousins at the bar tooone of our rising nibs as a matter of fact  i thought he was a lawyer of some kind  hes got a long way beyond it now but when he started he used to devil for scrymgeourassist him dont you know his names carmyle you know perhaps youve heard of him hes rather a prominent johnny in his way bruce carmyle you know  i havent  well he got me this job of secretary to scrymgeour  and why did mr scrymgeour fire you  ginger kemps face darkened he frowned sally watching him felt that she had been right when she had guessed that he had a temper she liked him none the worse for it mild men did not appeal to her  i dont know if youre fond of dogs said ginger  i used to be before this morning said sally and i suppose i shall be again in time for the moment ive had what you might call rather a surfeit of dogs but arent you straying from the point i asked you why mr scrymgeour dismissed you  im telling you  im glad of that i didnt know  the old brute said ginger frowning again has a dog a very jolly little spaniel great pal of mine and scrymgeour is the sort of fool who oughtnt to be allowed to own a dog hes one of those asses who isnt fit to own a dog as a matter of fact of all the blighted pompous bullying shrivelledsouled old devils  one moment said sally im getting an impression that you dont like mr scrymgeour am i right  yes  i thought so womanly intuition go on  he used to insist on the poor animal doing tricks i hate seeing a dog do tricks dogs loathe it you know theyre frightfully sensitive well scrymgeour used to make this spaniel of his do tricksfoolthings that no selfrespecting dogs would do and eventually poor old billy got fed up and jibbed he was too polite to bite but he sort of shook his head and crawled under a chair youd have thought anyone would have let it go at that but would old scrymgeour not a bit of it of all the poisonous  yes i know go on  well the thing ended in the blighter hauling him out from under the chair and getting more and more shirty until finally he laid into him with a stick that is to say said ginger coldly accurate he started laying into him with a stick he brooded for a moment with knit brows a spaniel mind you can you imagine anyone beating a spaniel its like hitting a little girl well hes a fairly oldish man you know and that hampered me a bit but i got hold of the stick and broke it into about eleven pieces and by great good luck it was a stick he happened to value rather highly it had a gold knob and had been presented to him by his constituents or something i minced it up a goodish bit and then i told him a fair amount about himself and thenwell after that he shot me out and i came here  sally did not speak for a moment  you were quite right she said at last in a sober voice that had nothing in it of her customary flippancy she paused again and what are you going to do now she said  i dont know  youll get something  oh yes i shall get something i suppose the family will be pretty sick of course  for goodness sake why do you bother about the family sally burst out she could not reconcile this young mans flabby dependence on his family with the enterprise and vigour which he had shown in his dealings with the unspeakable scrymgeour of course he had been brought up to look on himself as a rich mans son and appeared to have drifted as such young men are wont to do but even so the whole trouble with you she said embarking on a subject on which she held strong views is that  her harangue was interrupted by whatat the normandie at one oclock in the morningpractically amounted to a miracle the front door of the hotel opened and there entered a young man in evening dress such persons were sufficiently rare at the normandie which catered principally for the staid and middleaged and this youths presence was due if one must pause to explain it to the fact that in the middle of his stay at roville a disastrous evening at the casino had so diminished his funds that he had been obliged to make a hurried shift from the hotel splendide to the humbler normandie his late appearance tonight was caused by the fact that he had been attending a dance at the splendide principally in the hope of finding there some kindhearted friend of his prosperity from whom he might borrow  a rapidfire dialogue having taken place between jules and the newcomer the keys were handed through the cage the door opened and the lift was set once more in motion and a few minutes later sally suddenly aware of an overpowering sleepiness had switched off her light and jumped into bed her last waking thought was a regret that she had not been able to speak at length to mr ginger kemp on the subject of enterprise and resolve that the address should be delivered at the earliest opportunity     chapter iii the dignified mr carmyle    1    by six oclock on the following evening however sally had been forced to the conclusion that ginger would have to struggle through life as best he could without the assistance of her contemplated remarks for she had seen nothing of him all day and in another hour she would have left roville on the sevenfifteen express which was to take her to paris en route for cherbourg and the liner whereon she had booked her passage for new york  it was in the faint hope of finding him even now that at halfpast six having conveyed her baggage to the station and left it in charge of an amiable porter she paid a last visit to the casino municipale she disliked the thought of leaving ginger without having uplifted him like so many alert and activeminded girls she possessed in a great degree the quality of interesting herself inor as her brother fillmore preferred to put it messing about withthe private affairs of others ginger had impressed her as a man to whom it was worth while to give a friendly shove on the right path and it was with much gratification therefore that having entered the casino she perceived a flaming head shining through the crowd which had gathered at one of the roulettetables  there are two casinos at rovillesurmer the one on the promenade goes in mostly for seaair and a mild game called boule it is the big casino municipale down in the palace massena near the railway station which is the haunt of the earnest gambler who means business and it was plain to sally directly she arrived that ginger kemp not only meant business but was getting results ginger was going extremely strong he was entrenched behind an opulentlooking mound of square counters and even as sally looked a woodenfaced croupier shoved a further instalment across the table to him at the end of his long rake  epatant murmured a wistful man at sallys side removing an elbow from her ribs in order the better to gesticulate sally though no french scholar gathered that he was startled and gratified the entire crowd seemed to be startled and gratified there is undoubtedly a certain altruism in the makeup of the spectators at a continental roulettetable they seem to derive a spiritual pleasure from seeing somebody else win  the croupier gave his moustache a twist with his left hand and the wheel a twist with his right and silence fell again sally who had shifted to a spot where the pressure of the crowd was less acute was now able to see gingers face and as she saw it she gave an involuntary laugh he looked exactly like a dog at a rathole his hair seemed to bristle with excitement one could almost fancy that his ears were pricked up  in the tense hush which had fallen on the crowd at the restarting of the wheel sallys laugh rang out with an embarrassing clearness it had a marked effect on all those within hearing there is something almost of religious ecstasy in the deportment of the spectators at a table where anyone is having a run of luck at roulette and if she had guffawed in a cathedral she could not have caused a more pained consternation the earnest worshippers gazed at her with shocked eyes and ginger turning with a start saw her and jumped up as he did so the ball fell with a rattling click into a red compartment of the wheel and as it ceased to revolve and it was seen that at last the big winner had picked the wrong colour a shuddering groan ran through the congregation like that which convulses the penitents bench at a negro revival meeting more glances of reproach were cast at sally it was generally felt that her injudicious behaviour had changed gingers luck  the only person who did not appear to be concerned was ginger himself he gathered up his loot thrust it into his pocket and elbowed his way to where sally stood now definitely established in the eyes of the crowd as a pariah there was universal regret that he had decided to call it a day it was to the spectators as though a star had suddenly walked off the stage in the middle of his big scene and not even a loud and violent quarrel which sprang up at this moment between two excitable gamblers over a disputed fivefranc counter could wholly console them  i say said ginger dexterously plucking sally out of the crowd this is topping meeting you like this ive been looking for you everywhere  its funny you didnt find me then for thats where ive been i was looking for you  no really ginger seemed pleased he led the way to the quiet anteroom outside the gamblinghall and they sat down in a corner it was pleasant here with nobody near except the gorgeously uniformed attendant over by the door that was awfully good of you  i felt i must have a talk with you before my train went  ginger started violently  your train what do you mean  the puffpuff explained sally im leaving tonight you know  leaving ginger looked as horrified as the devoutest of the congregation of which sally had just ceased to be a member you dont mean leaving youre not going away from roville  im afraid so  but why where are you going  back to america my boat sails from cherbourg tomorrow  oh my aunt  im sorry said sally touched by his concern she was a warmhearted girl and liked being appreciated but  i say ginger kemp turned bright scarlet and glared before him at the uniformed official who was regarding their têteàtête with the indulgent eye of one who has been through this sort of thing himself i say look here will you marry me    2    sally stared at his vermilion profile in frank amazement ginger she had realized by this time was in many ways a surprising young man but she had not expected him to be as surprising as this  marry you  you know what i mean  well yes i suppose i do you allude to the holy state yes i know what you mean  then how about it  sally began to regain her composure her sense of humour was tickled she looked at ginger gravely he did not meet her eye but continued to drink in the uniformed official who was by now so carried away by the romance of it all that he had begun to hum a loveballad under his breath the official could not hear what they were saying and would not have been able to understand it even if he could have heard but he was an expert in the language of the eyes  but isnt thisdont think i am trying to make difficultiesisnt this a little sudden  its got to be sudden said ginger kemp complainingly i thought you were going to be here for weeks  but my infant my babe has it occurred to you that we are practically strangers she patted his hand tolerantly causing the uniformed official to heave a tender sigh i see what has happened she said youre mistaking me for some other girl some girl you know really well and were properly introduced to take a good look at me and youll see  if i take a good look at you said ginger feverishly im dashed if ill answer for the consequences  and this is the man i was going to lecture on enterprise  youre the most wonderful girl ive ever met dash it said ginger his gaze still riveted on the official by the door i dare say it is sudden i cant help that i fell in love with you the moment i saw you and there you are  but  now look here i know im not much of a chap and all that but well ive just won the deuce of a lot of money in there  would you buy me with your gold  i mean to say we should have enough to start on and of course ive made an infernal hash of everything ive tried up till now but there must be something i can do and you can jolly well bet id have a goodish stab at it i mean to say with you to buck me up and so forth dont you know well i mean  has it struck you that i may already be engaged to someone else  oh golly are you  for the first time he turned and faced her and there was a look in his eyes which touched sally and drove all sense of the ludicrous out of her absurd as it was this man was really serious  well yes as a matter of fact i am she said soberly  ginger kemp bit his lip and for a moment was silent  oh well thats torn it he said at last  sally was aware of an emotion too complex to analyse there was pity in it but amusement too the emotion though she did not recognize it was maternal mothers listening to their children pleading with engaging absurdity for something wholly out of their power to bestow feel that same wavering between tears and laughter sally wanted to pick ginger up and kiss him the one thing she could not do was to look on him sorry as she was for him as a reasonable grownup man  you dont really mean it you know  dont i said ginger hollowly oh dont i  you cant there isnt such a thing in real life as love at first sight loves a thing that comes when you know a person well and she paused it had just occurred to her that she was hardly the girl to lecture in this strain her love for gerald foster had been sufficiently sudden even instantaneous what did she know of gerald except that she loved him they had become engaged within two weeks of their first meeting she found this recollection damping to her eloquence and ended by saying tamely  its ridiculous  ginger had simmered down to a mood of melancholy resignation  i couldnt have expected you to care for me i suppose anyway he said sombrely im not much of a chap  it was just the diversion from the theme under discussion which sally had been longing to find she welcomed the chance of continuing the conversation on a less intimate and sentimental note  thats exactly what i wanted to talk to you about she said seizing the opportunity offered by this display of humility ive been looking for you all day to go on with what i was starting to say in the lift last night when we were interrupted do you mind if i talk to you like an auntor a sister suppose we say really the best plan would be for you to adopt me as an honorary sister what do you think  ginger did not appear noticeably elated at the suggested relationship  because i really do take a tremendous interest in you  ginger brightened thats awfully good of you  im going to speak words of wisdom ginger why dont you brace up  brace up  yes stiffen your backbone and stick out your chin and square your elbows and really amount to something why do you simply flop about and do nothing and leave everything to what you call the family why do you have to be helped all the time why dont you help yourself why do you have to have jobs found for you why dont you rush out and get one why do you have to worry about what the family thinks of you why dont you make yourself independent of them i know you had hard luck suddenly finding yourself without money and all that but good heavens everybody else in the world who has ever done anything has been broke at one time or another its part of the fun youll never get anywhere by letting yourself be picked up by the family like like a floppy newfoundland puppy and dumped down in any old place that happens to suit them a jobs a thing youve got to choose for yourself and get for yourself think what you can dothere must be somethingand then go at it with a snort and grab it and hold it down and teach it to take a joke youve managed to collect some money it will give you time to look round and when youve had a look round do something try to realize youre alive and try to imagine the family isnt  sally stopped and drew a deep breath ginger kemp did not reply for a moment he seemed greatly impressed  when you talk quick he said at length in a serious meditative voice your nose sort of goes all squiggly ripping it looks  sally uttered an indignant cry  do you mean to say you havent been listening to a word ive been saying she demanded  oh rather oh by jove yes  well what did i say  you er and your eyes sort of shine too  never mind my eyes what did i say  you told me said ginger on reflection to get a job  well yes i put it much better than that but thats what it amounted to i suppose all right then im glad you  ginger was eyeing her with mournful devotion i say he interrupted i wish youd let me write to you letters i mean and all that i have an idea it would kind of buck me up  you wont have time for writing letters  ill have time to write them to you you havent an address or anything of that sort in america have you by any chance i mean so that id know where to write to  i can give you an address which will always find me she told him the number and street of mrs meechers boardinghouse and he wrote them down reverently on his shirtcuff yes on second thoughts do write she said of course i shall want to know how youve got on i oh my goodness that clocks not right  just about what time does your train go  go its gone or at least it goes in about two seconds she made a rush for the swingdoor to the confusion of the uniformed official who had not been expecting this sudden activity goodbye ginger write to me and remember what i said  ginger alert after his unexpected fashion when it became a question of physical action had followed her through the swingdoor and they emerged together and started running down the square  stick it said ginger encouragingly he was running easily and well as becomes a man who in his day had been a snip for his international at scrumhalf  sally saved her breath the train was beginning to move slowly out of the station as they sprinted abreast on to the platform ginger dived for the nearest door wrenched it open gathered sally neatly in his arms and flung her in she landed squarely on the toes of a man who occupied the corner seat and bounding off again made for the window ginger faithful to the last was trotting beside the train as it gathered speed  ginger my poor porter tip him i forgot  right ho  and dont forget what ive been saying  right ho  look after yourself and death to the family  right ho  the train passed smoothly out of the station sally cast one last look back at her redhaired friend who had now halted and was waving a handkerchief then she turned to apologize to the other occupant of the carriage  im so sorry she said breathlessly i hope i didnt hurt you  she found herself facing gingers cousin the dark man of yesterdays episode on the beach bruce carmyle    3    mr carmyle was not a man who readily allowed himself to be disturbed by lifes little surprises but at the present moment he could not help feeling slightly dazed he recognized sally now as the french girl who had attracted his cousin lancelots notice on the beach at least he had assumed that she was french and it was startling to be addressed by her now in fluent english how had she suddenly acquired this gift of tongues and how on earth had she had time since yesterday when he had been a total stranger to her to become sufficiently intimate with cousin lancelot to be sprinting with him down station platforms and addressing him out of railwaycarriage windows as ginger bruce carmyle was aware that most members of that subspecies of humanity his cousins personal friends called him by that familiarand so carmyle held vulgarnickname but how had this girl got hold of it  if sally had been less pretty mr carmyle would undoubtedly have looked disapprovingly at her for she had given his rather rigid sense of the proprieties a nasty jar but as panting and flushed from her run she was prettier than any girl he had yet met he contrived to smile  not at all he said in answer to her question though it was far from the truth his left big toe was aching confoundedly even a girl with a foot as small as sallys can make her presence felt on a mans toe if the scrumhalf who is handling her aims well and uses plenty of vigour  if you dont mind said sally sitting down i think ill breathe a little  she breathed the train sped on  quite a close thing said bruce carmyle affably the pain in his toe was diminishing you nearly missed it  yes it was lucky mr kemp was with me he throws very straight doesnt he  tell me said carmyle how do you come to know my cousin on the beach yesterday morning  oh we didnt know each other then but we were staying at the same hotel and we spent an hour or so shut up in an elevator together that was when we really got acquainted  a waiter entered the compartment announcing in unexpected english that dinner was served in the restaurant car would you care for dinner  im starving said sally  she reproved herself as they made their way down the corridor for being so foolish as to judge anyone by his appearance this man was perfectly pleasant in spite of his grim exterior she had decided by the time they had seated themselves at the table she liked him  at the table however mr carmyles manner changed for the worse he lost his amiability he was evidently a man who took his meals seriously and believed in treating waiters with severity he shuddered austerely at a stain on the tablecloth and then concentrated himself frowningly on the bill of fare sally meanwhile was establishing cosy relations with the much too friendly waiter a cheerful old man who from the start seemed to have made up his mind to regard her as a favourite daughter the waiter talked no english and sally no french but they were getting along capitally when mr carmyle who had been irritably waving aside the servitors lighthearted adviceat the hotel splendide the waiters never bent over you and breathed cordial suggestions down the side of your facegave his order crisply in the anglogallic dialect of the travelling briton the waiter remarked boum in a pleased sort of way and vanished  nice old man said sally  infernally familiar said mr carmyle  sally perceived that on the topic of the waiter she and her host did not see eye to eye and that little pleasure or profit could be derived from any discussion centring about him she changed the subject she was not liking mr carmyle quite so much as she had done a few minutes ago but it was courteous of him to give her dinner and she tried to like him as much as she could  by the way she said my name is nicholas i always think its a good thing to start with names dont you  mine  oh i know yours gingermr kemp told me  mr carmyle who since the waiters departure had been thawing stiffened again at the mention of ginger  indeed he said coldly apparently you got intimate  sally did not like his tone he seemed to be criticizing her and she resented criticism from a stranger her eyes opened wide and she looked dangerously across the table  why apparently i told you that we had got intimate and i explained how you cant stay shut up in an elevator half the night with anybody without getting to know him i found mr kemp very pleasant  really  and very interesting  mr carmyle raised his eyebrows  would you call him interesting  i did call him interesting sally was beginning to feel the exhilaration of battle men usually made themselves extremely agreeable to her and she reacted belligerently under the stiff unfriendliness which had come over her companion in the last few minutes  he told me all about himself  and you found that interesting  why not  well a frigid halfsmile came and went on bruce carmyles dark face my cousin has many excellent qualities no doubthe used to play football well and i understand that he is a capable amateur pugilistbut i should not have supposed him entertaining we find him a little dull  i thought it was only royalty that called themselves we  i meant myselfand the rest of the family  the mention of the family was too much for sally she had to stop talking in order to allow her mind to clear itself of rude thoughts  mr kemp was telling me about mr scrymgeour she went on at length  bruce carmyle stared for a moment at the yard or so of french bread which the waiter had placed on the table  indeed he said he has an engaging lack of reticence  the waiter returned bearing soup and dumped it down  vla he observed with the satisfied air of a man who has successfully performed a difficult conjuring trick he smiled at sally expectantly as though confident of applause from this section of his audience at least but sallys face was set and rigid she had been snubbed and the sensation was as pleasant as it was novel  i think mr kemp had hard luck she said  if you will excuse me i would prefer not to discuss the matter  mr carmyles attitude was that sally might be a pretty girl but she was a stranger and the intimate affairs of the family were not to be discussed with strangers however prepossessing  he was quite in the right mr scrymgeour was beating a dog  ive heard the details  oh i didnt know that well dont you agree with me then  i do not a man who would throw away an excellent position simply because  oh well if thats your view i suppose it is useless to talk about it  quite  still theres no harm in asking what you propose to do about ginabout mr kemp  mr carmyle became more glacial  im afraid i cannot discuss  sallys quick impatience nobly restrained till now finally got the better of her  oh for goodness sake she snapped do try to be human and dont always be snubbing people you remind me of one of those portraits of men in the eighteenth century with wooden faces who look out of heavy gold frames at you with fishy eyes as if you were a regrettable incident  rosbif said the waiter genially manifesting himself suddenly beside them as if he had popped up out of a trap  bruce carmyle attacked his roast beef morosely sally who was in the mood when she knew that she would be ashamed of herself later on but was full of battle at the moment sat in silence  i am sorry said mr carmyle ponderously if my eyes are fishy the fact has not been called to my attention before  i suppose you never had any sisters said sally they would have told you  mr carmyle relapsed into an offended dumbness which lasted till the waiter had brought the coffee  i think said sally getting up ill be going now i dont seem to want any coffee and if i stay on i may say something rude i thought i might be able to put in a good word for mr kemp and save him from being massacred but apparently its no use goodbye mr carmyle and thank you for giving me dinner  she made her way down the car followed by bruce carmyles indignant yet fascinated gaze strange emotions were stirring in mr carmyles bosom     chapter iv ginger in dangerous mood    some few days later owing to the fact that the latter being preoccupied did not see him first bruce carmyle met his cousin lancelot in piccadilly they had returned by different routes from roville and ginger would have preferred the separation to continue he was hurrying on with a nod when carmyle stopped him  just the man i wanted to see he observed  oh hullo said ginger without joy  i was thinking of calling at your club  yes  yes cigarette  ginger peered at the proffered case with the vague suspicion of the man who has allowed himself to be lured on to the platform and is accepting a card from the conjurer he felt bewildered in all the years of their acquaintance he could not recall another such exhibition of geniality on his cousins part he was surprised indeed at mr carmyles speaking to him at all for the affaire scrymgeour remained an unhealed wound and the family ginger knew were even now in session upon it  been back in london long  day or two  i heard quite by accident that you had returned and that you were staying at the club by the way thank you for introducing me to miss nicholas  ginger started violently  what  i was in that compartment you know at roville station you threw her right on top of me we agreed to consider that an introduction an attractive girl  bruce carmyle had not entirely made up his mind regarding sally but on one point he was clear that she should not if he could help it pass out of his life her abrupt departure had left him with that baffled and dissatisfied feeling which though it has little in common with love at first sight frequently produces the same effects she had had he could not disguise it from himself the better of their late encounter and he was conscious of a desire to meet her again and show her that there was more in him than she apparently supposed bruce carmyle in a word was piqued and though he could not quite decide whether he liked or disliked sally he was very sure that a future without her would have an element of flatness  a very attractive girl we had a very pleasant talk  i bet you did said ginger enviously  by the way she did not give you her address by any chance  why said ginger suspiciously his attitude towards sallys address resembled somewhat that of a connoisseur who has acquired a unique work of art he wanted to keep it to himself and gloat over it  well ieri promised to send her some books she was anxious to read  i shouldnt think she gets much time for reading  books which are not published in america  oh pretty nearly everything is published in america what bound to be i mean  well these particular books are not said mr carmyle shortly he was finding gingers reserve a little trying and wished that he had been more inventive  give them to me and ill send them to her suggested ginger  good lord man snapped mr carmyle im capable of sending a few books to america where does she live  ginger revealed the sacred number of the holy street which had the luck to be sallys headquarters he did it because with a persistent devil like his cousin there seemed no way of getting out of it but he did it grudgingly  thanks bruce carmyle wrote the information down with a gold pencil in a dapper little moroccobound notebook he was the sort of man who always has a pencil and the backs of old envelopes never enter into his life  there was a pause bruce carmyle coughed  i saw uncle donald this morning he said  his manner had lost its geniality there was no need for it now and he was a man who objected to waste he spoke coldly and in his voice there was a familiar subtingle of reproof  yes said ginger moodily this was the uncle in whose office he had made his debut as a hasher a worthy man highly respected in the national liberal club but never a favourite of gingers there were other minor uncles and a few subsidiary aunts who went to make up the family but uncle donald was unquestionably the managing director of that body and it was gingers considered opinion that in this capacity he approximated to a human blister  he wants you to dine with him tonight at blekes  gingers depression deepened a dinner with uncle donald would hardly have been a cheerful function even in the surroundings of a banquet in the arabian nights there was that about uncle donalds personality which would have cast a sobering influence over the orgies of the emperor tiberius at capri to dine with him at a morgue like that relic of old london blekes coffee house which confined its custom principally to regular patrons who had not missed an evening there for half a century was to touch something very near bedrock ginger was extremely doubtful whether flesh and blood were equal to it  tonight he said oh you mean tonight well  dont be a fool you know as well as i do that youve got to go uncle donalds invitations were royal commands in the family if youve another engagement you must put it off  oh all right  seventhirty sharp  all right said ginger gloomily  the two men went their ways bruce carmyle eastwards because he had clients to see in his chambers at the temple ginger westwards because mr carmyle had gone east there was little sympathy between these cousins yet oddly enough their thoughts as they walked centred on the same object bruce carmyle threading his way briskly through the crowds of piccadilly circus was thinking of sally and so was ginger as he loafed aimlessly towards hyde park corner bumping in a sort of coma from pedestrian to pedestrian  since his return to london ginger had been in bad shape he mooned through the days and slept poorly at night if there is one thing rottener than another in a pretty blighted world one thing which gives a fellow the pip and reduces him to the condition of an absolute onion it is hopeless love hopeless love had got ginger all stirred up his had been hitherto a placid soul even the financial crash which had so altered his life had not bruised him very deeply his temperament had enabled him to bear the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune with a philosophic right ho but now everything seemed different things irritated him acutely which before he had accepted as inevitablehis uncle donalds moustache for instance and its owners habit of employing it during meals as a sort of zareba or earthwork against the assaults of soup  by gad thought ginger stopping suddenly opposite devonshire house if he uses that damned shrubbery as soupstrainer tonight ill slosh him with a fork  hard thoughts hard thoughts and getting harder all the time for nothing grows more quickly than a mood of rebellion rebellion is a forest fire that flames across the soul the spark had been lighted in ginger and long before he reached hyde park corner he was ablaze and crackling by the time he returned to his club he was practically a menace to societyto that section of it at any rate which embraced his uncle donald his minor uncles george and william and his aunts mary geraldine and louise  nor had the mood passed when he began to dress for the dismal festivities of blekes coffee house he scowled as he struggled morosely with an obstinate tie one cannot disguise the factginger was warming up and it was just at this moment that fate as though it had been waiting for the psychological instant applied the finishing touch there was a knock at the door and a waiter came in with a telegram  ginger looked at the envelope it had been readdressed and forwarded on from the hotel normandie it was a wireless handed in on board the white star liner olympic and it ran as follows  remember death to the family s  ginger sat down heavily on the bed  the driver of the taxicab which at twentyfive minutes past seven drew up at the dingy door of blekes coffee house in the strand was rather struck by his fares manner and appearance a determinedlooking sort of young bloke was the taxidrivers verdict     chapter v sally hears news    it had been sallys intention on arriving in new york to take a room at the st regis and revel in the gilded luxury to which her wealth entitled her before moving into the small but comfortable apartment which as soon as she had the time she intended to find and make her permanent abode but when the moment came and she was giving directions to the taxidriver at the dock there seemed to her something revoltingly fillmorian about the scheme it would be time enough to sever herself from the boardinghouse which had been her home for three years when she had found the apartment meanwhile the decent thing to do if she did not want to brand herself in the sight of her conscience as a female fillmore was to go back temporarily to mrs meechers admirable establishment and foregather with her old friends after all home is where the heart is even if there are more prunes there than the gourmet would consider judicious  perhaps it was the unavoidable complacency induced by the thought that she was doing the right thing or possibly it was the tingling expectation of meeting gerald foster again after all these weeks of separation that made the familiar streets seem wonderfully bright as she drove through them it was a perfect crisp new york morning all blue sky and amber sunshine and even the ashcans had a stimulating look about them the street cars were full of happy people rollicking off to work policemen directed the traffic with jaunty affability and the whiteclad streetcleaners went about their poetic tasks with a quiet but none the less noticeable relish it was improbable that any of these people knew that she was back but somehow they all seemed to be behaving as though this were a special day  the first discordant note in this overture of happiness was struck by mrs meecher who informed sally after expressing her gratification at the news that she required her old room that gerald foster had left town that morning  gone to detroit he has said mrs meecher miss doland too she broke off to speak a caustic word to the boardinghouse handyman who with sallys trunk as a weapon was depreciating the value of the wallpaper in the hall theres that play of his being tried out there you know monday resumed mrs meecher after the handyman had bumped his way up the staircase they been rehearsing ever since you left  sally was disappointed but it was such a beautiful morning and new york was so wonderful after the dull voyage in the liner that she was not going to allow herself to be depressed without good reason after all she could go on to detroit tomorrow it was nice to have something to which she could look forward  oh is elsa in the company she said  sure and very good too i hear mrs meecher kept abreast of theatrical gossip she was an exmember of the profession herself having been in the first production of florodora though unlike everybody else not one of the original sextette mr faucitt was down to see a rehearsal and he said miss doland was fine and hes not easy to please as you know  how is mr faucitt  mrs meecher not unwillingly for she was a woman who enjoyed the tragedies of life made her second essay in the direction of lowering sallys uplifted mood  poor old gentleman he aint over and above well went to bed early last night with a headache and this morning i been to see him and he dont look well theres a lot of this spanish influenza about it might be that lots o people have been dying of it if you believe what you see in the papers said mrs meecher buoyantly  good gracious you dont think  well he aint turned black admitted mrs meecher with regret they say they turn black if you believe what you see in the papers that is of course that may come later she added with the air of one confident that all will come right in the future the doctorll be in to see him pretty soon hes quite happy totos sitting with him  sallys concern increased like everyone who had ever spent any length of time in the house she had strong views on toto this quadruped who stained the fame of the entire canine race by posing as a dog was a small woolly animal with a persistent and penetrating yap hard to bear with equanimity in health and certainly quite outside the range of a sick man her heart bled for mr faucitt mrs meecher on the other hand who held a faith in her little pets amiability and power to soothe which seven years close association had been unable to shake seemed to feel that with toto on the spot all that could be done had been done as far as pampering the invalid was concerned  i must go up and see him cried sally poor old dear  sure you know his room you can hear toto talking to him now said mrs meecher complacently he wants a cracker thats what he wants toto likes a cracker after breakfast  the invalids eyes as sally entered the room turned wearily to the door at the sight of sally they lit up with an incredulous rapture almost any intervention would have pleased mr faucitt at that moment for his little playmate had long outstayed any welcome that might originally have been his but that the caller should be his beloved sally seemed to the old man something in the nature of a return of the age of miracles  sally  one moment here toto  toto struck momentarily dumb by the sight of food had jumped off the bed and was standing with his head on one side peering questioningly at the cracker he was a suspicious dog but he allowed himself to be lured into the passage upon which sally threw the cracker down and slipped in and shut the door toto after a couple of yaps which may have been gratitude or baffled fury trotted off downstairs and mr faucitt drew a deep breath  sally you come as ever as an angel of mercy our worthy mrs meecher means well and i yield to no man in my respect for her innate kindness of heart but she errs in supposing that that thricedamned whelp of hers is a combination of sicknurse soothing medicine and a week at the seaside she insisted on bringing him here he was yapping then as he was yapping when with womanly resource which i cannot sufficiently praise you decoyed him hence and each yap went through me like hammerstrokes on sheeted tin sally you stand alone among womankind you shine like a good deed in a naughty world when did you get back  ive only just arrived in my hired barouche from the pier  and you came to see your old friend without delay i am grateful and flattered sally my dear  of course i came to see you do you suppose that when mrs meecher told me you were sick i just said is that so and went on talking about the weather well what do you mean by it frightening everybody poor old darling do you feel very bad  one thousand individual mice are nibbling the base of my spine and i am conscious of a constant need of cooling refreshment but what of that your presence is a tonic tell me how did our sally enjoy foreign travel  our sally had the time of her life  did you visit england  only passing through  how did it look asked mr faucitt eagerly  moist very moist  it would said mr faucitt indulgently i confess that happy as i have been in this country there are times when i miss those wonderful london days when a sort of cosy brown mist hangs over the streets and the pavements ooze with a perspiration of mud and water and you see through the haze the yellow glow of the bodega lamps shining in the distance like harbourlights not said mr faucitt that i specify the bodega to the exclusion of other and equally worthy hostelries i have passed just as pleasant hours in rules and shorts you missed something by not lingering in england sally  i know i didpneumonia  mr faucitt shook his head reproachfully  you are prejudiced my dear you would have enjoyed london if you had had the courage to brave its superficial gloom where did you spend your holiday paris  part of the time and the rest of the while i was down by the sea it was glorious i dont think i would ever have come back if i hadnt had to but of course i wanted to see you all again and i wanted to be at the opening of mr fosters play mrs meecher tells me you went to one of the rehearsals  i attended a dogfight which i was informed was a rehearsal said mr faucitt severely there is no rehearsing nowadays  oh dear was it as bad as all that  the play is good the playi will go furtheris excellent it has fat but the acting  mrs meecher said you told her that elsa was good  our worthy hostess did not misreport me miss doland has great possibilities she reminds me somewhat of matilda devine under whose banner i played a season at the old royalty in london many years ago she has the seeds of greatness in her but she is wasted in the present case on an insignificant part there is only one part in the play i allude to the one murdered by miss mabel hobson  murdered sallys heart sank she had been afraid of this and it was no satisfaction to feel that she had warned gerald is she very terrible  she has the face of an angel and the histrionic ability of that curious suet pudding which our estimable mrs meecher is apt to give us on fridays in my professional career i have seen many cases of what i may term the lady friend in the role of star but miss hobson eclipses them all i remember in the year 94 a certain scion of the plutocracy took it into his head to present a female for whom he had conceived an admiration in a part which would have taxed the resources of the ablest i was engaged in her support and at the first rehearsal i recollect saying to my dear old friend arthur mosebydead alas these many years an excellent juvenile but like so many good fellows cursed with a tendency to lift the elbowi recollect saying to him arthur dear boy i give it two weeks max was his reply you are an incurable optimist one consecutive night laddie one consecutive night we had i recall an even halfcrown upon it he won we opened at wigan our leading lady got the bird and the show closed next day i was forcibly reminded of this incident as i watched miss hobson rehearsing  oh poor gerpoor mr foster  i do not share your commiseration for that young man said mr faucitt austerely you probably are almost a stranger to him but he and i have been thrown together a good deal of late a young man upon whom mark my words success if it ever comes will have the worst effects i dislike him sally he is i think without exception the most selfish and selfcentred young man of my acquaintance he reminds me very much of old billy fothergill with whom i toured a good deal in the later eighties did i ever tell you the story of billy and the amateur who  sally was in no mood to listen to the adventures of mr fothergill the old mans innocent criticism of gerald had stabbed her deeply a momentary impulse to speak hotly in his defence died away as she saw mr faucitts pale worn old face he had meant no harm after all how could he know what gerald was to her  she changed the conversation abruptly  have you seen anything of fillmore while ive been away  fillmore why yes my dear curiously enough i happened to run into him on broadway only a few days ago he seemed changedless stiff and aloof than he had been for some time past i may be wronging him but there have been times of late when one might almost have fancied him a trifle upstage all that was gone at our last encounter he appeared glad to see me and was most cordial  sally found her composure restored her lecture on the night of the party had evidently she thought not been wasted mr faucitt however advanced another theory to account for the change in the man of destiny  i rather fancy he said that the softening influence has been the young mans fiancée  what fillmores not engaged  did he not write and tell you i suppose he was waiting to inform you when you returned yes fillmore is betrothed the lady was with him when we met a miss winch in the profession i understand he introduced me a very charming and sensible young lady i thought  sally shook her head  she cant be fillmore would never have got engaged to anyone like that was her hair crimson  brown if i recollect rightly  very loud i suppose and overdressed  on the contrary neat and quiet  youve made a mistake said sally decidedly she cant have been like that i shall have to look into this it does seem hard that i cant go away for a few weeks without all my friends taking to beds of sickness and all my brothers getting ensnared by vampires  a knock at the door interrupted her complaint mrs meecher entered ushering in a pleasant little man with spectacles and black bag  the doctor to see you mr faucitt mrs meecher cast an appraising eye at the invalid as if to detect symptoms of approaching discoloration ive been telling him that what i think youve gotten is this here new spanish influenza two more deaths there were in the paper this morning if you can believe what you see  i wonder said the doctor if you would mind going and bringing me a small glass of water  why sure  not a large glassa small glass just let the tap run for a few moments and take care not to spill any as you come up the stairs i always ask ladies like our friend who has just gone he added as the door closed to bring me a glass of water it keeps them amused and interested and gets them out of the way and they think i am going to do a conjuring trick with it as a matter of fact im going to drink it now lets have a look at you  the examination did not take long at the end of it the doctor seemed somewhat chagrined  our good friends diagnosis was correct id give a leg to say it wasnt but it was it is this here new spanish influenza not a bad attack you want to stay in bed and keep warm and ill write you out a prescription you ought to be nursed is this young lady a nurse  no no merely  of course im a nurse said sally decidedly it isnt difficult is it doctor i know nurses smooth pillows i can do that is there anything else  their principal duty is to sit here and prevent the excellent and garrulous lady who has just left us from getting in they must also be able to aim straight with a book or an old shoe if that small woolly dog i met downstairs tries to force an entrance if you are equal to these tasks i can leave the case in your hands with every confidence  but sally my dear said mr faucitt concerned you must not waste your time looking after me you have a thousand things to occupy you  theres nothing i want to do more than help you to get better ill just go out and send a wire and then ill be right back  five minutes later sally was in a western union office telegraphing to gerald that she would be unable to reach detroit in time for the opening     chapter vi first aid for fillmore    1    it was not till the following friday that sally was able to start for detroit she arrived on the saturday morning and drove to the hotel statler having ascertained that gerald was stopping in the hotel and having phoned up to his room to tell him to join her she went into the diningroom and ordered breakfast  she felt lowspirited as she waited for the food to arrive the nursing of mr faucitt had left her tired and she had not slept well on the train but the real cause of her depression was the fact that there had been a lack of enthusiasm in geralds greeting over the telephone just now he had spoken listlessly as though the fact of her returning after all these weeks was a matter of no account and she felt hurt and perplexed  a cup of coffee had a stimulating effect men of course were always like this in the early morning it would no doubt be a very different gerald who would presently bound into the diningroom quickened and restored by a cold showerbath in the meantime here was food and she needed it  she was pouring out her second cup of coffee when a stout young man of whom she had caught a glimpse as he moved about that section of the hotel lobby which was visible through the open door of the diningroom came in and stood peering about as though in search of someone the momentary sight she had had of this young man had interested sally she had thought how extraordinarily like he was to her brother fillmore now she perceived that it was fillmore himself  sally was puzzled what could fillmore be doing so far west she had supposed him to be a permanent resident of new york but of course your man of affairs and vast interests flits about all over the place at any rate here he was and she called him and after he had stood in the doorway looking in every direction except the right one for another minute he saw her and came over to her table  why sally his manner she thought was nervousone might almost have said embarrassed she attributed this to a guilty conscience presently he would have to break to her the news that he had become engaged to be married without her sisterly sanction and no doubt he was wondering how to begin what are you doing here i thought you were in europe  i got back a week ago but ive been nursing poor old mr faucitt ever since then hes been ill poor old dear ive come here to see mr fosters play the primrose way you know is it a success  it hasnt opened yet  dont be silly fill do pull yourself together it opened last monday  no it didnt havent you heard theyve closed all the theatres because of this infernal spanish influenza nothing has been playing this week you must have seen it in the papers  i havent had time to read the papers oh fill what an awful shame  yes its pretty tough makes the company all on edge ive had the darndest time i can tell you  why what have you got to do with it  fillmore coughed  ieroh i didnt tell you that im sort ofermixed up in the show cracknellyou remember he was at college with mesuggested that i should come down and look at it shouldnt wonder if he wants me to put money into it and so on  i thought he had all the money in the world  yes he has a lot but these fellows like to let a pal in on a good thing  is it a good thing  the plays fine  thats what mr faucitt said but mabel hobson  fillmores ample face registered emotion  shes an awful woman sally she cant act and she throws her weight about all the time the other day there was a fuss about a paperknife  how do you mean a fuss about a paperknife  one of the props you know it got mislaid im certain it wasnt my fault  how could it have been your fault asked sally wonderingly love seemed to have the worst effects on fillmores mentality  welleryou know how it is angry woman blames the first person she sees this paperknife  fillmores voice trailed off into pained silence  mr faucitt said elsa doland was good  oh shes all right said fillmore indifferently but his face brightened and animation crept into his voice but the girl you want to watch is miss winch gladys winch she plays the maid shes only in the first act and hasnt much to say except did you ring madam and things like that but its the way she says em sally that girls a genius the greatest character actress in a dozen years you mark my words in a darned little while youll see her name up on broadway in electric light personality ask me charm she wrote the words and music looks  all right all right i know all about it fill and will you kindly inform me how you dared to get engaged without consulting me  fillmore blushed richly  oh do you know  yes mr faucitt told me  well  well  well im only human argued fillmore  i call that a very handsome admission youve got quite modest fill  he had certainly changed for the better since their last meeting  it was as if someone had punctured him and let out all the pomposity if this was due as mr faucitt had suggested to the influence of miss winch sally felt that she could not but approve of the romance  ill introduce you sometime said fillmore  i want to meet her very much  ill have to be going now ive got to see bunbury i thought he might be in here  whos bunbury  the producer i suppose he is breakfasting in his room id better go up  you are busy arent you little marvel its lucky theyve got you to look after them  fillmore retired and sally settled down to wait for gerald no longer hurt by his manner over the telephone poor gerald no wonder he had seemed upset  a few minutes later he came in  oh jerry darling said sally as he reached the table im so sorry ive just been hearing about it  gerald sat down his appearance fulfilled the promise of his voice over the telephone a sort of nervous dullness wrapped him about like a garment  its just my luck he said gloomily its the kind of thing that couldnt happen to anyone but me damned fools wheres the sense in shutting the theatres even if there is influenza about they let people jam against one another all day in the stores if that doesnt hurt them why should it hurt them to go to theatres besides its all infernal nonsense about this thing i dont believe there is such a thing as spanish influenza people get colds in their heads and think theyre dying its all a fake scare  i dont think its that said sally poor mr faucitt had it quite badly thats why i couldnt come earlier  gerald did not seem interested either by the news of mr faucitts illness or by the fact that sally after delay had at last arrived he dug a spoon sombrely into his grapefruit  weve been hanging about here day after day getting bored to death all the time the companys going all to pieces theyre sick of rehearsing and rehearsing when nobody knows if well ever open they were all keyed up a week ago and theyve been sagging ever since it will ruin the play of course my first chance just chucked away  sally was listening with a growing feeling of desolation she tried to be fair to remember that he had had a terrible disappointment and was under a great strain and yet it was unfortunate that selfpity was a thing she particularly disliked in a man her vanity too was hurt it was obvious that her arrival so far from acting as a magic restorative had effected nothing she could not help remembering though it made her feel disloyal what mr faucitt had said about gerald she had never noticed before that he was remarkably selfcentred but he was thrusting the fact upon her attention now  that hobson woman is beginning to make trouble went on gerald prodding in a despairing sort of way at scrambled eggs she ought never to have had the part never she cant handle it elsa doland could play it a thousand times better i wrote elsa in a few lines the other day and the hobson woman went right up in the air you dont know what a star is till youve seen one of these promoted clothesprops from the follies trying to be one it took me an hour to talk her round and keep her from throwing up her part  why not let her throw up her part  for heavens sake talk sense said gerald querulously do you suppose that man cracknell would keep the play on if she wasnt in it he would close the show in a second and where would i be then you dont seem to realize that this is a big chance for me id look a fool throwing it away  i see said sally shortly she had never felt so wretched in her life foreign travel she decided was a mistake it might be pleasant and broadening to the mind but it seemed to put you so out of touch with people when you got back she analysed her sensations and arrived at the conclusion that what she was resenting was the fact that gerald was trying to get the advantages of two attitudes simultaneously a man in trouble may either be the captain of his soul and superior to pity or he may be a broken thing for a woman to pet and comfort gerald it seemed to her was advertising himself as an object for her commiseration and at the same time raising a barrier against it he appeared to demand her sympathy while holding himself aloof from it she had the uncomfortable sensation of feeling herself shut out and useless  by the way said gerald theres one thing i have to keep her jollying along all the time so for goodness sake dont go letting it out that were engaged  sallys chin went up with a jerk this was too much  if you find it a handicap being engaged to me  dont be silly gerald took refuge in pathos good god its tough here am i worried to death and you  before he could finish the sentence sallys mood had undergone one of those swift changes which sometimes made her feel that she must be lacking in character a simple comforting thought had come to her altering her entire outlook she had come off the train tired and gritty and what seemed the general outofjointness of the world was entirely due she decided to the fact that she had not had a bath and that her hair was all anyhow she felt suddenly tranquil if it was merely her grubby and dishevelled condition that made gerald seem to her so different all was well she put her hand on his with a quick gesture of penitence  im so sorry she said ive been a brute but i do sympathize really  ive had an awful time mumbled gerald  i know i know but you never told me you were glad to see me  of course im glad to see you  why didnt you say so then you poor fish and why didnt you ask me if i had enjoyed myself in europe  did you enjoy yourself  yes except that i missed you so much there now we can consider my lecture on foreign travel finished and you can go on telling me your troubles  gerald accepted the invitation he spoke at considerable length though with little variety it appeared definitely established in his mind that providence had invented spanish influenza purely with a view to wrecking his future but now he seemed less aloof more open to sympathy the brief thunderstorm had cleared the air sally lost that sense of detachment and exclusion which had weighed upon her  well said gerald at length looking at his watch i suppose i had better be off  rehearsal  yes confound it its the only way of getting through the day are you coming along  ill come directly ive unpacked and tidied myself up  see you at the theatre then  sally went out and rang for the lift to take her up to her room    2    the rehearsal had started when she reached the theatre as she entered the dark auditorium voices came to her with that thin and reedy effect which is produced by people talking in an empty building she sat down at the back of the house and as her eyes grew accustomed to the gloom was able to see gerald sitting in the front row beside a man with a bald head fringed with orange hair whom she took correctly to be mr bunbury the producer dotted about the house in ones and twos were members of the company whose presence was not required in the first act on the stage elsa doland looking very attractive was playing a scene with a man in a bowler hat she was speaking a line as sally came in  why what do you mean father  tiddlyomtyom was the bowlerhatted ones surprising reply tiddlyomtyom long speech ending in find me in the library and exit said the man in the bowler hat starting to do so  for the first time sally became aware of the atmosphere of nerves mr bunbury who seemed to be a man of temperament picked up his walkingstick which was leaning against the next seat and flung it with some violence across the house  for gods sake said mr bunbury  now what inquired the bowler hat interested pausing hallway across the stage  do speak the lines teddy exclaimed gerald dont skip them in that sloppy fashion  you dont want me to go over the whole thing asked the bowler hat amazed  yes  not the whole damn thing queried the bowler hat fighting with incredulity  this is a rehearsal snapped mr bunbury if we are not going to do it properly whats the use of doing it at all  this seemed to strike the erring teddy if not as reasonable at any rate as one way of looking at it he delivered the speech in an injured tone and shuffled off the atmosphere of tenseness was unmistakable now sally could feel it the world of the theatre is simply a large nursery and its inhabitants children who readily become fretful if anything goes wrong the waiting and the uncertainty the loafing about in strange hotels in a strange city the dreary rehearsing of lines which had been polished to the last syllable more than a week agothese things had sapped the nerve of the primrose way company and demoralization had set in it would require only a trifle to produce an explosion  elsa doland now moved to the door pressed a bell and taking a magazine from the table sat down in a chair near the footlights a moment later in answer to the ring a young woman entered to be greeted instantly by an impassioned bellow from mr bunbury  miss winch  the new arrival stopped and looked out over the footlights not in the pained manner of the man in the bowler hat but with the sort of genial indulgence of one who has come to a juvenile party to amuse the children she was a square wholesome goodhumoured looking girl with a serious face the gravity of which was contradicted by the faint smile that seemed to lurk about the corner of her mouth she was certainly not pretty and sally watching her with keen interest was surprised that fillmore had had the sense to disregard surface homeliness and recognize her charm deep down in fillmore sally decided there must lurk an unsuspected vein of intelligence  hello said miss winch amiably  mr bunbury seemed profoundly moved  miss winch did i or did i not ask you to refrain from chewing gum during rehearsal  thats right so you did admitted miss winch chummily  then why are you doing it  fillmores fiancée revolved the criticized refreshment about her tongue for a moment before replying  bit o business she announced at length  what do you mean a bit of business  character stuff explained miss winch in her pleasant drawling voice thought it out myself maids chew gum you know  mr bunbury ruffled his orange hair in an overwrought manner with the palm of his right hand  have you ever seen a maid he asked despairingly  yes sir and they chew gum  i mean a parlourmaid in a smart house moaned mr bunbury do you imagine for a moment that in a house such as this is supposed to be the parlourmaid would be allowed to come into the drawingroom champing that disgusting beastly stuff  miss winch considered the point  maybe youre right she brightened listen great idea mr foster can write in a line for elsa calling me down and another giving me a good comeback and then another for elsa saying something else and then something really funny for me and so on we can work it up into a big comic scene five or six minutes all laughs  this ingenious suggestion had the effect of depriving the producer momentarily of speech and while he was struggling for utterance there dashed out from the wings a gorgeous being in blue velvet and a hat of such unimpeachable smartness that sally ached at the sight of it with a spasm of pure envy  say  miss mabel hobson had practically every personal advantage which nature can bestow with the exception of a musical voice her figure was perfect her face beautiful and her hair a mass of spun gold but her voice in moments of emotion was the voice of a peacock  say listen to me for just one moment  mr bunbury recovered from his trance  miss hobson please  yes thats all very well  you are interrupting the rehearsal  you bet your sorrowful existence im interrupting the rehearsal agreed miss hobson with emphasis and if you want to make a little easy money you go and bet somebody ten seeds that im going to interrupt it again every time theres any talk of writing up any darned part in the show except mine write up other peoples parts not while i have my strength  a young man with buttercoloured hair who had entered from the wings in close attendance on the injured lady attempted to calm the storm  now sweetie  oh can it reggie said miss hobson curtly  mr cracknell obediently canned it he was not one of your brutal cavemen he subsided into the recesses of a high collar and began to chew the knob of his stick  im the star resumed miss hobson vehemently and if you think anybody elses parts going to be written up well pardon me while i choke with laughter if so much as a syllable is written into anybodys part i walk straight out on my two feet you wont see me go ill be so quick  mr bunbury sprang to his feet and waved his hands  for heavens sake are we rehearsing or is this a debating society miss hobson nothing is going to be written into anybodys part now are you satisfied  she said  oh never mind observed miss winch equably it was only a random thought working for the good of the show all the time thats me  now sweetie pleaded mr cracknell emerging from the collar like a tortoise  miss hobson reluctantly allowed herself to be reassured  oh well thats all right then but dont forget i know how to look after myself she said stating a fact which was abundantly obvious to all who had had the privilege of listening to her any raw work and out i walk so quick itll make you giddy  she retired followed by mr cracknell and the wings swallowed her up  shall i say my big speech now inquired miss winch over the footlights  yes yes get on with the rehearsal weve wasted half the morning  did you ring madam said miss winch to elsa who had been reading her magazine placidly through the late scene  the rehearsal proceeded and sally watched it with a sinking heart it was all wrong novice as she was in things theatrical she could see that there was no doubt that miss hobson was superbly beautiful and would have shed lustre on any part which involved the minimum of words and the maximum of clothes but in the pivotal role of a serious play her very physical attributes only served to emphasize and point her hopeless incapacity sally remembered mr faucitts story of the lady who got the bird at wigan she did not see how history could fail to repeat itself the theatrical public of america will endure much from youth and beauty but there is a limit  a shrill passionate cry from the front row and mr bunbury was on his feet again sally could not help wondering whether things were going particularly wrong today or whether this was one of mr bunburys ordinary mornings  miss hobson  the action of the drama had just brought that emotional lady on left centre and had taken her across to the desk which stood on the other side of the stage the desk was an important feature of the play for it symbolized the absorption in business which exhibited by her husband was rapidly breaking miss hobsons heart he loved his desk better than his young wife that was what it amounted to and no wife can stand that sort of thing  oh gee said miss hobson ceasing to be the distressed wife and becoming the offended star whats it this time  i suggested at the last rehearsal and at the rehearsal before and the rehearsal before that that on that line you should pick up the paperknife and toy negligently with it you did it yesterday and today youve forgotten it again  my god cried miss hobson wounded to the quick if this dont beat everything how the heck can i toy negligently with a paperknife when theres no paperknife for me to toy negligently with  the paperknife is on the desk  its not on the desk  no paperknife  no paperknife and its no good picking on me im the star not the assistant stage manager if youre going to pick on anybody pick on him  the advice appeared to strike mr bunbury as good he threw back his head and bayed like a bloodhound  there was a momentary pause and then from the wings on the prompt side there shambled out a stout and shrinking figure in whose hand was a script of the play and on whose face lit up by the footlights there shone a look of apprehension it was fillmore the man of destiny    3    alas poor fillmore he stood in the middle of the stage with the lightning of mr bunburys wrath playing about his defenceless head and sally recovering from her first astonishment sent a wave of sisterly commiseration floating across the theatre to him she did not often pity fillmore his was a nature which in the sunshine of prosperity had a tendency to grow a trifle lush and such of the minor ills of life as had afflicted him during the past three years had she considered been wholesome and educative and a matter not for concern but for congratulation unmoved she had watched him through that lean period lunching on coffee and buckwheat cakes and curbing from motives of economy a somewhat florid taste in dress but this was different this was tragedy somehow or other blasting disaster must have smitten the fillmore bankroll and he was back where he had started his presence here this morning could mean nothing else  she recalled his words at the breakfasttable about financing the play how like fillmore to try to save his face for the moment with an outrageous bluff though well aware that he would have to reveal the truth sooner or later she realized how he must have felt when he had seen her at the hotel yes she was sorry for fillmore  and as she listened to the fervent eloquence of mr bunbury she perceived that she had every reason to be fillmore was having a bad time one of the chief articles of faith in the creed of all theatrical producers is that if anything goes wrong it must be the fault of the assistant stage manager and mr bunbury was evidently orthodox in his views he was showing oratorical gifts of no mean order the paperknife seemed to inspire him gradually sally began to get the feeling that this harmless necessary stageproperty was the source from which sprang most if not all of the trouble in the world it had disappeared before now it had disappeared again could mr bunbury go on struggling in a universe where this sort of thing happened he seemed to doubt it being a redblooded onehundredpercent american man he would try hard but it was a hundred to one shot that he would get through he had asked for a paperknife there was no paperknife why was there no paperknife where was the paperknife anyway  i assure you mr bunbury bleated the unhappy fillmore obsequiously i placed it with the rest of the properties after the last rehearsal  you couldnt have done  i assure you i did  and it walked away i suppose said miss hobson with cold scorn pausing in the operation of brightening up her lower lip with a lipstick  a calm clear voice spoke  it was taken away said the calm clear voice  miss winch had added herself to the symposium she stood beside fillmore chewing placidly it took more than raised voices and gesticulating hands to disturb miss winch  miss hobson took it she went on in her cosy drawling voice i saw her  sensation in court the prisoner who seemed to feel his position deeply cast a popeyed glance full of gratitude at his advocate mr bunbury in his capacity of prosecuting attorney ran his fingers through his hair in some embarrassment for he was regretting now that he had made such a fuss miss hobson thus assailed by an underling spun round and dropped the lipstick which was neatly retrieved by the assiduous mr cracknell mr cracknell had his limitations but he was rather good at picking up lipsticks  whats that i took it i never did anything of the sort  miss hobson took it after the rehearsal yesterday drawled gladys winch addressing the world in general and threw it negligently at the theatre cat  miss hobson seemed taken aback her composure was not restored by mr bunburys next remark the producer like his company had been feeling the strain of the past few days and though as a rule he avoided anything in the nature of a clash with the temperamental star this matter of the missing paperknife had bitten so deeply into his soul that he felt compelled to speak his mind  in future miss hobson i should be glad if when you wish to throw anything at the cat you would not select a missile from the property box good heavens he cried stung by the way fate was maltreating him i have never experienced anything like this before i have been producing plays all my life and this is the first time this has happened i have produced nazimova nazimova never threw paperknives at cats  well i hate cats said miss hobson as though that settled it  i murmured miss winch love little pussy her fur is so warm and if i dont hurt her shell do me no  oh my heavens shouted gerald foster bounding from his seat and for the first time taking a share in the debate are we going to spend the whole day arguing about cats and paperknives for goodness sake clear the stage and stop wasting time  miss hobson chose to regard this intervention as an affront  dont shout at me mr foster  i wasnt shouting at you  if you have anything to say to me lower your voice  he cant observed miss winch hes a tenor  nazimova never began mr bunbury  miss hobson was not to be diverted from her theme by reminiscences of nazimova she had not finished dealing with gerald  in the shows ive been in she said mordantly the author wasnt allowed to go about the place getting fresh with the leading lady in the shows ive been in the author sat at the back and spoke when he was spoken to in the shows ive been in  sally was tingling all over this reminded her of the dogfight on the roville sands she wanted to be in it and only the recognition that it was a private fight and that she would be intruding kept her silent the lure of the fray however was too strong for her wholly to resist it almost unconsciously she had risen from her place and drifted down the aisle so as to be nearer the whitehot centre of things she was now standing in the lighted space by the orchestrapit and her presence attracted the roving attention of miss hobson who having concluded her remarks on authors and their legitimate sphere of activity was looking about for some other object of attack  who the devil inquired miss hobson is that  sally found herself an object of universal scrutiny and wished that she had remained in the obscurity of the back rows  i am mr nicholas sister was the best method of identification that she could find  whos mr nicholas  fillmore timidly admitted that he was mr nicholas he did it in the manner of one in the dock pleading guilty to a major charge and at least half of those present seemed surprised to them till now fillmore had been a nameless thing answering to the shout of hi  miss hobson received the information with a laugh of such exceeding bitterness that strong men blanched and mr cracknell started so convulsively that he nearly jerked his collar off its stud  now sweetie urged mr cracknell  miss hobson said that mr cracknell gave her a pain in the gizzard she recommended his fading away and he did sointo his collar he seemed to feel that once well inside his collar he was home and safe from attack  im through announced miss hobson it appeared that sallys presence had in some mysterious fashion fulfilled the function of the last straw this is the bygoddest show i was ever in i can stand for a whole lot but when it comes to the assistant stage manager being allowed to fill the theatre with his sisters and his cousins and his aunts its time to quit  but sweetie pleaded mr cracknell coming to the surface  oh go and choke yourself said miss hobson crisply and swinging round like a blue panther she strode off a door banged and the sound of it seemed to restore mr cracknells power of movement he too shot up stage and disappeared  hello sally said elsa doland looking up from her magazine the battle raging all round her had failed to disturb her detachment when did you get back  sally trotted up the steps which had been propped against the stage to form a bridge over the orchestra pit  hello elsa  the late debaters had split into groups mr bunbury and gerald were pacing up and down the central aisle talking earnestly fillmore had subsided into a chair  do you know gladys winch asked elsa  sally shook hands with the placid lodestar of her brothers affections miss winch on closer inspection proved to have deep grey eyes and freckles sallys liking for her increased  thank you for saving fillmore from the wolves she said they would have torn him in pieces but for you  oh i dont know said miss winch  it was noble  oh well  i think said sally ill go and have a talk with fillmore he looks as though he wanted consoling  she made her way to that picturesque ruin    4    fillmore had the air of a man who thought it wasnt loaded a wild startled expression had settled itself upon his face and he was breathing heavily  cheer up said sally fillmore jumped like a stricken jelly tell me all said sally sitting down beside him i leave you a gentleman of large and independent means and i come back and find you one of the wageslaves again how did it all happen  sally said fillmore i will be frank with you can you lend me ten dollars  i dont see how you make that out an answer to my question but here you are  thanks fillmore pocketed the bill ill let you have it back next week i want to take miss winch out to lunch  if thats what you want it for dont look on it as a loan take it as a gift with my blessing thrown in she looked over her shoulder at miss winch who the cares of rehearsal being temporarily suspended was practising golfshots with an umbrella at the other side of the stage however did you have the sense to fall in love with her fill  do you like her asked fillmore brightening  i love her  i knew you would shes just the right girl for me isnt she  she certainly is  so sympathetic  yes  so kind  yes  and shes got brains enough for two which is the exact quantity the girl who marries you will need  fillmore drew himself up with as much hauteur as a stout man sitting in a low chair can achieve  some day i will make you believe in me sally  less of the merchant prince my lad said sally firmly you just confine yourself to explaining how you got this way instead of taking up my valuable time telling me what you mean to do in the future youve lost all your money  i have suffered certain reverses said fillmore with dignity which have left me temporarily yes every bean he concluded simply  how  well fillmore hesitated ive had bad luck you know first i bought consolidated rails for the rise and they fell so that went wrong  yes  and then i bought russian roubles for the fall and they rose so that went wrong  good gracious why ive heard all this before  who told you  no i remember now its just that you remind me of a man i met at roville he was telling me the story of his life and how he had made a hash of everything well that took all you had i suppose  not quite i had a few thousand left and i went into a deal that really did look castiron  and that went wrong  it wasnt my fault said fillmore querulously it was just my poisonous luck a man i knew got me to join a syndicate which had bought up a lot of whisky the idea was to ship it into chicago in herringbarrels we should have cleaned up big only a mutt of a detective took it into his darned head to go fooling about with a crowbar officious ass it wasnt as if the barrels werent labelled herrings as plainly as they could be said fillmore with honest indignation he shuddered i nearly got arrested  but that went wrong well thats something to be thankful for stripes wouldnt suit your figure sally gave his arm a squeeze she was very fond of fillmore though for the good of his soul she generally concealed her affection beneath a manner which he had once compared not without some reason to that of a governess who had afflicted their mutual childhood never mind you poor illused martyr things are sure to come right we shall see you a millionaire some day and oh heavens brother fillmore what a bore youll be when you are i can just see you being interviewed and giving hints to young men on how to make good mr nicholas attributes his success to sheer hard work he can lay his hand on his bulging waistcoat and say that he has never once indulged in those rash getrichquick speculations where you buy for the rise and watch things fall and then rush out and buy for the fall and watch em rise fill ill tell you what ill do they all say its the first bit of money that counts in building a vast fortune ill lend you some of mine  you will sally i always said you were an ace  i never heard you you oughtnt to mumble so  will you lend me twenty thousand dollars  sally patted his hand soothingly  come slowly down to earth she said two hundred was the sum i had in mind  i want twenty thousand  youd better rob a bank any policeman will direct you to a good bank  ill tell you why i want twenty thousand  you might just mention it  if i had twenty thousand id buy this production from cracknell hell be back in a few minutes to tell us that the hobson woman has quit and if she really has you take it from me that he will close the show and even if he manages to jolly her along this time and she comes back its going to happen sooner or later its a shame to let a show like this close i believe in it sally its a darn good play with elsa doland in the big part it couldnt fail  sally started her money was too recent for her to have grown fully accustomed to it and she had never realized that she was in a position to wave a wand and make things happen on any big scale the financing of a theatrical production had always been to her something mysterious and out of the reach of ordinary persons like herself fillmore that spacious thinker had brought it into the sphere of the possible  hed sell for less than that of course but one would need a bit in hand you have to face a loss on the road before coming into new york id give you ten per cent on your money sally  sally found herself wavering the prudent side of her nature which hitherto had steered her safely through most of lifes rapids seemed oddly dormant subconsciously she was aware that on past performances fillmore was decidedly not the man to be allowed control of anybodys little fortune but somehow the thought did not seem to grip her he had touched her imagination  its a goldmine  sallys prudent side stirred in its sleep fillmore had chosen an unfortunate expression to the novice in finance the word goldmine had repellent associations if there was one thing in which sally had proposed not to invest her legacy it was a goldmine what she had had in view as a matter of fact had been one of those little fancy shops which are called ye blue bird or ye corner shoppe or something like that where you sell exotic bricabrac to the wealthy at extortionate prices she knew two girls who were doing splendidly in that line as fillmore spoke those words ye corner shoppe suddenly looked very good to her  at this moment however two things happened gerald and mr bunbury in the course of their perambulations came into the glow of the footlights and she was able to see geralds face and at the same time mr reginald cracknell hurried on to the stage his whole demeanour that of the bearer of evil tidings  the sight of geralds face annihilated sallys prudence at a single stroke ye corner shoppe which a moment before had been shining brightly before her mental eye flickered and melted out the whole issue became clear and simple gerald was miserable and she had it in her power to make him happy he was sullenly awaiting disaster and she with a word could avert it she wondered that she had ever hesitated  all right she said simply  fillmore quivered from head to foot a powerful electric shock could not have produced a stronger convulsion he knew sally of old as cautious and clearheaded by no means to be stampeded by a brothers eloquence and he had never looked on this thing as anything better than a hundred to one shot  youll do it he whispered and held his breath after all he might not have heard correctly  yes  all the complex emotion in fillmores soul found expression in one vast whoop it rang through the empty theatre like the last trump beating against the back wall and rising in hollow echoes to the very gallery mr bunbury conversing in low undertones with mr cracknell across the footlights shied like a startled mule there was reproach and menace in the look he cast at fillmore and a minute earlier it would have reduced that financial magnate to apologetic pulp but fillmore was not to be intimidated now by a look he strode down to the group at the footlights  cracknell he said importantly one moment i should like a word with you     chapter vii some meditations on success    if actors and actresses are like children in that they are readily depressed by disaster they have the childs compensating gift of being easily uplifted by good fortune it amazed sally that any one mortal should have been able to spread such universal happiness as she had done by the simple act of lending her brother fillmore twenty thousand dollars if the millennium had arrived the members of the primrose way company could not have been on better terms with themselves the lethargy and dispiritedness caused by their week of inaction fell from them like a cloak the sudden elevation of that creature of the abyss the assistant stage manager to the dizzy height of proprietor of the show appealed to their sense of drama most of them had played in pieces where much the same thing had happened to the persecuted heroine round about eleven oclock and the situation struck them as theatrically sound also now that she had gone the extent to which miss hobson had acted as a blight was universally recognized  a spirit of optimism reigned and cheerful rumours became current the bowlerhatted teddy had it straight from the liftboy at his hotel that the ban on the theatres was to be lifted on tuesday at the latest while no less an authority than the cigarstand girl at the pontchatrain had informed the man who played the butler that toledo and cleveland were opening tomorrow it was generally felt that the sun was bursting through the clouds and that fate would soon despair of the hopeless task of trying to keep good men down  fillmore was himself again we all have our particular mode of selfexpression in moments of elation fillmores took the shape of buying a new waistcoat and a hundred halfdollar cigars and being very fussy about what he had for lunch it may have been an optical illusion but he appeared to sally to put on at least six pounds in weight on the first day of the new regime as a serf looking after paperknives and other properties he had beenfor himalmost slim as a manager he blossomed out into soft billowy curves and when he stood on the sidewalk in front of the theatre gloating over the new posters which bore the legend       fillmore nicholas       presents   the populace had to make a detour to get round him  in this era of bubbling joy it was hard that sally the fairy godmother responsible for it all should not have been completely happy too and it puzzled her why she was not but whatever it was that cast the faint shadow refused obstinately to come out from the back of her mind and show itself and be challenged it was not till she was out driving in a hired car with gerald one afternoon on belle isle that enlightenment came  gerald since the departure of miss hobson had been at his best like fillmore he was a man who responded to the sunshine of prosperity his moodiness had vanished and all his old charm had returned and yet it seemed to sally as the car slid smoothly through the pleasant woods and fields by the river that there was something that jarred  gerald was cheerful and talkative he at any rate found nothing wrong with life he held forth spaciously on the big things he intended to do  if this play get overand its going toill show em his jaw was squared and his eyes glowed as they stared into the inviting future one successthats all i needthen watch me i havent had a chance yet but  his voice rolled on but sally had ceased to listen it was the time of year when the chill of evening follows swiftly on the mellow warmth of afternoon the sun had gone behind the trees and a cold wind was blowing up from the river and quite suddenly as though it was the wind that had cleared her mind she understood what it was that had been lurking at the back of her thoughts for an instant it stood out nakedly without concealment and the world became a forlorn place she had realized the fundamental difference between mans outlook on life and womans  success how men worshipped it and how little of themselves they had to spare for anything else ironically it was the theme of this very play of geralds which she had saved from destruction of all the men she knew how many had any view of life except as a race which they must strain every nerve to win regardless of what they missed by the wayside in their haste fillmoregeraldall of them there might be a woman in each of their lives but she came secondan afterthoughta thing for their spare time gerald was everything to her his success would never be more than a sideissue as far as she was concerned he himself without any of the trappings of success was enough for her but she was not enough for him a spasm of futile jealousy shook her she shivered  cold said gerald ill tell the man to drive back i dont see any reason why this play shouldnt run a year in new york everybody says its good if it does get over theyll all be after me i  sally stared out into a bleak world the sky was a leaden grey and the wind from the river blew with a dismal chill     chapter viii reappearance of mr carmyleand ginger    1    when sally left detroit on the following saturday accompanied by fillmore who was returning to the metropolis for a few days in order to secure offices and generally make his presence felt along broadway her spirits had completely recovered she felt guiltily that she had been fanciful even morbid naturally men wanted to get on in the world it was their job she told herself that she was bound up with geralds success and that the last thing of which she ought to complain was the energy he put into efforts of which she as well as he would reap the reward  to this happier frame of mind the excitement of the last few days had contributed detroit that city of amiable audiences had liked the primrose way the theatre in fulfilment of teddys prophecy had been allowed to open on the tuesday and a full house hungry for entertainment after its enforced abstinence had welcomed the play wholeheartedly the papers not always in agreement with the applause of a firstnight audience had on this occasion endorsed the verdict with agreeable unanimity hailing gerald as the coming author and elsa doland as the coming star there had even been a brief mention of fillmore as the coming manager but there is always some trifle that jars in our greatest moments and fillmores triumph had been almost spoilt by the fact that the only notice taken of gladys winch was by the critic who printed her namespelt wunchin the list of those whom the cast also included  one of the greatest character actresses on the stage said fillmore bitterly talking over this outrage with sally on the morning after the production  from this blow however his buoyant nature had soon enabled him to rally life contained so much that was bright that it would have been churlish to concentrate the attention on the one dark spot business had been excellent all through the week elsa doland had got better at every performance the receipt of a long and agitated telegram from mr cracknell pleading to be allowed to buy the piece back the passage of time having apparently softened miss hobson was a pleasant incident and best of all the great ike schumann who owned half the theatres in new york and had been in detroit superintending one of his musical productions had looked in one evening and stamped the primrose way with the seal of his approval as fillmore sat opposite sally on the train he radiated contentment and importance  yes do said sally breaking a long silence  fillmore awoke from happy dreams  eh  i said yes do i think you owe it to your position  do what  buy a fur coat wasnt that what you were meditating about  dont be a chump said fillmore blushing nevertheless it was true that once or twice during the past week he had toyed negligently as mr bunbury would have said with the notion and why not a fellow must keep warm  with an astrakhan collar insisted sally  as a matter of fact said fillmore loftily his great soul illattuned to this badinage what i was really thinking about at the moment was something ike said  ike  ike schumann hes on the train i met him just now  we call him ike  of course i call him ike said fillmore heatedly everyone calls him ike  he wears a fur coat sally murmured  fillmore registered annoyance  i wish you wouldnt keep on harping on that damned coat and anyway why shouldnt i have a fur coat  fill how can you be so brutal as to suggest that i ever said you shouldnt why im one of the strongest supporters of the fur coat with big cuffs and you must roll up fifth avenue in your car and ill point and say thats my brother your brother no he is really youre joking why thats the great fillmore nicholas i know but he really is my brother and i was with him when he bought that coat  do leave off about the coat  and it isnt only the coat i shall say its whats underneath tucked away inside that mass of fur dodging about behind that dollar cigar is one to whom we point with pride   fillmore looked coldly at his watch  ive got to go and see ike schumann  we are in hourly consultation with ike  he wants to see me about the show he suggests putting it into chicago before opening in new york  oh no cried sally dismayed  why not  sally recovered herself identifying gerald so closely with his play she had supposed for a moment that if the piece opened in chicago it would mean a further prolonged separation from him but of course there would be no need she realized for him to stay with the company after the first day or two  youre thinking that we ought to have a new york reputation before tackling chicago theres a lot to be said for that still it works both ways a chicago run would help us in new york well ill have to think it over said fillmore importantly ill have to think it over  he mused with drawn brows  all wrong said sally  eh  not a bit like it the lips should be compressed and the forefinger of the right hand laid in a careworn way against the right temple youve a lot to learn fill  oh stop it  fillmore nicholas said sally if you knew what pain it gives me to josh my only brother youd be sorry for me but you know its for your good now run along and put ike out of his misery i know hes waiting for you with his watch out you do think hell come miss nicholas were his last words to me as he stepped on the train and oh fill the yearning in his voice why of course he will mr schumann i said for all his exalted position my brother is kindliness itself of course hell come if i could only think so he said with a gulp if i could only think so but you know what these managers are a thousand calls on their time they get brooding on their fur coats and forget everything else have no fear mr schumann i said fillmore nicholas is a man of his word  she would have been willing for she was a girl who never believed in sparing herself where it was a question of entertaining her nearest and dearest to continue the dialogue but fillmore was already moving down the car his rigid back a silent protest against sisterly levity sally watched him disappear then picked up a magazine and began to read  she had just finished tracking a story of gripping interest through a jungle of advertisements only to find that it was in two parts of which the one she was reading was the first when a voice spoke  how do you do miss nicholas  into the seat before her recently released from the weight of the coming manager bruce carmyle of all people in the world insinuated himself with that wellbred air of deferential restraint which never left him    2    sally was considerably startled everybody travels nowadays of course and there is nothing really remarkable in finding a man in america whom you had supposed to be in europe but nevertheless she was conscious of a dreamlike sensation as though the clock had been turned back and a chapter of her life reopened which she had thought closed for ever  mr carmyle she cried  if sally had been constantly in bruce carmyles thoughts since they had parted on the paris express mr carmyle had been very little in sallysso little indeed that she had had to search her memory for a moment before she identified him  were always meeting on trains arent we she went on her composure returning i never expected to see you in america  i came over  sally was tempted to reply that she gathered that but a sudden embarrassment curbed her tongue she had just remembered that at their last meeting she had been abominably rude to this man she was never rude to anyone without subsequent remorse she contented herself with a tame yes  yes said mr carmyle it is a good many years since i have taken a real holiday my doctor seemed to think i was a trifle run down it seemed a good opportunity to visit america everybody said mr carmyle oracularly endeavouring as he had often done since his ship had left england to persuade himself that his object in making the trip had not been merely to renew his acquaintance with sally everybody ought to visit america at least once it is part of ones education  and what are your impressions of our glorious country said sally rallying  mr carmyle seemed glad of the opportunity of lecturing on an impersonal subject he too though his face had shown no trace of it had been embarrassed in the opening stages of the conversation the sound of his voice restored him  i have been visiting chicago he said after a brief travelogue  oh  a wonderful city  ive never seen it ive come from detroit  yes i heard you were in detroit  sallys eyes opened  you heard i was in detroit good gracious how  iahcalled at your new york address and made inquiries said mr carmyle a little awkwardly  but how did you know where i lived  my cousinerlancelot told me  sally was silent for a moment she had much the same feeling that comes to the man in the detective story who realizes that he is being shadowed even if this almost complete stranger had not actually come to america in direct pursuit of her there was no disguising the fact that he evidently found her an object of considerable interest it was a compliment but sally was not at all sure that she liked it bruce carmyle meant nothing to her and it was rather disturbing to find that she was apparently of great importance to him she seized on the mention of ginger as a lever for diverting the conversation from its present too intimate course  how is mr kemp she asked  mr carmyles dark face seemed to become a trifle darker  we have had no news of him he said shortly  no news how do you mean you speak as though he had disappeared  he has disappeared  good heavens when  shortly after i saw you last  disappeared  mr carmyle frowned sally watching him found her antipathy stirring again there was something about this man which she had disliked instinctively from the first a sort of hardness  but where has he gone to  i dont know mr carmyle frowned again the subject of ginger was plainly a sore one and i dont want to know he went on heatedly a dull flush rising in the cheeks which sally was sure he had to shave twice a day i dont care to know the family have washed their hands of him for the future he may look after himself as best he can i believe he is off his head  sallys rebellious temper was well ablaze now but she fought it down she would dearly have loved to give battle to mr carmyleit was odd she felt how she seemed to have constituted herself gingers champion and protectorbut she perceived that if she wished as she did to hear more of her redheaded friend he must be humoured and conciliated  but what happened what was all the trouble about  mr carmyles eyebrows met  heinsulted his uncle his uncle donald he insulted himgrossly the one man in the world he should have made a point ofer  keeping in with  yes his future depended upon him  but what did he do cried sally trying hard to keep a thoroughly reprehensible joy out of her voice  i have heard no details my uncle is reticent as to what actually took place he invited lancelot to dinner to discuss his plans and it appears that lancelotdefied him defied him he was rude and insulting my uncle refuses to have anything more to do with him apparently the young fool managed to win some money at the tables at roville and this seems to have turned his head completely my uncle insists that he is mad i agree with him since the night of that dinner nothing has been heard of lancelot  mr carmyle broke off to brood once more and before sally could speak the impressive bulk of fillmore loomed up in the aisle beside them explanations seemed to fillmore to be in order he cast a questioning glance at the mysterious stranger who in addition to being in conversation with his sister had collared his seat  oh hullo fill said sally fillmore this is mr carmyle we met abroad my brother fillmore mr carmyle  proper introduction having been thus effected fillmore approved of mr carmyle his air of being someone in particular appealed to him  strange you meeting again like this he said affably  the porter who had been making up berths along the car was now hovering expectantly in the offing  you two had better go into the smoking room suggested sally im going to bed  she wanted to be alone to think mr carmyles tale of a roused and revolting ginger had stirred her  the two men went off to the smokingroom and sally found an empty seat and sat down to wait for her berth to be made up she was aglow with a curious exhilaration so ginger had taken her advice excellent ginger she felt proud of him she also had that feeling of complacency amounting almost to sinful pride which comes to those who give advice and find it acted upon she had the emotions of a creator after all had she not created this new ginger it was she who had stirred him up it was she who had unleashed him she had changed him from a meek dependent of the family to a ravening creature who went about the place insulting uncles  it was a feat there was no denying it it was something attempted something done and by all the rules laid down by the poet it should therefore have earned a nights repose yet sally jolted by the train which towards the small hours seemed to be trying out some new buckandwing steps of its own invention slept ill and presently as she lay awake there came to her bedside the spectre of doubt gaunt and questioning had she after all wrought so well had she been wise in tampering with this young mans life  what about it said the spectre of doubt    3    daylight brought no comforting answer to the question breakfast failed to manufacture an easy mind sally got off the train at the grand central station in a state of remorseful concern she declined the offer of mr carmyle to drive her to the boardinghouse and started to walk there hoping that the crisp morning air would effect a cure  she wondered now how she could ever have looked with approval on her rash act she wondered what demon of interference and meddling had possessed her to make her blunder into peoples lives upsetting them she wondered that she was allowed to go around loose she was nothing more nor less than a menace to society here was an estimable young man obviously the sort of young man who would always have to be assisted through life by his relatives and she had deliberately egged him on to wreck his prospects she blushed hotly as she remembered that mad wireless she had sent him from the boat  miserable ginger she pictured him his little stock of money gone wandering footsore about london seeking in vain for work forcing himself to call on uncle donald being thrown down the front steps by haughty footmen sleeping on the embankment gazing into the dark waters of the thames with the stare of hopelessness climbing to the parapet and  ugh said sally  she had arrived at the door of the boardinghouse and mrs meecher was regarding her with welcoming eyes little knowing that to all practical intents and purposes she had slain in his prime a redheaded young man of amiable manners andwhen not illadvised by meddling muddling femalesof excellent behaviour  mrs meecher was friendly and garrulous variety the journal which next to the dog toto was the thing she loved best in the world had informed her on the friday morning that mr fosters play had got over big in detroit and that miss doland had made every kind of hit it was not often that the old alumni of the boardinghouse forced their way after this fashion into the hall of fame and according to mrs meecher the establishment was ringing with the news that blue ribbon round totos neck was worn in honour of the triumph there was also though you could not see it a chicken dinner in totos interior by way of further celebration  and was it true that mr fillmore had bought the piece a great man was mrs meechers verdict mr faucitt had always said so  oh how is mr faucitt sally asked reproaching herself for having allowed the pressure of other matters to drive all thoughts of her late patient from her mind  hes gone said mrs meecher with such relish that to sally in her morbid condition the words had only one meaning she turned white and clutched at the banisters  gone  to england added mrs meecher sally was vastly relieved  oh i thought you meant  oh no not that mrs meecher sighed for she had been a little disappointed in the old gentleman who started out as such a promising invalid only to fall away into the dullness of robust health once more hes well enough i never seen anybody better youd think said mrs meecher bearing up with difficulty under her grievance youd think this here new spanish influenza was a sort of a tonic or somepn the way he looks now of course she added trying to find justification for a respected lodger hes had good news his brothers dead  what  not i dont mean that that was good news far from it though come to think of it all flesh is as grass and we all got to be prepared for somepn of the sort breaking loosebut it seems this here new brother of hisi didnt know hed a brother and i dont suppose you knew he had a brother men are secretive aint theythis brother of his has left him a parcel of money and mr faucitt he had to get on the wednesday boat quick as he could and go right over to the other side to look after things wind up the estate i believe they call it left in a awful hurry he did sent his love to you and said hed write funny him having a brother now wasnt it not said mrs meecher at heart a reasonable woman that folks dont have brothers i got two myself one in portland oregon and the other goodness knows where he is but what im trying to say  sally disengaged herself and went up to her room for a brief while the excitement which comes of hearing good news about those of whom we are fond acted as a stimulant and she felt almost cheerful dear old mr faucitt she was sorry for his brother of course though she had never had the pleasure of his acquaintance and had only just heard that he had ever existed but it was nice to think that her old friends remaining years would be years of affluence  presently however she found her thoughts wandering back into their melancholy groove she threw herself wearily on the bed she was tired after her bad night  but she could not sleep remorse kept her awake besides she could hear mrs meecher prowling disturbingly about the house apparently in search of someone her progress indicated by creaking boards and the strenuous yapping of toto  sally turned restlessly and having turned remained for a long instant transfixed and rigid she had seen something and what she had seen was enough to surprise any girl in the privacy of her bedroom from underneath the bed there peeped coyly forth an undeniably masculine shoe and six inches of a grey trouserleg  sally bounded to the floor she was a girl of courage and she meant to probe this matter thoroughly  what are you doing under my bed  the question was a reasonable one and evidently seemed to the intruder to deserve an answer there was a muffled sneeze and he began to crawl out  the shoe came first then the legs then a sturdy body in a dusty coat and finally there flashed on sallys fascinated gaze a head of so nearly the maximum redness that it could only belong to one person in the world  ginger  mr lancelot kemp on all fours blinked up at her  oh hullo he said     chapter ix ginger becomes a righthand man    it was not till she saw him actually standing there before her with his hair rumpled and a large smut on the tip of his nose that sally really understood how profoundly troubled she had been about this young man and how vivid had been that vision of him bobbing about on the waters of the thames a cold and unappreciated corpse she was a girl of keen imagination and she had allowed her imagination to riot unchecked astonishment therefore at the extraordinary fact of his being there was for the moment thrust aside by relief never before in her life had she experienced such an overwhelming rush of exhilaration she flung herself into a chair and burst into a screech of laughter which even to her own ears sounded strange it struck ginger as hysterical  i say you know said ginger as the merriment showed no signs of abating ginger was concerned nasty shock for a girl finding blighters under her bed  sally sat up gurgling and wiped her eyes  oh i am glad to see you she gasped  no really said ginger gratified thats fine it occurred to him that some sort of apology would be a graceful act i say you know awfully sorry about barging in here i mean never dreamed it was your room unoccupied i thought  dont mention it i ought not to have disturbed you you were having a nice sleep of course do you always sleep on the floor  it was like this  of course if youre wearing it for ornament as a sort of beautyspot said sally all right but in case you dont know youve a smut on your nose  oh my aunt not really  now would i deceive you on an important point like that  do you mind if i have a look in the glass  certainly if you can stand it  ginger moved hurriedly to the dressingtable  youre perfectly right he announced applying his handkerchief  i thought i was im very quick at noticing things  my hairs a bit rumpled too  very much so  you take my tip said ginger earnestly and never lie about under beds theres nothing in it  that reminds me you wont be offended if i asked you something  no no go ahead  its rather an impertinent question you may resent it  no no  well then what were you doing under my bed  oh under your bed  yes under my bed this its a bed you know mine my bed you were under it why or putting it another way why were you under my bed  i was hiding  playing hideandseek that explains it  mrs whatshernamebeechermeecherwas after me  sally shook her head disapprovingly  you mustnt encourage mrs meecher in these childish pastimes it unsettles her  ginger passed an agitated hand over his forehead  its like this  i hate to keep criticizing your appearance said sally and personally i like it but when you clutched your brow just then you put about a pound of dust on it your hands are probably grubby  ginger inspected them  they are  why not make a really good job of it and have a wash  do you mind  id prefer it  thanks awfully i mean to say its your basin you know and all that what i mean is seem to be making myself pretty well at home  oh no  touching the matter of soap  use mine we americans are famous for our hospitality  thanks awfully  the towel is on your right  thanks awfully  and ive a clothes brush in my bag  thanks awfully  splashing followed like a sealion taking a dip now then said sally why were you hiding from mrs meecher  a careworn almost hunted look came into gingers face i say you know that woman is rather by way of being one of the lads what scares me word was brought that she was on the prowl so it seemed to me a judicious move to take cover till she sort of blew over if shed found me shed have made me take that dog of hers for a walk  toto  toto you know said ginger with a strong sense of injury no dogs got a right to be a dog like that i dont suppose theres anyone keener on dogs than i am but a thing like a woolly rat he shuddered slightly well one hates to be seen about with it in the public streets  why couldnt you have refused in a firm but gentlemanly manner to take toto out  ah there you rather touch the spot you see the fact of the matter is im a bit behind with the rent and that makes it rather hard to take what you might call a firm stand  but how can you be behind with the rent i only left here the saturday before last and you werent in the place then you cant have been here more than a week  ive been here just a week thats the week im behind with  but why you were a millionaire when i left you at roville  well the fact of the matter is i went back to the tables that night and lost a goodish bit of what id won and somehow or another when i got to america the stuff seemed to slip away  what made you come to america at all said sally asking the question which she felt any sensible person would have asked at the opening of the conversation  one of his familiar blushes raced over gingers face oh i thought i would land of opportunity you know  have you managed to find any of the opportunities yet  well i have got a job of sorts im a waiter at a rummy little place on second avenue the salary isnt big but id have wangled enough out of it to pay last weeks rent only they docked me a goodish bit for breaking plates and what not the fact is im making rather a hash of it  oh ginger you oughtnt to be a waiter  thats what the boss seems to think  i mean you ought to be doing something ever so much better  but what youve no notion how well all these blighters here seem to be able to get along without my help ive tramped all over the place offering my services but they all say theyll try to carry on as they are  sally reflected  i know  what  ill make fillmore give you a job i wonder i didnt think of it before  fillmore  my brother yes hell be able to use you  what as  sally considered  as aas aoh as his righthand man  does he want a righthand man  sure to hes a young fellow trying to get along sure to want a righthand man  m yes said ginger reflectively of course ive never been a righthand man you know  oh youd pick it up ill take you round to him now hes staying at the astor  theres just one thing said ginger  whats that  i might make a hash of it  heavens ginger there must be something in this world that you wouldnt make a hash of dont stand arguing any longer are you dry and clean very well then lets be off  right ho  ginger took a step towards the door then paused rigid with one leg in the air as though some spell had been cast upon him from the passage outside there had sounded a shrill yapping ginger looked at sally then he lookedlonginglyat the bed  dont be such a coward said sally severely  yes but  how much do you owe mrs meecher  round about twelve dollars i think it is  ill pay her  ginger flushed awkwardly  no im hanged if you will i mean he stammered its frightfully good of you and all that and i cant tell you how grateful i am but honestly i couldnt  sally did not press the point she liked him the better for a rugged independence which in the days of his impecuniousness her brother fillmore had never dreamed of exhibiting  very well she said have it your own way proud thats me all over mabel ginger she broke off sharply pull yourself together where is your manly spirit id be ashamed to be such a coward  awfully sorry but honestly that woolly dog  never mind the dog ill see you through  they came out into the passage almost on top of toto who was stalking phantom rats mrs meecher was manoeuvring in the background her face lit up grimly at the sight of ginger  mister kemp i been looking for you  sally intervened brightly  oh mrs meecher she said shepherding her young charge through the danger zone i was so surprised to meet mr kemp here he is a great friend of mine we met in france were going off now to have a long talk about old times and then im taking him to see my brother  toto  dear little thing you ought to take him for a walk said sally its a lovely day mr kemp was saying just now that he would have liked to take him but were rather in a hurry and shall probably have to get into a taxi youve no idea how busy my brother is just now if were late hell never forgive us  she passed on down the stairs leaving mrs meecher dissatisfied but irresolute there was something about sally which even in her prewealthy days had always baffled mrs meecher and cramped her style and now that she was rich and independent she inspired in the chatelaine of the boardinghouse an emotion which was almost awe the front door had closed before mrs meecher had collected her faculties and ginger pausing on the sidewalk drew a long breath  you know youre wonderful he said regarding sally with unconcealed admiration  she accepted the compliment composedly  now well go and hunt up fillmore she said but theres no need to hurry of course really well go for a walk first and then call at the astor and make him give us lunch i want to hear all about you ive heard something already i met your cousin mr carmyle he was on the train coming from detroit did you know that he was in america  no iveerrather lost touch with the family  so i gathered from mr carmyle and i feel hideously responsible it was all through me that all this happened  oh no  of course it was i made you what you are todayi hope im satisfiedi dragged and dragged you down until the soul within you died so to speak i know perfectly well that you wouldnt have dreamed of savaging the family as you seem to have done if it hadnt been for what i said to you at roville ginger tell me what did happen im dying to know mr carmyle said you insulted your uncle  donald yes we did have a bit of a scrap as a matter of fact he made me go out to dinner with him and weersort of disagreed to start with he wanted me to apologize to old scrymgeour and i rather gave it a miss  noble fellow  scrymgeour  no silly you  oh ah ginger blushed and then there was all that about the soup you know  how do you mean all that about the soup what about the soup what soup  well things sort of hotted up a bit when the soup arrived  i dont understand  i mean the trouble seemed to start as it were when the waiter had finished ladling out the mulligatawny thick soup you know  i know mulligatawny is a thick soup yes  well my old uncleim not blaming him dont you knowmore his misfortune than his faulti can see that nowbut hes got a heavy moustache like a walrus rather and hes a bit apt to inhale the stuff through it and iwell i asked him not to it was just a suggestion you know he cut up fairly rough and by the time the fish came round we were more or less down on the mat chewing holes in one another my fault probably i wasnt feeling particularly welldisposed towards the family that night id just had a talk with brucemy cousin you knowin piccadilly and that had rather got the wind up me bruce always seems to get on my nerves a bit somehow anduncle donald asking me to dinner and all that by the way did you get the books  what books  bruce said he wanted to send you some books that was why i gave him your address sally stared  he never sent me any books  well he said he was going to and i had to tell him where to send them  sally walked on a little thoughtfully she was not a vain girl but it was impossible not to perceive in the light of this fresh evidence that mr carmyle had made a journey of three thousand miles with the sole object of renewing his acquaintance with her it did not matter of course but it was vaguely disturbing no girl cares to be dogged by a man she rather dislikes  go on telling me about your uncle she said  well theres not much more to tell id happened to get that wireless of yours just before i started out to dinner with him and i was more or less feeling that i wasnt going to stand any rot from the family id got to the fish course hadnt i well we managed to get through that somehow but we didnt survive the fillet steak one thing seemed to lead to another and the show sort of bust up he called me a good many things and i got a bit fedup and finally i told him i hadnt any more use for the family and was going to start out on my own andwell i did dont you know and here i am  sally listened to this saga breathlessly more than ever did she feel responsible for her young protégé and any faint qualms which she had entertained as to the wisdom of transferring practically the whole of her patrimony to the care of so erratic a financier as her brother vanished it was her plain duty to see that ginger was started well in the race of life and fillmore was going to come in uncommonly handy  well go to the astor now she said and ill introduce you to fillmore hes a theatrical manager and hes sure to have something for you  its awfully good of you to bother about me  ginger said sally i regard you as a grandson hail that cab will you     chapter x sally in the shadows    1    it seemed to sally in the weeks that followed her reunion with ginger kemp that a sort of golden age had set in on all the frontiers of her little kingdom there was peace and prosperity and she woke each morning in a world so neatly smoothed and ironed out that the most captious pessimist could hardly have found anything in it to criticize  true gerald was still a thousand miles away going to chicago to superintend the opening of the primrose way for fillmore had acceded to his friend ikes suggestion in the matter of producing it first in chicago and he had been called in by a distracted manager to revise the work of a brother dramatist whose comedy was in difficulties at one of the theatres in that city and this meant he would have to remain on the spot for some time to come it was disappointing for sally had been looking forward to having him back in new york in a few days but she refused to allow herself to be depressed life as a whole was much too satisfactory for that life indeed in every other respect seemed perfect fillmore was going strong ginger was off her conscience she had found an apartment her new hat suited her and the primrose way was a tremendous success chicago it appeared from fillmores account was paying little attention to anything except the primrose way national problems had ceased to interest the citizens local problems left them cold their minds were riveted to the exclusion of all else on the problem of how to secure seats the production of the piece according to fillmore had been the most terrific experience that had come to stir chicago since the great fire  of all these satisfactory happenings the most satisfactory to sallys thinking was the fact that the problem of gingers future had been solved ginger had entered the service of the fillmore nicholas theatrical enterprises ltd managing director fillmore nicholasfillmore would have made the title longer only that was all that would go on the brass plateand was to be found daily in the outer office his duties consisting mainly it seemed in reading the evening papers what exactly he was even ginger hardly knew sometimes he felt like the man at the wheel sometimes like a glorified office boy and not so very glorified at that for the most part he had to prevent the mob rushing and getting at fillmore who sat in semiregal state in the inner office pondering great schemes  but though there might be an occasional passing uncertainty in gingers mind as to just what he was supposed to be doing in exchange for the fifty dollars he drew every friday there was nothing uncertain about his gratitude to sally for having pulled the strings and enabled him to do it he tried to thank her every time they met and nowadays they were meeting frequently for ginger was helping her to furnish her new apartment in this task he spared no efforts he said that it kept him in condition  and what i mean to say is said ginger pausing in the act of carrying a massive easy chair to the third spot which sally had selected in the last ten minutes if i didnt sweat about a bit and help you after the way you got me that job  ginger desist said sally  yes but honestly  if you dont stop it ill make you move that chair into the next room  shall i ginger rubbed his blistered hands and took a new grip anything you say  silly of course not the only other rooms are my bedroom the bathroom and the kitchen what on earth would i want a great lumbering chair in them for all the same i believe the first we chose was the best  back she goes then what  sally reflected frowningly this business of setting up house was causing her much thought  no she decided by the window is better she looked at him remorsefully im giving you a lot of trouble  trouble ginger accompanied by a chair staggered across the room the way i look at it is this he wiped a bead of perspiration from his freckled forehead you got me that job and  stop  right ho still you did you know  sally sat down in the armchair and stretched herself watching ginger work had given her a vicarious fatigue she surveyed the room proudly it was certainly beginning to look cosy the pictures were up the carpet down the furniture very neatly in order for almost the first time in her life she had the restful sensation of being at home she had always longed during the past three years of boardinghouse existence for a settled abode a place where she could lock the door on herself and be alone the apartment was small but it was undeniably a haven she looked about her and could see no flaw in it except she had a sudden sense of something missing  hullo she said wheres that photograph of me im sure i put it on the mantelpiece yesterday  his exertions seemed to have brought the blood to gingers face he was a rich red he inspected the mantelpiece narrowly  no no photograph here  i know there isnt but it was there yesterday or was it i know i meant to put it there perhaps i forgot its the most beautiful thing you ever saw not a bit like me but what of that they touch em up in the darkroom you know i value it because it looks the way i should like to look if i could  ive never had a beautiful photograph taken of myself said ginger solemnly with gentle regret  cheer up  oh i dont mind i only mentioned  ginger said sally pardon my interrupting your remarks which i know are valuable but this chair isnotright it ought to be where it was at the beginning could you give your imitation of a packmule just once more and after that ill make you some tea if theres any teaor milkor cups  there are cups all right i know because i smashed two the day before yesterday ill nip round the corner for some milk shall i  yes please nip all this hard work has taken it out of me terribly  over the teatable sally became inquisitive  what i cant understand about this job of yours gingerwhich as you are just about to observe i was noble enough to secure for youis the amount of leisure that seems to go with it how is it that you are able to spend your valuable timefillmores valuable time ratherjuggling with my furniture every day  oh i can usually get off  but oughtnt you to be at your post doingwhatever it is you do what do you do  ginger stirred his tea thoughtfully and gave his mind to the question  well i sort of mess about you know he pondered i interview divers blighters and tell em your brother is out and take their names and addresses and oh all that sort of thing  does fillmore consult you much  he lets me read some of the plays that are sent in awful tosh most of them sometimes he sends me off to a vaudeville house of an evening  as a treat  to see some special act you know to report on it in case he might want to use it for this revue of his  which revue  didnt you know he was going to put on a revue oh rather a whacking big affair going to cut out the follies and all that sort of thing  butmy goodness sally was alarmed it was just like fillmore she felt to go branching out into these expensive schemes when he ought to be moving warily and trying to consolidate the small success he had had all his life he had thought in millions where the prudent man would have been content with hundreds an inexhaustible fount of optimism bubbled eternally within him thats rather ambitious she said  yes ambitious sort of cove your brother quite the napoleon  i shall have to talk to him said sally decidedly she was annoyed with fillmore everything had been going so beautifully with everybody peaceful and happy and prosperous and no anxiety anywhere till he had spoiled things now she would have to start worrying again  of course argued ginger theres money in revues over in london fellows make pots out of them  sally shook her head  it wont do she said and ill tell you another thing that wont do this armchair of course it ought to be over by the window you can see that yourself cant you  absolutely said ginger patiently preparing for action once more    2    sallys anxiety with regard to her ebullient brother was not lessened by the receipt shortly afterwards of a telegram from miss winch in chicago  have you been feeding fillmore meat  the telegram ran and while sally could not have claimed that she completely understood it there was a sinister suggestion about the message which decided her to wait no longer before making investigations she tore herself away from the joys of furnishing and went round to the headquarters of the fillmore nicholas theatrical enterprises ltd managing director fillmore nicholas without delay  ginger she discovered on arrival was absent from his customary post his place in the outer office being taken by a lad of tender years and pimply exterior who thawed and cast off a proud reserve on hearing sallys name and told her to walk right in sally walked right in and found fillmore with his feet on an untidy desk studying what appeared to be costumedesigns  ah sally he said in the distrait tired voice which speaks of vast preoccupations prosperity was still putting in its silent deadly work on the hope of the american theatre what even at as late an epoch as the return from detroit had been merely a smooth fullness around the angle of the jaw was now frankly and without disguise a double chin he was wearing a new waistcoat and it was unbuttoned i am rather busy he went on always glad to see you but i am rather busy i have a hundred things to attend to  well attend to me thatll only make a hundred and one fill whats all this i hear about a revue  fillmore looked as like a small boy caught in the act of stealing jam as it is possible for a great theatrical manager to look he had been wondering in his darker moments what sally would say about that project when she heard of it and he had hoped that she would not hear of it until all the preparations were so complete that interference would be impossible he was extremely fond of sally but there was he knew a lamentable vein of caution in her makeup which might lead her to criticize and how can your man of affairs carry on if women are buzzing round criticizing all the time he picked up a pen and put it down buttoned his waistcoat and unbuttoned it and scratched his ear with one of the costumedesigns  oh yes the revue  its no good saying oh yes you know perfectly well its a crazy idea  really these business matters this interference  i dont want to run your affairs for you fill but that money of mine does make me a sort of partner i suppose and i think i have a right to raise a loud yell of agony when i see you risking it on a  pardon me said fillmore loftily looking happier let me explain women never understand business matters your money is tied up exclusively in the primrose way which as you know is a tremendous success you have nothing whatever to worry about as regards any new production i may make  im not worrying about the money im worrying about you  a tolerant smile played about the lower slopes of fillmores face  dont be alarmed about me im all right  you arent all right youve no business when youve only just got started as a manager to be rushing into an enormous production like this you cant afford it  my dear child as i said before women cannot understand these things a man in my position can always command money for a new venture  do you mean to say you have found somebody silly enough to put up money  certainly i dont know that there is any secret about it your friend mr carmyle has taken an interest in some of my forthcoming productions  what sally had been disturbed before but she was aghast now  this was something she had never anticipated bruce carmyle seemed to be creeping into her life like an advancing tide there appeared to be no eluding him wherever she turned there he was and she could do nothing but rage impotently the situation was becoming impossible  fillmore misinterpreted the note of dismay in her voice  its quite all right he assured her hes a very rich man large private means besides his big income even if anything goes wrong  it isnt that its  the hopelessness of explaining to fillmore stopped sally and while she was chafing at this new complication which had come to upset the orderly routine of her life there was an outburst of voices in the other office gingers understudy seemed to be endeavouring to convince somebody that the big chief was engaged and not to be intruded upon in this he was unsuccessful for the door opened tempestuously and miss winch sailed in  fillmore you poor nut said miss winch for though she might wrap up her meaning somewhat obscurely in her telegraphic communications when it came to the spoken word she was directness itself stop picking straws in your hair and listen to me youre dippy  the last time sally had seen fillmores fiancée she had been impressed by her imperturbable calm miss winch in detroit had seemed a girl whom nothing could ruffle that she had lapsed now from this serene placidity struck sally as ominous slightly though she knew her she felt that it could be no ordinary happening that had so animated her sisterinlawtobe  ah here you are said fillmore he had started to his feet indignantly at the opening of the door like a lion bearded in its den but calm had returned when he saw who the intruder was  yes here i am miss winch dropped despairingly into a swivelchair and endeavoured to restore herself with a stick of chewinggum fillmore darling youre the sweetest thing on earth and i love you but on present form you could just walk straight into bloomingdale and theyd give you the royal suite  my dear girl  what do you think demanded miss winch turning to sally  ive just been telling him said sally welcoming this ally i think its absurd at this stage of things for him to put on an enormous revue  revue miss winch stopped in the act of gnawing her gum what revue she flung up her arms i shall have to swallow this gum she said you cant chew with your head going round are you putting on a revue too  fillmore was buttoning and unbuttoning his waistcoat he had a hounded look  certainly certainly he replied in a tone of some feverishness i wish you girls would leave me to manage  dippy said miss winch once more telegraphic address teapot matteawan she swivelled round to sally again say listen this boy must be stopped we must form a gang in his best interests and get him put away what do you think he proposes doing ill give you three guesses oh whats the use youd never hit it this poor wandering lad has got it all fixed up to star memein a new show  fillmore removed a hand from his waistcoat buttons and waved it protestingly  i have used my own judgment  yes sir proceeded miss winch riding over the interruption thats what hes planning to spring on an unsuspicious public im sitting peacefully in my room at the hotel in chicago pronging a few cents worth of scrambled eggs and reading the morning paper when the telephone rings gentleman below would like to see me oh ask him to wait business of flinging on a few clothes down in elevator bright sunrise effects in lobby  what on earth do you mean  the gentleman had a head of red hair which had to be seen to be believed explained miss winch lit up the lobby management had switched off all the electrics for sake of economy an englishman he was nice fellow named kemp  oh is ginger in chicago said sally i wondered why he wasnt on his little chair in the outer office  i sent kemp to chicago said fillmore to have a look at the show it is my policy if i am unable to pay periodical visits myself to send a representative  save it up for the long winter evenings advised miss winch cutting in on this statement of managerial tactics mr kemp may have been there to look at the show but his chief reason for coming was to tell me to beat it back to new york to enter into my kingdom fillmore wanted me on the spot he told me so that i could sit around in this office here interviewing my supporting company me can you or can you not inquired miss winch frankly tie it  well sally hesitated  dont say it i know it just as well as you do its too sad for words  you persist in underestimating your abilities gladys said fillmore reproachfully i have had a certain amount of experience in theatrical mattersi have seen a good deal of actingand i assure you that as a characteractress you  miss winch rose swiftly from her seat kissed fillmore energetically and sat down again she produced another stick of chewinggum then shook her head and replaced it in her bag  youre a darling old thing to talk like that she said and i hate to wake you out of your daydreams but honestly fillmore dear do just step out of the padded cell for one moment and listen to reason i know exactly what has been passing in your poor disordered bean you took elsa doland out of a minor part and made her a star overnight she goes to chicago and the critics and everybody else rave about her as a matter of fact she said to sally with enthusiasm for hers was an honest and generous nature you cant realize not having seen her play there what an amazing hit she has made she really is a sensation everybody says shes going to be the biggest thing on record very well then what does fillmore do the poor fish claps his hand to his forehead and cries gadzooks an idea ive done it before ill do it again im the fellow who can make a star out of anything and he picks on me  my dear girl  now the flaw in the scheme is this elsa is a genius and if he hadnt made her a star somebody else would have done but little gladys thats something else again she turned to sally youve seen me in action and let me tell you youve seen me at my best give me a maids part with a tray to carry on in act one and a couple of yes madams in act two and im there ellen terry hasnt anything on me when it comes to saying yes madam and im willing to back myself for gold notes or lima beans against sarah bernhardt as a traycarrier but there i finish that lets me out and anybody who thinks otherwise is going to lose a lot of money between ourselves the only thing i can do really well is to cook  my dear gladys cried fillmore revolted  im a heavenborn cook and i dont mind notifying the world to that effect i can cook a chicken casserole so that you would leave home and mother for it also my english porkpies one of these days ill take an afternoon off and assemble one for you youd be surprised but actingno i cant do it and i dont want to do it i only went on the stage for fun and my idea of fun isnt to plough through a star part with all the critics waving their axes in the front row and me knowing all the time that its taking money out of fillmores bankroll that ought to be going towards buying the little home with stationary washtubs well thats that fillmore old darling i thought id just mention it  sally could not help being sorry for fillmore he was sitting with his chin on his hands staring moodily before himnapoleon at elba it was plain that this project of taking miss winch by the scruff of the neck and hurling her to the heights had been very near his heart  if thats how you feel he said in a stricken voice there is nothing more to say  oh yes there is we will now talk about this revue of yours its off  fillmore bounded to his feet he thumped the desk with a wellnourished fist a man can stand just so much  it is not off great heavens its too much i will not put up with this interference with my business concerns i will not be tied and hampered here am i a man of broad vision and and broad vision i form my plans my plans i form them i shape my schemes and what happens a horde of girls flock into my private office while i am endeavouring to concentrate and concentrate i wont stand it advice yes interference no i i i and kindly remember that  the door closed with a bang a fainter detonation announced the whirlwind passage through the outer office footsteps died away down the corridor  sally looked at miss winch stunned a roused and militant fillmore was new to her  miss winch took out the stick of chewinggum again and unwrapped it  isnt he cute she said i hope he doesnt get the soft kind she murmured chewing reflectively  the soft kind  hell be back soon with a box of candy explained miss winch and he will get that sloshy creamy sort though i keep telling him i like the other well one things certain fillmores got it up his nose hes beginning to hop about and sing in the sunlight its going to be hard work to get that boy down to earth again miss winch heaved a gentle sigh i should like him to have enough left in the old stocking to pay the first years rent when the wedding bells ring out she bit meditatively on her chewinggum not she said that it matters id be just as happy in two rooms and a kitchenette so long as fillmore was there youve no notion how dippy i am about him her freckled face glowed he grows on me like a darned drug and the funny thing is that i keep right on admiring him though i can see all the while that hes the most perfect chump he is a chump you know thats what i love about him that and the way his ears wiggle when he gets excited chumps always make the best husbands when you marry sally grab a chump tap his forehead first and if it rings solid dont hesitate all the unhappy marriages come from the husband having brains what good are brains to a man they only unsettle him she broke off and scrutinized sally closely say what do you do with your skin  she spoke with solemn earnestness which made sally laugh  what do i do with my skin i just carry it around with me  well said miss winch enviously i wish i could train my darned fool of a complexion to get that way freckles are the devil when i was eight i had the finest collection in the middle west and ive been adding to it right along some folks say lemonjuicell cure em mine lap up all i give em and ask for more theres only one way of getting rid of freckles and that is to saw the head off at the neck  but why do you want to get rid of them  why because a sensitive girl anxious to retain her future husbands love doesnt enjoy going about looking like something out of a dime museum  how absurd fillmore worships freckles  did he tell you so asked miss winch eagerly  not in so many words but you can see it in his eye  well he certainly asked me to marry him knowing all about them i will say that and whats more i dont think feminine loveliness means much to fillmore or hed never have picked on me still it is calculated to give a girl a jar you must admit when she picks up a magazine and reads an advertisement of a facecream beginning your husband is growing cold to you can you blame him have you really tried to cure those unsightly blemishesmeaning what ive got still i havent noticed fillmore growing cold to me so maybe its all right  it was a subdued sally who received ginger when he called at her apartment a few days later on his return from chicago it seemed to her thinking over the recent scene that matters were even worse than she had feared this absurd revue which she had looked on as a mere isolated outbreak of foolishness was it would appear only a specimen of the sort of thing her misguided brother proposed to do a sample selected at random from a wholesale lot of frantic schemes fillmore there was no longer any room for doubt was preparing to express his great soul on a vast scale and she could not dissuade him a humiliating thought she had grown so accustomed through the years to being the dominating mind that this revolt from her authority made her feel helpless and inadequate her selfconfidence was shaken  and bruce carmyle was financing him it was illogical but sally could not help feeling that whenshe had not the optimism to say ifhe lost his money she would somehow be under an obligation to him as if the disaster had been her fault she disliked with a wholehearted intensity the thought of being under an obligation to mr carmyle  ginger said he had looked in to inspect the furniture on the chance that sally might want it shifted again but sally had no criticisms to make on that subject weightier matters occupied her mind she sat ginger down in the armchair and started to pour out her troubles it soothed her to talk to him in a world which had somehow become chaotic again after an all too brief period of peace he was solid and consoling  i shouldnt worry observed ginger with winchlike calm when she had finished drawing for him the picture of a fillmore rampant against a background of expensive revues sally nearly shook him  its all very well to tell me not to worry she cried how can i help worrying fillmores simply a baby and hes just playing the fool he has lost his head completely and i cant stop him that is the awful part of it i used to be able to look him in the eye and he would wag his tail and crawl back into his basket but now i seem to have no influence at all over him he just snorts and goes on running round in circles breathing fire  ginger did not abandon his attempts to indicate the silver lining  i think you are making too much of all this you know i mean to say its quite likely hes found some mug what i mean is its just possible that your brother isnt standing the entire racket himself perhaps some rich johnnie has breezed along with a pot of money it often happens like that you know you read in the paper that some manager or other is putting on some show or other when really the chap whos actually supplying the pieces of eight is some anonymous lad in the background  that is just what has happened and it makes it worse than ever fillmore tells me that your cousin mr carmyle is providing the money  this did interest ginger he sat up with a jerk  oh i say he exclaimed  yes said sally still agitated but pleased that she had at last shaken him out of his trying attitude of detachment  ginger was scowling  thats a bit off he observed  i think so too  i dont like that  nor do i  do you know what i think said ginger ever a man of plain speech and a reckless plunger into delicate subjects the blighters in love with you  sally flushed after examining the evidence before her she had reached the same conclusion in the privacy of her thoughts but it embarrassed her to hear the thing put into bald words  i know bruce continued ginger and believe me he isnt the sort of cove to take any kind of flutter without a jolly good motive of course hes got tons of money his old guvnor was the carmyle of carmyle brent  cocoal mines up in wales and all that sort of thingand i suppose he must have left bruce something like half a million no need for the fellow to have worked at all if he hadnt wanted to as far as having the stuff goes hes in a position to back all the shows he wants to but the point is its right out of his line he doesnt do that sort of thing not a drop of sporting blood in the chap why ive known him stick the whole family on to me just because it got noised about that id dropped a couple of quid on the grand national if hes really brought himself to the point of shelling out on a risky proposition like a show it means something take my word for it and i dont see what else it can mean except well i mean to say is it likely that hes doing it simply to make your brother look on him as a good egg and a pal and all that sort of thing  no its not agreed sally but dont lets talk about it any more tell me all about your trip to chicago  all right but returning to this binge for a moment i dont see how it matters to you one way or the other youre engaged to another fellow and when bruce rolls up and says what about it youve simply to tell him that the shot isnt on the board and will he kindly melt away then you hand him his hat and out he goes  sally gave a troubled laugh  you think thats simple do you i suppose you imagine that a girl enjoys that sort of thing oh whats the use of talking about it its horrible and no amount of arguing will make it anything else do lets change the subject how did you like chicago  oh all right rather a grubby sort of place  so ive always heard but you ought not to mind that being a londoner  oh i didnt mind it as a matter of fact i had rather a good time saw one or two shows you know got in on my face as your brothers representative which was all to the good by the way its rummy how you run into people when you move about isnt it  you talk as if you had been dashing about the streets with your eyes shut did you meet somebody you knew  chap i hadnt seen for years was at school with him as a matter of fact fellow named foster but i expect you know him too dont you by name at any rate he wrote your brothers show  sallys heart jumped  oh did you meet geraldfoster  ran into him one night at the theatre  and you were really at school with him  yes he was in the footer team with me my last year  was he a scrumhalf too asked sally dimpling  ginger looked shocked  you dont have two scrumhalves in a team he said pained at this ignorance on a vital matter the scrumhalf is the half who works the scrum and  yes you told me that at roville what was geraldmr foster then a six and seveneighths or something  he was a wingthree said ginger with a gravity befitting his theme rather fast with a fairly decent swerve but he would not learn to give the reverse pass inside to the centre  ghastly said sally  if said ginger earnestly a wings bottled up by his wing and the back the only thing he can do if he doesnt want to be bundled into touch is to give the reverse pass  i know said sally if ive thought that once ive thought it a hundred times how nice it must have been for you meeting again i suppose you had all sorts of things to talk about  ginger shook his head  not such a frightful lot we were never very thick you see this chap foster was by way of being a bit of a worm  what  a tick explained ginger a rotter he was pretty generally barred at school personally i never had any use for him at all  sally stiffened she had liked ginger up to that moment and later on no doubt she would resume her liking for him but in the immediate moment which followed these words she found herself regarding him with stormy hostility how dare he sit there saying things like that about gerald  ginger who was lighting a cigarette without a care in the world proceeded to develop his theme  its a rummy thing about school generally if a fellows good at gamesin the cricket team or the footer team and so forthhe can hardly help being fairly popular but this blighter foster somehownobody seemed very keen on him of course he had a few of his own pals but most of the chaps rather gave him a miss it may have been because he was a bit sidey had rather an edge on him you know personally the reason i barred him was because he wasnt straight you didnt notice it if you werent thrown a goodish bit with him of course but he and i were in the same house and  sally managed to control her voice though it shook a little  i ought to tell you she said and her tone would have warned him had he been less occupied that mr foster is a great friend of mine  but ginger was intent on the lighting of his cigarette a delicate operation with the breeze blowing in through the open window his head was bent and he had formed his hands into a protective framework which half hid his face  if you take my tip he mumbled youll drop him hes a wrong un  he spoke with the absentminded drawl of preoccupation and sally could keep the conflagration under no longer she was aflame from head to foot  it may interest you to know she said shooting the words out like bullets from between clenched teeth that gerald foster is the man i am engaged to marry  gingers head came slowly up from his cupped hands amazement was in his eyes and a sort of horror the cigarette hung limply from his mouth he did not speak but sat looking at her dazed then the match burnt his fingers and he dropped it with a start the sharp sting of it seemed to wake him he blinked  youre joking he said feebly there was a note of wistfulness in his voice it isnt true  sally kicked the leg of her chair irritably she read insolent disapproval into the words he was daring to criticize  of course its true  but a look of hopeless misery came into gingers pleasant face he hesitated then with the air of a man bracing himself to a dreadful but unavoidable ordeal he went on he spoke gruffly and his eyes which had been fixed on sallys wandered down to the match on the carpet it was still glowing and mechanically he put a foot on it  fosters married he said shortly he was married the day before i left chicago    3    it seemed to ginger that in the silence which followed brooding over the room like a living presence even the noises in the street had ceased as though what he had said had been a spell cutting sally and himself off from the outer world only the little clock on the mantelpiece tickedtickedticked like a heart beating fast  he stared straight before him conscious of a strange rigidity he felt incapable of movement as he had sometimes felt in nightmares and not for all the wealth of america could he have raised his eyes just then to sallys face he could see her hands they had tightened on the arm of the chair the knuckles were white  he was blaming himself bitterly now for his oafish clumsiness in blurting out the news so abruptly and yet curiously in his remorse there was something of elation never before had he felt so near to her it was as though a barrier that had been between them had fallen  something moved it was sallys hand slowly relaxing the fingers loosened their grip tightened again then as if reluctantly relaxed once more the blood flowed back  your cigarettes out  ginger started violently her voice coming suddenly out of the silence had struck him like a blow  oh thanks  he forced himself to light another match it sputtered noisily in the stillness he blew it out and the uncanny quiet fell again  ginger drew at his cigarette mechanically for an instant he had seen sallys face whitecheeked and brighteyed the chin tilted like a flag flying over a stricken field his mood changed all his emotions had crystallized into a dull futile rage a helpless fury directed at a man a thousand miles away  sally spoke again her voice sounded small and far off an odd flatness in it  married  ginger threw his cigarette out of the window he was shocked to find that he was smoking nothing could have been farther from his intention than to smoke he nodded  whom has he married  ginger coughed something was sticking in his throat and speech was difficult  a girl called doland  oh elsa doland  yes  elsa doland sally drummed with her fingers on the arm of the chair oh elsa doland  there was silence again the little clock ticked fussily on the mantelpiece out in the street automobile horns were blowing from somewhere in the distance came faintly the rumble of an elevated train familiar sounds but they came to sally now with a curious unreal sense of novelty she felt as though she had been projected into another world where everything was new and strange and horribleeverything except ginger about him in the mere sight of him there was something known and heartening  suddenly she became aware that she was feeling that ginger was behaving extremely well she seemed to have been taken out of herself and to be regarding the scene from outside regarding it coolly and critically and it was plain to her that ginger in this upheaval of all things was bearing himself perfectly he had attempted no banal words of sympathy he had said nothing and he was not looking at her and sally felt that sympathy just now would be torture and that she could not have borne to be looked at  ginger was wonderful in that curious detached spirit that had come upon her she examined him impartially and gratitude welled up from the very depths of her there he sat saying nothing and doing nothing as if he knew that all she needed the only thing that could keep her sane in this world of nightmare was the sight of that dear flaming head of his that made her feel that the world had not slipped away from her altogether  ginger did not move the room had grown almost dark now a spear of light from a street lamp shone in through the window  sally got up abruptly slowly gradually inch by inch the great suffocating cloud which had been crushing her had lifted she felt alive again her black hour had gone and she was back in the world of living things once more she was afire with a fierce tearing pain that tormented her almost beyond endurance but dimly she sensed the fact that she had passed through something that was worse than pain and with gingers stolid presence to aid her had passed triumphantly  go and have dinner ginger she said you must be starving  ginger came to life like a courtier in the palace of the sleeping beauty he shook himself and rose stiffly from his chair  oh no he said not a bit really  sally switched on the light and set him blinking she could bear to be looked at now  go and dine she said dine lavishly and luxuriously youve certainly earned her voice faltered for a moment she held out her hand ginger she said shakily i ginger youre a pal  when he had gone sally sat down and began to cry then she dried her eyes in a businesslike manner  there miss nicholas she said you couldnt have done that an hour ago we will now boil you an egg for your dinner and see how that suits you     chapter xi sally runs away    if ginger kemp had been asked to enumerate his good qualities it is not probable that he would have drawn up a very lengthy list he might have started by claiming for himself the virtue of meaning well but after that he would have had to chew the pencil in prolonged meditation and even if he could eventually have added one or two further items to the catalogue tact and delicacy of feeling would not have been among them  yet by staying away from sally during the next few days he showed considerable delicacy it was not easy to stay away from her but he forced himself to do so he argued from his own tastes and was strongly of opinion that in times of travail solitude was what the sufferer most desired in his time he too had had what he would have described as nasty jars and on these occasions all he had asked was to be allowed to sit and think things over and fight his battle out by himself  by saturday however he had come to the conclusion that some form of action might now be taken saturday was rather a good day for picking up the threads again he had not to go to the office and what was still more to the point he had just drawn his weeks salary mrs meecher had deftly taken a certain amount of this off him but enough remained to enable him to attempt consolation on a fairly princely scale there presented itself to him as a judicious move the idea of hiring a car and taking sally out to dinner at one of the roadhouses he had heard about up the boston post road he examined the scheme the more he looked at it the better it seemed  he was helped to this decision by the extraordinary perfection of the weather the weather of late had been a revelation to ginger it was his first experience of americas indian summer and it had quite overcome him as he stood on the roof of mrs meechers establishment on the saturday morning thrilled by the velvet wonder of the sunshine it seemed to him that the only possible way of passing such a day was to take sally for a ride in an open car  the maison meecher was a lofty building on one of the sidestreets at the lower end of the avenue from its roof after you had worked your way through the groves of washing which hung limply from the clothesline you could see many things of interest to the left lay washington square full of somnolent italians and rollerskating children to the right was a spectacle which never failed to intrigue ginger the high smokestacks of a cunard liner moving slowly down the river sticking up over the housetops as if the boat was travelling down ninth avenue  today there were four of these funnels causing ginger to deduce the mauritania as the boat on which he had come over from england the mauritania had a sentimental interest for him he stood watching her stately progress till the higher buildings farther down the town shut her from his sight then picked his way through the washing and went down to his room to get his hat a quarter of an hour later he was in the hallway of sallys apartment house gazing with illconcealed disgust at the sergeclad back of his cousin mr carmyle who was engaged in conversation with a gentleman in overalls  no carefree prospector singing his way through the mojave desert and suddenly finding himself confronted by a rattlesnake could have experienced so abrupt a change of mood as did ginger at this revolting spectacle even in their native piccadilly it had been unpleasant to run into mr carmyle to find him here now was nothing short of nauseating only one thing could have brought him to this place obviously he must have come to see sally and with a sudden sinking of the heart ginger remembered the shiny expensive automobile which he had seen waiting at the door he it was clear was not the only person to whom the idea had occurred of taking sally for a drive on this golden day  he was still standing there when mr carmyle swung round with a frown on his dark face which seemed to say that he had not found the janitors conversation entertaining the sight of ginger plainly did nothing to lighten his gloom  hullo he said  hullo said ginger  uncomfortable silence followed these civilities  have you come to see miss nicholas  why yes  she isnt here said mr carmyle and the fact that he had found someone to share the bad news seemed to cheer him a little  not here  no apparently bruce carmyles scowl betrayed that resentment which a wellbalanced man cannot but feel at the unreasonableness of others  apparently for some extraordinary reason she has taken it into her head to dash over to england  ginger tottered the unexpectedness of the blow was crushing he followed his cousin out into the sunshine in a sort of dream bruce carmyle was addressing the driver of the expensive automobile  i find i shall not want the car you can take it back to the garage  the chauffeur a moody man opened one halfclosed eye and spat cautiously it was the way rockefeller would have spat when approaching the crisis of some delicate financial negotiation  youll have to pay just the same he observed opening his other eye to lend emphasis to the words  of course i shall pay snapped mr carmyle irritably how much is it  money passed the car rolled off  gone to england said ginger dizzily  yes gone to england  but why  how the devil do i know why bruce carmyle would have found his best friend trying at this moment gaping ginger gave him almost a physical pain all i know is what the janitor told me that she sailed on the mauretania this morning  the tragic irony of this overcame ginger that he should have stood on the roof calmly watching the boat down the river  he nodded absently to mr carmyle and walked off he had no further remarks to make the warmth had gone out of the sunshine and all interest had departed from his life he felt dull listless at a loose end not even the thought that his cousin a careful man with his money had had to pay a days hire for a car which he could not use brought him any balm he loafed aimlessly about the streets he wandered in the park and out again the park bored him the streets bored him the whole city bored him a city without sally in it was a drab futile city and nothing that the sun could do to brighten it could make it otherwise  night came at last and with it a letter it was the first even passably pleasant thing that had happened to ginger in the whole of this dreary and unprofitable day for the envelope bore the crest of the good ship mauretania he snatched it covetously from the letterrack and carried it upstairs to his room  very few of the rooms at mrs meechers boardinghouse struck any note of luxury mrs meecher was not one of your fashionable interior decorators she considered that when she had added a morris chair to the essentials which make up a bedroom she had gone as far in the direction of pomp as any guest at sevenandahalf per could expect her to go as a rule the severity of his surroundings afflicted ginger with a touch of gloom when he went to bed but tonightsuch is the magic of a letter from the right personhe was uplifted and almost gay there are moments when even illuminated texts over the washstand cannot wholly quell us  there was nothing of haste and much of ceremony in gingers method of approaching the perusal of his correspondence he bore himself after the manner of a small boy in the presence of unexpected icecream gloating for awhile before embarking on the treat anxious to make it last out his first move was to feel in the breastpocket of his coat and produce the photograph of sally which he had feloniously removed from her apartment at this he looked long and earnestly before propping it up within easy reach against his basin to be handy if required for purposes of reference he then took off his coat collar and shoes filled and lit a pipe placed pouch and matches on the arm of the morris chair and drew that chair up so that he could sit with his feet on the bed having manoeuvred himself into a position of ease he lit his pipe again and took up the letter he looked at the crest the handwriting of the address and the postmark he weighed it in his hand it was a bulky letter  he took sallys photograph from the washstand and scrutinized it once more then he lit his pipe again and finally wriggling himself into the depths of the chair opened the envelope  ginger dear  having read so far ginger found it necessary to take up the photograph and study it with an even greater intentness than before he gazed at it for many minutes then laid it down and lit his pipe again then he went on with the letter  ginger dearim afraid this address is going to give you rather a shock and im feeling very guilty im running away and i havent even stopped to say goodbye i cant help it i know its weak and cowardly but i simply cant help it i stood it for a day or two and then i saw that it was no good thank you for leaving me alone and not coming round to see me nobody else but you would have done that but then nobody ever has been or ever could be so understanding as you  ginger found himself compelled at this point to look at the photograph again  there was too much in new york to remind me thats the worst of being happy in a place when things go wrong you find there are too many ghosts about i just couldnt stand it i tried but i couldnt im going away to get curedif i can mr faucitt is over in england and when i went down to mrs meecher for my letters i found one from him his brother is dead you know and he has inherited of all things a fashionable dressmaking place in regent street his brother was laurette et cie i suppose he will sell the business later on but just at present the poor old dear is apparently quite bewildered and that doesnt seem to have occurred to him he kept saying in his letter how much he wished i was with him to help him and i was tempted and ran anything to get away from the ghosts and have something to do i dont suppose i shall feel much better in england but at least every street corner wont have associations dont ever be happy anywhere ginger its too big a risk much too big a risk  there was a letter from elsa doland too bubbling over with affection we had always been tremendous friends of course she never knew anything about my being engaged to gerald i lent fillmore the money to buy that piece which gave elsa her first big chance and so shes very grateful she says if ever she gets the opportunity of doing me a good turn arent things muddled  and there was a letter from gerald i was expecting one of course but what would you have done ginger would you have read it i sat with it in front of me for an hour i should think just looking at the envelope and then you see what was the use i could guess exactly the sort of thing that would be in it and reading it would only have hurt a lot more the thing was done so why bother about explanations what good are explanations anyway they dont help they dont do anything i burned it ginger the last letter i shall ever get from him i made a bonfire on the bathroom floor and it smouldered and went brown and then flared a little and every now and then i lit another match and kept it burning and at last it was just black ashes and a stain on the tiles just a mess  ginger burn this letter too im pouring out all the poison to you hoping it will make me feel better you dont mind do you but i know you dont if ever anybody had a real pal  its a dreadful thing fascination ginger it grips you and you are helpless one can be so sensible and reasonable about other peoples love affairs when i was working at the dance place i told you about there was a girl who fell in love with the most awful little beast he had a mean mouth and shiny black hair brushed straight back and anybody would have seen what he was but this girl wouldnt listen to a word i talked to her by the hour it makes me smile now when i think how sensible and levelheaded i was but she wouldnt listen in some mysterious way this was the man she wanted and of course everything happened that one knew would happen  if one could manage ones own life as well as one can manage other peoples if all this wretched thing of mine had happened to some other girl how beautifully i could have proved that it was the best thing that could have happened and that a man who could behave as gerald has done wasnt worth worrying about i can just hear myself but you see whatever he has done gerald is still gerald and sally is still sally and however much i argue i cant get away from that all i can do is to come howling to my redheaded pal when i know just as well as he does that a girl of any spirit would be dignified and keep her troubles to herself and be much too proud to let anyone know that she was hurt  proud thats the real trouble ginger my pride has been battered and chopped up and broken into as many pieces as you broke mr scrymgeours stick what pitiful creatures we are girls i mean at least i suppose a good many girls are like me if gerald had died and i had lost him that way i know quite well i shouldnt be feeling as i do now i should have been brokenhearted but it wouldnt have been the same its my pride that is hurt i have always been a bossy cocksure little creature swaggering about the world like an english sparrow and now im paying for it oh ginger im paying for it i wonder if running away is going to do me any good at all perhaps if mr faucitt has some real hard work for me to do  of course i know exactly how all this has come about elsas pretty and attractive but the point is that she is a success and as a success she appeals to geralds weakest side he worships success she is going to have a marvellous career and she can help gerald on in his he can write plays for her to star in what have i to offer against that yes i know its grovelling and contemptible of me to say that ginger i ought to be above it oughtnt italking as if i were competing for some prize but i havent any pride left oh well  there ive poured it all out and i really do feel a little better just for the moment it wont last of course but even a minute is something ginger dear i shant see you for ever so long even if we ever do meet again but youll try to remember that im thinking of you a whole lot wont you i feel responsible for you youre my baby youve got started now and youve only to stick to it please please please dont make a hash of it goodbye i never did find that photograph of me that we were looking for that afternoon in the apartment or i would send it to you then you could have kept it on your mantelpiece and whenever you felt inclined to make a hash of anything i would have caught your eye sternly and you would have pulled up  goodbye ginger i shall have to stop now the mail is just closing  always your pal wherever i amsally  ginger laid the letter down and a little sound escaped him that was half a sigh half an oath he was wondering whether even now some desirable end might not be achieved by going to chicago and breaking gerald fosters neck abandoning this scheme as impracticable and not being able to think of anything else to do he relit his pipe and started to read the letter again     chapter xii some letters for ginger    laurette et cie  regent street  london w  england    january 21st  dear gingerim feeling better as its three months since i last wrote to you no doubt you will say to yourself that i would be a poor weakminded creature if i wasnt i suppose one ought to be able to get over anything in three months unfortunately im afraid i havent quite succeeded in doing that but at least i have managed to get my troubles stowed away in the cellar and im not dragging them out and looking at them all the time thats something isnt it  i ought to give you all my impressions of london i suppose but ive grown so used to the place that i dont think i have any now i seem to have been here years and years  you will see by the address that mr faucitt has not yet sold his inheritance he expects to do so very soon he tells methere is a richlooking man with whiskers and a keen eye whom he is always lunching with and i think big deals are in progress poor dear he is crazy to get away into the country and settle down and grow ducks and things london has disappointed him it is not the place it used to be until quite lately when he grew resigned he used to wander about in a disconsolate sort of way trying to locate the landmarks of his youth he has not been in england for nearly thirty years the trouble is it seems that about once in every thirty years a sort of craze for change comes over london and they paint a shopfront red instead of blue and that upsets the returned exile dreadfully mr faucitt feels like rip van winkle his first shock was when he found that the empire was a theatre now instead of a musichall then he was told that another musichall the tivoli had been pulled down altogether and when on top of that he went to look at the bakers shop in rupert street over which he had lodgings in the eighties and discovered that it had been turned into a dressmakers he grew very melancholy and only cheered up a little when a lovely magenta fog came on and showed him that some things were still going along as in the good old days  i am kept quite busy at laurette et cie thank goodness not being a french scholar like youdo you remember julesi thought at first that cie was the name of the junior partner and looked forward to meeting him miss nicholas shake hands with mr cie one of your greatest admirers i hold down the female equivalent of your job at the fillmore nicholas theatrical enterprises ltdthat is to say im a sort of righthand woman i hang around and sidle up to the customers when they come in and say chawming weather moddom which is usually a black lie and pass them on to the staff who do the actual work i shouldnt mind going on like this for the next few years but mr faucitt is determined to sell i dont know if you are like that but every other englishman ive ever met seems to have an ambition to own a house and lot in loamshire or hants or salop or somewhere their one object in life is to make some money and buy back the old placewhich was sold of course at the end of act one to pay the heirs gambling debts  mr faucitt when he was a small boy used to live in a little village in gloucestershire near a place called cirencesterat least it isnt its called cissister which i bet you didnt knowand after forgetting about it for fifty years he has suddenly been bitten by the desire to end his days there surrounded by pigs and chickens he took me down to see the place the other day oh ginger this english country why any of you ever live in towns i cant think old old grey stone houses with yellow haystacks and lovely squelchy muddy lanes and great fat trees and blue hills in the distance the peace of it if ever i sell my soul i shall insist on the devil giving me at least forty years in some english country place in exchange  perhaps you will think from all this that i am too much occupied to remember your existence just to show how interested i am in you let me tell you that when i was reading the paper a week ago i happened to see the headline international match it didnt seem to mean anything at first and then i suddenly recollected this was the thing you had once been a snip for so i went down to a place called twickenham where this football game was to be to see the sort of thing you used to do before i took charge of you and made you a respectable righthand man there was an enormous crowd there and i was nearly squeezed to death but i bore it for your sake i found out that the english team were the ones wearing white shirts and that the ones in red were the welsh i said to the man next to me after he had finished yelling himself black in the face could you kindly inform me which is the english scrumhalf and just at that moment the players came quite near where i was and about a dozen assassins in red hurled themselves violently on top of a meeklooking little fellow who had just fallen on the ball ginger you are well out of it that was the scrumhalf and i gathered that that sort of thing was a mere commonplace in his existence stopping a rush it is called and he is expected to do it all the time the idea of you ever going in for such brutal sports you thank your stars that you are safe on your little stool in fillmores outer office and that if anybody jumps on top of you now you can call a cop do you mean to say you really used to do these daredevil feats you must have hidden depths in you which i have never suspected  as i was taking a ride down piccadilly the other day on top of a bus i saw somebody walking along who seemed familiar it was mr carmyle so hes back in england again he didnt see me thank goodness i dont want to meet anybody just at present who reminds me of new york  thanks for telling me all the news but please dont do it again it makes me remember and i dont want to its this way ginger let me write to you because it really does relieve me but dont answer my letters do you mind im sure youll understand  so fillmore and gladys winch are married from what i have seen of her its the best thing that has ever happened to brother f she is a splendid girl i must write to him    laurette et cie  london    march 12th  dear gingeri saw in a sunday paper last week that the primrose way had been produced in new york and was a great success well im very glad but i dont think the papers ought to print things like that its unsettling  next day i did one of those funny things you do when youre feeling blue and lonely and a long way away from everybody i called at your club and asked for you such a nice old man in uniform at the desk said in a fatherly way that you hadnt been in lately and he rather fancied you were out of town but would i take a seat while he inquired he then summoned a tiny boy also in uniform and the child skipped off chanting mister kemp mister kemp in a shrill treble it gave me such an odd feeling to hear your name echoing in the distance i felt so ashamed for giving them all that trouble and when the boy came back i slipped twopence into his palm which i suppose was against all the rules though he seemed to like it  mr faucitt has sold the business and retired to the country and i am rather at a loose end                                                     monks crofton                                                  whatever that means                                                  much middleford                                                  salop                                                  slang for shropshire                                                  england    april 18th  dear gingerwhats the use what is the use i do all i can to get right away from new york and new york comes after me and tracks me down in my hidingplace a week or so ago as i was walking down the strand in an aimless sort of way out there came right on top of mewho do you think fillmore arm in arm with mr carmyle i couldnt dodge in the first place mr carmyle had seen me in the second place it is a days journey to dodge poor dear fillmore now i blushed for him ginger right there in the strand i blushed for him in my worst dreams i had never pictured him so enormous upon what meat doth this our fillmore feed that he is grown so great poor gladys when she looks at him she must feel like a bigamist  apparently fillmore is still full of big schemes for he talked airily about buying all sorts of english plays he has come over as i suppose you know to arrange about putting on the primrose way over here he is staying at the savoy and they took me off there to lunch whooping joyfully as over a strayed lamb it was the worst thing that could possibly have happened to me fillmore talked broadway without a pause till by the time he had worked his way past the french pastry and was lolling back breathing a little stertorously waiting for the coffee and liqueurs he had got me so homesick that if it hadnt been that i didnt want to make a public exhibition of myself i should have broken down and howled it was crazy of me ever to go near the savoy of course its simply an annex to broadway there were americans at every table as far as the eye could reach i might just as well have been at the astor  well if fate insists in bringing new york to england for my special discomfiture i suppose i have got to put up with it i just let events take their course and i have been drifting ever since two days ago i drifted here mr carmyle invited fillmorehe seems to love fillmoreand me to monks crofton and i hadnt even the shadow of an excuse for refusing so i came and i am now sitting writing to you in an enormous bedroom with an open fire and armchairs and every other sort of luxury fillmore is out golfing he sails for new york on saturday on the mauretania i am horrified to hear from him that in addition to all his other big schemes he is now promoting a fight for the lightweight championship in jersey city and guaranteeing enormous sums to both boxers its no good arguing with him if you do he simply quotes figures to show the fortunes other people have made out of these things besides its too late now anyway as far as i can make out the fight is going to take place in another week or two all the same it makes my flesh creep  well its no use worrying i suppose lets change the subject do you know monks crofton probably you dont as i seem to remember hearing something said about it being a recent purchase mr carmyle bought it from some lord or other who had been losing money on the stock exchange i hope you havent seen it anyway because i want to describe it at great length i want to pour out my soul about it ginger what has england ever done to deserve such paradises i thought in my ignorance that mr faucitts cissister place was pretty good but it doesnt even begin it cant compete of course his is just an ordinary country house and this is a seat monks crofton is the sort of place they used to write about in the english novels you know the sunset was falling on the walls of g castle in bshire hard by the picturesque village of h and not a stones throw from the hamlet of j i can imagine tennysons maud living here it is one of the stately homes of england how beautiful they stand and im crazy about it  you motor up from the station and after you have gone about three miles you turn in at a big iron gate with stone posts on each side with stone beasts on them close by the gate is the cutest little house with an old man inside it who pops out and touches his hat this is only the lodge really but you think you have arrived so you get all ready to jump out and then the car goes rolling on for another fifty miles or so through beech woods full of rabbits and open meadows with deer in them finally just as you think you are going on for ever you whizz round a corner and theres the house you dont get a glimpse of it till then because the trees are too thick  its very large and sort of low and square with a kind of tower at one side and the most fascinating upper porch sort of thing with battlements i suppose in the old days you used to stand on this and drop molten lead on visitors heads wonderful lawns all round and shrubberies and a lake that you can just see where the ground dips beyond the fields of course its too early yet for them to be out but to the left of the house theres a place where there will be about a million roses when june comes round and all along the side of the rosegarden is a high wall of old red brick which shuts off the kitchen garden i went exploring there this morning its an enormous place with hothouses and things and theres the cunningest farm at one end with a stable yard full of puppies that just tear the heart out of you theyre so sweet and a big sleepy cat which sits and blinks in the sun and lets the puppies run all over her and theres a lovely stillness and you can hear everything growing and thrushes and blackbirds oh ginger its heavenly  but theres a catch its a case of where every prospect pleases and only man is vile at least not exactly vile i suppose but terribly stodgy i can see now why you couldnt hit it off with the family because ive seen em all theyre here yes uncle donald and all of them is it a habit of your family to collect in gangs or have i just happened to stumble into an accidental old home week when i came down to dinner the first evening the drawingroom was full to bursting pointnot simply because fillmore was there but because there were uncles and aunts all over the place i felt like a small lion in a den of daniels i know exactly now what you mean about the family they look at you of course its all right for me because i am snowy white clear through but i can just imagine what it must have been like for you with your permanently guilty conscience you must have had an awful time  by the way its going to be a delicate business getting this letter through to yourather like carrying the despatches through the enemys lines in a civil war play youre supposed to leave letters on the table in the hall and someone collects them in the afternoon and takes them down to the village on a bicycle but if i do that some aunt or uncle is bound to see it and i shall be an object of loathing for it is no light matter my lad to be caught having correspondence with a human jimpson weed like you it would blast me socially at least so i gather from the way they behaved when your name came up at dinner last night somebody mentioned you and the most awful roasting party broke loose uncle donald acting as cheerleader i said feebly that i had met you and had found you part human and there was an awful silence till they all started at the same time to show me where i was wrong and how cruelly my girlish inexperience had deceived me a young and innocent halfportion like me it appears is absolutely incapable of suspecting the true infamy of the dregs of society you arent fit to speak to the likes of me being at the kindest estimate little more than a blot on the human race i tell you this in case you may imagine youre popular with the family youre not  so i shall have to exercise a good deal of snaky craft in smuggling this letter through ill take it down to the village myself if i can sneak away but its going to be pretty difficult because for some reason i seem to be a centre of attraction except when i take refuge in my room hardly a moment passes without an aunt or an uncle popping out and having a cosy talk with me it sometimes seems as though they were weighing me in the balance well let em weigh  time to dress for dinner now goodbye  yours in the balance  sally  psyou were perfectly right about your uncle donalds moustache but i dont agree with you that it is more his misfortune than his fault i think he does it on purpose                                                      just for the moment                                                   monks crofton                                                   much middleford                                                   salop                                                   england    april 20th  dear gingerleaving here today in disgrace hard cold looks from the family strained silences uncle donald far from chummy you can guess what has happened i might have seen it coming i can see now that it was in the air all along  fillmore knows nothing about it he left just before it happened i shall see him very soon for i have decided to come back and stop running away from things any longer its cowardly to skulk about over here besides im feeling so much better that i believe i can face the ghosts anyway im going to try see you almost as soon as you get this  i shall mail this in london and i suppose it will come over by the same boat as me its hardly worth writing really of course but i have sneaked up to my room to wait till the motor arrives to take me to the station and its something to do i can hear muffled voices the family talking me over probably saying they never really liked me all along oh well  yours moving in an orderly manner to the exit  sally     chapter xiii strange behaviour of a sparringpartner    1    sallys emotions as she sat in her apartment on the morning of her return to new york resembled somewhat those of a swimmer who after wavering on a raw morning at the brink of a chill pool nerves himself to the plunge she was aching but she knew that she had done well if she wanted happiness she must fight for it and for all these months she had been shirking the fight she had done with wavering on the brink and here she was in midstream ready for whatever might befall it hurt this coming to grips she had expected it to hurt but it was a pain that stimulated not a dull melancholy that smothered she felt alive and defiant  she had finished unpacking and tidying up the next move was certainly to go and see ginger she had suddenly become aware that she wanted very badly to see ginger his stolid friendliness would be a support and a prop she wished now that she had sent him a cable so that he could have met her at the dock it had been rather terrible at the dock the echoing customs sheds had sapped her valour and she felt alone and forlorn  she looked at her watch and was surprised to find how early it was she could catch him at the office and make him take her out to lunch she put on her hat and went out  the restless hand of change always active in new york had not spared the outer office of the fillmore nicholas theatrical enterprises ltd in the months of her absence she was greeted on her arrival by an entirely new and original stripling in the place of the one with whom at her last visit she had established such cordial relations like his predecessor he was generously pimpled but there the resemblance stopped he was a grim boy and his manner was stern and suspicious he peered narrowly at sally for a moment as if he had caught her in the act of purloining the office blottingpaper then with no little acerbity desired her to state her business  i want mr kemp said sally  the officeboy scratched his cheek dourly with a ruler no one would have guessed so austere was his aspect that a moment before her entrance he had been trying to balance it on his chin juggling the while with a pair of paperweights for impervious as he seemed to human weaknesses it was this lads ambition one day to go into vaudeville  what name he said coldly  nicholas said sally i am mr nicholas sister  on a previous occasion when she had made this announcement disastrous results had ensued but today it went well it seemed to hit the officeboy like a bullet he started convulsively opened his mouth and dropped the ruler in the interval of stooping and recovering it he was able to pull himself together he had not been curious about sallys name what he had wished was to have the name of the person for whom she was asking repeated he now perceived that he had had a bit of luck a wearying period of disappointment in the matter of keeping the paperweights circulating while balancing the ruler had left him peevish and it had been his intention to work off his illhumour on the young visitor the discovery that it was the bosss sister who was taking up his time suggested the advisability of a radical change of tactics he had stooped with a frown he returned to the perpendicular with a smile that was positively winning it was like the sun suddenly bursting through a london fog  will you take a seat lady he said with polished courtesy even unbending so far as to reach out and dust one with the sleeve of his coat he added that the morning was a fine one  thank you said sally will you tell him im here  mr nicholas is out miss said the officeboy with gentlemanly regret hes back in new york but hes gone out  i dont want mr nicholas i want mr kemp  mr kemp  yes mr kemp  sorrow at his inability to oblige shone from every hilltop on the boys face  dont know of anyone of that name around here he said apologetically  but surely sally broke off suddenly a grim foreboding had come to her how long have you been here she asked  all day maam said the officeboy with the manner of a casablanca  i mean how long have you been employed here  just over a month miss  hasnt mr kemp been in the office all that time  names new to me lady does he look like anything i meanter say whats he look like  he has very red hair  never seen him in here said the officeboy the truth shone coldly on sally she blamed herself for ever having gone away and told herself that she might have known what would happen left to his own resources the unhappy ginger had once more made a hash of it and this hash must have been a more notable and outstanding hash than any of his previous efforts for surely fillmore would not lightly have dismissed one who had come to him under her special protection  where is mr nicholas she asked it seemed to her that fillmore was the only possible source of information did you say he was out  really out miss said the officeboy with engaging candour he went off to white plains in his automobile halfanhour ago  white plains what for  the pimpled stripling had now given himself up wholeheartedly to social chitchat usually he liked his time to himself and resented the intrusion of the outer world for he who had chosen jugglery for his walk in life must neglect no opportunity of practising but so favourable was the impression which sally had made on his plastic mind that he was delighted to converse with her as long as she wished  i guess whats happened is hes gone up to take a look at bugs butler he said  whose butler said sally mystified  the officeboy smiled a tolerant smile though an admirer of the sex he was aware that women were seldom hep to the really important things in life he did not blame them that was the way they were constructed and one simply had to accept it  bugs butler is training up at white plains miss  who is bugs butler  something of his former bleakness of aspect returned to the officeboy sallys question had opened up a subject on which he felt deeply  ah he replied losing his air of respectful deference as he approached the topic who is he thats what theyre all saying all the wise guys who has bugs butler ever licked  i dont know said sally for he had fixed her with a penetrating gaze and seemed to be pausing for a reply  nor nobody else said the stripling vehemently a lot of stiffs out on the coast thats all ginks nobody has ever heard of except cyclone mullins and it took that false alarm fifteen rounds to get a referees decision over him the boss would go and give him a chance against the champ but i could have told him that the legitimate contender was kleg binns kleg put cyclone mullins out in the fifth well said the officeboy in the overwrought tone of one chafing at human folly if anybody thinks bugs butler can last six rounds with lew lucas ive two bucks right here in my vest pocket that says it aint so  sally began to see daylight  oh bugsmr butler is one of the boxers in this fight that my brother is interested in  thats right hes going up against the lightweight champ lew lucas is the lightweight champ hes a bird  yes said sally this youth had a way of looking at her with his head cocked on one side as though he expected her to say something  yes sir said the stripling with emphasis lew lucas is a hot sketch he used to live on the next street to me he added as clinching evidence of his heros prowess ive seen his old mother as close as i am to you say i seen her a hundred times is any stiff of a bugs butler going to lick a fellow like that  it doesnt seem likely  you spoke it said the lad crisply striking unsuccessfully at a fly which had settled on the blottingpaper  there was a pause sally started to rise  and theres another thing said the officeboy loath to close the subject can bugs butler make a hundred and thirtyfive ringside without being weak  it sounds awfully difficult  they say hes clever the expert laughed satirically well whats that going to get him the poor fish cant punch a hole in a nutsundae  you dont seem to like mr butler  oh ive nothing against him said the officeboy magnanimously im only saying hes no licence to be mixing it with lew lucas  sally got up absorbing as this chat on current form was more important matters claimed her attention  how shall i find my brother when i get to white plains she asked  oh anybodyll show you the way to the trainingcamp if you hurry theres a train you can make now  thank you very much  youre welcome  he opened the door for her with an oldworld politeness which disuse had rendered a little rusty then with an air of getting back to business after a pleasant but frivolous interlude he took up the paperweights once more and placed the ruler with nice care on his upturned chin    2    fillmore heaved a sigh of relief and began to sidle from the room it was a large room half barn half gymnasium athletic appliances of various kinds hung on the walls and in the middle there was a wide ropedoff space around which a small crowd had distributed itself with an air of expectancy this is a commercial age and the days when a prominent pugilists training activities used to be hidden from the public gaze are over today if the public can lay its hands on fifty cents it may come and gaze its fill this afternoon plutocrats to the number of about forty had assembled though not all of these to the regret of mr lester burrowes the manager of the eminent bugs butler had parted with solid coin many of those present were newspaper representatives and on the free listwriters who would polish up mr butlers somewhat crude prognostications as to what he proposed to do to mr lew lucas and would report him as saying i am in really superb condition and feel little apprehension of the issue and artists who would depict him in a state of seminudity with feet several sizes too large for any man  the reason for fillmores relief was that mr burrowes who was a great talker and had buttonholed him a quarter of an hour ago had at last had his attention distracted elsewhere and had gone off to investigate some matter that called for his personal handling leaving fillmore free to slide away to the hotel and get a bite to eat which he sorely needed the zeal which had brought him to the trainingcamp to inspect the final day of mr butlers preparationfor the fight was to take place on the morrowhad been so great that he had omitted to lunch before leaving new york  so fillmore made thankfully for the door and it was at the door that he encountered sally he was looking over his shoulder at the moment and was not aware of her presence till she spoke  hallo fillmore  sally had spoken softly but a dynamite explosion could not have shattered her brothers composure with more completeness in the leaping twist which brought him facing her he rose a clear three inches from the floor he had a confused sensation as though his nervous system had been stirred up with a pole he struggled for breath and moistened his lips with the tip of his tongue staring at her continuously during the process  great men in their moments of weakness are to be pitied rather than scorned if ever a man had an excuse for leaping like a young ram fillmore had it he had left sally not much more than a week ago in england in shropshire at monks crofton she had said nothing of any intention on her part of leaving the country the county or the house yet here she was in bugs butlers trainingcamp at white plains in the state of new york speaking softly in his ear without even going through the preliminary of tapping him on the shoulder to advertise her presence no wonder that fillmore was startled and no wonder that as he adjusted his faculties to the situation there crept upon him a chill apprehension  for fillmore had not been blind to the significance of that invitation to monks crofton nowadays your wooer does not formally approach a girls nearest relative and ask permission to pay his addresses but when he invites her and that nearest relative to his country home and collects all the rest of the family to meet her the thing may be said to have advanced beyond the realms of mere speculation shrewdly fillmore had deduced that bruce carmyle was in love with sally and mentally he had joined their hands and given them a brothers blessing and now it was only too plain that disaster must have occurred if the invitation could mean only one thing so also could sallys presence at white plains mean only one thing  sally a croaking whisper was the best he could achieve what what  did i startle you im sorry  what are you doing here why arent you at monks crofton  sally glanced past him at the ring and the crowd around it  i decided i wanted to get back to america circumstances arose which made it pleasanter to leave monks crofton  do you mean to say  yes dont lets talk about it  do you mean to say persisted fillmore that carmyle proposed to you and you turned him down  sally flushed  i dont think its particularly nice to talk about that sort of thing butyes  a feeling of desolation overcame fillmore that conviction which saddens us at all times of the wilful boneheadedness of our fellows swept coldly upon him everything had been so perfect the whole arrangement so ideal that it had never occurred to him as a possibility that sally might take it into her head to spoil it by declining to play the part allotted to her the match was so obviously the best thing that could happen it was not merely the suitors impressive wealth that made him hold this opinion though it would be idle to deny that the prospect of having a brotherinlawful claim on the carmyle bankbalance had cast a rosy glamour over the future as he had envisaged it he honestly liked and respected the man he appreciated his quiet and aristocratic reserve a wellbred fellow sensible withal just the sort of husband a girl like sally needed and now she had ruined everything with the capricious perversity which so characterizes her otherwise delightful sex she had spilled the beans  but why  oh fill sally had expected that realization of the facts would produce these symptoms in him but now that they had presented themselves she was finding them rasping to the nerves i should have thought the reason was obvious  you mean you dont like him  i dont know whether i do or not i certainly dont like him enough to marry him  hes a darned good fellow  is he you say so i dont know  the imperious desire for bodily sustenance began to compete successfully for fillmores notice with his spiritual anguish  lets go to the hotel and talk it over well go to the hotel and ill give you something to eat  i dont want anything to eat thanks  you dont want anything to eat said fillmore incredulously he supposed in a vague sort of way that there were eccentric people of this sort but it was hard to realize that he had met one of them im starving  well run along then  yes but i want to talk  he was not the only person who wanted to talk at the moment a small man of sporting exterior hurried up he wore what his tailors advertisements would have called a nobbly suit of checked tweed andin defiance of popular prejudicea brown bowler hat mr lester burrowes having dealt with the business which had interrupted their conversation a few minutes before was anxious to resume his remarks on the subject of the supreme excellence in every respect of his young charge  say mr nicholas you aint going bugs is just getting ready to spar  he glanced inquiringly at sally  my sistermr burrowes said fillmore faintly mr burrowes is bugs butlers manager  how do you do said sally  pleased to meecher said mr burrowes say  i was just going to the hotel to get something to eat said fillmore  mr burrowes clutched at his coatbutton with a swoop and held him with a glittering eye  yes but say beforeyougolemmetellyasomefn youve never seen this boy of mine not when he was feeling right believe me hes there hes a wizard hes a hindoo say hes been practising up a left shift that  fillmores eye met sallys wanly and she pitied him presently she would require him to explain to her how he had dared to dismiss ginger from his employmentand make that explanation a good one but in the meantime she remembered that he was her brother and was suffering  hes the cleverest lightweight proceeded mr burrowes fervently since joe gans im telling you and i know he  can he make a hundred and thirtyfive ringside without being weak asked sally  the effect of this simple question on mr burrowes was stupendous he dropped away from fillmores coatbutton like an exhausted bivalve and his small mouth opened feebly it was as if a child had suddenly propounded to an eminent mathematician some abstruse problem in the higher algebra females who took an interest in boxing had come into mr burrowes life beforein his younger days when he was a famous featherweight the first of his three wives had been accustomed to sit at the ringside during his contests and urge him in language of the severest technicality to knock opponents blocks offbut somehow he had not supposed from her appearance and manner that sally was one of the elect he gaped at her and the relieved fillmore sidled off like a bird hopping from the compelling gaze of a snake he was not quite sure that he was acting correctly in allowing his sister to roam at large among the somewhat bohemian surroundings of a trainingcamp but the instinct of selfpreservation turned the scale he had breakfasted early and if he did not eat right speedily it seemed to him that dissolution would set in  whazzat said mr burrowes feebly  it took him fifteen rounds to get a referees decision over cyclone mullins said sally severely and kleg binns  mr burrowes rallies  you aint got it right he protested say you mustnt believe what you see in the papers the referee was dead against us and cyclone was down once for all of half a minute and they wouldnt count him out gee you got to kill a guy in some towns before theyll give you a decision at that they couldnt do nothing so raw as make it anything but a win for my boy after him leading by a mile all the way have you ever seen bugs maam  sally had to admit that she had not had that privilege mr burrowes with growing excitement felt in his breastpocket and produced a picturepostcard which he thrust into her hand  thats bugs he said take a slant at that and then tell me if he dont look the goods  the photograph represented a young man in the irreducible minimum of clothing who crouched painfully as though stricken with one of the acuter forms of gastritis  ill call him over and have him sign it for you said mr burrowes before sally had had time to grasp the fact that this work of art was a gift and no mere loan here bugswantcher  a youth enveloped in a bathrobe who had been talking to a group of admirers near the ring turned started languidly towards them then seeing sally quickened his pace he was an admirer of the sex  mr burrowes did the honours  bugs this is miss nicholas come to see you work out i have been telling her shes going to have a treat and to sally shake hands with bugs butler maam the coming lightweight champion of the world  mr butlers photograph sally considered had flattered him he was in the flesh a singularly repellent young man there was a mean and cruel curve to his lips and a cold arrogance in his eye a something dangerous and sinister in the atmosphere he radiated moreover she did not like the way he smirked at her  however she exerted herself to be amiable  i hope you are going to win mr butler she said  the smile which she forced as she spoke the words removed the coming champions doubts though they had never been serious he was convinced now that he had made a hit he always did he reflected with the girls it was something about him his chest swelled complacently beneath the bathrobe  you betcher he asserted briefly  mr burrows looked at his watch  time you were starting bugs  the coming champion removed his gaze from sallys face into which he had been peering in a conquering manner and cast a disparaging glance at the audience it was far from being as large as he could have wished and at least a third of it was composed of nonpayers from the newspapers  all right he said bored  his languor left him as his gaze fell on sally again and his spirits revived somewhat after all small though the numbers of spectators might be bright eyes would watch and admire him  ill go a couple of rounds with reddy for a starter he said seen him anywheres hes never around when hes wanted  ill fetch him said mr burrowes hes back there somewheres  im going to show that guy up this afternoon said mr butler coldly hes been getting too fresh  the manager bustled off and bugs butler with a final smirk left sally and dived under the ropes there was a stir of interest in the audience though the newspaper men blasé through familiarity exhibited no emotion presently mr burrowes reappeared shepherding a young man whose face was hidden by the sweater which he was pulling over his head he was a sturdily built young man the sweater moving from his body revealed a good pair of shoulders  a last tug and the sweater was off red hair flashed into view tousled and disordered and as she saw it sally uttered an involuntary gasp of astonishment which caused many eyes to turn towards her and the redheaded young man who had been stooping to pick up his gloves straightened himself with a jerk and stood staring at her blankly and incredulously his face slowly crimsoning    3    it was the energetic mr burrowes who broke the spell  come on come on he said impatiently lil speed there reddy  ginger kemp started like a sleepwalker awakened then recovering himself slowly began to pull on the gloves embarrassment was stamped on his agreeable features his face matched his hair  sally plucked at the little managers elbow he turned irritably but beamed in a distrait sort of manner when he perceived the source of the interruption  whohim he said in answer to sallys whispered question hes just one of bugs sparringpartners  but  mr burrowes fussy now that the time had come for action interrupted her  youll excuse me miss but i have to hold the watch we mustnt waste any time  sally drew back she felt like an infidel who intrudes upon the celebration of strange rites this was mans hour and women must keep in the background she had the sensation of being very small and yet very much in the way like a puppy who has wandered into a church the novelty and solemnity of the scene awed her  she looked at ginger who with averted gaze was fiddling with his clothes in the opposite corner of the ring he was as removed from communication as if he had been in another world she continued to stare wideeyed and ginger shuffling his feet selfconsciously plucked at his gloves  mr butler meanwhile having doffed his bathrobe stretched himself and with leisurely nonchalance put on a second pair of gloves was filling in the time with a little shadow boxing he moved rhythmically to and fro now ducking his head now striking out with his muffled hands and a sickening realization of the mans animal power swept over sally and turned her cold swathed in his bathrobe bugs butler had conveyed an atmosphere of dangerousness in the boxingtights which showed up every rippling muscle he was horrible and sinister a machine built for destruction a human panther  so he appeared to sally but a stout and bulbous eyed man standing at her side was not equally impressed obviously one of the wise guys of whom her friend the sporting officeboy had spoken he was frankly dissatisfied with the exhibition  shadowboxing he observed in a cavilling spirit to his companion yes he can do that all right just like i can foxtrot if i aint got a partner to get in the way but one good wallop and then watch him  his friend also plainly a guy of established wisdom assented with a curt nod  ah he agreed  lew lucas said the first wise guy is just as shifty and he can punch  ah said the second wise guy  just because he beats up a few poor mutts of sparringpartners said the first wise guy disparagingly he thinks hes someone  ah said the second wise guy  as far as sally could interpret these remarks the full meaning of which was shrouded from her they seemed to be reassuring for a comforting moment she ceased to regard ginger as a martyr waiting to be devoured by a lion mr butler she gathered was not so formidable as he appeared but her relief was not to be longlived  of course hell eat this redheaded gink went on the first wise guy thats the thing he does best killing his sparringpartners but lew lucas  sally was not interested in lew lucas that numbing fear had come back to her even these cognoscenti little as they esteemed mr butler had plainly no doubts as to what he would do to ginger she tried to tear herself away but something stronger than her own will kept her there standing where she was holding on to the rope and staring forlornly into the ring  ready bugs asked mr burrowes  the coming champion nodded carelessly  go to it said mr burrowes  ginger ceased to pluck at his gloves and advanced into the ring    4    of all the learned professions pugilism is the one in which the trained expert is most sharply divided from the mere dabbler in other fields the amateur may occasionally hope to compete successfully with the man who has made a business of what is to him but a sport but at boxing never and the whole demeanour of bugs butler showed that he had laid this truth to heart it would be too little to say that his bearing was confident he comported himself with the carefree jauntiness of an infant about to demolish a noahs ark with a tackhammer cyclone mullinses might withstand him for fifteen rounds where they yielded to a kleg binns in the fifth but when it came to beating up a sparringpartner and an amateur at that bugs butler knew his potentialities he was there forty ways and he did not attempt to conceal it crouching as was his wont he uncoiled himself like a striking rattlesnake and flicked ginger lightly over his guard then he returned to his crouch and circled sinuously about the ring with the amiable intention of showing the crowd payers and deadheads alike what real footwork was if there was one thing on which bugs butler prided himself it was footwork  the adverb lightly is a relative term and the blow which had just planted a dull patch on gingers cheekbone affected those present in different degrees ginger himself appeared stolidly callous sally shuddered to the core of her being and had to hold more tightly to the rope to support herself the two wise guys mocked openly to the wise guys expert connoisseurs of swat the thing had appeared richly farcical they seemed to consider the blow administered to a third party and not to themselves hardly worth calling a blow at all two more landing as quickly and neatly as the first left them equally cold  call that punching said the first wise guy  ah said the second wise guy  but mr butler if he heard this criticismand it is probable that he didfor the wise ones had been restrained by no delicacy of feeling from raising their voices was in no way discommoded by it bugs butler knew what he was about bright eyes were watching him and he meant to give them a treat the girls like smooth work any roughneck could sail into a guy and knock the daylights out of him but how few could be clever and flashy and scientific few few indeed thought mr butler as he slid in and led once more  something solid smote mr butlers nose rocking him on to his heels and inducing an unpleasant smarting sensation about his eyes he backed away and regarded ginger with astonishment almost with pain until this moment he had scarcely considered him as an active participant in the scene at all and he felt strongly that this sort of thing was bad form it was not being done by sparringpartners  a juster man might have reflected that he himself was to blame he had undeniably been careless in the very act of leading he had allowed his eyes to flicker sideways to see how sally was taking this exhibition of science and he had paid the penalty nevertheless he was piqued he shimmered about the ring thinking it over and the more he thought it over the less did he approve of his young assistants conduct hard thoughts towards ginger began to float in his mind  ginger too was thinking hard thoughts he had not had an easy time since he had come to the training camp but never till today had he experienced any resentment towards his employer until this afternoon bugs butler had pounded him honestly and without malice and he had gone through it as the other sparringpartners did phlegmatically taking it as part of the days work but this afternoon there had been a difference those careless flicks had been an insult a deliberate offence the man was trying to make a fool of him playing to the gallery and the thought of who was in that gallery inflamed ginger past thought of consequences no one not even mr butler was more keenly alive than he to the fact that in a serious conflict with a man who tomorrow night might be lightweight champion of the world he stood no chance whatever but he did not intend to be made an exhibition of in front of sally without doing something to hold his end up he proposed to go down with his flag flying and in pursuance of this object he dug mr butler heavily in the lower ribs with his right causing that expert to clinch and the two wise guys to utter sharp barking sounds expressive of derision  say what the hell dya think youre getting at demanded the aggrieved pugilist in a heated whisper in gingers ear as they fell into the embrace whats the idea you jelly bean  ginger maintained a pink silence his jaw was set and the temper which nature had bestowed upon him to go with his hair had reached white heat he dodged a vicious right which whizzed up at his chin out of the breaking clinch and rushed a left hook shook him but was too high to do more there was rough work in the far corner and suddenly with startling abruptness bugs butler bothered by the ropes at his back and trying to sidestep ran into a swing and fell  time shouted the scandalized mr burrowes utterly aghast at this frightful misadventure in the whole course of his professional experience he could recall no such devastating occurrence  the audience was no less startled there was audible gasping the newspaper men looked at each other with a wild surmise and conjured up pleasant pictures of their sporting editors receiving this sensational item of news later on over the telephone the two wise guys continuing to pursue mr butler with their dislike emitted loud and raucous laughs and one of them forming his hands into a megaphone urged the fallen warrior to go away and get a rep as for sally she was conscious of a sudden fierce cavewomanly rush of happiness which swept away completely the sickening qualms of the last few minutes her teeth were clenched and her eyes blazed with joyous excitement she looked at ginger yearningly longing to forget a gentle upbringing and shout congratulation to him she was proud of him and mingled with the pride was a curious feeling that was almost fear this was not the mild and amiable young man whom she was wont to mother through the difficulties of a world in which he was unfitted to struggle for himself this was a new ginger a stranger to her  on the rare occasions on which he had been knocked down in the past it had been bugs butlers canny practice to pause for a while and rest before rising and continuing the argument but now he was up almost before he had touched the boards and the satire of the second wise guy who had begun to saw the air with his hand and count loudly lost its point it was only too plain that mr butlers motto was that a man may be down but he is never out and indeed the knockdown had been largely a stumble bugs butlers educated feet which had carried him unscathed through so many contests had for this single occasion managed to get themselves crossed just as gingers blow landed and it was to his lack of balance rather than the force of the swing that his downfall had been due  time he snarled casting a malevolent sideglance at his manager like hell its time  and in a whirlwind of flying gloves he flung himself upon ginger driving him across the ring while mr burrowes watch in hand stared with dropping jaw if ginger had seemed a new ginger to sally still more did this seem a new bugs butler to mr burrowes and the manager groaned in spirit coolness skill and sciencethese had been the qualities in his protégé which had always so endeared him to mr lester burrowes and had so enriched their respective bank accounts and now on the eve of the most important fight in his life before an audience of newspaper men he had thrown them all aside and was making an exhibition of himself with a common sparringpartner  that was the bitter blow to mr burrowes had this lapse into the unscientific primitive happened in a regular fight he might have mourned and poured reproof into bugs ear when he got him back in his corner at the end of the round but he would not have experienced this feeling of helpless horrorthe sort of horror an elder of the church might feel if he saw his favourite bishop yielding in public to the fascination of jazz it was the fact that bugs butler was lowering himself to extend his powers against a sparringpartner that shocked mr burrowes there is an etiquette in these things a champion may batter his sparringpartners into insensibility if he pleases but he must do it with nonchalance he must not appear to be really trying  and nothing could be more manifest than that bugs butler was trying his whole fighting soul was in his efforts to corner ginger and destroy him the battle was raging across the ring and down the ring and up the ring and back again yet always ginger like a stormdriven ship contrived somehow to weather the tempest out of the flurry of swinging arms he emerged time after time bruised bleeding but fighting hard  for bugs butlers fury was defeating its object had he remained his cool and scientific self he could have demolished ginger and cut through his defence in a matter of seconds but he had lapsed back into the methods of his unskilled novitiate he swung and missed swung and missed again struck but found no vital spot and now there was blood on his face too in some wild mêlée the sacred fount had been tapped and his teeth gleamed through a crimson mist  the wise guys were beyond speech they were leaning against one another punching each other feebly in the back one was crying  and then suddenly the end came as swiftly and unexpectedly as the thing had begun his wild swings had tired bugs butler and with fatigue prudence returned to him his feet began once more their subtle weaving in and out twice his left hand flickered home a quick feint a short jolting stab and gingers guard was down and he was swaying in the middle of the ring his hands hanging and his knees aquiver  bugs butler measured his distance and sally shut her eyes     chapter xiv mr abrahams reengages an old employee    1    the only real happiness we are told is to be obtained by bringing happiness to others bugs butlers mood accordingly when some thirty hours after the painful episode recorded in the last chapter he awoke from a state of coma in the ring at jersey city to discover that mr lew lucas had knocked him out in the middle of the third round should have been one of quiet contentment his inability to block a short lefthook followed by a right to the point of the jaw had ameliorated quite a number of existences  mr lew lucas for one was noticeably pleased so were mr lucass seconds one of whom went so far as to kiss him and most of the crowd who had betted heavily on the champion were delighted yet bugs butler did not rejoice it is not too much to say that his peevish bearing struck a jarring note in the general gaiety a heavy frown disfigured his face as he slouched from the ring  but the happiness which he had spread went on spreading the two wise guys who had been unable to attend the fight in person received the result on the ticker and exuberantly proclaimed themselves the richer by five hundred dollars the pimpled officeboy at the fillmore nicholas theatrical enterprises ltd caused remark in the subway by whooping gleefully when he read the news in his morning paper for he too had been rendered wealthier by the brittleness of mr butlers chin and it was with fierce satisfaction that sally breakfasting in her little apartment informed herself through the sporting page of the details of the contenders downfall she was not a girl who disliked many people but she had acquired a lively distaste for bugs butler  lew lucas seemed a man after her own heart if he had been a personal friend of gingers he could not considering the brief time at his disposal have avenged him with more thoroughness in round one he had done all sorts of diverting things to mr butlers left eye in round two he had continued the good work on that gentlemans body and in round three he had knocked him out could anyone have done more sally thought not and she drank lew lucass health in a cup of coffee and hoped his old mother was proud of him  the telephone bell rang at her elbow she unhooked the receiver  hullo  oh hullo said a voice  ginger cried sally delightedly  i say im awfully glad youre back i only got your letter this morning found it at the boardinghouse i happened to look in there and  ginger interrupted sally your voice is music but i want to see you where are you  im at a chemists shop across the street i was wondering if  come here at once  i say may i i was just going to ask  you miserable creature why havent you been round to see me before  well as a matter of fact i havent been going about much for the last day you see  i know of course quick sympathy came into sallys voice she gave a sidelong glance of approval and gratitude at the large picture of lew lucas which beamed up at her from the morning paper you poor thing how are you  oh all right thanks  well hurry  there was a slight pause at the other end of the wire  i say  well  im not much to look at you know  you never were stop talking and hurry over  i mean to say  sally hung up the receiver firmly she waited eagerly for some minutes and then footsteps came along the passage they stopped at her door and the bell rang sally ran to the door flung it open and recoiled in consternation  oh ginger  he had stated the facts accurately when he had said that he was not much to look at he gazed at her devotedly out of an unblemished right eye but the other was hidden altogether by a puffy swelling of dull purple a great bruise marred his left cheekbone and he spoke with some difficulty through swollen lips  its all right you know he assured her  it isnt its awful oh you poor darling she clenched her teeth viciously i wish he had killed him  eh  i wish lew lucas or whatever his name is had murdered him brute  oh i dont know you know gingers sense of fairness compelled him to defend his late employer against these harsh sentiments he isnt a bad sort of chap really bugs butler i mean  do you seriously mean to stand there and tell me you dont loathe the creature  oh hes all right see his point of view and all that cant blame him if you come to think of it for getting the wind up a bit in the circs bit thick i mean to say a sparringpartner going at him like that naturally he didnt think it much of a wheeze it was my fault right along oughtnt to have done it of course but somehow when he started making an ass of me and i knew you were looking on well it seemed a good idea to have a dash at doing something on my own no right to of course a sparringpartner isnt supposed  sit down said sally  ginger sat down  ginger said sally youre too good to live  oh i say  i believe if someone sandbagged you and stole your watch and chain youd say there were faults on both sides or something im just a cat and i say i wish your beast of a bugs butler had perished miserably id have gone and danced on his grave but whatever made you go in for that sort of thing  well it seemed the only job that was going at the moment ive always done a goodish bit of boxing and i was very fit and so on and it looked to me rather an opening gave me something to get along with you get paid quite fairly decently you know and its rather a jolly life  jolly being hammered about like that  oh you dont notice it much ive always enjoyed scrapping rather and you see when your brother gave me the push  sally uttered an exclamation  what an extraordinary thing it isi went all the way out to white plains that afternoon to find fillmore and tackle him about that and i didnt say a word about it and i havent seen or been able to get hold of him since  no busy sort of cove your brother  why did fillmore let you go  let me go oh you mean well there was a sort of mixup a kind of misunderstanding  what happened  oh it was nothing just a  what happened  gingers disfigured countenance betrayed embarrassment he looked awkwardly about the room  its not worth talking about  it is worth talking about ive a right to know it was i who sent you to fillmore  now that said ginger was jolly decent of you  dont interrupt i sent you to fillmore and he had no business to let you go without saying a word to me what happened  ginger twiddled his fingers unhappily  well it was rather unfortunate you see his wifei dont know if you know her  of course i know her  why yes you would wouldnt you your brothers wife i mean said ginger acutely though as a matter of fact you often find sistersinlaw who wont have anything to do with one another i know a fellow  ginger said sally its no good your thinking you can get out of telling me by rambling off on other subjects im grim and resolute and relentless and i mean to get this story out of you if i have to use a corkscrew fillmores wife you were saying  ginger came back reluctantly to the main theme  well she came into the office one morning and we started fooling about  fooling about  well kind of chivvying each other  chivvying  at least i was  you were what  sort of chasing her a bit you know  sally regarded this apostle of frivolity with amazement  what do you mean  gingers embarrassment increased  the thing was you see she happened to trickle in rather quietly when i happened to be looking at something and i didnt know she was there till she suddenly grabbed it  grabbed what  the thing the thing i happened to be looking at she bagged it collared it took it away from me you know and wouldnt give it back and generally started to rot about a bit so i rather began to chivvy her to some extent and id just caught her when your brother happened to roll in i suppose said ginger putting two and two together he had really come with her to the office and had happened to hang back for a minute or two to talk to somebody or something well of course he was considerably fed to see me apparently doing jiujitsu with his wife enough to rattle any man if you come to think of it said ginger ever fairminded well he didnt say anything at the time but a bit later in the day he called me in and administered the push  sally shook her head  it sounds the craziest story to me what was it that mrs fillmore took from you  oh just something  sally rapped the table imperiously  ginger  well as a matter of fact said her goaded visitor it was a photograph  who of or if youre particular of whom  well you to be absolutely accurate  me sally stared but ive never given you a photograph of myself  gingers face was a study in scarlet and purple  you didnt exactly give it to me he mumbled when i say give i mean  good gracious sudden enlightenment came upon sally that photograph we were hunting for when i first came here had you stolen it all the time  why yes i did sort of pinch it  you fraud you humbug and you pretended to help me look for it she gazed at him almost with respect i never knew you were so deep and snaky im discovering all sorts of new things about you  there was a brief silence ginger confession over seemed a trifle happier  i hope youre not frightfully sick about it he said at length it was lying about you know and i rather felt i must have it hadnt the cheek to ask you for it so  dont apologize said sally cordially great compliment so i have caused your downfall again have i im certainly your evil genius ginger im beginning to feel like a regular rag and a bone and a hank of hair first i egged you on to insult your familyoh by the way i want to thank you about that now that ive met your uncle donald i can see how publicspirited you were i ruined your prospects there and now my fatal beautycabinet sizehas led to your destruction once more its certainly up to me to find you another job i can see that  no really i say you mustnt bother i shall be all right  its my duty now what is there that you really can do burglary of course but its not respectable youve tried being a waiter and a prizefighter and a righthand man and none of those seems to be just right cant you suggest anything  ginger shook his head  i shall wangle something i expect  yes but what it must be something good this time i dont want to be walking along broadway and come on you suddenly as a streetcleaner i dont want to send for an expressman and find you popping up my idea would be to go to my bank to arrange an overdraft and be told the president could give me two minutes and crawl in humbly and find you prezzing away to beat the band in a big chair isnt there anything in the world that you can do thats solid and substantial and will keep you out of the poorhouse in your old age think  of course if i had a bit of capital  ah the business man and what inquired sally would you do mr morgan if you had a bit of capital  run a dogthingummy said ginger promptly  whats a dogthingummy  why a thingamajig for dogs you know  sally nodded  oh a thingamajig for dogs now i understand you will put things so obscurely at first ginger you poor fish what are you raving about what on earth is a thingamajig for dogs  i mean a sort of place like fellows have breeding dogs you know and selling them and winning prizes and all that there are lots of them about  oh a kennels  yes a kennels  what a weird mind you have ginger you couldnt say kennels at first could you that wouldnt have made it difficult enough i suppose if anyone asked you where you had your lunch you would say oh at a thingamajig for mutton chops ginger my lad there is something in this i believe for the first time in our acquaintance you have spoken something very nearly resembling a mouthful youre wonderful with dogs arent you  im dashed keen on them and ive studied them a bit as a matter of fact though it seems rather like swanking there isnt much about dogs that i dont know  of course i believe youre a sort of honorary dog yourself i could tell it by the way you stopped that fight at roville you plunged into a howling mass of about a million hounds of all species and just whispered in their ears and they stopped at once why the more one examines this the better it looks i do believe its the one thing you couldnt help making a success of its very paying isnt it  works out at about a hundred per cent on the original outlay ive been told  a hundred per cent that sounds too much like something of fillmores for comfort lets say ninetynine and be conservative ginger you have hit it say no more you shall be the dog king the biggest thingamajigger for dogs in the country but how do you start  well as a matter of fact while i was up at white plains i ran into a cove who had a place of the sort and wanted to sell out that was what made me think of it  you must start today or early tomorrow  yes said ginger doubtfully of course theres the catch you know  what catch  the capital youve got to have that this fellow wouldnt sell out under five thousand dollars  ill lend you five thousand dollars  no said ginger  sally looked at him with exasperation ginger id like to slap you she said it was maddening this intrusion of sentiment into business affairs why simply because he was a man and she was a woman should she be restrained from investing money in a sound commercial undertaking if columbus had taken up this boneheaded stand towards queen isabella america would never have been discovered  i cant take five thousand dollars off you said ginger firmly  whos talking of taking it off me as you call it stormed sally cant you forget your burglarious career for a second this isnt the same thing as going about stealing defenceless girls photographs this is business i think you would make an enormous success of a dogplace and you admit youre good so why make frivolous objections why shouldnt i put money into a good thing dont you want me to get rich or what is it  ginger was becoming confused argument had never been his strong point  but its such a lot of money  to you perhaps not to me im a plutocrat five thousand dollars whats five thousand dollars i feed it to the birds  ginger pondered woodenly for a while his was a literal mind and he knew nothing of sallys finances beyond the fact that when he had first met her she had come into a legacy of some kind moreover he had been hugely impressed by fillmores magnificence it seemed plain enough that the nicholases were a wealthy family  i dont like it you know he said  you dont have to like it said sally you just do it  a consoling thought flashed upon ginger  youd have to let me pay you interest  let you my lad youll have to pay me interest what do you think this isa round game its a cold business deal  topping said ginger relieved how about twentyfive per cent  dont be silly said sally quickly i want three  no thats all rot protested ginger i mean to saythree i dont he went on making a concession mind saying twenty  if you insist ill make it five not more  well ten then  five  suppose said ginger insinuatingly i said seven  i never saw anyone like you for haggling said sally with disapproval listen six and thats my last word  six  six  ginger did sums in his head  but that would only work out at three hundred dollars a year it isnt enough  what do you know about it as if i hadnt been handling this sort of deal in my life six do you agree  i suppose so  then thats settled is this man you talk about in new york  no hes down on long island at a place on the south shore  i mean can you get him on the phone and clinch the thing  oh yes i know his address and i suppose his numbers in the book  then go off at once and settle with him before somebody else snaps him up dont waste a minute  ginger paused at the door  i say youre absolutely sure about this  of course  i mean to say  get on said sally    2    the window of sallys sittingroom looked out on to a street which while not one of the citys important arteries was capable nevertheless of affording a certain amount of entertainment to the observer and after ginger had left she carried the morning paper to the windowsill and proceeded to divide her attention between a third reading of the fightreport and a lazy survey of the outer world it was a beautiful day and the outer world was looking its best  she had not been at her post for many minutes when a taxicab stopped at the apartmenthouse and she was surprised and interested to see her brother fillmore heave himself out of the interior he paid the driver and the cab moved off leaving him on the sidewalk casting a large shadow in the sunshine sally was on the point of calling to him when his behaviour became so odd that astonishment checked her  from where she sat fillmore had all the appearance of a man practising the steps of a new dance and sheer curiosity as to what he would do next kept sally watching in silence first he moved in a resolute sort of way towards the front door then suddenly stopping scuttled back this movement he repeated twice after which he stood in deep thought before making another dash for the door which like the others came to an abrupt end as though he had run into some invisible obstacle and finally wheeling sharply he bustled off down the street and was lost to view  sally could make nothing of it if fillmore had taken the trouble to come in a taxicab obviously to call upon her why had he abandoned the idea at her very threshold she was still speculating on this mystery when the telephonebell rang and her brothers voice spoke huskily in her ear  sally  hullo fill what are you going to call it  what am i call what  the dance you were doing outside here just now its your own invention isnt it  did you see me said fillmore upset  of course i saw you i was fascinated  ieri was coming to have a talk with you sally  fillmores voice trailed off  well why didnt you  there was a pauseon fillmores part if the timbre of at his voice correctly indicated his feelings a pause of discomfort something was plainly vexing fillmores great mind  sally he said at last and coughed hollowly into the receiver  yes  ithat is to say i have asked gladys gladys will be coming to see you very shortly will you be in  ill stay in how is gladys im longing to see her again  she is very well a triflea little upset  upset what about  she will tell you when she arrives i have just been phoning to her she is coming at once there was another pause im afraid she has bad news  what news  there was silence at the other end of the wire  what news repeated sally a little sharply she hated mysteries  but fillmore had rung off sally hung up the receiver thoughtfully she was puzzled and anxious however there being nothing to be gained by worrying she carried the breakfast things into the kitchen and tried to divert herself by washing up presently a ring at the doorbell brought her out to find her sisterinlaw  marriage even though it had brought with it the lofty position of partnership with the hope of the american stage had effected no noticeable alteration in the former miss winch as mrs fillmore she was the same square friendly creature she hugged sally in a muscular manner and went on in the sittingroom  well its great seeing you again she said i began to think you were never coming back what was the big idea springing over to england like that  sally had been expecting the question and answered it with composure  i wanted to help mr faucitt  whos mr faucitt  hasnt fillmore ever mentioned him he was a dear old man at the boardinghouse and his brother died and left him a dressmaking establishment in london he screamed to me to come and tell him what to do about it he has sold it now and is quite happy in the country  well the trips done you good said mrs fillmore youre prettier than ever  there was a pause already in these trivial opening exchanges sally had sensed a suggestion of unwonted gravity in her companion she missed that careless whimsicality which had been the chief characteristic of miss gladys winch and seemed to have been cast off by mrs fillmore nicholas at their meeting before she had spoken sally had not noticed this but now it was apparent that something was weighing on her companion mrs fillmores honest eyes were troubled  whats the bad news asked sally abruptly she wanted to end the suspense fillmore was telling me over the phone that you had some bad news for me  mrs fillmore scratched at the carpet for a moment with the end of her parasol without replying when she spoke it was not in answer to the question  sally whos this man carmyle over in england  oh did fillmore tell you about him  he told me there was a rich fellow over in england who was crazy about you and had asked you to marry him and that you had turned him down  sallys momentary annoyance faded she could hardly she felt have expected fillmore to refrain from mentioning the matter to his wife  yes she said thats true  you couldnt write and say youve changed your mind  sallys annoyance returned all her life she had been intensely independent resentful of interference with her private concerns  i suppose i could if i hadbut i havent did fillmore tell you to try to talk me round  oh im not trying to talk you round said mrs fillmore quickly goodness knows im the last person to try and jolly anyone into marrying anybody if they didnt feel like it ive seen too many marriages go wrong to do that look at elsa doland  sallys heart jumped as if an exposed nerve had been touched  elsa she stammered and hated herself because her voice shook hashas her marriage gone wrong  gone all to bits said mrs fillmore shortly you remember she married gerald foster the man who wrote the primrose way  sally with an effort repressed an hysterical laugh  yes i remember she said  well its all gone blooey ill tell you about that in a minute coming back to this man in england if youre in any doubt about it i mean you cant always tell right away whether youre fond of a man or not when first i met fillmore i couldnt see him with a spyglass and now hes just the whole shootingmatch but thats not what i wanted to talk about i was saying one doesnt always know ones own mind at first and if this fellow really is a good fellow and fillmore tells me hes got all the money in the world  sally stopped her  no its no good i dont want to marry mr carmyle  thats that then said mrs fillmore its a pity though  why are you taking it so much to heart said sally with a nervous laugh  well mrs fillmore paused sallys anxiety was growing it must she realized be something very serious indeed that had happened if it had the power to make her forthright sisterinlaw disjointed in her talk you see went on mrs fillmore and stopped again gee im hating this she murmured  what is it i dont understand  youll find its all too darned clear by the time im through said mrs fillmore mournfully if im going to explain this thing i guess id best start at the beginning you remember that revue of fillmoresthe one we both begged him not to put on it flopped  oh  yes it flopped on the road and died there never got to new york at all ike schumann wouldnt let fillmore have a theatre the book wanted fixing and the numbers wanted fixing and the scenery wasnt right and while they were tinkering with all that there was trouble about the cast and the actors equity closed the show best thing that could have happened really and i was glad at the time because going on with it would only have meant wasting more money and it had cost a fortune already after that fillmore put on a play of gerald fosters and that was a frost too it ran a week at the booth i hear the new piece hes got in rehearsal now is no good either its called the wild rose or something but fillmores got nothing to do with that  but sally tried to speak but mrs fillmore went on  dont talk just yet or i shall never get this thing straight well you know fillmore poor darling anyone else would have pulled in his horns and gone slow for a spell but hes one of those fellows whose horse is always going to win the next race the big killing is always just round the corner with him funny how you can see what a chump a man is and yet love him to death i remember saying something like that to you before he thought he could get it all back by staging this fight of his that came off in jersey city last night and if everything had gone right he might have got afloat again but it seems as if he cant touch anything without it turning to mud on the very day before the fight was to come off the poor mutt who was going against the champion goes and lets a sparringpartner of his own knock him down and fool around with him with all the newspaper men there too you probably saw about it in the papers it made a great story for them well that killed the whole thing the public had never been any too sure that this fellow bugs butler had a chance of putting up a scrap with the champion that would be worth paying to see and when they read that he couldnt even stop his sparringpartners slamming him all around the place they simply decided to stay away poor old fill it was a finisher for him the house wasnt a quarter full and after hed paid these two pluguglies their guarantees which they insisted on having before theyd so much as go into the ring he was just about cleaned out so there you are  sally had listened with dismay to this catalogue of misfortunes  oh poor fill she cried how dreadful  pretty tough  but the primrose way is a big success isnt it said sally anxious to discover something of brightness in the situation  it was mrs fillmore flushed again this is the part i hate having to tell you  it was do you mean it isnt still i thought elsa had made such a tremendous hit i read about it when i was over in london it was even in one of the english papers  yes she made a hit all right said mrs fillmore drily she made such a hit that all the other managements in new york were after her right away and fillmore had hardly sailed when she handed in her notice and signed up with goble and cohn for a new piece they are starring her in  ah she couldnt cried sally  my dear she did shes out on the road with it now i had to break the news to poor old fillmore at the dock when he landed it was rather a blow i must say it wasnt what i would call playing the game i know there isnt supposed to be any sentiment in business but after all we had given elsa her big chance but fillmore wouldnt put her name up over the theatre in electrics and goble and cohn made it a clause in her contract that they would so nothing else mattered people are like that  but elsa she used not to be like that  they all get that way they must grab success if its to be grabbed i suppose you cant blame them you might just as well expect a cat to keep off catnip still she might have waited to the end of the new york run mrs fillmore put out her hand and touched sallys well ive got it out now she said and believe me it was one rotten job you dont know how sorry i am sally i wouldnt have had it happen for a million dollars nor would fillmore im not sure that i blame him for getting cold feet and backing out of telling you himself he just hadnt the nerve to come and confess that he had fooled away your money he was hoping all along that this fight would pan out big and that hed be able to pay you back what you had loaned him but things didnt happen right  sally was silent she was thinking how strange it was that this room in which she had hoped to be so happy had been from the first moment of her occupancy a storm centre of bad news and miserable disillusionment in this first shock of the tidings it was the disillusionment that hurt most she had always been so fond of elsa and elsa had always seemed so fond of her she remembered that letter of elsas with all its protestations of gratitude it wasnt straight it was horrible callous selfish altogether horrible  its she choked as a rush of indignation brought the tears to her eyes its beastly im im not thinking about my money thats just bad luck but elsa  mrs fillmore shrugged her square shoulders  well its happening all the time in the show business she said and in every other business too i guess if one only knew enough about them to be able to say of course it hits you hard because elsa was a pal of yours and youre thinking she might have considered you after all youve done for her i cant say im much surprised myself mrs fillmore was talking rapidly and dimly sally understood that she was talking so that talk would carry her over this bad moment silence now would have been unendurable i was in the company with her and it sometimes seems to me as if you cant get to know a person right through till youve been in the same company with them elsas all right but shes two people really like these dual identity cases you read about shes awfully fond of you i know she is she was always saying so and it was quite genuine if it didnt interfere with business theres nothing she wouldnt do for you but when its a case of her career you dont count nobody counts not even her husband now thats funny if you think that sort of thing funny personally it gives me the willies  whats funny asked sally dully  well you werent there so you didnt see it but i was on the spot all the time and i know as well as i know anything that he simply married her because he thought she could get him on in the game he hardly paid any attention to her at all till she was such a riot in chicago and then he was all over her and now hes got stung she throws down his show and goes off to another fellows its like marrying for money and finding the girl hasnt any and shes got stung too in a way because im pretty sure she married him mostly because she thought he was going to be the next big man in the playwriting business and could boost her up the ladder and now it doesnt look as though he had another success in him the result is theyre at outs i hear hes drinking somebody whod seen him told me he had gone all to pieces you havent seen him i suppose  no  i thought maybe you might have run into him he lives right opposite  sally clutched at the arm of her chair  lives right opposite gerald foster what do you mean  across the passage there said mrs fillmore jerking her thumb at the door didnt you know thats right i suppose you didnt they moved in after you had beaten it for england elsa wanted to be near you and she was tickled to death when she found there was an apartment to be had right across from you now that just proves what i was saying a while ago about elsa if she wasnt fond of you would she go out of her way to camp next door and yet though shes so fond of you she doesnt hesitate about wrecking your property by quitting the show when she sees a chance of doing herself a bit of good its funny isnt it  the telephonebell tinkling sharply rescued sally from the necessity of a reply she forced herself across the room to answer it  hullo  gingers voice spoke jubilantly  hullo are you there i say its all right about that binge you know  oh yes  that dog fellow you know said ginger with a slight diminution of exuberance his sensitive ear had seemed to detect a lack of animation in her voice ive just been talking to him over the phone and its all settled if he added with a touch of doubt you still feel like going into it i mean  there was an instant in which sally hesitated but it was only an instant  why of course she said steadily why should you think i had changed my mind  well i thought that is to say you seemed oh i dont know  you imagine things i was a little worried about something when you called me up and my mind wasnt working properly of course go ahead with it ginger im delighted  i say im awfully sorry youre worried  oh its all right  something bad  nothing thatll kill me im young and strong  ginger was silent for a moment  i say i dont want to butt in but can i do anything  no really ginger i know you would do anything you could but this is just something i must worry through by myself when do you go down to this place  i was thinking of popping down this afternoon just to take a look round  let me know what train youre making and ill come and see you off  thats ripping of you right ho well so long  so long said sally  mrs fillmore who had been sitting in that state of suspended animation which comes upon people who are present at a telephone conversation which has nothing to do with themselves came to life as sally replaced the receiver  sally she said i think we ought to have a talk now about what youre going to do  sally was not feeling equal to any discussion of the future all she asked of the world at the moment was to be left alone  oh thats all right i shall manage you ought to be worrying about fillmore  fillmores got me to look after him said gladys with quiet determination youre the one thats on my mind i lay awake all last night thinking about you as far as i can make out from fillmore youve still a few thousand dollars left well as it happens i can put you on to a really good thing i know a girl  im afraid interrupted sally all the rest of my money what there is of it is tied up  you cant get hold of it  no  but listen said mrs fillmore urgently this is a really good thing this girl i know started an interior decorating business some time ago and is pulling in the money in handfuls but she wants more capital and shes willing to let go of a third of the business to anyone wholl put in a few thousand she wont have any difficulty getting it but i phoned her this morning to hold off till id heard from you honestly sally its the chance of a lifetime it would put you right on easy street isnt there really any way you could get your money out of this other thing and take on this deal  there really isnt im awfully obliged to you gladys dear but its impossible  well said mrs fillmore prodding the carpet energetically with her parasol i dont know what youve gone into but unless theyve given you a share in the mint or something youll be losing by not making the switch youre sure you cant do it  i really cant  mrs fillmore rose plainly disappointed  well you know best of course gosh what a muddle everything is sally she said suddenly stopping at the door youre not going to hate poor old fillmore over this are you  why of course not the whole thing was just bad luck  hes worried stiff about it  well give him my love and tell him not to be so silly  mrs fillmore crossed the room and kissed sally impulsively  youre an angel she said i wish there were more like you but i guess theyve lost the pattern well ill go back and tell fillmore that itll relieve him  the door closed and sally sat down with her chin in her hands to think    3    mr isadore abrahams the founder and proprietor of that deservedly popular dancing resort poetically named the flower garden leaned back in his chair with a contented sigh and laid down the knife and fork with which he had been assailing a plateful of succulent goulash he was dining as was his admirable custom in the bosom of his family at his residence at far rockaway across the table his wife rebecca beamed at him over her comfortable plinth of chins and round the table his children david jacob morris and saide would have beamed at him if they had not been too busy at the moment ingurgitating goulash a genial honest domestic man was mr abrahams a credit to the community  mother he said  pa said mrs abrahams  knew there was something id meant to tell you said mr abrahams absently chasing a piece of bread round his plate with a stout finger you remember that girl i told you about some time backgirl working at the gardengirl called nicholas who came into a bit of money and threw up her job  i remember you liked her jakie dear dont gobble  aint gobbling said master abrahams  everybody liked her said mr abrahams the nicest girl i ever hired and i dont hire none but nice girls because the gardens a nice place and i like to run it nice i wouldnt give you a nickel for any of your tough joints where you get nothing but lowlifes and scare away all the real folks everybody liked sally nicholas always pleasant and always smiling and never anything but the lady it was a treat to have her around well what do you think  dead inquired mrs abrahams apprehensively the story had sounded to her as though it were heading that way wipe your mouth jakie dear  no not dead said mr abrahams conscious for the first time that the remainder of his narrative might be considered by a critic something of an anticlimax and lacking in drama but she was in to see me this afternoon and wants her job back  ah said mrs abrahams rather tonelessly an ardent supporter of the local motionpicture palace she had hoped for a slightly more gingery denouement something with a bit more punch  yes but dont it show you continued mr abrahams gallantly trying to work up the interest theres this girl goes out of my place not moren a year ago with a good bankroll in her pocket and here she is back again all of it spent dont it show you what a tragedy life is if you see what i mean and how careful one ought to be about money its what i call a human document goodness knows how shes been and gone and spent it all id never have thought she was the sort of girl to go gadding around always seemed to me to be kind of sensible  whats gadding pop asked master jakie the goulash having ceased to chain his interest  well she wanted her job back and i gave it to her and glad to get her back again theres class to that girl shes the sort of girl i want in the place dont seem quite to have so much getup in her as she used to seems kind of quieted down but shes got class and im glad shes back i hope shell stay but dont it show you  ah said mrs abrahams with more enthusiasm than before it had not worked out such a bad story after all in its essentials it was not unlike the film she had seen the previous eveninggloria gooch in a girl against the world  pop said master abrahams  yes jakie  when im grown up i wont never lose no money ill put it in the bank and save it  the slight depression caused by the contemplation of sallys troubles left mr abrahams as mist melts beneath a sunbeam  thats a good boy jakie he said  he felt in his waistcoat pocket found a dime put it back again and bent forward and patted master abrahams on the head     chapter xv uncle donald speaks his mind    there is in certain menand bruce carmyle was one of thema quality of resilience a sturdy refusal to acknowledge defeat which aids them as effectively in affairs of the heart as in encounters of a sterner and more practical kind as a wooer bruce carmyle resembled that durable type of pugilist who can only give of his best after he has received at least one substantial wallop on some tender spot although sally had refused his offer of marriage quite definitely at monks crofton it had never occurred to him to consider the episode closed all his life he had been accustomed to getting what he wanted and he meant to get it now  he was quite sure that he wanted sally there had been moments when he had been conscious of certain doubts but in the smart of temporary defeat these had vanished that streak of bohemianism in her which from time to time since their first meeting had jarred upon his orderly mind was forgotten and all that mr carmyle could remember was the brightness of her eyes the jaunty lift of her chin and the gallant trimness of her her gay prettiness seemed to flick at him like a whip in the darkness of wakeful nights lashing him to pursuit and quietly and methodically like a respectable wolf settling on the trail of a red riding hood he prepared to pursue delicacy and imagination might have kept him back but in these qualities he had never been strong one cannot have everything  his preparations for departure though he did his best to make them swiftly and secretly did not escape the notice of the family in many english families there seems to exist a system of intercommunication and newsdistribution like that of those savage tribes in africa who pass the latest item of news and interest from point to point over miles of intervening jungle by some telepathic method never properly explained on his last night in london there entered to bruce carmyle at his apartment in south audley street the familys chosen representative the man to whom the family pointed with prideuncle donald in the flesh  there were two hundred and forty pounds of the flesh uncle donald was in and the chair in which he deposited it creaked beneath its burden once at monks crofton sally had spoiled a whole morning for her brother fillmore by indicating uncle donald as the exact image of what he would be when he grew up a superstition cherished from early schooldays that he had a weak heart had caused the familys managing director to abstain from every form of exercise for nearly fifty years and as he combined with a distaste for exercise one of the three heartiest appetites in the southwestern postal division of london uncle donald at sixtytwo was not a man one would willingly have lounging in ones armchairs bruce carmyles customary respectfulness was tinged with something approaching dislike as he looked at him  uncle donalds walrus moustache heaved gently upon his laboured breath like seaweed on a groundswell there had been stairs to climb  whats this whats this he contrived to ejaculate at last you packing  yes said mr carmyle shortly for the first time in his life he was conscious of that sensation of furtive guilt which was habitual with his cousin ginger when in the presence of this large mackereleyed man  you going away  yes  where you going  america  when you going  tomorrow morning  why you going  this dialogue has been set down as though it had been as brisk and snappy as any crosstalk between vaudeville comedians but in reality uncle donalds peculiar methods of conversation had stretched it over a period of nearly three minutes for after each reply and before each question he had puffed and sighed and inhaled his moustache with such painful deliberation that his companions nerves were finding it difficult to bear up under the strain  youre going after that girl said uncle donald accusingly  bruce carmyle flushed darkly and it is interesting to record that at this moment there flitted through his mind the thought that gingers behaviour at blekes coffee house on a certain notable occasion had not been so utterly inexcusable as he had supposed there was no doubt that the familys chosen one could be trying  will you have a whisky and soda uncle donald he said by way of changing the conversation  yes said his relative in pursuance of a vow he had made in the early eighties never to refuse an offer of this kind gimme  you would have thought that that would have put matters on a pleasanter footing but no having lapped up the restorative uncle donald returned to the attack quite unsoftened  never thought you were a fool before he said severely  bruce carmyles proud spirit chafed this sort of interview which had become a commonplace with his cousin ginger was new to him hitherto his actions had received neither criticism nor been subjected to it  im not a fool  you are a fool a damn fool continued uncle donald specifying more exactly dont like the girl never did not a nice girl didnt like her right from the first  need we discuss this said bruce carmyle dropping as he was apt to do into the grand manner  the head of the family drank in a layer of moustache and blew it out again  need we discuss it he said with asperity were going to discuss it whatch think i climbed all these blasted stairs for with my weak heart gimme another  mr carmyle gave him another  s a bad business moaned uncle donald having gone through the movements once more shocking bad business if your poor father were alive whatch think hed say to your tearing across the world after this girl ill tell you what hed say hed say what kind of whiskys this  orafferty special  new to me not bad quite good sound mellow wherej get it  bilbys in oxford street  must order some mellow hed say well god knows what hed say whatch doing it for whatch doing it for thats what i cant see none of us can see puzzles your uncle george baffles your aunt geraldine nobody can understand it girls simply after your money anyone can see that  pardon me uncle donald said mr carmyle stiffly but that is surely rather absurd if that were the case why should she have refused me at monks crofton  drawing you on said uncle donald promptly luring you on wellknown trick girl in 1881 when i was at oxford tried to lure me on if i hadnt had some sense and a weak heart whatch know of this girl whatch know of her thats the point who is she wherej meet her  i met her at roville in france  travelling with her family  travelling alone said bruce carmyle reluctantly  not even with that brother of hers bad said uncle donald bad bad  american girls are accustomed to more independence than english girls  that young man said uncle donald pursuing a train of thought is going to be fat one of these days if he doesnt look out travelling alone was she what did you do catch her eye on the pier  really uncle donald  well must have got to know her somehow  i was introduced to her by lancelot she was a friend of his  lancelot exploded uncle donald quivering all over like a smitten jelly at the loathed name well that shows you what sort of a girl she is any girl that would be a friend of unpack  i beg your pardon  unpack mustnt go on with this foolery out of the question find some girl make you a good wife your aunt marys been meeting some people name of bassingtonbassington related kent bassingtonbassingtons eldest daughter charming girl just do for you  outside the pages of the more oldfashioned type of fiction nobody ever really ground his teeth but bruce carmyle came nearer to it at that moment than anyone had ever come before he scowled blackly and the last trace of suavity left him  i shall do nothing of the kind he said briefly i sail tomorrow  uncle donald had had a previous experience of being defied by a nephew but it had not accustomed him to the sensation he was aware of an unpleasant feeling of impotence nothing is harder than to know what to do next when defied  eh he said  mr carmyle having started to defy evidently decided to make a good job of it  i am over twentyone said he i am financially independent i shall do as i please  but consider pleaded uncle donald painfully conscious of the weakness of his words reflect  i have reflected  your position in the county  ive thought of that  you could marry anyone you pleased  im going to  you are determined to go running off to godknowswhere after this miss icantevenrememberherdamname  yes  have you considered said uncle donald portentously that you owe a duty to the family  bruce carmyles patience snapped and he sank like a stone to absolutely gingerian depths of plainspokenness  oh damn the family he cried  there was a painful silence broken only by the relieved sigh of the armchair as uncle donald heaved himself out of it  after that said uncle donald i have nothing more to say  good said mr carmyle rudely lost to all shame  cept this if you come back married to that girl ill cut you in piccadilly by george i will  he moved to the door bruce carmyle looked down his nose without speaking a tense moment  what asked uncle donald his fingers on the handle did you say it was called  what was what called  that whisky  orafferty special  and wherj get it  bilbys in oxford street  ill make a note of it said uncle donald     chapter xvi at the flower garden    1    and after all ive done for her said mr reginald cracknell his voice tremulous with selfpity and his eyes moist with the combined effects of anguish and overindulgence in his celebrated private stock after all ive done for her she throws me down  sally did not reply the orchestra of the flower garden was of a calibre that discouraged vocal competition and she was having moreover too much difficulty in adjusting her feet to mr cracknells erratic dancesteps to employ her attention elsewhere they manoeuvred jerkily past the table where miss mabel hobson the flower gardens newest hostess sat watching the revels with a distant hauteur miss hobson was looking her most regal in old gold and black and a sorrowful gulp escaped the stricken mr cracknell as he shambled beneath her eye  if i told you he moaned in sallys ear what was that your ankle sorry dont know what im doing tonight if i told you what i had spent on that woman you wouldnt believe it and then she throws me down and all because i said i didnt like her in that hat she hasnt spoken to me for a week and wont answer when i call up on the phone and i was right too it was a rotten hat didnt suit her a bit but that said mr cracknell morosely is a woman all over  sally uttered a stifled exclamation as his wandering foot descended on hers before she could get it out of the way mr cracknell interpreted the ejaculation as a protest against the sweeping harshness of his last remark and gallantly tried to make amends  i dont mean youre like that he said youre different i could see that directly i saw you you have a sympathetic nature thats why im telling you all this youre a sensible and broadminded girl and can understand ive done everything for that woman i got her this job as hostess hereyou wouldnt believe what they pay her i starred her in a show once did you see those pearls she was wearing i gave her those and she wont speak to me just because i didnt like her hat i wish you could have seen that hat you would agree with me i know because youre a sensible broadminded girl and understand hats i dont know what to do i come here every night sally was aware of this she had seen him often but this was the first time that lee schoenstein the gentlemanly master of ceremonies had inflicted him on her i come here every night and dance past her table but she wont look at me what asked mr cracknell tears welling in his pale eyes would you do about it  i dont know said sally frankly  nor do i i thought you wouldnt because youre a sensible broadminded i mean nor do i im having one last try tonight if you can keep a secret you wont tell anyone will you pleaded mr cracknell urgently but i know you wont because youre a sensible im giving her a little present having it brought here tonight little present that ought to soften her dont you think  a big one would do it better  mr cracknell kicked her on the shin in a dismayed sort of way  i never thought of that perhaps youre right but its too late now still it might or wouldnt it which do you think  yes said sally  i thought as much said mr cracknell  the orchestra stopped with a thump and a bang leaving mr cracknell clapping feebly in the middle of the floor sally slipped back to her table her late partner after an uncertain glance about him as if he had mislaid something but could not remember what zigzagged off in search of his own seat the noise of many conversations drowned by the music broke out with renewed vigour the hot close air was full of voices and sally pressing her hands on her closed eyes was reminded once more that she had a headache  nearly a month had passed since her return to mr abrahams employment it had been a dull leaden month a monotonous succession of lifeless days during which life had become a bad dream in some strange nightmare fashion she seemed nowadays to be cut off from her kind it was weeks since she had seen a familiar face none of the companions of her old boardinghouse days had crossed her path fillmore no doubt from uneasiness of conscience had not sought her out and ginger was working out his destiny on the south shore of long island  she lowered her hands and opened her eyes and looked at the room it was crowded as always the flower garden was one of the many establishments of the same kind which had swum to popularity on the rising flood of new yorks dancing craze and doubtless because as its proprietor had claimed it was a nice place and run nice it had continued unlike many of its rivals to enjoy unvarying prosperity in its advertisement it described itself as a supperclub for aftertheatre dining and dancing adding that large and spacious and sumptuously appointed it was one of the towns wonderplaces with its incomparable dancefloor enchanting music cuisine and service de luxe from which it may be gathered even without his personal statements to that effect that isadore abrahams thought well of the place  there had been a time when sally had liked it too in her first period of employment there she had found it diverting stimulating and full of entertainment but in those days she had never had headaches or what was worse this dreadful listless depression which weighed her down and made her nightly work a burden  miss nicholas  the orchestra never silent for long at the flower garden had started again and lee schoenstein the master of ceremonies was presenting a new partner she got up mechanically  this is the first time i have been in this place said the man as they bumped over the crowded floor he was big and clumsy of course tonight it seemed to sally that the whole world was big and clumsy its a swell place i come from upstate myself we got nothing like this where i come from he cleared a space before him using sally as a batteringram and sally though she had not enjoyed her recent excursion with mr cracknell now began to look back to it almost with wistfulness this man was undoubtedly the worst dancer in america  give me lil old new york said the man from upstate unpatriotically its good enough for me i been to some swell shows since i got to town you seen this years follies  no  you go said the man earnestly you go take it from me its a swell show you seen myrtle takes a turkish bath  i dont go to many theatres  you go its a scream i been to a show every night since i got here every night regular swell shows all of em except this last one i certnly picked a lemon tonight all right i was taking a chance ysee because it was an opening thought it would be something to say when i got home that id been to a new york opening set me back twoseventyfive including tax and i wish id got it in my kick right now the wild rose they called it he said satirically as if exposing a low subterfuge on the part of the management the wild rose it sure made me wild all right two dollars seventyfive tossed away just like that  something stirred in sallys memory why did that title seem so familiar then with a shock she remembered it was geralds new play for some time after her return to new york she had been haunted by the fear lest coming out of her apartment she might meet him coming out of his and then she had seen a paragraph in her morning paper which had relieved her of this apprehension gerald was out on the road with a new play and the wild rose she was almost sure was the name of it  is that gerald fosters play she asked quickly  i dont know who wrote it said her partner but let me tell you hes one lucky guy to get away alive theres fellows breaking stones on the ossining road thats done a lot less to deserve a sentence wild rose ill tell the world it made me go good and wild said the man from upstate an economical soul who disliked waste and was accustomed to spread out his humorous efforts so as to give them every chance why before the second act was over the people were beating it for the exits and if it hadnt been for someone shouting women and children first thered have been a panic  sally found herself back at her table without knowing clearly how she had got there  miss nicholas  she started to rise and was aware suddenly that this was not the voice of duty calling her once more through the gold teeth of mr schoenstein the man who had spoken her name had seated himself beside her and was talking in precise clipped accents oddly familiar the mist cleared from her eyes and she recognized bruce carmyle    2    i called at your place mr carmyle was saying and the hall porter told me that you were here so i ventured to follow you i hope you do not mind may i smoke  he lit a cigarette with something of an air his fingers trembled as he raised the match but he flattered himself that there was nothing else in his demeanour to indicate that he was violently excited bruce carmyles ideal was the strong man who can rise superior to his emotions he was alive to the fact that this was an embarrassing moment but he was determined not to show that he appreciated it he cast a sideways glance at sally and thought that never not even in the garden at monks crofton on a certain momentous occasion had he seen her looking prettier her face was flushed and her eyes aflame the stout wraith of uncle donald which had accompanied mr carmyle on this expedition of his faded into nothingness as he gazed  there was a pause mr carmyle having lighted his cigarette puffed vigorously  when did you land asked sally feeling the need of saying something her mind was confused she could not have said whether she was glad or sorry that he was there glad she thought on the whole there was something in his dark cool stiff english aspect that gave her a curious feeling of relief he was so unlike mr cracknell and the man from upstate and so calmly remote from the feverish atmosphere in which she lived her nights that it was restful to look at him  i landed tonight said bruce carmyle turning and faced her squarely  tonight  we docked at ten  he turned away again he had made his effect and was content to leave her to think it over  sally was silent the significance of his words had not escaped her she realized that his presence there was a challenge which she must answer and yet it hardly stirred her she had been fighting so long and she felt utterly inert she was like a swimmer who can battle no longer and prepares to yield to the numbness of exhaustion the heat of the room pressed down on her like a smothering blanket her tired nerves cried out under the blare of music and the clatter of voices  shall we dance this he asked  the orchestra had started to play again a sensuous creamy melody which was making the most of its brief reign as broadways leading songhit overfamiliar to her from a hundred repetitions  if you like  efficiency was bruce carmyles gospel he was one of these men who do not attempt anything which they cannot accomplish to perfection dancing he had decided early in his life was a part of a gentlemans education and he had seen to it that he was educated thoroughly sally who as they swept out on to the floor had braced herself automatically for a repetition of the usual bumping struggle which dancing at the flower garden had come to mean for her found herself in the arms of a masterful expert a man who danced better than she did and suddenly there came to her a feeling that was almost gratitude a miraculous slackening of her taut nerves a delicious peace soothed and contented she yielded herself with eyes half closed to the rhythm of the melody finding it now robbed in some mysterious manner of all its stale cheapness and in that moment her whole attitude towards bruce carmyle underwent a complete change  she had never troubled to examine with any minuteness her feelings towards him but one thing she had known clearly since their first meetingthat he was physically distasteful to her for all his good looks and in his rather sinister way he was a handsome man she had shrunk from him now spirited away by the magic of the dance that repugnance had left her it was as if some barrier had been broken down between them  sally  she felt his arm tighten about her the muscles quivering she caught sight of his face his dark eyes suddenly blazed into hers and she stumbled with an odd feeling of helplessness realizing with a shock that brought her with a jerk out of the halfdream into which she had been lulled that this dance had not postponed the moment of decision as she had looked to it to do in a hot whisper the words swept away on the flood of the music which had suddenly become raucous and blaring once more he was repeating what he had said under the trees at monks crofton on that faroff morning in the english springtime dizzily she knew that she was resenting the unfairness of the attack at such a moment but her mind seemed numbed  the music stopped abruptly insistent clapping started it again but sally moved away to her table and he followed her like a shadow neither spoke bruce carmyle had said his say and sally was sitting staring before her trying to think she was tired tired her eyes were burning she tried to force herself to face the situation squarely was it worth struggling was anything in the world worth a struggle she only knew that she was tired desperately tired tired to the very depths of her soul  the music stopped there was more clapping but this time the orchestra did not respond gradually the floor emptied the shuffling of feet ceased the flower garden was as quiet as it was ever able to be even the voices of the babblers seemed strangely hushed sally closed her eyes and as she did so from somewhere up near the roof there came the song of a bird  isadore abrahams was a man of his word he advertised a flower garden and he had tried to give the public something as closely resembling a flowergarden as it was possible for an overcrowded overheated overnoisy broadway dancingresort to achieve paper roses festooned the walls genuine tulips bloomed in tubs by every pillar and from the roof hung cages with birds in them one of these stirred by the sudden cessation of the tumult below had began to sing  sally had often pitied these birds and more than once had pleaded in vain with abrahams for a remission of their sentence but somehow at this moment it did not occur to her that this one was merely praying in its own language as she often had prayed in her thoughts to be taken out of this place to her sitting there wrestling with fate the song seemed cheerful it soothed her it healed her to listen to it and suddenly before her eyes there rose a vision of monks crofton cool green and peaceful under the mild english sun luring her as an oasis seen in the distance lures the desert traveller  she became aware that the master of monks crofton had placed his hand on hers and was holding it in a tightening grip she looked down and gave a little shiver she had always disliked bruce carmyles hands they were strong and bony and black hair grew on the back of them one of the earliest feelings regarding him had been that she would hate to have those hands touching her but she did not move again that vision of the old garden had flickered across her mind a haven where she could rest  he was leaning towards her whispering in her ear the room was hotter than it had ever been noisier than it had ever been fuller than it had ever been the bird on the roof was singing again and now she understood what it said take me out of this did anything matter except that what did it matter how one was taken or where or by whom so that one was taken  monks crofton was looking cool and green and peaceful  very well said sally  3    bruce carmyle in the capacity of accepted suitor found himself at something of a loss he had a dissatisfied feeling it was not the manner of sallys acceptance that caused this it would of course have pleased him better if she had shown more warmth but he was prepared to wait for warmth what did trouble him was the fact that his correct mind perceived now for the first time that he had chosen an unsuitable moment and place for his outburst of emotion he belonged to the orthodox school of thought which looks on moonlight and solitude as the proper setting for a proposal of marriage and the surroundings of the flower garden for all its niceness and the nice manner in which it was conducted jarred upon him profoundly  music had begun again but it was not the soft music such as a lover demands if he is to give of his best it was a brassy clashy rendering of a ribald onestep enough to choke the eloquence of the most ardent couples were dipping and swaying and bumping into one another as far as the eye could reach while just behind him two waiters had halted in order to thrash out one of those voluble arguments in which waiters love to indulge to continue the scene at the proper emotional level was impossible and bruce carmyle began his career as an engaged man by dropping into smalltalk  deuce of a lot of noise he said querulously  yes agreed sally  is it always like this  oh yes  infernal racket  yes  the romantic side of mr carmyles nature could have cried aloud at the hideous unworthiness of these banalities in the visions which he had had of himself as a successful wooer it had always been in the moments immediately succeeding the allimportant question and its whispered reply that he had come out particularly strong he had been accustomed to picture himself bending with a proud tenderness over his partner in the scene and murmuring some notably good things to her bowed head how could any man murmur in a pandemonium like this from tenderness bruce carmyle descended with a sharp swoop to irritability  do you often come here  yes  what for  to dance  mr carmyle chafed helplessly the scene which should be so romantic had suddenly reminded him of the occasion when at the age of twenty he had attended his first ball and had sat in a corner behind a potted palm perspiring shyly and endeavouring to make conversation to a formidable nymph in pink it was one of the few occasions in his life at which he had ever been at a complete disadvantage he could still remember the clammy discomfort of his too high collar as it melted on him most certainly it was not a scene which he enjoyed recalling and that he should be forced to recall it now at what ought to have been the supreme moment of his life annoyed him intensely almost angrily he endeavoured to jerk the conversation to a higher level  darling he murmured for by moving his chair two feet to the right and bending sideways he found that he was in a position to murmur you have made me so  batti batti i presto ravioli hollandaise cried one of the disputing waiters at his backor to bruce carmyles prejudiced hearing it sounded like that  la donna e mobile spaghetti napoli tettrazina rejoined the second waiter with spirit   you have made me so  infanta isabella lope de vegas mulligatawny toronto said the first waiter weak but coming back pluckily   so happy  funiculi funicula vincente y blasco ibanez vermicelli sul campo della gloria risotto said the second waiter clinchingly and scored a technical knockout  bruce carmyle gave it up and lit a moody cigarette he was oppressed by that feeling which so many of us have felt in our time that it was all wrong  the music stopped the two leading citizens of little italy vanished and went their way probably to start a vendetta there followed comparative calm but bruce carmyles emotions like sweet bells jangled were out of tune and he could not recapture the first fine careless rapture he found nothing within him but smalltalk  what has become of your party he asked  my party  the people you are with said mr carmyle even in the stress of his emotion this problem had been exercising him in his correctly ordered world girls did not go to restaurants alone  im not with anybody  you came here by yourself exclaimed bruce carmyle frankly aghast and as he spoke the wraith of uncle donald banished till now returned as large as ever puffing disapproval through a walrus moustache  i am employed here said sally  mr carmyle started violently  employed here  as a dancer you know i  sally broke off her attention abruptly diverted to something which had just caught her eye at a table on the other side of the room that something was a redheaded young man of sturdy build who had just appeared beside the chair in which mr reginald cracknell was sitting in huddled gloom in one hand he carried a basket and from this basket rising above the din of conversation there came a sudden sharp yapping mr cracknell roused himself from his stupor took the basket raised the lid the yapping increased in volume  mr cracknell rose the basket in his arms with uncertain steps and a look on his face like that of those who lead forlorn hopes he crossed the floor to where miss mabel hobson sat proud and aloof the next moment that haughty lady the centre of an admiring and curious crowd was hugging to her bosom a protesting pekingese puppy and mr cracknell seizing his opportunity like a good general had deposited himself in a chair at her side the course of true love was running smooth again  the redheaded young man was gazing fixedly at sally  as a dancer ejaculated mr carmyle of all those within sight of the moving drama which had just taken place he alone had paid no attention to it replete as it was with human interest sexappeal the punch and all the other qualities which a drama should possess it had failed to grip him his thoughts had been elsewhere the accusing figure of uncle donald refused to vanish from his mental eye the stern voice of uncle donald seemed still to ring in his ear  a dancer a professional dancer at a broadway restaurant hideous doubts began to creep like snakes into bruce carmyles mind what he asked himself did he really know of this girl on whom he had bestowed the priceless boon of his society for life how did he know what she washe could not find the exact adjective to express his meaning but he knew what he meant was she worthy of the boon that was what it amounted to all his life he had had a prim shrinking from the section of the feminine world which is connected with the lightlife of large cities club acquaintances of his in london had from time to time married into the gaiety chorus and mr carmyle though he had no objection to the gaiety chorus in its proper placeon the other side of the footlightshad always looked on these young men after as social outcasts the fine dashing frenzy which had brought him all the way from south audley street to win sally was ebbing fast  sally hearing him speak had turned and there was a candid honesty in her gaze which for a moment sent all those creeping doubts scuttling away into the darkness whence they had come he had not made a fool of himself he protested to the lowering phantom of uncle donald who he demanded could look at sally and think for an instant that she was not all that was perfect and lovable a warm revulsion of feeling swept over bruce carmyle like a returning tide  you see i lost my money and had to do something said sally  i see i see murmured mr carmyle and if only fate had left him alone who knows to what heights of tenderness he might not have soared but at this moment fate being no respecter of persons sent into his life the disturbing personality of george washington williams  george washington williams was the talented coloured gentleman who had been extracted from smalltime vaudeville by mr abrahams to do a nightly speciality at the flower garden he was in fact a trapdrummer and it was his amiable practice after he had done a few minutes trapdrumming to rise from his seat and make a circular tour of the tables on the edge of the dancingfloor whimsically pretending to clip the locks of the male patrons with a pair of drumsticks held scissorwise and so it came about that just as mr carmyle was bending towards sally in an access of manly sentiment and was on the very verge of pouring out his soul in a series of wellphrased remarks he was surprised and annoyed to find an ethiopian to whom he had never been introduced leaning over him and taking quite unpardonable liberties with his back hair  one says that mr carmyle was annoyed the word is weak the interruption coming at such a moment jarred every ganglion in his body the clicking noise of the drumsticks maddened him and the gleaming whiteness of mr williams friendly and benignant smile was the last straw his dignity writhed beneath this abominable infliction people at other tables were laughing at him a loathing for the flower garden flowed over bruce carmyle and with it a feeling of suspicion and disapproval of everyone connected with the establishment he sprang to his feet  i think i will be going he said  sally did not reply she was watching ginger who still stood beside the table recently vacated by reginald cracknell  good night said mr carmyle between his teeth  oh are you going said sally with a start she felt embarrassed try as she would she was unable to find words of any intimacy she tried to realize that she had promised to marry this man but never before had he seemed so much a stranger to her so little a part of her life it came to her with a sensation of the incredible that she had done this thing taken this irrevocable step  the sudden sight of ginger had shaken her it was as though in the last halfhour she had forgotten him and only now realized what marriage with bruce carmyle would mean to their comradeship from now on he was dead to her if anything in this world was certain that was sally nicholas was gingers pal but mrs carmyle she realized would never be allowed to see him again a devastating feeling of loss smote her like a blow  yes ive had enough of this place bruce carmyle was saying  good night said sally she hesitated when shall i see you she asked awkwardly  it occurred to bruce carmyle that he was not showing himself at his best he had he perceived allowed his nerves to run away with him  you dont mind if i go he said more amiably the fact is i cant stand this place any longer ill tell you one thing im going to take you out of here quick  im afraid i cant leave at a moments notice said sally loyal to her obligations  well talk over that tomorrow ill call for you in the morning and take you for a drive somewhere in a car you want some fresh air after this mr carmyle looked about him in stiff disgust and expressed his unalterable sentiments concerning the flower garden that apple of isadore abrahams eye in a snort of loathing my god what a place  he walked quickly away and disappeared and ginger beaming happily swooped on sallys table like a homing pigeon    4    good lord i say what ho cried ginger fancy meeting you here what a bit of luck he glanced over his shoulder warily has that blighter pipped  pipped  popped explained ginger i mean to say he isnt coming back or any rot like that is he  mr carmyle no he has gone  sound egg said ginger with satisfaction for a moment when i saw you yarning away together i thought he might be with your party what on earth is he doing over here at all confound him hes got all europe to play about in why should he come infesting new york i say it really is ripping seeing you again it seems years of course one gets a certain amount of satisfaction writing letters but its not the same besides i write such rotten letters i say this really is rather priceless cant i get you something a cup of coffee i mean or an egg or something by jove this really is tophole  his homely honest face glowed with pleasure and it seemed to sally as though she had come out of a winters night into a warm friendly room her mercurial spirits soared  oh ginger if you knew what its like seeing you  no really do you mean honestly youre braced  i should say i am braced  well isnt that fine i was afraid you might have forgotten me  forgotten you  with something of the effect of a revelation it suddenly struck sally how far she had been from forgetting him how large was the place he had occupied in her thoughts  ive missed you dreadfully she said and felt the words inadequate as she uttered them  what ho said ginger also internally condemning the poverty of speech as a vehicle for conveying thought  there was a brief silence the first exhilaration of the reunion over sally deep down in her heart was aware of a troubled feeling as though the world were out of joint she forced herself to ignore it but it would not be ignored it grew dimly she was beginning to realize what ginger meant to her and she fought to keep herself from realizing it strange things were happening to her tonight strange emotions stirring her ginger seemed somehow different as if she were really seeing him for the first time  youre looking wonderfully well she said trying to keep the conversation on a pedestrian level  i am well said ginger never felt fitter in my life been out in the open all day long simple life and all that working like blazes i say business is booming did you see me just now handing over percy the pup to whatshisname five hundred dollars on that one deal got the cheque in my pocket but what an extraordinarily rummy thing that i should have come to this place to deliver the goods just when you happened to be here i couldnt believe my eyes at first i say i hope the people youre with wont think im butting in youll have to explain that were old pals and that you started me in business and all that sort of thing look here he said lowering his voice i know how you hate being thanked but i simply must say how terrifically decent  miss nicholas  lee schoenstein was standing at the table and by his side an expectant youth with a small moustache and pincenez sally got up and the next moment ginger was alone gaping perplexedly after her as she vanished and reappeared in the jogging throng on the dancing floor it was the nearest thing ginger had seen to a conjuring trick and at that moment he was illattuned to conjuring tricks he brooded fuming at what seemed to him the supremest exhibition of pure cheek of monumental nerve and of undiluted crust that had ever come within his notice to come and charge into a private conversation like that and whisk her away without a word  who was that blighter he demanded with heat when the music ceased and sally limped back  that was mr schoenstein  and who was the other  the one i danced with i dont know  you dont know  sally perceived that the conversation had arrived at an embarrassing point there was nothing for it but candour  ginger she said you remember my telling you when we first met that i used to dance in a broadway place this is the place im working again  complete unintelligence showed itself on gingers every feature  i dont understand he saidunnecessarily for his face revealed the fact  ive got my old job back  but why  well i had to do something she went on rapidly already a light dimly resembling the light of understanding was beginning to appear in gingers eyes fillmore went smash you knowit wasnt his fault poor dear he had the worst kind of luckand most of my money was tied up in his business so you see  she broke off confused by the look in his eyes conscious of an absurd feeling of guilt there was amazement in that look and a sort of incredulous horror  do you mean to say ginger gulped and started again do you mean to tell me that you let me have all that money for the dogbusiness when you were broke do you mean to say  sally stole a glance at his crimson face and looked away again quickly there was an electric silence  look here exploded ginger with sudden violence youve got to marry me youve jolly well got to marry me i dont mean that he added quickly i mean to say i know youre going to marry whoever you please but wont you marry me sally for gods sake have a dash at it ive been keeping it in all this time because it seemed rather rotten to bother you about it but nowoh dammit i wish i could put it into words i always was rotten at talking but well look here what i mean is i know im not much of a chap but it seems to me you must care for me a bit to do a thing like that for a fellow and ive loved you like the dickens ever since i met you i do wish youd have a stab at it sally at least i could look after you you know and all that i mean to say work like the deuce and try to give you a good time im not such an ass as to think a girl like you could ever really er love a blighter like me but  sally laid her hand on his  ginger dear she said i do love you i ought to have known it all along but i seem to be understanding myself tonight for the first time she got up and bent over him for a swift moment whispering in his ear i shall never love anyone but you ginger will you try to remember that she was moving away but he caught at her arm and stopped her  sally  she pulled her arm away her face working as she fought against the tears that would not keep back  ive made a fool of myself she said ginger your cousin mr carmyle just now he asked me to marry him and i said i would  she was gone flitting among the tables like some wild creature running to its home and ginger motionless watched her go    5    the telephonebell in sallys little sittingroom was ringing jerkily as she let herself in at the front door she guessed who it was at the other end of the wire and the noise of the bell sounded to her like the voice of a friend in distress crying for help without stopping to close the door she ran to the table and unhooked the receiver muffled plaintive sounds were coming over the wire  hullo hullo i say hullo  hullo ginger said sally quietly  an ejaculation that was half a shout and half gurgle answered her  sally is that you  yes here i am ginger  ive been trying to get you for ages  ive only just come in i walked home  there was a pause  hullo  yes  well i mean ginger seemed to be finding his usual difficulty in expressing himself about that you know what you said  yes said sally trying to keep her voice from shaking  you said again gingers vocabulary failed him you said you loved me  yes said sally simply  another odd sound floated over the wire and there was a moment of silence before ginger found himself able to resume  i i well we can talk about that when we meet i mean its no good trying to say what i think over the phone im sort of knocked out i never dreamed but i say what did you mean about bruce  i told you i told you sallys face was twisted and the receiver shook in her hand ive made a fool of myself i never realized and now its too late  good god gingers voice rose in a sharp wail you cant mean you really you dont seriously intend to marry the man  i must ive promised  but good heavens  its no good i must  but the mans a blighter  i cant break my word  i never heard such rot said ginger vehemently of course you can a girl isnt expected  i cant ginger dear i really cant  but look here  its really no good talking about it any more really it isnt where are you staying tonight  staying me at the plaza but look here  sally found herself laughing weakly  at the plaza oh ginger you really do want somebody to look after you squandering your pennies like that well dont talk any more now its so late and im so tired ill come and see you tomorrow good night  she hung up the receiver quickly to cut short a fresh outburst of protest and as she turned away a voice spoke behind her  sally  gerald foster was standing in the doorway     chapter xvii sally lays a ghost    1    the blood flowed slowly back into sallys face and her heart which had leaped madly for an instant at the sound of his voice resumed its normal beat the suddenness of the shock over she was surprised to find herself perfectly calm always when she had imagined this meeting knowing that it would have to take place sooner or later she had felt something akin to panic but now that it had actually occurred it hardly seemed to stir her the events of the night had left her incapable of any violent emotion  hullo sally said gerald  he spoke thickly and there was a foolish smile on his face as he stood swaying with one hand on the door he was in his shirtsleeves collarless and it was plain that he had been drinking heavily his face was white and puffy and about him there hung like a nimbus a sodden disreputableness  sally did not speak weighed down before by a numbing exhaustion she seemed now to have passed into that second phase in which overtired nerves enter upon a sort of indian summer of abnormal alertness she looked at him quietly coolly and altogether dispassionately as if he had been a stranger  hullo said gerald again  what do you want said sally  heard your voice saw the door open thought id come in  what do you want  the weak smile which had seemed pinned on geralds face vanished a tear rolled down his cheek his intoxication had reached the maudlin stage  sally ssally im very miserable he slurred awkwardly over the difficult syllables heard your voice saw the door open thought id come in  something flicked at the back of sallys mind she seemed to have been through all this before then she remembered this was simply mr reginald cracknell over again  i think you had better go to bed gerald she said steadily nothing about him seemed to touch her now neither the sight of him nor his shameless misery  whats the use cant sleep no good couldnt sleep sally you dont know how worried i am i see what a fool ive been  sally made a quick gesture to check what she supposed was about to develop into a belated expression of regret for his treatment of herself she did not want to stand there listening to gerald apologizing with tears for having done his best to wreck her life but it seemed that it was not this that was weighing upon his soul  i was a fool ever to try writing plays he went on got a winner first time but cant repeat its no good ought to have stuck to newspaper work im good at that shall have to go back to it had another frost tonight no good trying any more shall have to go back to the old grind damn it  he wept softly full of pity for his hard case  very miserable he murmured  he came forward a step into the room lurched and retreated to the safe support of the door for an instant sallys artificial calm was shot through by a swift stab of contempt it passed and she was back again in her armour of indifference  go to bed gerald she said youll feel better in the morning  perhaps some inkling of how he was going to feel in the morning worked through to geralds muddled intelligence for he winced and his manner took on a deeper melancholy  may not be alive in the morning he said solemnly good mind to end it all end it all he repeated with the beginning of a sweeping gesture which was cut off abruptly as he clutched at the friendly door  sally was not in the mood for melodrama  oh go to bed she said impatiently the strange frozen indifference which had gripped her was beginning to pass leaving in its place a growing feeling of resentmentresentment against gerald for degrading himself like this against herself for ever having found glamour in the man it humiliated her to remember how utterly she had once allowed his personality to master hers and under the sting of this humiliation she felt hard and pitiless dimly she was aware that a curious change had come over her tonight normally the sight of any living thing in distress was enough to stir her quick sympathy but gerald mourning over the prospect of having to go back to regular work made no appeal to hera fact which the sufferer noted and commented upon  youre very unsymp unsympathetic he complained  im sorry said sally she walked briskly to the door and gave it a push gerald still clinging to his chosen support moved out into the passage attached to the handle with the air of a man the foundations of whose world have suddenly lost their stability he released the handle and moved uncertainly across the passage finding his own door open before him he staggered over the threshold and sally having watched him safely to his journeys end went into her bedroom with the intention of terminating this disturbing night by going to sleep  almost immediately she changed her mind sleep was out of the question a fever of restlessness had come upon her she put on a kimono and went into the kitchen to ascertain whether her commissariat arrangements would permit of a glass of hot milk  she had just remembered that she had that morning presented the last of the milk to a sandy cat with a purposeful eye which had dropped in through the window to take breakfast with her when her regrets for this thriftless hospitality were interrupted by a muffled crash  she listened intently the sound had seemed to come from across the passage she hurried to the door and opened it as she did so from behind the door of the apartment opposite there came a perfect fusillade of crashes each seeming to her strained hearing louder and more appalling than the last  there is something about sudden loud noises in the stillness of the night which shatters the most rigid detachment a short while before gerald toying with the idea of ending his sorrows by violence had left sally unmoved but now her mind leapt back to what he had said and apprehension succeeded indifference there was no disputing the fact that gerald was in an irresponsible mood under the influence of which he was capable of doing almost anything sally listening in the doorway felt a momentary panic  a brief silence had succeeded the fusillade but as she stood there hesitating the noise broke out again and this time it was so loud and compelling that sally hesitated no longer she ran across the passage and beat on the door    2    whatever devastating happenings had been going on in his home it was plain a moment later that gerald had managed to survive them for there came the sound of a dragging footstep and the door opened gerald stood on the threshold the weak smile back on his face  hullo sally  at the sight of him disreputable and obviously unscathed sallys brief alarm died away leaving in its place the old feeling of impatient resentment in addition to her other grievances against him he had apparently frightened her unnecessarily  whatever was all that noise she demanded  noise said gerald considering the point openmouthed  yes noise snapped sally  ive been cleaning house said gerald with the owllike gravity of a man just conscious that he is not wholly himself  sally pushed her way past him the apartment in which she found herself was almost an exact replica of her own and it was evident that elsa doland had taken pains to make it pretty and comfortable in a niggly feminine way amateur interior decoration had always been a hobby of hers even in the unpromising surroundings of her bedroom at mrs meechers boardinghouse she had contrived to create a certain daintiness which sally who had no ability in that direction herself had always rather envied as a decorator elsas mind ran in the direction of small fragile ornaments and she was not afraid of overfurnishing pictures jostled one another on the walls china of all description stood about on little tables there was a profusion of lamps with shades of particoloured glass and plates were ranged along a series of shelves  one says that the plates were ranged and the pictures jostled one another but it would be more correct to put it they had jostled and had been ranged for it was only by guesswork that sally was able to reconstruct the scene as it must have appeared before gerald had started as he put it to clean house she had walked into the flat briskly enough but she pulled up short as she crossed the threshold appalled by the majestic ruin that met her gaze a shell bursting in the little sittingroom could hardly have created more havoc  the psychology of a man of weak character under the influence of alcohol and disappointed ambition is not easy to plumb for his moods follow one another with a rapidity which baffles the observer ten minutes before gerald foster had been in the grip of a clammy selfpity and it seemed from his aspect at the present moment that this phase had returned but in the interval there had manifestly occurred a brief but adequate spasm of what would appear to have been an almost berserk fury what had caused it and why it should have expended itself so abruptly sally was not psychologist enough to explain but that it had existed there was ocular evidence of the most convincing kind a heavy niblick flung petulantlyor remorsefullyinto a corner showed by what medium the destruction had been accomplished  bleak chaos appeared on every side the floor was littered with every imaginable shape and size of broken glass and china fragments of pictures looking as if they had been chewed by some prehistoric animal lay amid heaps of shattered statuettes and vases as sally moved slowly into the room after her involuntary pause china crackled beneath her feet she surveyed the stripped walls with a wondering eye and turned to gerald for an explanation  gerald had subsided on to an occasional table and was weeping softly again it had come over him once more that he had been very very badly treated  well said sally with a gasp youve certainly made a good job of it  there was a sharp crack as the occasional table never designed by its maker to bear heavy weights gave way in a splintering flurry of broken legs under the pressure of the master of the house and sallys mood underwent an abrupt change there are few situations in life which do not hold equal potentialities for both tragedy and farce and it was the ludicrous side of this drama that chanced to appeal to sally at this moment her sense of humour was tickled it was if she could have analysed her feelings at herself that she was mockingat the feeble sentimental sally who had once conceived the absurd idea of taking this preposterous man seriously she felt lighthearted and lightheaded and she sank into a chair with a gurgling laugh  the shock of his fall appeared to have had the desirable effect of restoring gerald to something approaching intelligence he picked himself up from the remains of a set of watercolours gazing at sally with growing disapproval  no sympathy he said austerely  i cant help it cried sally its too funny  not funny corrected gerald his brain beginning to cloud once more  what did you do it for  gerald returned for a moment to that mood of honest indignation which had so strengthened his arm when wielding the niblick he bethought him once again of his grievance  wasnt going to stand for it any longer he said heatedly a fellows wife goes and lets him down ruins his show by going off and playing in another show why shouldnt i smash her things why should i stand for that sort of treatment why should i  well you havent said sally so theres no need to discuss it you seem to have acted in a thoroughly manly and independent way  thats it manly independent he waggled his finger impressively dont care what she says he continued dont care if she never comes back that woman  sally was not prepared to embark with him upon a discussion of the absent elsa already the amusing aspect of the affair had begun to fade and her hilarity was giving way to a tired distaste for the sordidness of the whole business she had become aware that she could not endure the society of gerald foster much longer she got up and spoke decidedly  and now she said im going to tidy up  gerald had other views  no he said with sudden solemnity no nothing of the kind leave it for her to find leave it as it is  dont be silly all this has got to be cleaned up ill do it you go and sit in my apartment ill come and tell you when you can come back  no said gerald wagging his head  sally stamped her foot among the crackling ruins quite suddenly the sight of him had become intolerable  do as i tell you she cried  gerald wavered for a moment but his brief militant mood was ebbing fast after a faint protest he shuffled off and sally heard him go into her room she breathed a deep breath of relief and turned to her task  a visit to the kitchen revealed a longhandled broom and armed with this sally was soon busy she was an efficient little person and presently out of chaos there began to emerge a certain order nothing short of complete redecoration would ever make the place look habitable again but at the end of half an hour she had cleared the floor and the fragments of vases plates lampshades pictures and glasses were stacked in tiny heaps against the walls she returned the broom to the kitchen and going back into the sittingroom flung open the window and stood looking out  with a sense of unreality she perceived that the night had gone over the quiet street below there brooded that strange metallic light which ushers in the dawn of a fine day a cold breeze whispered to and fro above the housetops the sky was a faint level blue  she left the window and started to cross the room and suddenly there came over her a feeling of utter weakness she stumbled to a chair conscious only of being tired beyond the possibility of a further effort her eyes closed and almost before her head had touched the cushions she was asleep    3    sally woke sunshine was streaming through the open window and with it the myriad noises of a city awake and about its business footsteps clattered on the sidewalk automobile horns were sounding and she could hear the clank of street cars as they passed over the points she could only guess at the hour but it was evident that the morning was well advanced she got up stiffly her head was aching  she went into the bathroom bathed her face and felt better the dull oppression which comes of a bad night was leaving her she leaned out of the window revelling in the fresh air then crossed the passage and entered her own apartment stertorous breathing greeted her and she perceived that gerald foster had also passed the night in a chair he was sprawling by the window with his legs stretched out and his head resting on one of the arms an unlovely spectacle  sally stood regarding him for a moment with a return of the distaste which she had felt on the previous night and yet mingled with the distaste there was a certain elation a black chapter of her life was closed for ever whatever the years to come might bring to her they would be free from any wistful yearnings for the man who had once been woven so inextricably into the fabric of her life she had thought that his personality had gripped her too strongly ever to be dislodged but now she could look at him calmly and feel only a faint halfpity halfcontempt the glamour had departed  she shook him gently and he sat up with a start blinking in the strong light his mouth was still open he stared at sally foolishly then scrambled awkwardly out of the chair  oh my god said gerald pressing both his hands to his forehead and sitting down again he licked his lips with a dry tongue and moaned oh ive got a headache  sally might have pointed out to him that he had certainly earned one but she refrained  youd better go and have a wash she suggested  yes said gerald heaving himself up again  would you like some breakfast  dont said gerald faintly and tottered off to the bathroom  sally sat down in the chair he had vacated she had never felt quite like this before in her life everything seemed dreamlike the splashing of water in the bathroom came faintly to her and she realized that she had been on the point of falling asleep again she got up and opened the window and once more the air acted as a restorative she watched the activities of the street with a distant interest they too seemed dreamlike and unreal people were hurrying up and down on mysterious errands an inscrutable cat picked its way daintily across the road at the door of the apartment house an open car purred sleepily  she was roused by a ring at the bell she went to the door and opened it and found bruce carmyle standing on the threshold he wore a light motorcoat and he was plainly endeavouring to soften the severity of his saturnine face with a smile of beaming kindliness  well here i am said bruce carmyle cheerily are you ready  with the coming of daylight a certain penitence had descended on mr carmyle thinking things over while shaving and subsequently in his bath he had come to the conclusion that his behaviour overnight had not been all that could have been desired he had not actually been brutal perhaps but he had undoubtedly not been winning there had been an abruptness in the manner of his leaving sally at the flower garden which a perfect lover ought not to have shown he had allowed his nerves to get the better of him and now he desired to make amends hence a cheerfulness which he did not usually exhibit so early in the morning  sally was staring at him blankly she had completely forgotten that he had said that he would come and take her for a drive this morning she searched in her mind for words and found none and as mr carmyle was debating within himself whether to kiss her now or wait for a more suitable moment embarrassment came upon them both like a fog and the genial smile faded from his face as if the motivepower behind it had suddenly failed  iveergot the car outside and  at this point speech failed mr carmyle for even as he began the sentence the door that led to the bathroom opened and gerald foster came out mr carmyle gaped at gerald gerald gaped at mr carmyle  the application of cold water to the face and head is an excellent thing on the morning after an imprudent night but as a tonic it only goes part of the way in the case of gerald foster which was an extremely serious and aggravated case it had gone hardly any way at all the person unknown who had been driving redhot rivets into the base of gerald fosters skull ever since the moment of his awakening was still busily engaged on that task he gazed at mr carmyle wanly  bruce carmyle drew in his breath with a sharp hiss and stood rigid his eyes burning now with a grim light flickered over geralds person and found nothing in it to entertain them he saw a slouching figure in shirtsleeves and the foundations of evening dress a disgusting degraded figure with pink eyes and a white face that needed a shave and all the doubts that had ever come to vex mr carmyles mind since his first meeting with sally became on the instant certainties so uncle donald had been right after all this was the sort of girl she was  at his elbow the stout phantom of uncle donald puffed with satisfaction  i told you so it said  sally had not moved the situation was beyond her just as if this had really been the dream it seemed she felt incapable of speech or action  so said mr carmyle becoming articulate and allowed an impressive aposiopesis to take the place of the rest of the speech a cold fury had gripped him he pointed at gerald began to speak found that he was stuttering and gulped back the words in this supreme moment he was not going to have his dignity impaired by a stutter he gulped and found a sentence which while brief enough to insure against this disaster was sufficiently long to express his meaning  get out he said  gerald foster had his dignity too and it seemed to him that the time had come to assert it but he also had a most excruciating headache and when he drew himself up haughtily to ask mr carmyle what the devil he meant by it a severe access of pain sent him huddling back immediately to a safer attitude he clasped his forehead and groaned  get out  for a moment gerald hesitated then another sudden shooting spasm convinced him that no profit or pleasure was to be derived from a continuance of the argument and he began to shamble slowly across to the door bruce carmyle watched him go with twitching hands there was a moment when the human man in him somewhat atrophied from long disuse stirred him almost to the point of assault then dignity whispered more prudent counsel in his ear and gerald was past the dangerzone and out in the passage mr carmyle turned to face sally as king arthur on a similar but less impressive occasion must have turned to deal with guinevere  so he said again  sally was eyeing him steadilyconsidering the circumstances mr carmyle thought with not a little indignation much too steadily  this he said ponderously is very amusing  he waited for her to speak but she said nothing  i might have expected it said mr carmyle with a bitter laugh  sally forced herself from the lethargy which was gripping her  would you like me to explain she said  there can be no explanation said mr carmyle coldly  very well said sally  there was a pause  goodbye said bruce carmyle  goodbye said sally  mr carmyle walked to the door there he stopped for an instant and glanced back at her sally had walked to the window and was looking out for one swift instant something about her trim little figure and the gleam of her hair where the sunlight shone on it seemed to catch at bruce carmyles heart and he wavered but the next moment he was strong again and the door had closed behind him with a resolute bang  out in the street climbing into his car he looked up involuntarily to see if she was still there but she had gone as the car gathering speed hummed down the street sally was at the telephone listening to the sleepy voice of ginger kemp which as he became aware who it was that had woken him from his rest and what she had to say to him magically lost its sleepiness and took on a note of riotous ecstasy  five minutes later ginger was splashing in his bath singing discordantly     chapter xviii journeys end    darkness was beginning to gather slowly and with almost an apologetic air as if it regretted the painful duty of putting an end to the perfect summer day over to the west beyond the trees there still lingered a faint afterglow and a new moon shone like a silver sickle above the big barn sally came out of the house and bowed gravely three times for luck she stood on the gravel outside the porch drinking in the sweet evening scents and found life good  the darkness having shown a certain reluctance at the start was now buckling down to make a quick and thorough job of it the sky turned to a uniform dark blue picked out with quiet stars the cement of the state road which led to patchogue babylon and other important centres ceased to be a pale blur and became invisible lights appeared in the windows of the houses across the meadows from the direction of the kennels there came a single sleepy bark and the small white woolly dog which had scampered out at sallys heels stopped short and uttered a challenging squeak  the evening was so still that gingers footsteps as he pounded along the road on his way back from the village whither he had gone to buy provisions evening papers and wool for the sweater which sally was knitting were audible long before he turned in at the gate sally could not see him but she looked in the direction of the sound and once again felt that pleasant cosy thrill of happiness which had come to her every evening for the last year  ginger she called  what ho  the woolly dog with another important squeak scuttled down the drive to look into the matter and was coldly greeted ginger for all his love of dogs had never been able to bring himself to regard toto with affection he had protested when sally a month before finding mrs meecher distraught on account of a dreadful lethargy which had seized her pet had begged him to offer hospitality and country air to the invalid  its wonderful what youve done for toto angel said sally as he came up frigidly eluding that curious animals leaps of welcome hes a different dog  bit of luck for him said ginger  in all the years i was at mrs meechers i never knew him move at anything more rapid than a stately walk now he runs about all the time  the blighter had been overeating from birth said ginger that was all that was wrong with him a little judicious dieting put him right well be able said ginger brightening to ship him back next week  i shall quite miss him  i nearly missed himthis morningwith a shoe said ginger he was up on the kitchen table wolfing the bacon and i took steps  my caveman murmured sally i always said you had a frightfully brutal streak in you ginger what an evening  good lord said ginger suddenly as they walked into the light of the open kitchen door  now what  he stopped and eyed her intently  do you know youre looking prettier than you were when i started down to the village  sally gave his arm a little hug  beloved she said did you get the chops  ginger froze in his tracks horrified  oh my aunt i clean forgot them  oh ginger you are an old chump well youll have to go in for a little judicious dieting like toto  i say im most awfully sorry i got the wool  if you think im going to eat wool  isnt there anything in the house  vegetables and fruit  fine but of course if you want chops  not at all im spiritual besides people say that vegetables are good for the bloodpressure or something of course you forgot to get the mail too  absolutely not i was on to it like a knife two letters from fellows wanting airedale puppies  no ginger we are getting on  pretty bloated agreed ginger complacently pretty bloated well be able to get that twoseater if things go buzzing on like this there was a letter for you here it is  its from fillmore said sally examining the envelope as they went into the kitchen and about time too i havent had a word from him for months  she sat down and opened the letter ginger heaving himself on to the table wriggled into a position of comfort and started to read his evening paper but after he had skimmed over the sporting page he lowered it and allowed his gaze to rest on sallys bent head with a feeling of utter contentment  although a married man of nearly a years standing ginger was still moving about a magic world in a state of dazed incredulity unable fully to realize that such bliss could be ginger in his time had seen many things that looked good from a distance but not one that had borne the test of a closer acquaintanceexcept this business of marriage  marriage with sally for a partner seemed to be one of the very few things in the world in which there was no catch his honest eyes glowed as he watched her sally broke into a little splutter of laughter  ginger look at this  he reached down and took the slip of paper which she held out to him the following legend met his eye printed in bold letters                                   popps                                outstanding                   succulentappetizingnutritious                            just say pop a child                                can do it    ginger regarded this cipher with a puzzled frown  what is it he asked  its fillmore  how do you mean  sally gurgled  fillmore and gladys have started a little restaurant in pittsburg  a restaurant there was a shocked note in gingers voice although he knew that the managerial career of that modern napoleon his brotherinlaw had terminated in something of a smash he had never quite lost his reverence for one whom he considered a bit of a mastermind that fillmore nicholas the man of destiny should have descended to conducting a restaurantand a little restaurant at thatstruck him as almost indecent  sally on the other handfor sisters always seem to fail in proper reverence for the greatness of their brotherswas delighted  its the most splendid idea she said with enthusiasm it really does look as if fillmore was going to amount to something at last apparently they started on quite a small scale just making porkpies  why popp interrupted ginger ventilating a question which was perplexing him deeply  just a trade name silly gladys is a wonderful cook you know and she made the pies and fillmore toddled round selling them and they did so well that now theyve started a regular restaurant and thats a success too listen to this sally gurgled again and turned over the letter where is it oh yes  sound financial footing in fact our success has been so instantaneous that i have decided to launch out on a really big scale it is big ideas that lead to big business i am contemplating a vast extension of this venture of ours and in a very short time i shall organize branches in new york chicago detroit and all the big cities each in charge of a manager and each offering as a special feature in addition to the usual restaurant cuisine these popps outstanding porkpies of ours that done and having established all these branches as going concerns i shall sail for england and introduce popps porkpies there isnt he a little wonder  dashed brainy chap always said so  i must say i was rather uneasy when i read that ive seen so many of fillmores big ideas thats always the way with him he gets something good and then goes and overdoes it and bursts however its all right now that hes got gladys to look after him she has added a postscript just four words but oh how comforting to a sisters heart yes i dont think is what she says and i dont know when ive read anything more cheering thank heaven shes got poor dear fillmore well in hand  porkpies said ginger musingly as the pangs of a healthy hunger began to assail his interior i wish hed sent us one of the outstanding little chaps i could do with it  sally got up and ruffled his red hair  poor old ginger i knew youd never be able to stick it come on its a lovely night lets walk to the village and revel at the inn were going to be millionaires before we know where we are so we can afford it   the end
