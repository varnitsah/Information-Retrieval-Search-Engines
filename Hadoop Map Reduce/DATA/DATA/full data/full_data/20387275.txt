murmuring crowd of beings that are human only in name for to the eye and ear they seem naught but savage creatures animated by vile passions and by the lust of vengeance and of hate the hour some little time before sunset and the place the west barricade at the very spot where a decade later a proud tyrant raised an undying monument to the nations glory and his own vanity  during the greater part of the day the guillotine had been kept busy at its ghastly work all that france had boasted of in the past centuries of ancient names and blue blood had paid toll to her desire for liberty and for fraternity the carnage had only ceased at this late hour of the day because there were other more interesting sights for the people to witness a little while before the final closing of the barricades for the night  and so the crowd rushed away from the place de la greve and made for the various barricades in order to watch this interesting and amusing sight  it was to be seen every day for those aristos were such fools they were traitors to the people of course all of them men women and children who happened to be descendants of the great men who since the crusades had made the glory of france her old noblesse their ancestors had oppressed the people had crushed them under the scarlet heels of their dainty buckled shoes and now the people had become the rulers of france and crushed their former mastersnot beneath their heel for they went shoeless mostly in these daysbut a more effectual weight the knife of the guillotine  and daily hourly the hideous instrument of torture claimed its many victimsold men young women tiny children until the day when it would finally demand the head of a king and of a beautiful young queen  but this was as it should be were not the people now the rulers of france every aristocrat was a traitor as his ancestors had been before him for two hundred years now the people had sweated and toiled and starved to keep a lustful court in lavish extravagance now the descendants of those who had helped to make those courts brilliant had to hide for their livesto fly if they wished to avoid the tardy vengeance of the people  and they did try to hide and tried to fly that was just the fun of the whole thing every afternoon before the gates closed and the market carts went out in procession by the various barricades some fool of an aristo endeavoured to evade the clutches of the committee of public safety in various disguises under various pretexts they tried to slip through the barriers which were so well guarded by citizen soldiers of the republic men in womens clothes women in male attire children disguised in beggars rags there were some of all sorts cidevant counts marquises even dukes who wanted to fly from france reach england or some other equally accursed country and there try to rouse foreign feelings against the glorious revolution or to raise an army in order to liberate the wretched prisoners in the temple who had once called themselves sovereigns of france  but they were nearly always caught at the barricades sergeant bibot especially at the west gate had a wonderful nose for scenting an aristo in the most perfect disguise then of course the fun began bibot would look at his prey as a cat looks upon the mouse play with him sometimes for quite a quarter of an hour pretend to be hoodwinked by the disguise by the wigs and other bits of theatrical makeup which hid the identity of a cidevant noble marquise or count  oh bibot had a keen sense of humour and it was well worth hanging round that west barricade in order to see him catch an aristo in the very act of trying to flee from the vengeance of the people  sometimes bibot would let his prey actually out by the gates allowing him to think for the space of two minutes at least that he really had escaped out of paris and might even manage to reach the coast of england in safety but bibot would let the unfortunate wretch walk about ten metres towards the open country then he would send two men after him and bring him back stripped of his disguise  oh that was extremely funny for as often as not the fugitive would prove to be a woman some proud marchioness who looked terribly comical when she found herself in bibots clutches after all and knew that a summary trial would await her the next day and after that the fond embrace of madame la guillotine  no wonder that on this fine afternoon in september the crowd round bibots gate was eager and excited the lust of blood grows with its satisfaction there is no satiety the crowd had seen a hundred noble heads fall beneath the guillotine today it wanted to make sure that it would see another hundred fall on the morrow  bibot was sitting on an overturned and empty cask close by the gate of the barricade a small detachment of citoyen soldiers was under his command the work had been very hot lately those cursed aristos were becoming terrified and tried their hardest to slip out of paris men women and children whose ancestors even in remote ages had served those traitorous bourbons were all traitors themselves and right food for the guillotine every day bibot had had the satisfaction of unmasking some fugitive royalists and sending them back to be tried by the committee of public safety presided over by that good patriot citoyen foucquiertinville  robespierre and danton both had commended bibot for his zeal and bibot was proud of the fact that he on his own initiative had sent at least fifty aristos to the guillotine  but today all the sergeants in command at the various barricades had had special orders recently a very great number of aristos had succeeded in escaping out of france and in reaching england safely there were curious rumours about these escapes they had become very frequent and singularly daring the peoples minds were becoming strangely excited about it all sergeant grospierre had been sent to the guillotine for allowing a whole family of aristos to slip out of the north gate under his very nose  it was asserted that these escapes were organised by a band of englishmen whose daring seemed to be unparalleled and who from sheer desire to meddle in what did not concern them spent their spare time in snatching away lawful victims destined for madame la guillotine these rumours soon grew in extravagance there was no doubt that this band of meddlesome englishmen did exist moreover they seemed to be under the leadership of a man whose pluck and audacity were almost fabulous strange stories were afloat of how he and those aristos whom he rescued became suddenly invisible as they reached the barricades and escaped out of the gates by sheer supernatural agency  no one had seen these mysterious englishmen as for their leader he was never spoken of save with a superstitious shudder citoyen foucquiertinville would in the course of the day receive a scrap of paper from some mysterious source sometimes he would find it in the pocket of his coat at others it would be handed to him by someone in the crowd whilst he was on his way to the sitting of the committee of public safety the paper always contained a brief notice that the band of meddlesome englishmen were at work and it was always signed with a device drawn in reda little starshaped flower which we in england call the scarlet pimpernel within a few hours of the receipt of this impudent notice the citoyens of the committee of public safety would hear that so many royalists and aristocrats had succeeded in reaching the coast and were on their way to england and safety  the guards at the gates had been doubled the sergeants in command had been threatened with death whilst liberal rewards were offered for the capture of these daring and impudent englishmen there was a sum of five thousand francs promised to the man who laid hands on the mysterious and elusive scarlet pimpernel  everyone felt that bibot would be that man and bibot allowed that belief to take firm root in everybodys mind and so day after day people came to watch him at the west gate so as to be present when he laid hands on any fugitive aristo who perhaps might be accompanied by that mysterious englishman  bah he said to his trusted corporal citoyen grospierre was a fool had it been me now at that north gate last week     citoyen bibot spat on the ground to express his contempt for his comrades stupidity  how did it happen citoyen asked the corporal  grospierre was at the gate keeping good watch began bibot pompously as the crowd closed in round him listening eagerly to his narrative weve all heard of this meddlesome englishman this accursed scarlet pimpernel he wont get through my gate morbleu unless he be the devil himself but grospierre was a fool the market carts were going through the gates there was one laden with casks and driven by an old man with a boy beside him grospierre was a bit drunk but he thought himself very clever he looked into the casksmost of them at leastand saw they were empty and let the cart go through  a murmur of wrath and contempt went round the group of illclad wretches who crowded round citoyen bibot  half an hour later continued the sergeant up comes a captain of the guard with a squad of some dozen soldiers with him has a cart gone through he asks of grospierre breathlessly yes says grospierre not half an hour ago and you have let them escape shouts the captain furiously youll go to the guillotine for this citoyen sergeant that cart held concealed the cidevant duc de chalis and all his family what thunders grospierre aghast aye and the driver was none other than that cursed englishman the scarlet pimpernel  a howl of execration greeted this tale citoyen grospierre had paid for his blunder on the guillotine but what a fool oh what a fool  bibot was laughing so much at his own tale that it was some time before he could continue  after them my men shouts the captain he said after a while remember the reward after them they cannot have gone far and with that he rushes through the gate followed by his dozen soldiers  but it was too late shouted the crowd excitedly  they never got them  curse that grospierre for his folly  he deserved his fate  fancy not examining those casks properly  but these sallies seemed to amuse citoyen bibot exceedingly he laughed until his sides ached and the tears streamed down his cheeks  nay nay he said at last those aristos werent in the cart the driver was not the scarlet pimpernel  what  no the captain of the guard was that damned englishman in disguise and everyone of his soldiers aristos  the crowd this time said nothing the story certainly savoured of the supernatural and though the republic had abolished god it had not quite succeeded in killing the fear of the supernatural in the hearts of the people truly that englishman must be the devil himself  the sun was sinking low down in the west bibot prepared himself to close the gates  en avant the carts he said  some dozen covered carts were drawn up in a row ready to leave town in order to fetch the produce from the country close by for market the next morning they were mostly well known to bibot as they went through his gate twice every day on their way to and from the town he spoke to one or two of their driversmostly womenand was at great pains to examine the inside of the carts  you never know he would say and im not going to be caught like that fool grospierre  the women who drove the carts usually spent their day on the place de la greve beneath the platform of the guillotine knitting and gossiping whilst they watched the rows of tumbrils arriving with the victims the reign of terror claimed every day it was great fun to see the aristos arriving for the reception of madame la guillotine and the places close by the platform were very much sought after bibot during the day had been on duty on the place he recognized most of the old hats tricotteuses as they were called who sat there and knitted whilst head after head fell beneath the knife and they themselves got quite bespattered with the blood of those cursed aristos  he la mere said bibot to one of these horrible hags what have you got there  he had seen her earlier in the day with her knitting and the whip of her cart close beside her now she had fastened a row of curly locks to the whip handle all colours from gold to silver fair to dark and she stroked them with her huge bony fingers as she laughed at bibot  i made friends with madame guillotines lover she said with a coarse laugh he cut these off for me from the heads as they rolled down he has promised me some more tomorrow but i dont know if i shall be at my usual place  ah how is that la mere asked bibot who hardened soldier that he was could not help shuddering at the awful loathsomeness of this semblance of a woman with her ghastly trophy on the handle of her whip  my grandson has got the smallpox she said with a jerk of her thumb towards the inside of her cart some say its the plague if it is i shant be allowed to come into paris tomorrow at the first mention of the word smallpox bibot had stepped hastily backwards and when the old hag spoke of the plague he retreated from her as fast as he could  curse you he muttered whilst the whole crowd hastily avoided the cart leaving it standing all alone in the midst of the place  the old hag laughed  curse you citoyen for being a coward she said bah what a man to be afraid of sickness  morbleu the plague  everyone was awestruck and silent filled with horror for the loathsome malady the one thing which still had the power to arouse terror and disgust in these savage brutalised creatures  get out with you and with your plaguestricken brood shouted bibot hoarsely  and with another rough laugh and coarse jest the old hag whipped up her lean nag and drove her cart out of the gate  this incident had spoilt the afternoon the people were terrified of these two horrible curses the two maladies which nothing could cure and which were the precursors of an awful and lonely death they hung about the barricades silent and sullen for a while eyeing one another suspiciously avoiding each other as if by instinct lest the plague lurked already in their midst presently as in the case of grospierre a captain of the guard appeared suddenly but he was known to bibot and there was no fear of his turning out to be a sly englishman in disguise  a cart    he shouted breathlessly even before he had reached the gates  what cart asked bibot roughly  driven by an old hag    a covered cart     there were a dozen     an old hag who said her son had the plague  yes     you have not let them go  morbleu said bibot whose purple cheeks had suddenly become white with fear  the cart contained the cidevant comtesse de tourney and her two children all of them traitors and condemned to death  and their driver muttered bibot as a superstitious shudder ran down his spine  sacre tonnerre said the captain but it is feared that it was that accursed englishman himselfthe scarlet pimpernel     chapter ii dover the fishermans rest    in the kitchen sally was extremely busysaucepans and fryingpans were standing in rows on the gigantic hearth the huge stockpot stood in a corner and the jack turned with slow deliberation and presented alternately to the glow every side of a noble sirloin of beef the two little kitchenmaids bustled around eager to help hot and panting with cotton sleeves well tucked up above the dimpled elbows and giggling over some private jokes of their own whenever miss sallys back was turned for a moment and old jemima stolid in temper and solid in bulk kept up a long and subdued grumble while she stirred the stockpot methodically over the fire  what ho sally came in cheerful if none too melodious accents from the coffeeroom close by  lud bless my soul exclaimed sally with a goodhumoured laugh what be they all wanting now i wonder  beer of course grumbled jemima you dont xpect jimmy pitkin to ave done with one tankard do ye  mr arry e looked uncommon thirsty too simpered martha one of the little kitchenmaids and her beady black eyes twinkled as they met those of her companion whereupon both started on a round of short and suppressed giggles  sally looked cross for a moment and thoughtfully rubbed her hands against her shapely hips her palms were itching evidently to come in contact with marthas rosy cheeksbut inherent goodhumour prevailed and with a pout and a shrug of the shoulders she turned her attention to the fried potatoes  what ho sally hey sally  and a chorus of pewter mugs tapped with impatient hands against the oak tables of the coffeeroom accompanied the shouts for mine hosts buxom daughter  sally shouted a more persistent voice are ye goin to be all night with that there beer  i do think father might get the beer for them muttered sally as jemima stolidly and without further comment took a couple of foamcrowned jugs from the shelf and began filling a number of pewter tankards with some of that homebrewed ale for which the fishermans rest had been famous since that days of king charles e knows ow busy we are in ere  your father is too busy discussing politics with mr empseed to worry isself about you and the kitchen grumbled jemima under her breath  sally had gone to the small mirror which hung in a corner of the kitchen and was hastily smoothing her hair and setting her frilled cap at its most becoming angle over her dark curls then she took up the tankards by their handles three in each strong brown hand and laughing grumbling blushing carried them through into the coffee room  there there was certainly no sign of that bustle and activity which kept four women busy and hot in the glowing kitchen beyond  the coffeeroom of the fishermans rest is a show place now at the beginning of the twentieth century at the end of the eighteenth in the year of grace 1792 it had not yet gained the notoriety and importance which a hundred additional years and the craze of the age have since bestowed upon it yet it was an old place even then for the oak rafters and beams were already black with ageas were the panelled seats with their tall backs and the long polished tables between on which innumerable pewter tankards had left fantastic patterns of manysized rings in the leaded window high up a row of pots of scarlet geraniums and blue larkspur gave the bright note of colour against the dull background of the oak  that mr jellyband landlord of the fishermans rest at dover was a prosperous man was of course clear to the most casual observer the pewter on the fine old dressers the brass above the gigantic hearth shone like silver and goldthe redtiled floor was as brilliant as the scarlet geranium on the window sillthis meant that his servants were good and plentiful that the custom was constant and of that order which necessitated the keeping up of the coffeeroom to a high standard of elegance and order  as sally came in laughing through her frowns and displaying a row of dazzling white teeth she was greeted with shouts and chorus of applause  why heres sally what ho sally hurrah for pretty sally  i thought youd grown deaf in that kitchen of yours muttered jimmy pitkin as he passed the back of his hand across his very dry lips  all ri all ri laughed sally as she deposited the freshlyfilled tankards upon the tables why what a urry to be sure and is your granmother adyin an you wantin to see the pore soul afore shem gone i never seed such a mighty rushin a chorus of goodhumoured laughter greeted this witticism which gave the company there present food for many jokes for some considerable time sally now seemed in less of a hurry to get back to her pots and pans a young man with fair curly hair and eager bright blue eyes was engaging most of her attention and the whole of her time whilst broad witticisms anent jimmy pitkins fictitious grandmother flew from mouth to mouth mixed with heavy puffs of pungent tobacco smoke  facing the hearth his legs wide apart a long clay pipe in his mouth stood mine host himself worthy mr jellyband landlord of the fishermans rest as his father had before him aye and his grandfather and greatgrandfather too for that matter portly in build jovial in countenance and somewhat bald of pate mr jellyband was indeed a typical rural john bull of those daysthe days when our prejudiced insularity was at its height when to an englishman be he lord yeoman or peasant the whole of the continent of europe was a den of immorality and the rest of the world an unexploited land of savages and cannibals  there he stood mine worthy host firm and well set up on his limbs smoking his long churchwarden and caring nothing for nobody at home and despising everybody abroad he wore the typical scarlet waistcoat with shiny brass buttons the corduroy breeches and grey worsted stockings and smart buckled shoes that characterised every selfrespecting innkeeper in great britain in these daysand while pretty motherless sally had need of four pairs of brown hands to do all the work that fell on her shapely shoulders worthy jellyband discussed the affairs of nations with his most privileged guests  the coffeeroom indeed lighted by two wellpolished lamps which hung from the raftered ceiling looked cheerful and cosy in the extreme through the dense clouds of tobacco smoke that hung about in every corner the faces of mr jellybands customers appeared red and pleasant to look at and on good terms with themselves their host and all the world from every side of the room loud guffaws accompanied pleasant if not highly intellectual conversationwhile sallys repeated giggles testified to the good use mr harry waite was making of the short time she seemed inclined to spare him  they were mostly fisherfolk who patronised mr jellybands coffeeroom but fishermen are known to be very thirsty people the salt which they breathe in when they are on the sea accounts for their parched throats when on shore but the fishermans rest was something more than a rendezvous for these humble folk the london and dover coach started from the hostel daily and passengers who had come across the channel and those who started for the grand tour all became acquainted with mr jellyband his french wines and his homebrewed ales  it was towards the close of september 1792 and the weather which had been brilliant and hot throughout the month had suddenly broken up for two days torrents of rain had deluged the south of england doing its level best to ruin what chances the apples and pears and late plums had of becoming really fine selfrespecting fruit even now it was beating against the leaded windows and tumbling down the chimney making the cheerful wood fire sizzle in the hearth  lud did you ever see such a wet september mr jellyband asked mr hempseed  he sat in one of the seats inside the hearth did mr hempseed for he was an authority and important personage not only at the fishermans rest where mr jellyband always made a special selection of him as a foil for political arguments but throughout the neighborhood where his learning and notably his knowledge of the scriptures was held in the most profound awe and respect with one hand buried in the capacious pockets of his corduroys underneath his elaboratelyworked wellworn smock the other holding his long clay pipe mr hempseed sat there looking dejectedly across the room at the rivulets of moisture which trickled down the window panes  no replied mr jellyband sententiously i dunno mr empseed as i ever did an ive been in these parts nigh on sixty years  aye you wouldnt recllect the first three years of them sixty mr jellyband quietly interposed mr hempseed i dunno as i ever seed an infant take much note of the weather leastways not in these parts an ive lived ere nigh on seventyfive years mr jellyband  the superiority of this wisdom was so incontestable that for the moment mr jellyband was not ready with his usual flow of argument  it do seem more like april than september dont it continued mr hempseed dolefully as a shower of raindrops fell with a sizzle upon the fire  aye that it do assented the worthy host but then what can you xpect mr empseed i says with sich a government as weve got  mr hempseed shook his head with an infinity of wisdom tempered by deeplyrooted mistrust of the british climate and the british government  i dont xpect nothing mr jellyband he said pore folks like us is of no account up there in lunnon i knows that and its not often as i do complain but when it comes to sich wet weather in september and all me fruit arottin and adying like the guptian mothers first born and doin no more good than they did pore dears save a lot more jews pedlars and sich with their oranges and sich like foreign ungodly fruit which nobodyd buy if english apples and pears was nicely swelled as the scriptures say  thats quite right mr empseed retorted jellyband and as i says what can you xpect theres all them frenchy devils over the channel yonder amurderin their king and nobility and mr pitt and mr fox and mr burke afightin and awranglin between them if we englishmen should low them to go on in their ungodly way let em murder says mr pitt stop em says mr burke  and let em murder says i and be demmed to em said mr hempseed emphatically for he had but little liking for his friend jellybands political arguments wherein he always got out of his depth and had but little chance for displaying those pearls of wisdom which had earned for him so high a reputation in the neighbourhood and so many free tankards of ale at the fishermans rest  let em murder he repeated again but dont lets ave sich rain in september for that is agin the law and the scriptures which says  lud mr arry ow you made me jump  it was unfortunate for sally and her flirtation that this remark of hers should have occurred at the precise moment when mr hempseed was collecting his breath in order to deliver himself one of those scriptural utterances which made him famous for it brought down upon her pretty head the full flood of her fathers wrath  now then sally me girl now then he said trying to force a frown upon his goodhumoured face stop that fooling with them young jackanapes and get on with the work  the works gettin on all ri father  but mr jellyband was peremptory he had other views for his buxom daughter his only child who would in gods good time become the owner of the fishermans rest than to see her married to one of these young fellows who earned but a precarious livelihood with their net  did ye hear me speak me girl he said in that quiet tone which no one inside the inn dared to disobey get on with my lord tonys supper for if it aint the best we can do and e not satisfied see what youll get thats all  reluctantly sally obeyed  is you xpecting special guests then tonight mr jellyband asked jimmy pitkin in a loyal attempt to divert his hosts attention from the circumstances connected with sallys exit from the room  aye that i be replied jellyband friends of my lord tony hisself dukes and duchesses from over the water yonder whom the young lord and his friend sir andrew ffoulkes and other young noblemen have helped out of the clutches of them murderin devils  but this was too much for mr hempseeds querulous philosophy  lud he said what do they do that for i wonder i dont old not with interferin in other folks ways as the scriptures say  maybe mr empseed interrupted jellyband with biting sarcasm as youre a personal friend of mr pitt and as you says along with mr fox let em murder says you  pardon me mr jellyband feebly protested mr hempseed i dunno as i ever did  but mr jellyband had at last succeeded in getting upon his favourite hobbyhorse and had no intention of dismounting in any hurry  or maybe youve made friends with some of them french chaps oo they do say have come over here o purpose to make us englishmen agree with their murderin ways  i dunno what you mean mr jellyband suggested mr hempseed all i know is  all i know is loudly asserted mine host that there was my friend peppercorn oo owns the bluefaced boar an as true and loyal an englishman as youd see in the land and now look at ime made friends with some o them frogeaters obnobbed with them just as if they was englishmen and not just a lot of immoral godforsaking furrin spies well and what happened peppercorn e now ups and talks of revolutions and liberty and down with the aristocrats just like mr empseed over ere  pardon me mr jellyband again interposed mr hempseed feebly i dunno as i ever did  mr jellyband had appealed to the company in general who were listening awestruck and openmouthed at the recital of mr peppercorns defalcations at one table two customersgentlemen apparently by their clotheshad pushed aside their halffinished game of dominoes and had been listening for some time and evidently with much amusement at mr jellybands international opinions one of them now with a quiet sarcastic smile still lurking round the corners of his mobile mouth turned towards the centre of the room where mr jellyband was standing  you seem to think mine honest friend he said quietly that these frenchmenspies i think you called themare mighty clever fellows to have made mincemeat so to speak of your friend mr peppercorns opinions how did they accomplish that now think you  lud sir i suppose they talked im over those frenchies ive eard it said ave got the gift of gaband mr empseed ere will tell you ow it is that they just twist some people round their little finger like  indeed and is that so mr hempseed inquired the stranger politely  nay sir replied mr hempseed much irritated i dunno as i can give you the information you require  faith then said the stranger let us hope my worthy host that these clever spies will not succeed in upsetting your extremely loyal opinions  but this was too much for mr jellybands pleasant equanimity he burst into an uproarious fit of laughter which was soon echoed by those who happened to be in his debt  hahaha hohoho hehehe he laughed in every key did my worthy host and laughed until his sided ached and his eyes streamed at me hark at that did ye ear im say that theyd be upsettin my opinionsehlud love you sir but you do say some queer things  well mr jellyband said mr hempseed sententiously you know what the scriptures say let im oo stands take eed lest e fall  but then harkee mr empseed retorted jellyband still holding his sides with laughter the scriptures didnt know me why i wouldnt so much as drink a glass of ale with one o them murderin frenchmen and nothin d make me change my opinions why ive eard it said that them frogeaters cant even speak the kings english so of course if any of em tried to speak their godforsaken lingo to me why i should spot them directly seeand forewarned is forearmed as the saying goes  aye my honest friend assented the stranger cheerfully i see that you are much too sharp and a match for any twenty frenchmen and heres to your very good health my worthy host if youll do me the honour to finish this bottle of mine with me  i am sure youre very polite sir said mr jellyband wiping his eyes which were still streaming with the abundance of his laughter and i dont mind if i do  the stranger poured out a couple of tankards full of wine and having offered one to mine host he took the other himself  loyal englishmen as we all are he said whilst the same humorous smile played round the corners of his thin lipsloyal as we are we must admit that this at least is one good thing which comes to us from france  aye well none of us deny that sir assented mine host  and heres to the best landlord in england our worthy host mr jellyband said the stranger in a loud tone of voice  hi hip hurrah retorted the whole company present then there was a loud clapping of hands and mugs and tankards made a rattling music upon the tables to the accompaniment of loud laughter at nothing in particular and of mr jellybands muttered exclamations  just fancy me bein talked over by any godforsaken furrinerwhatlud love you sir but you do say some queer things  to which obvious fact the stranger heartily assented it was certainly a preposterous suggestion that anyone could ever upset mr jellybands firmlyrooted opinions anent the utter worthlessness of the inhabitants of the whole continent of europe     chapter iii the refugees    feeling in every part of england certainly ran very high at this time against the french and their doings smugglers and legitimate traders between the french and the english coasts brought snatches of news from over the water which made every honest englishmans blood boil and made him long to have a good go at those murderers who had imprisoned their king and all his family subjected the queen and the royal children to every species of indignity and were even now loudly demanding the blood of the whole bourbon family and of every one of its adherents  the execution of the princesse de lamballe marie antoinettes young and charming friend had filled every one in england with unspeakable horror the daily execution of scores of royalists of good family whose only sin was their aristocratic name seemed to cry for vengeance to the whole of civilised europe  yet with all that no one dared to interfere burke had exhausted all his eloquence in trying to induce the british government to fight the revolutionary government of france but mr pitt with characteristic prudence did not feel that this country was fit yet to embark on another arduous and costly war it was for austria to take the initiative austria whose fairest daughter was even now a dethroned queen imprisoned and insulted by a howling mob surely twas notso argued mr foxfor the whole of england to take up arms because one set of frenchmen chose to murder another  as for mr jellyband and his fellow john bulls though they looked upon all foreigners with withering contempt they were royalist and antirevolutionists to a man and at this present moment were furious with pitt for his caution and moderation although they naturally understood nothing of the diplomatic reasons which guided that great mans policy  by now sally came running back very excited and very eager the joyous company in the coffeeroom had heard nothing of the noise outside but she had spied a dripping horse and rider who had stopped at the door of the fishermans rest and while the stable boy ran forward to take charge of the horse pretty miss sally went to the front door to greet the welcome visitor i think i seed my lord antonys horse out in the yard father she said as she ran across the coffeeroom  but already the door had been thrown open from outside and the next moment an arm covered in drab cloth and dripping with the heavy rain was round pretty sallys waist while a hearty voice echoed along the polished rafters of the coffeeroom  aye and bless your brown eyes for being so sharp my pretty sally said the man who had just entered whilst worthy mr jellyband came bustling forward eager alert and fussy as became the advent of one of the most favoured guests of his hostel  lud i protest sally added lord antony as he deposited a kiss on miss sallys blooming cheeks but you are growing prettier and prettier every time i see youand my honest friend jellyband here have hard work to keep the fellows off that slim waist of yours what say you mr waite  mr waitetorn between his respect for my lord and his dislike of that particular type of jokeonly replied with a doubtful grunt  lord antony dewhurst one of the sons of the duke of exeter was in those days a very perfect type of a young english gentlementall well setup broad of shoulders and merry of face his laughter rang loudly wherever he went a good sportsman a lively companion a courteous wellbred man of the world with not too much brains to spoil his temper he was a universal favourite in london drawingrooms or in the coffeerooms of village inns at the fishermans rest everyone knew himfor he was fond of a trip across to france and always spent a night under worthy mr jellybands roof on his way there or back  he nodded to waite pitkin and the others as he at last released sallys waist and crossed over to the hearth to warm and dry himself as he did so he cast a quick somewhat suspicious glance at the two strangers who had quietly resumed their game of dominoes and for a moment a look of deep earnestness even of anxiety clouded his jovial young face  but only for a moment the next he turned to mr hempseed who was respectfully touching his forelock  well mr hempseed and how is the fruit  badly my lord badly replied mr hempseed dolefully but what can you xpect with this ere government favourin them rascals over in france who would murder their king and all their nobility  odds life retorted lord antony so they would honest hempseedat least those they can get hold of worse luck but we have got some friends coming here tonight who at any rate have evaded their clutches  it almost seemed when the young man said these words as if he threw a defiant look towards the quiet strangers in the corner  thanks to you my lord and to your friends so ive heard it said said mr jellyband  but in a moment lord antonys hand fell warningly on mine hosts arm  hush he said peremptorily and instinctively once again looked towards the strangers  oh lud love you they are all right my lord retorted jellyband dont you be afraid i wouldnt have spoken only i knew we were among friends that gentleman over there is as true and loyal a subject of king george as you are yourself my lord saving your presence he is but lately arrived in dover and is setting down in business in these parts  in business faith then it must be as an undertaker for i vow i never beheld a more rueful countenance  nay my lord i believe that the gentleman is a widower which no doubt would account for the melancholy of his bearingbut he is a friend nevertheless ill vouch for thatand you will own my lord that who should judge of a face better than the landlord of a popular inn  oh thats all right then if we are among friends said lord antony who evidently did not care to discuss the subject with his host but tell me you have no one else staying here have you  no one my lord and no one coming either leastways  leastways  no one your lordship would object to i know  who is it  well my lord sir percy blakeney and his lady will be here presently but they aint agoin to stay  lady blakeney queried lord antony in some astonishment  aye my lord sir percys skipper was here just now he says that my ladys brother is crossing over to france today in the day dream which is sir percys yacht and sir percy and my lady will come with him as far as here to see the last of him it dont put you out do it my lord  no no it doesnt put me out friend nothing will put me out unless that supper is not the very best which miss sally can cook and which has ever been served in the fishermans rest  you need have no fear of that my lord said sally who all this while had been busy setting the table for supper and very gay and inviting it looked with a large bunch of brilliantly coloured dahlias in the centre and the bright pewter goblets and blue china about  how many shall i lay for my lord  five places pretty sally but let the supper be enough for ten at leastour friends will be tired and i hope hungry as for me i vow i could demolish a baron of beef tonight  here they are i do believe said sally excitedly as a distant clatter of horses and wheels could now be distinctly heard drawing rapidly nearer  there was a general commotion in the coffeeroom everyone was curious to see my lord antonys swell friends from over the water miss sally cast one or two quick glances at the little bit of mirror which hung on the wall and worthy mr jellyband bustled out in order to give the first welcome himself to his distinguished guests only the two strangers in the corner did not participate in the general excitement they were calmly finishing their game of dominoes and did not even look once towards the door  straight ahead comtesse the door on your right said a pleasant voice outside  aye there they are all right enough said lord antony joyfully off with you my pretty sally and see how quick you can dish up the soup  the door was thrown wide open and preceded by mr jellyband who was profuse in his bows and welcomes a party of fourtwo ladies and two gentlemenentered the coffeeroom  welcome welcome to old england said lord antony effusively as he came eagerly forward with both hands outstretched towards the newcomers  ah you are lord antony dewhurst i think said one of the ladies speaking with a strong foreign accent  at your service madame he replied as he ceremoniously kissed the hands of both the ladies then turned to the men and shook them both warmly by the hand  sally was already helping the ladies to take off their traveling cloaks and both turned with a shiver towards the brightlyblazing hearth  there was a general movement among the company in the coffeeroom sally had bustled off to her kitchen whilst jellyband still profuse with his respectful salutations arranged one or two chairs around the fire mr hempseed touching his forelock was quietly vacating the seat in the hearth everyone was staring curiously yet deferentially at the foreigners  ah messieurs what can i say said the elder of the two ladies as she stretched a pair of fine aristocratic hands to the warmth of the blaze and looked with unspeakable gratitude first at lord antony then at one of the young men who had accompanied her party and who was busy divesting himself of his heavy caped coat  only that you are glad to be in england comtesse replied lord antony and that you have not suffered too much from your trying voyage  indeed indeed we are glad to be in england she said while her eyes filled with tears and we have already forgotten all that we have suffered  her voice was musical and low and there was a great deal of calm dignity and of many sufferings nobly endured marked in the handsome aristocratic face with its wealth of snowywhite hair dressed high above the forehead after the fashion of the times  i hope my friend sir andrew ffoulkes proved an entertaining travelling companion madame  ah indeed sir andrew was kindness itself how could my children and i ever show enough gratitude to you all messieurs  her companion a dainty girlish figure childlike and pathetic in its look of fatigue and of sorrow had said nothing as yet but her eyes large brown and full of tears looked up from the fire and sought those of sir andrew ffoulkes who had drawn near to the hearth and to her then as they met his which were fixed with unconcealed admiration upon the sweet face before him a thought of warmer colour rushed up to her pale cheeks  so this is england she said as she looked round with childlike curiosity at the great hearth the oak rafters and the yokels with their elaborate smocks and jovial rubicund british countenances  a bit of it mademoiselle replied sir andrew smiling but all of it at your service  the young girl blushed again but this time a bright smile fleet and sweet illumined her dainty face she said nothing and sir andrew too was silent yet those two young people understood one another as young people have a way of doing all the world over and have done since the world began  but i say supper here broke in lord antonys jovial voice supper honest jellyband where is that pretty wench of yours and the dish of soup zooks man while you stand there gaping at the ladies they will faint with hunger  one moment one moment my lord said jellyband as he threw open the door that led to the kitchen and shouted lustily sally hey sally there are ye ready my girl  sally was ready and the next moment she appeared in the doorway carrying a gigantic tureen from which rose a cloud of steam and an abundance of savoury odour  odds life supper at last ejaculated lord antony merrily as he gallantly offered his arm to the comtesse  may i have the honour he added ceremoniously as he led her towards the supper table  there was a general bustle in the coffeeroom mr hempseed and most of the yokels and fisherfolk had gone to make way for the quality and to finish smoking their pipes elsewhere only the two strangers stayed on quietly and unconcernedly playing their game of dominoes and sipping their wine whilst at another table harry waite who was fast losing his temper watched pretty sally bustling round the table  she looked a very dainty picture of english rural life and no wonder that the susceptible young frenchman could scarce take his eyes off her pretty face the vicomte de tournay was scarce nineteen a beardless boy on whom terrible tragedies which were being enacted in his own country had made but little impression he was elegantly and even foppishly dressed and once safely landed in england he was evidently ready to forget the horrors of the revolution in the delights of english life  pardi if zis is england he said as he continued to ogle sally with marked satisfaction i am of it satisfied  it would be impossible at this point to record the exact exclamation which escaped through mr harry waites clenched teeth only respect for the quality and notably for my lord antony kept his marked disapproval of the young foreigner in check  nay but this is england you abandoned young reprobate interposed lord antony with a laugh and do not i pray bring your loose foreign ways into this most moral country  lord antony had already sat down at the head of the table with the comtesse on his right jellyband was bustling round filling glasses and putting chairs straight sally waited ready to hand round the soup mr harry waites friends had at last succeeded in taking him out of the room for his temper was growing more and more violent under the vicomtes obvious admiration for sally  suzanne came in stern commanding accents from the rigid comtesse  suzanne blushed again she had lost count of time and of place whilst she had stood beside the fire allowing the handsome young englishmans eyes to dwell upon her sweet face and his hand as if unconsciously to rest upon hers her mothers voice brought her back to reality once more and with a submissive yes mama she took her place at the supper table     chapter iv the league of the scarlet pimpernel    they all looked a merry even a happy party as they sat round the table sir andrew ffoulkes and lord antony dewhurst two typical goodlooking wellborn and wellbred englishmen of that year of grace 1792 and the aristocratic french comtesse with her two children who had just escaped from such dire perils and found a safe retreat at last on the shores of protecting england  in the corner the two strangers had apparently finished their game one of them arose and standing with his back to the merry company at the table he adjusted with much deliberation his large triple caped coat as he did so he gave one quick glance all around him everyone was busy laughing and chatting and he murmured the words all safe his companion then with the alertness borne of long practice slipped on to his knees in a moment and the next had crept noiselessly under the oak bench the stranger then with a loud goodnight quietly walked out of the coffeeroom  not one of those at the supper table had noticed this curious and silent manoeuvre but when the stranger finally closed the door of the coffeeroom behind him they all instinctively sighed a sigh of relief  alone at last said lord antony jovially  then the young vicomte de tournay rose glass in hand and with the graceful affection peculiar to the times he raised it aloft and said in broken english  to his majesty george three of england god bless him for his hospitality to us all poor exiles from france  his majesty the king echoed lord antony and sir andrew as they drank loyally to the toast  to his majesty king louis of france added sir andrew with solemnity may god protect him and give him victory over his enemies  everyone rose and drank this toast in silence the fate of the unfortunate king of france then a prisoner of his own people seemed to cast a gloom even over mr jellybands pleasant countenance  and to m le comte de tournay de basserive said lord antony merrily may we welcome him in england before many days are over  ah monsieur said the comtesse as with a slightly trembling hand she conveyed her glass to her lips i scarcely dare to hope  but already lord antony had served out the soup and for the next few moments all conversation ceased while jellyband and sally handed round the plates and everyone began to eat  faith madame said lord antony after a while mine was no idle toast seeing yourself mademoiselle suzanne and my friend the vicomte safely in england now surely you must feel reasurred as to the fate of monsieur le comte  ah monsieur replied the comtesse with a heavy sigh i trust in godi can but prayand hope     aye madame here interposed sir andrew ffoulkes trust in god by all means but believe also a little in your english friends who have sworn to bring the count safely across the channel even as they have brought you today  indeed indeed monsieur she replied i have the fullest confidence in you and your friends your fame i assure you has spread throughout the whole of france the way some of my own friends have escaped from the clutches of that awful revolutionary tribunal was nothing short of a miracleand all done by you and your friends  we were but the hands madame la comtesse     but my husband monsieur said the comtesse whilst unshed tears seemed to veil her voice he is in such deadly perili would never have left him only    there were my children    i was torn between my duty to him and to them they refused to go without me    and you and your friends assured me so solemnly that my husband would be safe but oh now that i am hereamongst you allin this beautiful free englandi think of him flying for his life hunted like a poor beast    in such peril    ah i should not have left him    i should not have left him     the poor woman had completely broken down fatigue sorrow and emotion had overmastered her rigid aristocratic bearing she was crying gently to herself whilst suzanne ran up to her and tried to kiss away her tears  lord antony and sir andrew had said nothing to interrupt the comtesse whilst she was speaking there was no doubt that they felt deeply for her their very silence testified to thatbut in every century and ever since england has been what it is an englishman has always felt somewhat ashamed of his own emotion and of his own sympathy and so the two young men said nothing and busied themselves in trying to hide their feelings only succeeding in looking immeasurably sheepish  as for me monsieur said suzanne suddenly as she looked through a wealth of brown curls across at sir andrew i trust you absolutely and i know that you will bring my dear father safely to england just as you brought us today  this was said with so much confidence such unuttered hope and belief that it seemed as if by magic to dry the mothers eyes and to bring a smile upon everybodys lips  nay you shame me mademoiselle replied sir andrew though my life is at your service i have been but a humble tool in the hands of our great leader who organised and effected your escape  he had spoken with so much warmth and vehemence that suzannes eyes fastened upon him in undisguised wonder  your leader monsieur said the comtesse eagerly ah of course you must have a leader and i did not think of that before but tell me where is he i must go to him at once and i and my children must throw ourselves at his feet and thank him for all that he has done for us  alas madame said lord antony that is impossible  impossiblewhy  because the scarlet pimpernel works in the dark and his identity is only known under the solemn oath of secrecy to his immediate followers  the scarlet pimpernel said suzanne with a merry laugh why what a droll name what is the scarlet pimpernel monsieur  she looked at sir andrew with eager curiosity the young mans face had become almost transfigured his eyes shone with enthusiasm heroworship love admiration for his leader seemed literally to glow upon his face the scarlet pimpernel mademoiselle he said at last is the name of a humble english wayside flower but it is also the name chosen to hide the identity of the best and bravest man in all the world so that he may better succeed in accomplishing the noble task he has set himself to do  ah yes here interposed the young vicomte i have heard speak of this scarlet pimpernel a little flowerredyes they say in paris that every time a royalist escapes to england that devil foucquiertinville the public prosecutor receives a paper with that little flower designated in red upon it    yes  yes that is so assented lord antony  then he will have received one such paper today  undoubtedly  oh i wonder what he will say said suzanne merrily i have heard that the picture of that little red flower is the only thing that frightens him  faith then said sir andrew he will have many more opportunities of studying the shape of that small scarlet flower  ah monsieur sighed the comtesse it all sounds like a romance and i cannot understand it all  why should you try madame  but tell me why should your leaderwhy should you allspend your money and risk your livesfor it is your lives you risk messieurs when you set foot in franceand all for us french men and women who are nothing to you  sport madame la comtesse sport asserted lord antony with his jovial loud and pleasant voice we are a nation of sportsmen you know and just now it is the fashion to pull the hare from between the teeth of the hound  ah no no not sport only monsieur    you have a more noble motive i am sure for the good work you do  faith madame i would like you to find it then    as for me i vow i love the game for this is the finest sport i have yet encounteredhairbreath escapes    the devils own riskstally hoand away we go  but the comtesse shook her head still incredulously to her it seemed preposterous that these young men and their great leader all of them rich probably wellborn and young should for no other motive than sport run the terrible risks which she knew they were constantly doing their nationality once they had set foot in france would be no safeguard to them anyone found harbouring or assisting suspected royalists would be ruthlessly condemned and summarily executed whatever his nationality might be and this band of young englishmen had to her own knowledge bearded the implacable and bloodthirsty tribunal of the revolution within the very walls of paris itself and had snatched away condemned victims almost from the very foot of the guillotine with a shudder she recalled the events of the last few days her escape from paris with her two children all three of them hidden beneath the hood of a rickety cart and lying amidst a heap of turnips and cabbages not daring to breathe whilst the mob howled a la lanterne les aristos at the awful west barricade  it had all occurred in such a miraculous way she and her husband had understood that they had been placed on the list of suspected persons which meant that their trial and death were but a matter of daysof hours perhaps  then came the hope of salvation the mysterious epistle signed with the enigmatical scarlet device the clear peremptory directions the parting from the comte de tournay which had torn the poor wifes heart in two the hope of reunion the flight with her two children the covered cart that awful hag driving it who looked like some horrible evil demon with the ghastly trophy on her whip handle  the comtesse looked round at the quaint oldfashioned english inn the peace of this land of civil and religious liberty and she closed her eyes to shut out the haunting vision of that west barricade and of the mob retreating panicstricken when the old hag spoke of the plague  every moment under that cart she expected recognition arrest herself and her children tried and condemned and these young englishmen under the guidance of their brave and mysterious leader had risked their lives to save them all as they had already saved scores of other innocent people  and all only for sport impossible suzannes eyes as she sought those of sir andrew plainly told him that she thought that he at any rate rescued his fellowmen from terrible and unmerited death through a higher and nobler motive than his friend would have her believe  how many are there in your brave league monsieur she asked timidly  twenty all told mademoiselle he replied one to command and nineteen to obey all of us englishmen and all pledged to the same causeto obey our leader and to rescue the innocent  may god protect you all messieurs said the comtesse fervently  he had done that so far madame  it is wonderful to me wonderfulthat you should all be so brave so devoted to your fellowmenyet you are englishand in france treachery is rifeall in the name of liberty and fraternity  the women even in france have been more bitter against us aristocrats than the men said the vicomte with a sigh  ah yes added the comtesse while a look of haughty disdain and intense bitterness shot through her melancholy eyes there was that woman marguerite st just for instance she denounced the marquis de st cyr and all his family to the awful tribunal of the terror  marguerite st just said lord antony as he shot a quick and apprehensive glance across at sir andrew  marguerite st justsurely     yes replied the comtesse surely you know her she was a leading actress of the comedie francaise and she married an englishman lately you must know her  know her said lord antony know lady blakeneythe most fashionable woman in londonthe wife of the richest man in england of course we all know lady blakeney  she was a schoolfellow of mine at the convent in paris interposed suzanne and we came over to england together to learn your language i was very fond of marguerite and i cannot believe that she ever did anything so wicked  it certainly seems incredible said sir andrew you say that she actually denounced the marquis de st cyr why should she have done such a thing surely there must be some mistake  no mistake is possible monsieur rejoined the comtesse coldly marguerite st justs brother is a noted republican there was some talk of a family feud between him and my cousin the marquis de st cyr the st justs are quite plebeian and the republican government employs many spies i assure you there is no mistake    you had not heard this story  faith madame i did hear some vague rumours of it but in england no one would credit it    sir percy blakeney her husband is a very wealthy man of high social position the intimate friend of the prince of wales    and lady blakeney leads both fashion and society in london  that may be monsieur and we shall of course lead a very quiet life in england but i pray god that while i remain in this beautiful country i may never meet marguerite st just  the proverbial wetblanket seemed to have fallen over the merry little company gathered round the table suzanne looked sad and silent sir andrew fidgeted uneasily with his fork whilst the comtesse encased in the platearmour of her aristocratic prejudices sat rigid and unbending in her straightbacked chair as for lord antony he looked extremely uncomfortable and glanced once or twice apprehensively towards jellyband who looked just as uncomfortable as himself  at what time do you expect sir percy and lady blakeney he contrived to whisper unobserved to mine host  any moment my lord whispered jellyband in reply  even as he spoke a distant clatter was heard of an approaching coach louder and louder it grew one or two shouts became distinguishable then the rattle of horses hoofs on the uneven cobble stones and the next moment a stable boy had thrown open the coffeeroom door and rushed in excitedly  sir percy blakeney and my lady he shouted at the top of his voice theyre just arriving  and with more shouting jingling of harness and iron hoofs upon the stones a magnificent coach drawn by four superb bays had halted outside the porch of the fishermans rest     chapter v marguerite    in a moment the pleasant oakraftered coffeeroom of the inn became the scene of hopeless confusion and discomfort at the first announcement made by the stable boy lord antony with a fashionable oath had jumped up from his seat and was now giving many and confused directions to poor bewildered jellyband who seemed at his wits end what to do  for goodness sake man admonished his lordship try to keep lady blakeney talking outside for a moment while the ladies withdraw zounds he added with another more emphatic oath this is most unfortunate  quick sally the candles shouted jellyband as hopping about from one leg to another he ran hither and thither adding to the general discomfort of everybody  the comtesse too had risen to her feet rigid and erect trying to hide her excitement beneath more becoming sangfroid she repeated mechanically  i will not see heri will not see her  outside the excitement attendant upon the arrival of very important guests grew apace  goodday sir percygoodday to your ladyship your servant sir percywas heard in one long continued chorus with alternate more feeble tones ofremember the poor blind man of your charity lady and gentleman  then suddenly a singularly sweet voice was heard through all the din  let the poor man beand give him some supper at my expense  the voice was low and musical with a slight singsong in it and a faint soupcon of foreign intonation in the pronunciation of the consonants  everyone in the coffeeroom heard it and paused instinctively listening to it for a moment sally was holding the candles by the opposite door which led to the bedrooms upstairs and the comtesse was in the act of beating a hasty retreat before that enemy who owned such a sweet musical voice suzanne reluctantly was preparing to follow her mother while casting regretful glances towards the door where she hoped still to see her dearlybeloved erstwhile schoolfellow  then jellyband threw open the door still stupidly and blindly hoping to avert the catastrophe which he felt was in the air and the same low musical voice said with a merry laugh and mock consternation  brrrr i am as wet as a herring dieu has anyone ever seen such a contemptible climate  suzanne come with me at oncei wish it said the comtesse peremptorily  oh mama pleaded suzanne  my lady    er    hm    my lady    came in feeble accents from jellyband who stood clumsily trying to bar the way  pardieu my good man said lady blakeney with some impatience what are you standing in my way for dancing about like a turkey with a sore foot let me get to the fire i am perished with the cold  and the next moment lady blakeney gently pushing mine host on one side had swept into the coffeeroom  there are many portraits and miniatures extant of marguerite st justlady blakeney as she was thenbut it is doubtful if any of these really do her singular beauty justice tall above the average with magnificent presence and regal figure it is small wonder that even the comtesse paused for a moment in involuntary admiration before turning her back on so fascinating an apparition  marguerite blakeney was then scarcely fiveandtwenty and her beauty was at its most dazzling stage the large hat with its undulating and waving plumes threw a soft shadow across the classic brow with the aureole of auburn hairfree at the moment from any powder the sweet almost childlike mouth the straight chiselled nose round chin and delicate throat all seemed set off by the picturesque costume of the period the rich blue velvet robe moulded in its every line the graceful contour of the figure whilst one tiny hand held with a dignity all its own the tall stick adorned with a large bunch of ribbons which fashionable ladies of the period had taken to carrying recently  with a quick glance all around the room marguerite blakeney had taken stock of every one there she nodded pleasantly to sir andrew ffoulkes whilst extending a hand to lord antony  hello my lord tony whywhat are you doing here in dover she said merrily  then without waiting for a reply she turned and faced the comtesse and suzanne her whole face lighted up with additional brightness as she stretched out both arms towards the young girl  why if that isnt my little suzanne over there pardieu little citizeness how came you to be in england and madame too  she went up effusive to them both with not a single touch of embarrassment in her manner or in her smile lord tony and sir andrew watched the little scene with eager apprehension english though they were they had often been in france and had mixed sufficiently with the french to realise the unbending hauteur the bitter hatred with which the old noblesse of france viewed all those who had helped to contribute to their downfall armand st just the brother of beautiful lady blakeneythough known to hold moderate and conciliatory viewswas an ardent republican his feud with the ancient family of st cyrthe rights and wrongs of which no outsider ever knewhad culminated in the downfall the almost total extinction of the latter in france st just and his party had triumphed and here in england face to face with these three refugees driven from their country flying for their lives bereft of all which centuries of luxury had given them there stood a fair scion of those same republican families which had hurled down a throne and uprooted an aristocracy whose origin was lost in the dim and distant vista of bygone centuries  she stood there before them in all the unconscious insolence of beauty and stretched out her dainty hand to them as if she would by that one act bridge over the conflict and bloodshed of the past decade  suzanne i forbid you to speak to that woman said the comtesse sternly as she placed a restraining hand upon her daughters arm  she had spoken in english so that all might hear and understand the two young english gentlemen as well as the common innkeeper and his daughter the latter literally gasped with horror at this foreign insolence this impudence before her ladyshipwho was english now that she was sir percys wife and a friend of the princess of wales to boot  as for lord antony and sir andrew ffoulkes their very hearts seemed to stand still with horror at this gratuitous insult one of them uttered an exclamation of appeal the other one of warning and instinctively both glanced hurriedly towards the door whence a slow drawly not unpleasant voice had already been heard  alone among those present marguerite blakeney and the comtesse de tournay had remained seemingly unmoved the latter rigid erect and defiant with one hand still upon her daughters arm seemed the very personification of unbending pride for the moment marguerites sweet face had become as white as the soft fichu which swathed her throat and a very keen observer might have noted that the hand which held the tall beribboned stick was clenched and trembled somewhat  but this was only momentary the next instant the delicate eyebrows were raised slightly the lips curved sarcastically upwards the clear blue eyes looked straight at the rigid comtesse and with a slight shrug of the shoulders  hoitytoity citizeness she said gaily what fly stings you pray  we are in england now madame rejoined the comtesse coldly and i am at liberty to forbid my daughter to touch your hand in friendship come suzanne  she beckoned to her daughter and without another look at marguerite blakeney but with a deep oldfashioned curtsey to the two young men she sailed majestically out of the room  there was silence in the old inn parlour for a moment as the rustle of the comtesses skirts died away down the passage marguerite rigid as a statue followed with hard set eyes the upright figure as it disappeared through the doorwaybut as little suzanne humble and obedient was about to follow her mother the hard set expression suddenly vanished and a wistful almost pathetic and childlike look stole into lady blakeneys eyes  little suzanne caught that look the childs sweet nature went out to the beautiful woman scarcely older than herself filial obedience vanished before girlish sympathy at the door she turned ran back to marguerite and putting her arms round her kissed her effusively then only did she follow her mother sally bringing up the rear with a final curtsey to my lady  suzannes sweet and dainty impulse had relieved the unpleasant tension sir andrews eyes followed the pretty little figure until it had quite disappeared then they met lady blakeneys with unassumed merriment  marguerite with dainty affection had kissed her hand to the ladies as they disappeared through the door then a humorous smile began hovering round the corners of her mouth  so thats it is it she said gaily la sir andrew did you ever see such an unpleasant person i hope when i grow old i shant look like that  she gathered up her skirts and assuming a majestic gait stalked towards the fireplace  suzanne she said mimicking the comtesses voice i forbid you to speak to that woman  the laugh which accompanied this sally sounded perhaps a trifled forced and hard but neither sir andrew nor lord tony were very keen observers the mimicry was so perfect the tone of the voice so accurately reproduced that both the young men joined in a hearty cheerful bravo  ah lady blakeney added lord tony how they must miss you at the comedie francaise and how the parisians must hate sir percy for having taken you away  lud man rejoined marguerite with a shrug of her graceful shoulders tis impossible to hate sir percy for anything his witty sallies would disarm even madame la comtesse herself  the young vicomte who had not elected to follow his mother in her dignified exit now made a step forward ready to champion the comtesse should lady blakeney aim any further shafts at her but before he could utter a preliminary word of protest a pleasant though distinctly inane laugh was heard from outside and the next moment an unusually tall and very richly dressed figure appeared in the doorway     chapter vi an exquisite of 92    sir percy blakeney as the chronicles of the time inform us was in this year of grace 1792 still a year or two on the right side of thirty tall above the average even for an englishman broadshouldered and massively built he would have been called unusually goodlooking but for a certain lazy expression in his deepset blue eyes and that perpetual inane laugh which seemed to disfigure his strong clearlycut mouth  it was nearly a year ago now that sir percy blakeney bart one of the richest men in england leader of all the fashions and intimate friend of the prince of wales had astonished fashionable society in london and bath by bringing home from one of his journeys abroad a beautiful fascinating clever french wife he the sleepiest dullest most british britisher that had ever set a pretty woman yawning had secured a brilliant matrimonial prize for which as all chroniclers aver there had been many competitors  marguerite st just had first made her debut in artistic parisian circles at the very moment when the greatest social upheaval the world has ever known was taking place within its very walls scarcely eighteen lavishly gifted with beauty and talent chaperoned only by a young and devoted brother she had soon gathered round her in her charming apartment in the rue richelieu a coterie which was as brilliant as it was exclusiveexclusive that is to say only from one point of view marguerite st just was from principle and by conviction a republicanequality of birth was her mottoinequality of fortune was in her eyes a mere untoward accident but the only inequality she admitted was that of talent money and titles may be hereditary she would say but brains are not and thus her charming salon was reserved for originality and intellect for brilliance and wit for clever men and talented women and the entrance into it was soon looked upon in the world of intellectwhich even in those days and in those troublous times found its pivot in parisas the seal to an artistic career  clever men distinguished men and even men of exalted station formed a perpetual and brilliant court round the fascinating young actress of the comedie francaise and she glided through republican revolutionary bloodthirsty paris like a shining comet with a trail behind her of all that was most distinguished most interesting in intellectual europe  then the climax came some smiled indulgently and called it an artistic eccentricity others looked upon it as a wise provision in view of the many events which were crowding thick and fast in paris just then but to all the real motive of that climax remained a puzzle and a mystery anyway marguerite st just married sir percy blakeney one fine day just like that without any warning to her friends without a soiree de contrat or diner de fiancailles or other appurtenances of a fashionable french wedding  how that stupid dull englishman ever came to be admitted within the intellectual circle which revolved round the cleverest woman in europe as her friends unanimously called her no one ventured to guessgolden key is said to open every door asserted the more malignantly inclined  enough she married him and the cleverest woman in europe had linked her fate to that demmed idiot blakeney and not even her most intimate friends could assign to this strange step any other motive than that of supreme eccentricity those friends who knew laughed to scorn the idea that marguerite st just had married a fool for the sake of the worldly advantages with which he might endow her they knew as a matter of fact that marguerite st just cared nothing about money and still less about a title moreover there were at least half a dozen other men in the cosmopolitan world equally wellborn if not so wealthy as blakeney who would have been only too happy to give marguerite st just any position she might choose to covet  as for sir percy himself he was universally voted to be totally unqualified for the onerous post he had taken upon himself his chief qualifications for it seemed to consist in his blind adoration for her his great wealth and the high favour in which he stood at the english court but london society thought that taking into consideration his own intellectual limitations it would have been wiser on his part had he bestowed those worldly advantages upon a less brilliant and witty wife  although lately he had been so prominent a figure in fashionable english society he had spent most of his early life abroad his father the late sir algernon blakeney had had the terrible misfortune of seeing an idolized young wife become hopelessly insane after two years of happy married life percy had just been born when the late lady blakeney fell prey to the terrible malady which in those days was looked upon as hopelessly incurable and nothing short of a curse of god upon the entire family sir algernon took his afflicted young wife abroad and there presumably percy was educated and grew up between an imbecile mother and a distracted father until he attained his majority the death of his parents following close upon one another left him a free man and as sir algernon had led a forcibly simple and retired life the large blakeney fortune had increased tenfold  sir percy blakeney had travelled a great deal abroad before he brought home his beautiful young french wife the fashionable circles of the time were ready to receive them both with open arms sir percy was rich his wife was accomplished the prince of wales took a very great liking to them both within six months they were the acknowledged leaders of fashion and of style sir percys coats were the talk of the town his inanities were quoted his foolish laugh copied by the gilded youth at almacks or the mall everyone knew that he was hopelessly stupid but then that was scarcely to be wondered at seeing that all the blakeneys for generations had been notoriously dull and that his mother died an imbecile  thus society accepted him petted him made much of him since his horses were the finest in the country his fetes and wines the most sought after as for his marriage with the cleverest woman in europe well the inevitable came with sure and rapid footsteps no one pitied him since his fate was of his own making there were plenty of young ladies in england of high birth and good looks who would have been quite willing to help him to spend the blakeney fortune whilst smiling indulgently at his inanities and his goodhumoured foolishness moreover sir percy got no pity because he seemed to require nonehe seemed very proud of his clever wife and to care little that she took no pains to disguise that goodnatured contempt which she evidently felt for him and that she even amused herself by sharpening her ready wits at his expense  but then blakeney was really too stupid to notice the ridicule with which his wife covered him and if his matrimonial relations with the fascinating parisienne had not turned out all that his hopes and his doglike devotion for her had pictured society could never do more than vaguely guess at it  in his beautiful house at richmond he played second fiddle to his clever wife with imperturbable bonhomie he lavished jewels and luxuries of all kinds upon her which she took with inimitable grace dispensing the hospitality of his superb mansion with the same graciousness with which she had welcomed the intellectual coterie of paris  physically sir percy blakeney was undeniably handsomealways excepting the lazy bored look which was habitual to him he was always irreproachable dressed and wore the exaggerated incroyable fashions which had just crept across from paris to england with the perfect good taste innate in an english gentleman on this special afternoon in september in spite of the long journey by coach in spite of rain and mud his coat set irreproachably across his fine shoulders his hands looked almost femininely white as they emerged through billowy frills of finest mechline lace the extravagantly shortwaisted satin coat widelapelled waistcoat and tightfitting striped breeches set off his massive figure to perfection and in repose one might have admired so fine a specimen of english manhood until the foppish ways the affected movements the perpetual inane laugh brought ones admiration of sir percy blakeney to an abrupt close  he had lolled into the oldfashioned inn parlour shaking the wet off his fine overcoat then putting up a goldrimmed eyeglass to his lazy blue eye he surveyed the company upon whom an embarrassed silence had suddenly fallen  how do tony how do ffoulkes he said recognizing the two young men and shaking them by the hand zounds my dear fellow he added smothering a slight yawn did you ever see such a beastly day demmed climate this  with a quaint little laugh half of embarrassment and half of sarcasm marguerite had turned towards her husband and was surveying him from head to foot with an amused little twinkle in her merry blue eyes  la said sir percy after a moment or twos silence as no one offered any comment how sheepish you all look    whats up  oh nothing sir percy replied marguerite with a certain amount of gaiety which however sounded somewhat forced nothing to disturb your equanimityonly an insult to your wife  the laugh which accompanied this remark was evidently intended to reassure sir percy as to the gravity of the incident it apparently succeeded in that for echoing the laugh he rejoined placidly  la mdear you dont say so begad who was the bold man who dared to tackle youeh  lord tony tried to interpose but had no time to do so for the young vicomte had already quickly stepped forward  monsieur he said prefixing his little speech with an elaborate bow and speaking in broken english my mother the comtesse de tournay de basserive has offenced madame who i see is your wife i cannot ask your pardon for my mother what she does is right in my eyes but i am ready to offer you the usual reparation between men of honour  the young man drew up his slim stature to its full height and looked very enthusiastic very proud and very hot as he gazed at six foot odd of gorgeousness as represented by sir percy blakeney bart  lud sir andrew said marguerite with one of her merry infectious laughs look on that pretty picturethe english turkey and the french bantam  the simile was quite perfect and the english turkey looked down with complete bewilderment upon the dainty little french bantam which hovered quite threateningly around him  la sir said sir percy at last putting up his eye glass and surveying the young frenchman with undisguised wonderment where in the cuckoos name did you learn to speak english  monsieur protested the vicomte somewhat abashed at the way his warlike attitude had been taken by the ponderouslooking englishman  i protest tis marvellous continued sir percy imperturbably demmed marvellous dont you think so tonyeh i vow i cant speak the french lingo like that what  nay ill vouch for that rejoined marguerite sir percy has a british accent you could cut with a knife  monsieur interposed the vicomte earnestly and in still more broken english i fear you have not understand i offer you the only posseeble reparation among gentlemen  what the devil is that asked sir percy blandly  my sword monsieur replied the vicomte who though still bewildered was beginning to lose his temper  you are a sportsman lord tony said marguerite merrily ten to one on the little bantam  but sir percy was staring sleepily at the vicomte for a moment or two through his partly closed heavy lids then he smothered another yawn stretched his long limbs and turned leisurely away  lud love you sir he muttered goodhumouredly demmit young man whats the good of your sword to me  what the vicomte thought and felt at that moment when that longlimbed englishman treated him with such marked insolence might fill volumes of sound reflections    what he said resolved itself into a single articulate word for all the others were choked in his throat by his surging wrath  a duel monsieur he stammered  once more blakeney turned and from his high altitude looked down on the choleric little man before him but not even for a second did he seem to lose his own imperturbable goodhumour he laughed his own pleasant and inane laugh and burying his slender long hands into the capacious pockets of his overcoat he said leisurelya bloodthirsty young ruffian do you want to make a hole in a lawabiding man    as for me sir i never fight duels he added as he placidly sat down and stretched his long lazy legs out before him demmed uncomfortable things duels aint they tony  now the vicomte had no doubt vaguely heard that in england the fashion of duelling amongst gentlemen had been surpressed by the law with a very stern hand still to him a frenchman whose notions of bravery and honour were based upon a code that had centuries of tradition to back it the spectacle of a gentleman actually refusing to fight a duel was a little short of an enormity in his mind he vaguely pondered whether he should strike that longlegged englishman in the face and call him a coward or whether such conduct in a ladys presence might be deemed ungentlemanly when marguerite happily interposed  i pray you lord tony she said in that gentle sweet musical voice of hers i pray you play the peacemaker the child is bursting with rage and she added with a soupcon of dry sarcasm might do sir percy an injury she laughed a mocking little laugh which however did not in the least disturb her husbands placid equanimity the british turkey has had the day she said sir percy would provoke all the saints in the calendar and keep his temper the while  but already blakeney goodhumoured as ever had joined in the laugh against himself  demmed smart that now wasnt it he said turning pleasantly to the vicomte clever woman my wife sir    you will find that out if you live long enough in england  sir percy is right vicomte here interposed lord antony laying a friendly hand on the young frenchmans shoulder it would hardly be fitting that you should commence your career in england by provoking him to a duel  for a moment longer the vicomte hesitated then with a slight shrug of the shoulders directed against the extraordinary code of honour prevailing in this fogridden island he said with becoming dignity  ah well if monsieur is satisfied i have no griefs you milor are our protector if i have done wrong i withdraw myself  aye do rejoined blakeney with a long sigh of satisfaction withdraw yourself over there demmed excitable little puppy he added under his breath faith ffoulkes if thats a specimen of the goods you and your friends bring over from france my advice to you is drop em mid channel my friend or i shall have to see old pitt about it get him to clap on a prohibitive tariff and put you in the stocks an you smuggle  la sir percy your chivalry misguides you said marguerite coquettishly you forget that you yourself have imported one bundle of goods from france  blakeney slowly rose to his feet and making a deep and elaborate bow before his wife he said with consummate gallantry  i had the pick of the market madame and my taste is unerring  more so than your chivalry i fear she retorted sarcastically  odds life mdear be reasonable do you think i am going to allow my body to be made a pincushion of by every little frogeater who dont like the shape of your nose  lud sir percy laughed lady blakeney as she bobbed him a quaint and pretty curtsey you need not be afraid tis not the men who dislike the shape of my nose  afraid be demmed do you impugn my bravery madame i dont patronise the ring for nothing do i tony ive put up the fists with red sam before now andand he didnt get it all his own way either  sfaith sir percy said marguerite with a long and merry laugh that went echoing along the old oak rafters of the parlour i would i had seen you then    ha ha ha hayou must have looked a pretty picture    and    and to be afraid of a little french boy    ha ha    ha ha  ha ha ha he he he echoed sir percy goodhumouredly la madame you honour me zooks ffoulkes mark ye that i have made my wife laughthe cleverest woman in europe    odds fish we must have a bowl on that and he tapped vigorously on the table near him hey jelly quick man here jelly  harmony was once more restored mr jellyband with a mighty effort recovered himself from the many emotions he had experienced within the last half hour a bowl of punch jelly hot and strong eh said sir percy the wits that have just made a clever woman laugh must be whetted ha ha ha hasten my good jelly  nay there is no time sir percy interposed marguerite the skipper will be here directly and my brother must get on board or the day dream will miss the tide  time mdear there is plenty of time for any gentleman to get drunk and get on board before the turn of the tide  i think your ladyship said jellyband respectfully that the young gentleman is coming along now with sir percys skipper  thats right said blakeney then armand can join us in the merry bowl think you tony he added turning towards the vicomte that the jackanapes of yours will join us in a glass tell him that we drink in token of reconciliation  in fact you are all such merry company said marguerite that i trust you will forgive me if i bid my brother goodbye in another room  it would have been bad form to protest both lord antony and sir andrew felt that lady blakeney could not altogether be in tune with them at the moment her love for her brother armand st just was deep and touching in the extreme he had just spent a few weeks with her in her english home and was going back to serve his country at the moment when death was the usual reward for the most enduring devotion  sir percy also made no attempt to detain his wife with that perfect somewhat affected gallantry which characterised his every movement he opened the coffeeroom door for her and made her the most approved and elaborate bow which the fashion of the time dictated as she sailed out of the room without bestowing on him more than a passing slightly contemptuous glance only sir andrew ffoulkes whose every thought since he had met suzanne de tournay seemed keener more gentle more innately sympathetic noted the curious look of intense longing of deep and hopeless passion with which the inane and flippant sir percy followed the retreating figure of his brilliant wife     chapter vii the secret orchard    once outside the noisy coffeeroom alone in the dimlylighted passage marguerite blakeney seemed to breathe more freely she heaved a deep sigh like one who had long been oppressed with the heavy weight of constant selfcontrol and she allowed a few tears to fall unheeded down her cheeks  outside the rain had ceased and through the swiftly passing clouds the pale rays of an afterstorm sun shone upon the beautiful white coast of kent and the quaint irregular houses that clustered round the admiralty pier marguerite blakeney stepped on to the porch and looked out to sea silhouetted against the everchanging sky a graceful schooner with white sails set was gently dancing in the breeze the day dream it was sir percy blakeneys yacht which was ready to take armand st just back to france into the very midst of that seething bloody revolution which was overthrowing a monarchy attacking a religion destroying a society in order to try and rebuild upon the ashes of tradition a new utopia of which a few men dreamed but which none had the power to establish  in the distance two figures were approaching the fishermans rest one an oldish man with a curious fringe of grey hairs round a rotund and massive chin and who walked with that peculiar rolling gait which invariably betrays the seafaring man the other a young slight figure neatly and becomingly dressed in a dark many caped overcoat he was cleanshaved and his dark hair was taken well back over a clear and noble forehead  armand said marguerite blakeney as soon as she saw him approaching from the distance and a happy smile shone on her sweet face even through the tears  a minute or two later brother and sister were locked in each others arms while the old skipper stood respectfully on one side  how much time have we got briggs asked lady blakeney before m st just need go on board  we ought to weigh anchor before half an hour your ladyship replied the old man pulling at his grey forelock  linking her arm in his marguerite led her brother towards the cliffs  half an hour she said looking wistfully out to sea half an hour more and youll be far from me armand oh i cant believe that you are going dear these last few dayswhilst percy has been away and ive had you all to myself have slipped by like a dream  i am not going far sweet one said the young man gently a narrow channel to crossa few miles of roadi can soon come back  nay tis not the distance armandbut that awful paris    just now     they had reached the edge of the cliff the gentle seabreeze blew marguerites hair about her face and sent the ends of her soft lace fichu waving round her like a white and supple snake she tried to pierce the distance far away beyond which lay the shores of france that relentless and stern france which was exacting her pound of flesh the bloodtax from the noblest of her sons  our own beautiful country marguerite said armand who seemed to have divined her thoughts  they are going too far armand she said vehemently you are a republican so am i    we have the same thoughts the same enthusiasm for liberty and equality    but even you must think that they are going too far     hush said armand instinctively as he threw a quick apprehensive glance around him  ah you see you dont think yourself that it is safe even to speak of these thingshere in england she clung to him suddenly with strong almost motherly passion dont go armand she begged dont go back what should i do if    if    if     her voice was choked in sobs her eyes tender blue and loving gazed appealingly at the young man who in his turn looked steadfastly into hers  you would in any case be my own brave sister he said gently who would remember that when france is in peril it is not for her sons to turn their backs on her  even as he spoke that sweet childlike smile crept back into her face pathetic in the extreme for it seemed drowned in tears  oh armand she said quaintly i sometimes wish you had not so many lofty virtues    i assure you little sins are far less dangerous and uncomfortable but you will be prudent she added earnestly  as far as possible    i promise you  remember dear i have only you    to    to care for me     nay sweet one you have other interests now percy cares for you     a look of strange wistfulness crept into her eyes as she murmured  he did    once     but surely     there there dear dont distress yourself on my account percy is very good     nay he interrupted energetically i will distress myself on your account my margot listen dear i have not spoken of these things to you before something always seemed to stop me when i wished to question you but somehow i feel as if i could not go away and leave you now without asking you one question    you need not answer it if you do not wish he added as he noted a sudden hard look almost of apprehension darting through her eyes  what is it she asked simply  does sir percy blakeney know that    i mean does he know the part you played in the arrest of the marquis de st cyr  she laugheda mirthless bitter contemptuous laugh which was like a jarring chord in the music of her voice  that i denounced the marquis de st cyr you mean to the tribunal that ultimately sent him and all his family to the guillotine yes he does know     i told him after i married him     you told him all the circumstanceswhich so completely exonerated you from any blame  it was too late to talk of circumstances he heard the story from other sources my confession came too tardily it seems i could no longer plead extenuating circumstances i could not demean myself by trying to explain  and  and now i have the satisfaction armand of knowing that the biggest fool in england has the most complete contempt for his wife  she spoke with vehement bitterness this time and armand st just who loved her so dearly felt that he had placed a somewhat clumsy finger upon an aching wound  but sir percy loved you margot he repeated gently  loved mewell armand i thought at one time that he did or i should not have married him i daresay she added speaking very rapidly as if she were about to lay down a heavy burden which had oppressed her for months i daresay that even you thoughtas everybody else didthat i married sir percy because of his wealthbut i assure you dear that it was not so he seemed to worship me with a curious intensity of concentrated passion which went straight to my heart i had never loved any one before as you know and i was fourandtwenty thenso i naturally thought that it was not in my nature to love but it has always seemed to me that it must be heavenly to be loved blindly passionately wholly    worshipped in factand the very fact that percy was slow and stupid was an attraction for me as i thought he would love me all the more a clever man would naturally have other interests an ambitious man other hopes    i thought that a fool would worship and think of nothing else and i was ready to respond armand i would have allowed myself to be worshipped and given infinite tenderness in return     she sighedand there was a world of disillusionment in that sigh armand st just had allowed her to speak on without interruption he listened to her whilst allowing his own thoughts to run riot it was terrible to see a young and beautiful womana girl in all but namestill standing almost at the threshold of her life yet bereft of hope bereft of illusions bereft of all those golden and fantastic dreams which should have made her youth one long perpetual holiday  yet perhapsthough he loved his sister dearlyperhaps he understood he had studied men in many countries men of all ages men of every grade of social and intellectual status and inwardly he understood what marguerite had left unsaid granted that percy blakeney was dullwitted but in his slowgoing mind there would still be room for that ineradicable pride of a descendant of a long line of english gentlemen a blakeney had died on bosworth field another had sacrified life and fortune for the sake of a treacherous stuart and that same pridefoolish and prejudiced as the republican armand would call itmust have been stung to the quick on hearing of the sin which lay at lady blakeneys door she had been young misguided illadvised perhaps armand knew that her impulses and imprudence knew it still better but blakeney was slowwitted he would not listen to circumstances he only clung to facts and these had shown him lady blakeney denouncing a fellow man to a tribunal that knew no pardon and the contempt he would feel for the deed she had done however unwittingly would kill that same love in him in which sympathy and intellectuality could never have a part  yet even now his own sister puzzled him life and love have such strange vagaries could it be that with the waning of her husbands love marguerites heart had awakened with love for him strange extremes meet in loves pathway this woman who had had half intellectual europe at her feet might perhaps have set her affections on a fool marguerite was gazing out towards the sunset armand could not see her face but presently it seemed to him that something which glittered for a moment in the golden evening light fell from her eyes onto her dainty fichu of lace  but he could not broach that subject with her he knew her strange passionate nature so well and knew that reserve which lurked behind her frank open ways they had always been together these two for their parents had died when armand was still a youth and marguerite but a child he some eight years her senior had watched over her until her marriage had chaperoned her during those brilliant years spent in the flat of the rue de richelieu and had seen her enter upon this new life of hers here in england with much sorrow and some foreboding  this was his first visit to england since her marriage and the few months of separation had already seemed to have built up a slight thin partition between brother and sister the same deep intense love was still there on both sides but each now seemed to have a secret orchard into which the other dared not penetrate  there was much armand st just could not tell his sister the political aspect of the revolution in france was changing almost every day she might not understand how his own views and sympathies might become modified even as the excesses committed by those who had been his friends grew in horror and in intensity and marguerite could not speak to her brother about the secrets of her heart she hardly understood them herself she only knew that in the midst of luxury she felt lonely and unhappy  and now armand was going away she feared for his safety she longed for his presence she would not spoil these last few sadlysweet moments by speaking about herself she led him gently along the cliffs then down to the beach their arms linked in one anothers they had still so much to say that lay just outside that secret orchard of theirs     chapter viii the accredited agent    the afternoon was rapidly drawing to a close and a long chilly english summers evening was throwing a misty pall over the green kentish landscape  the day dream had set sail and marguerite blakeney stood alone on the edge of the cliff over an hour watching those white sails which bore so swiftly away from her the only being who really cared for her whom she dared to love whom she knew she could trust  some little distance away to her left the lights from the coffeeroom of the fishermans rest glittered yellow in the gathering mist from time to time it seemed to her aching nerves as if she could catch from thence the sound of merrymaking and of jovial talk or even that perpetual senseless laugh of her husbands which grated continually upon her sensitive ears  sir percy had had the delicacy to leave her severely alone she supposed that in his own stupid goodnatured way he may have understood that she would wish to remain alone while those white sails disappeared into the vague horizon so many miles away he whose notions of propriety and decorum were supersensitive had not suggested even that an attendant should remain within call marguerite was grateful to her husband for all this she always tried to be grateful to him for his thoughtfulness which was constant and for his generosity which really was boundless she tried even at times to curb the sarcastic bitter thoughts of him which made herin spite of herselfsay cruel insulting things which she vaguely hoped would wound him  yes she often wished to wound him to make him feel that she too held him in contempt that she too had forgotten that she had almost loved him loved that inane fop whose thoughts seemed unable to soar beyond the tying of a cravat or the new cut of a coat bah and yet    vague memories that were sweet and ardent and attuned to this calm summers evening came wafted back to her memory on the invisible wings of the light seabreeze the tie when first he worshipped her he seemed so devoteda very slaveand there was a certain latent intensity in that love which had fascinated her  then suddenly that love that devotion which throughout his courtship she had looked upon as the slavish fidelity of a dog seemed to vanish completely twentyfour hours after the simple little ceremony at old st roch she had told him the story of how inadvertently she had spoken of certain matters connected with the marquis de st cyr before some menher friendswho had used this information against the unfortunate marquis and sent him and his family to the guillotine  she hated the marquis years ago armand her dear brother loved angele de st cyr but st just was a plebeian and the marquis full of the pride and arrogant prejudices of his caste one day armand the respectful timid lover ventured on sending a small poementhusiastic ardent passionateto the idol of his dreams the next night he was waylaid just outside paris by the valets of marquis de st cyr and ignominiously thrashedthrashed like a dog within an inch of his lifebecause he had dared to raise his eyes to the daughter of the aristocrat the incident was one which in those days some two years before the great revolution was of almost daily occurrence in france incidents of that type in fact led to bloody reprisals which a few years later sent most of those haughty heads to the guillotine  marguerite remembered it all what her brother must have suffered in his manhood and his pride must have been appalling what she suffered through him and with him she never attempted even to analyse  then the day of retribution came st cyr and his kin had found their masters in those same plebeians whom they had despised armand and marguerite both intellectual thinking beings adopted with the enthusiasm of their years the utopian doctrines of the revolution while the marquis de st cyr and his family fought inch by inch for the retention of those privileges which had placed them socially above their fellowmen marguerite impulsive thoughtless not calculating the purport of her words still smarting under the terrible insult her brother had suffered at the marquis hands happened to hearamongst her own coteriethat the st cyrs were in treasonable correspondence with austria hoping to obtain the emperors support to quell the growing revolution in their own country  in those days one denunciation was sufficient marguerites few thoughtless words anent the marquis de st cyr bore fruit within twentyfour hours he was arrested his papers were searched letters from the austrian emperor promising to send troops against the paris populace were found in his desk he was arraigned for treason against the nation and sent to the guillotine whilst his family his wife and his sons shared in this awful fate  marguerite horrified at the terrible consequences of her own thoughtlessness was powerless to save the marquis his own coterie the leaders of the revolutionary movement all proclaimed her as a heroine and when she married sir percy blakeney she did not perhaps altogether realise how severely he would look upon the sin which she had so inadvertently committed and which still lay heavily upon her soul she made full confession of it to her husband trusting his blind love for her her boundless power over him to soon make him forget what might have sounded unpleasant to an english ear  certainly at the moment he seemed to take it very quietly hardly in fact did he appear to understand the meaning of all she said but what was more certain still was that never after that could she detect the slightest sign of that love which she once believed had been wholly hers now they had drifted quite apart and sir percy seemed to have laid aside his love for her as he would an illfitting glove she tried to rouse him by sharpening her ready wit against his dull intellect endeavouring to excite his jealousy if she could not rouse his love tried to goad him to selfassertion but all in vain he remained the same always passive drawling sleepy always courteous invariably a gentleman she had all that the world and a wealthy husband can give to a pretty woman yet on this beautiful summers evening with the white sails of the day dream finally hidden by the evening shadows she felt more lonely than that poor tramp who plodded his way wearily along the rugged cliffs  with another heavy sigh marguerite blakeney turned her back upon the sea and cliffs and walked slowly back towards the fishermans rest as she drew near the sound of revelry of gay jovial laughter grew louder and more distinct she could distinguish sir andrew ffoulkes pleasant voice lord tonys boisterous guffaws her husbands occasional drawly sleepy comments then realising the loneliness of the road and the fast gathering gloom round her she quickened her steps    the next moment she perceived a stranger coming rapidly towards her marguerite did not look up she was not the least nervous and the fishermans rest was now well within call  the stranger paused when he saw marguerite coming quickly towards him and just as she was about to slip past him he said very quietly  citoyenne st just  marguerite uttered a little cry of astonishment at thus hearing her own familiar maiden name uttered so close to her she looked up at the stranger and this time with a cry of unfeigned pleasure she put out both her hands effusively towards him  chauvelin she exclaimed  himself citoyenne at your service said the stranger gallantly kissing the tips of her fingers  marguerite said nothing for a moment or two as she surveyed with obvious delight the not very prepossessing little figure before her chauvelin was then nearer forty than thirtya clever shrewdlooking personality with a curious foxlike expression in the deep sunken eyes he was the same stranger who an hour or two previously had joined mr jellyband in a friendly glass of wine  chauvelin    my friend    said marguerite with a pretty little sigh of satisfaction i am mightily pleased to see you  no doubt poor marguerite st just lonely in the midst of her grandeur and of her starchy friends was happy to see a face that brought back memories of that happy time in paris when she reigneda queenover the intellectual coterie of the rue de richelieu she did not notice the sarcastic little smile however that hovered round the thin lips of chauvelin  but tell me she added merrily what in the world or whom in the world are you doing here in england  i might return the subtle compliment fair lady he said what of yourself  oh i she said with a shrug of the shoulders je mennuie mon ami that is all  they had reached the porch of the fishermans rest but marguerite seemed loth to go within the evening air was lovely after the storm and she had found a friend who exhaled the breath of paris who knew armand well who could talk of all the merry brilliant friends whom she had left behind so she lingered on under the pretty porch while through the gailylighted dormerwindow of the coffeeroom sounds of laughter of calls for sally and for beer of tapping of mugs and clinking of dice mingled with sir percy blakeneys inane and mirthless laugh chauvelin stood beside her his shrewd pale yellow eyes fixed on the pretty face which looked so sweet and childlike in this soft english summer twilight  you surprise me citoyenne he said quietly as he took a pinch of snuff  do i now she retorted gaily faith my little chauvelin i should have thought that with your penetration you would have guessed that an atmosphere composed of fogs and virtues would never suit marguerite st just  dear me is it as bad as that he asked in mock consternation  quite she retorted and worse  strange now i thought that a pretty woman would have found english country life peculiarly attractive  yes so did i she said with a sigh pretty women she added meditatively ought to have a good time in england since all the pleasant things are forbidden themthe very things they do every day  quite so  youll hardly believe it my little chauvelin she said earnestly but i often pass a whole daya whole daywithout encountering a single temptation  no wonder retorted chauvelin gallantly that the cleverest woman in europe is troubled with ennui  she laughed one of her melodious rippling childlike laughs  it must be pretty bad mustnt it she asked archly or i should not have been so pleased to see you  and this within a year of a romantic love match    thats just the difficulty     ah    that idyllic folly said chauvelin with quiet sarcasm did not then survive the lapse of    weeks  idyllic follies never last my little chauvelin    they come upon us like the measles    and are as easily cured  chauvelin took another pinch of snuff he seemed very much addicted to that pernicious habit so prevalent in those days perhaps too he found the taking of snuff a convenient veil for disguising the quick shrewd glances with which he strove to read the very souls of those with whom he came in contact  no wonder he repeated with the same gallantry that the most active brain in europe is troubled with ennui  i was in hopes that you had a prescription against the malady my little chauvelin  how can i hope to succeed in that which sir percy blakeney has failed to accomplish  shall we leave sir percy out of the question for the present my dear friend she said drily  ah my dear lady pardon me but that is just what we cannot very well do said chauvelin whilst once again his eyes keen as those of a fox on the alert darted a quick glance at marguerite i have a most perfect prescription against the worst form of ennui which i would have been happy to submit to you but  but what  there is sir percy  what has he to do with it  quite a good deal i am afraid the prescription i would offer fair lady is called by a very plebeian name work  work  chauvelin looked at marguerite long and scrutinisingly it seemed as if those keen pale eyes of his were reading every one of her thoughts they were alone together the evening air was quite still and their soft whispers were drowned in the noise which came from the coffeeroom still chauvelin took a step or two from under the porch looked quickly and keenly all round him then seeing that indeed no one was within earshot he once more came back close to marguerite  will you render france a small service citoyenne he asked with a sudden change of manner which lent his thin foxlike face a singular earnestness  la man she replied flippantly how serious you look all of a sudden    indeed i do not know if i would render france a small serviceat any rate it depends upon the kind of service sheor youwant  have you ever heard of the scarlet pimpernel citoyenne st just asked chauvelin abruptly  heard of the scarlet pimpernel she retorted with a long and merry laugh faith man we talk of nothing else    we have hats a la scarlet pimpernel our horses are called scarlet pimpernel at the prince of wales supper party the other night we had a souffle a la scarlet pimpernel    lud she added gaily the other day i ordered at my milliners a blue dress trimmed with green and bless me if she did not call that a la scarlet pimpernel  chauvelin had not moved while she prattled merrily along he did not even attempt to stop her when her musical voice and her childlike laugh went echoing through the still evening air but he remained serious and earnest whilst she laughed and his voice clear incisive and hard was not raised above his breath as he said  then as you have heard of that enigmatical personage citoyenne you must also have guessed and know that the man who hides his identity under that strange pseudonym is the most bitter enemy of our republic of france    of men like armand st just  la she said with a quaint little sigh i dare swear he is    france has many bitter enemies these days  but you citoyenne are a daughter of france and should be ready to help her in a moment of deadly peril  my brother armand devotes his life to france she retorted proudly as for me i can do nothing    here in england     yes you    he urged still more earnestly whilst his thin foxlike face seemed suddenly to have grown impressive and full of dignity here in england citoyenne    you alone can help us    listeni have been sent over here by the republican government as its representative i present my credentials to mr pitt in london tomorrow one of my duties here is to find out all about this league of the scarlet pimpernel which has become a standing menace to france since it is pledged to help our cursed aristocratstraitors to their country and enemies of the peopleto escape from the just punishment which they deserve you know as well as i do citoyenne that once they are over here those french emigres try to rouse public feeling against the republic    they are ready to join issue with any enemy bold enough to attack france    now within the last month scores of these emigres some only suspected of treason others actually condemned by the tribunal of public safety have succeeded in crossing the channel their escape in each instance was planned organized and effected by this society of young english jackanapes headed by a man whose brain seems as resourceful as his identity is mysterious all the most strenuous efforts on the part of my spies have failed to discover who he is whilst the others are the hands he is the head who beneath this strange anonymity calmly works at the destruction of france i mean to strike at that head and for this i want your helpthrough him afterwards i can reach the rest of the gang he is a young buck in english society of that i feel sure find that man for me citoyenne he urged find him for france  marguerite had listened to chauvelins impassioned speech without uttering a word scarce making a movement hardly daring to breathe she had told him before that this mysterious hero of romance was the talk of the smart set to which she belonged already before this her heart and her imagination had been stirred by the thought of the brave man who unknown to fame had rescued hundreds of lives from a terrible often an unmerciful fate she had but little real sympathy with those haughty french aristocrats insolent in their pride of caste of whom the comtesse de tournay de basserive was so typical an example but republican and liberalminded though she was from principle she hated and loathed the methods which the young republic had chosen for establishing itself she had not been in paris for some months the horrors and bloodshed of the reign of terror culminating in the september massacres had only come across the channel to her as a faint echo robespierre danton marat she had not known in their new guise of bloody judiciaries merciless wielders of the guillotine her very soul recoiled in horror from these excesses to which she feared her brother armandmoderate republican as he wasmight become one day the holocaust  then when first she heard of this band of young english enthusiasts who for sheer love of their fellowmen dragged women and children old and young men from a horrible death her heart had glowed with pride for them and now as chauvelin spoke her very soul went out to the gallant and mysterious leader of the reckless little band who risked his life daily who gave it freely and without ostentation for the sake of humanity  her eyes were moist when chauvelin had finished speaking the lace at her bosom rose and fell with her quick excited breathing she no longer heard the noise of drinking from the inn she did not heed her husbands voice or his inane laugh her thoughts had gone wandering in search of the mysterious hero ah there was a man she might have loved had he come her way everything in him appealed to her romantic imagination his personality his strength his bravery the loyalty of those who served under him in that same noble cause and above all that anonymity which crowned him as if with a halo of romantic glory  find him for france citoyenne  chauvelins voice close to her ear roused her from her dreams the mysterious hero had vanished and not twenty yards away from her a man was drinking and laughing to whom she had sworn faith and loyalty  la man she said with a return of her assumed flippancy you are astonishing where in the world am i to look for him  you go everywhere citoyenne whispered chauvelin insinuatingly lady blakeney is the pivot of social london so i am told    you see everything you hear everything  easy my friend retorted marguerite drawing herself up to her full height and looking down with a slight thought of contempt on the small thin figure before her easy you seem to forget that there are six feet of sir percy blakeney and a long line of ancestors to stand between lady blakeney and such a thing as you propose  for the sake of france citoyenne reiterated chauvelin earnestly  tush man you talk nonsense anyway for even if you did know who this scarlet pimpernel is you could do nothing to himan englishman  id take my chance of that said chauvelin with a dry rasping little laugh at any rate we could send him to the guillotine first to cool his ardour then when there is a diplomatic fuss about it we can apologisehumblyto the british government and if necessary pay compensation to the bereaved family  what you propose is horrible chauvelin she said drawing away from him as from some noisome insect whoever the man may be he is brave and noble and neverdo you hear menever would i lend a hand to such villainy  you prefer to be insulted by every french aristocrat who comes to this country  chauvelin had taken sure aim when he shot this tiny shaft marguerites fresh young cheeks became a touch more pale and she bit her under lip for she would not let him see that the shaft had struck home  that is beside the question she said at last with indifference i can defend myself but i refuse to do any dirty work for youor for france you have other means at your disposal you must use them my friend  and without another look at chauvelin marguerite blakeney turned her back on him and walked straight into the inn  that is not your last word citoyenne said chauvelin as a flood of light from the passage illumined her elegant richlyclad figure we meet in london i hope  we meet in london she said speaking over her shoulder at him but that is my last word  she threw open the coffeeroom door and disappeared from his view but he remained under the porch for a moment or two taking a pinch of snuff he had received a rebuke and a snub but his shrewd foxlike face looked neither abashed nor disappointed on the contrary a curious smile half sarcastic and wholly satisfied played around the corners of his thin lips     chapter ix the outrage    a beautiful starlit night had followed on the day of incessant rain a cool balmy late summers night essentially english in its suggestion of moisture and scent of wet earth and dripping leaves  the magnificent coach drawn by four of the finest thoroughbreds in england had driven off along the london road with sir percy blakeney on the box holding the reins in his slender feminine hands and beside him lady blakeney wrapped in costly furs a fiftymile drive on a starlit summers night marguerite had hailed the notion of it with delight    sir percy was an enthusiastic whip his four thoroughbreds which had been sent down to dover a couple of days before were just sufficiently fresh and restive to add zest to the expedition and marguerite revelled in anticipation of the few hours of solitude with the soft night breeze fanning her cheeks her thoughts wandering whither away she knew from old experience that sir percy would speak little if at all he had often driven her on his beautiful coach for hours at night from point to point without making more than one or two casual remarks upon the weather or the state of the roads he was very fond of driving by night and she had very quickly adopted his fancy as she sat next to him hour after hour admiring the dexterous certain way in which he handled the reins she often wondered what went on in that slowgoing head of his he never told her and she had never cared to ask  at the fishermans rest mr jellyband was going the round putting out the lights his bar customers had all gone but upstairs in the snug little bedrooms mr jellyband had quite a few important guests the comtesse de tournay with suzannne and the vicomte and there were two more bedrooms ready for sir andrew ffoulkes and lord antony dewhurst if the two young men should elect to honour the ancient hostelry and stay the night  for the moment these two young gallants were comfortably installed in the coffeeroom before the huge logfire which in spite of the mildness of the evening had been allowed to burn merrily  i say jelly has everyone gone asked lord tony as the worthy landlord still busied himself clearing away glasses and mugs  everyone as you see my lord  and all your servants gone to bed  all except the boy on duty in the bar and added mr jellyband with a laugh i expect hell be asleep afore long the rascal  then we can talk here undisturbed for half an hour  at your service my lord    ill leave your candles on the dresser    and your rooms are quite ready    i sleep at the top of the house myself but if your lordshipll only call loudly enough i daresay i shall hear  all right jelly    and    i say put the lamp outthe firell give us all the light we needand we dont want to attract the passerby  al ri my lord  mr jellyband did as he was bidhe turned out the quaint old lamp that hung from the raftered ceiling and blew out all the candles  lets have a bottle of wine jelly suggested sir andrew  al ri sir  jellyband went off to fetch the wine the room now was quite dark save for the circle of ruddy and fitful light formed by the brightly blazing logs in the hearth  is that all gentlemen asked jellyband as he returned with a bottle of wine and a couple of glasses which he placed on the table  thatll do nicely thanks jelly said lord tony  goodnight my lord goodnight sir  goodnight jelly  the two young men listened whilst the heavy tread of mr jellyband was heard echoing along the passage and staircase presently even that sound died out and the whole of the fishermans rest seemed wrapt in sleep save the two young men drinking in silence beside the hearth  for a while no sound was heard even in the coffeeroom save the ticking of the old grandfathers clock and the crackling of the burning wood  all right again this time ffoulkes asked lord antony at last  sir andrew had been dreaming evidently gazing into the fire and seeing therein no doubt a pretty piquant face with large brown eyes and a wealth of dark curls round a childish forehead  yes he said still musing all right  no hitch  none  lord antony laughed pleasantly as he poured himself out another glass of wine  i need not ask i suppose whether you found the journey pleasant this time  no friend you need not ask replied sir andrew gaily it was all right  then heres to her very good health said jovial lord tony shes a bonnie lass though she is a french one and heres to your courtshipmay it flourish and prosper exceedingly  he drained his glass to the last drop then joined his friend beside the hearth  well youll be doing the journey next tony i expect said sir andrew rousing himself from his meditations you and hastings certainly and i hope you may have as pleasant a task as i had and as charming a travelling companion you have no idea tony     no i havent interrupted his friend pleasantly but ill take your word for it and now he added whilst a sudden earnestness crept over his jovial young face how about business the two young men drew their chairs closer together and instinctively though they were alone their voices sank to a whisper  i saw the scarlet pimpernel alone for a few moments in calais said sir andrew a day or two ago he crossed over to england two days before we did he had escorted the party all the way from paris dressedyoull never credit itas an old market woman and drivinguntil they were safely out of the citythe covered cart under which the comtesse de tournay mlle suzanne and the vicomte lay concealed among the turnips and cabbages they themselves of course never suspected who their driver was he drove them right through a line of soldiery and a yelling mob who were screaming a bas les aristos but the market cart got through along with some others and the scarlet pimpernel in shawl petticoat and hood yelled a bas les aristos louder than anybody faith added the young man as his eyes glowed with enthusiasm for the beloved leader that mans a marvel his cheek is preposterous i vowand thats what carries him through  lord antony whose vocabulary was more limited than that of his friend could only find an oath or two with which to show his admiration for his leader  he wants you and hastings to meet him at calais said sir andrew more quietly on the 2nd of next month let me see that will be next wednesday  yes  it is of course the case of the comte de tournay this time a dangerous task for the comte whose escape from his chateau after he had been declared a suspect by the committee of public safety was a masterpiece of the scarlet pimpernels ingenuity is now under sentence of death it will be rare sport to get him out of france and you will have a narrow escape if you get through at all st just has actually gone to meet himof course no one suspects st just as yet but after that    to get them both out of the country ifaith twill be a tough job and tax even the ingenuity of our chief i hope i may yet have orders to be of the party  have you any special instructions for me  yes rather more precise ones than usual it appears that the republican government have sent an accredited agent over to england a man named chauvelin who is said to be terribly bitter against our league and determined to discover the identity of our leader so that he may have him kidnapped the next time he attempts to set foot in france this chauvelin has brought a whole army of spies with him and until the chief has sampled the lot he thinks we should meet as seldom as possible on the business of the league and on no account should talk to each other in public places for a time when he wants to speak to us he will contrive to let us know  the two young men were both bending over the fire for the blaze had died down and only a red glow from the dying embers cast a lurid light on a narrow semicircle in front of the hearth the rest of the room lay buried in complete gloom sir andrew had taken a pocketbook from his pocket and drawn therefrom a paper which he unfolded and together they tried to read it by the dim red firelight so intent were they upon this so wrapt up in the cause the business they had so much at heart so precious was this document which came from the very hand of their adored leader that they had eyes and ears only for that they lost count of the sounds around them of the dropping of the crisp ash from the grate of the monotonous ticking of the clock of the soft almost imperceptible rustle of something on the floor close beside them a figure had emerged from under one of the benches with snakelike noiseless movements it crept closer and closer to the two young men not breathing only gliding along the floor in the inky blackness of the room  you are to read these instructions and commit them to memory said sir andrew then destroy them  he was about to replace the lettercase into his pocket when a tiny slip of paper fluttered from it and fell on to the floor lord antony stooped and picked it up  whats that he asked  i dont know replied sir andrew  it dropped out of your pocket just now it certainly does not seem to be with the other paper  strangei wonder when it got there it is from the chief he added glancing at the paper  both stooped to try and decipher this last tiny scrap of paper on which a few words had been hastily scrawled when suddenly a slight noise attracted their attention which seemed to come from the passage beyond  whats that said both instinctively lord antony crossed the room towards the door which he threw open quickly and suddenly at that very moment he received a stunning blow between the eyes which threw him back violently into the room simultaneously the crouching snakelike figure in the gloom had jumped up and hurled itself from behind upon the unsuspecting sir andrew felling him to the ground  all this occurred within the short space of two or three seconds and before either lord antony or sir andrew had time or chance to utter a cry or to make the faintest struggle they were each seized by two men a muffler was quickly tied round the mouth of each and they were pinioned to one another back to back their arms hands and legs securely fastened  one man had in the meanwhile quietly shut the door he wore a mask and now stood motionless while the others completed their work  all safe citoyen said one of the men as he took a final survey of the bonds which secured the two young men  good replied the man at the door now search their pockets and give me all the papers you find  this was promptly and quietly done the masked man having taken possession of all the papers listened for a moment or two if there were any sound within the fishermans rest evidently satisfied that this dastardly outrage had remained unheard he once more opened the door and pointed peremptorily down the passage the four men lifted sir andrew and lord antony from the ground and as quietly as noiselessly as they had come they bore the two pinioned young gallants out of the inn and along the dover road into the gloom beyond  in the coffeeroom the masked leader of this daring attempt was quickly glancing through the stolen papers  not a bad days work on the whole he muttered as he quietly took off his mask and his pale foxlike eyes glittered in the red glow of the fire not a bad days work  he opened one or two letters from sir andrew ffoulkes pocketbook noted the tiny scrap of paper which the two young men had only just had time to read but one letter specially signed armand st just seemed to give him strange satisfaction  armand st just a traitor after all he murmured now fair marguerite blakeney he added viciously between his clenched teeth i think that you will help me to find the scarlet pimpernel     chapter x in the opera box    it was one of the gala nights at covent garden theatre the first of the autumn season in this memorable year of grace 1792  the house was packed both in the smart orchestra boxes and in the pit as well as in the more plebeian balconies and galleries above glucks orpheus made a strong appeal to the more intellectual portions of the house whilst the fashionable women the gailydressed and brilliant throng spoke to the eye of those who cared but little for this latest importation from germany  selina storace had been duly applauded after her grand aria by her numerous admirers benjamin incledon the acknowledged favourite of the ladies had received special gracious recognition from the royal box and now the curtain came down after the glorious finale to the second act and the audience which had hung spellbound on the magic strains of the great maestro seemed collectively to breathe a long sigh of satisfaction previous to letting loose its hundreds of waggish and frivolous tongues in the smart orchestra boxes many wellknown faces were to be seen mr pitt overweighted with cares of state was finding brief relaxation in tonights musical treat the prince of wales jovial rotund somewhat coarse and commonplace in appearance moved about from box to box spending brief quarters of an hour with those of his more intimate friends  in lord grenvilles box too a curious interesting personality attracted everyones attention a thin small figure with shrewd sarcastic face and deepset eyes attentive to the music keenly critical of the audience dressed in immaculate black with dark hair free from any powder lord grenvilleforeign secretary of statepaid him marked though frigid deference  here and there dotted about among distinctly english types of beauty one or two foreign faces stood out in marked contrast the haughty aristocratic cast of countenance of the many french royalist emigres who persecuted by the relentless revolutionary faction of their country had found a peaceful refuge in england on these faces sorrow and care were deeply writ the women especially paid but little heed either to the music or to the brilliant audience no doubt their thoughts were far away with husband brother son maybe still in peril or lately succumbed to a cruel fate  among these the comtesse de tournay de basserive but lately arrived from france was a most conspicuous figure dressed in deep heavy black silk with only a white lace kerchief to relieve the aspect of mourning about her person she sat beside lady portarles who was vainly trying by witty sallies and somewhat broad jokes to bring a smile to the comtesses sad mouth behind her sat little suzanne and the vicomte both silent and somewhat shy among so many strangers suzannes eyes seemed wistful when she first entered the crowded house she had looked eagerly all around scanning every face scrutinised every box evidently the one face she wished to see was not there for she settled herself quietly behind her mother listened apathetically to the music and took no further interest in the audience itself  ah lord grenville said lady portarles as following a discreet knock the clever interesting head of the secretary of state appeared in the doorway of the box you could not arrive more a propos here is madame la comtesse de tournay positively dying to hear the latest news from france  the distinguished diplomat had come forward and was shaking hands with the ladies  alas he said sadly it is of the very worst the massacres continue paris literally reeks with blood and the guillotine claims a hundred victims a day  pale and tearful the comtesse was leaning back in her chair listening horrorstruck to this brief and graphic account of what went on in her own misguided country  ah monsieur she said in broken english it is dreadful to hear all thatand my poor husband still in that awful country it is terrible for me to be sitting here in a theatre all safe and in peace whilst he is in such peril  lud madame said honest bluff lady portarles your sitting in a convent wont make your husband safe and you have your children to consider they are too young to be dosed with anxiety and premature mourning  the comtesse smiled through her tears at the vehemence of her friend lady portarles whose voice and manner would not have misfitted a jockey had a heart of gold and hid the most genuine sympathy and most gentle kindliness beneath the somewhat coarse manners affected by some ladies at that time  besides which madame added lord grenville did you not tell me yesterday that the league of the scarlet pimpernel had pledged their honour to bring m le comte safely across the channel  ah yes replied the comtesse and that is my only hope i saw lord hastings yesterday    he reassured me again  then i am sure you need have no fear what the league have sworn that they surely will accomplish ah added the old diplomat with a sigh if i were but a few years younger     la man interrupted honest lady portarles you are still young enough to turn your back on that french scarecrow that sits enthroned in your box tonight  i wish i could    but your ladyship must remember that in serving our country we must put prejudices aside m chauvelin is the accredited agent of his government     odds fish man she retorted you dont call those bloodthirsty ruffians over there a government do you  it has not been thought advisable as yet said the minister guardedly for england to break off diplomatic relations with france and we cannot therefore refuse to receive with courtesy the agent she wishes to send to us  diplomatic relations be demmed my lord that sly little fox over there is nothing but a spy ill warrant and youll findan im much mistaken that hell concern himself little with such diplomacy beyond trying to do mischief to royalist refugeesto our heroic scarlet pimpernel and to the members of that brave little league  i am sure said the comtesse pursing up her thin lips that if this chauvelin wishes to do us mischief he will find a faithful ally in lady blakeney  bless the woman ejaculated lady portarles did ever anyone see such perversity my lord grenville you have the gift of gab will you please explain to madame la comtesse that she is acting like a fool in your position here in england madame she added turning a wrathful and resolute face towards the comtesse you cannot afford to put on the hoitytoity airs you french aristocrats are so fond of lady blakeney may or may not be in sympathy with those ruffians in france she may or may not have had anything to do with the arrest and condemnation of st cyr or whatever the mans name is but she is the leader of fashion in this country sir percy blakeney has more money than any halfdozen other men put together he is hand and glove with royalty and your trying to snub lady blakeney will not harm her but will make you look a fool isnt that so my lord  but what lord grenville thought of this matter or to what reflections this comely tirade of lady portarles led the comtesse de tournay remained unspoken for the curtain had just risen on the third act of orpheus and admonishments to silence came from every part of the house  lord grenville took a hasty farewell of the ladies and slipped back into his box where m chauvelin had sat through this entracte with his eternal snuffbox in his hand and with his keen pale eyes intently fixed upon a box opposite him where with much froufrou of silken skirts much laughter and general stir of curiosity amongst the audience marguerite blakeney had just entered accompanied by her husband and looking divinely pretty beneath the wealth of her golden reddish curls slightly besprinkled with powder and tied back at the nape of her graceful neck with a gigantic black bow always dressed in the very latest vagary of fashion marguerite alone among the ladies that night had discarded the crossover fichu and broadlapelled overdress which had been in fashion for the last two or three years she wore the shortwaisted classicalshaped gown which so soon was to become the approved mode in every country in europe it suited her graceful regal figure to perfection composed as it was of shimmering stuff which seemed a mass of rich gold embroidery  as she entered she leant for a moment out of the box taking stock of all those present whom she knew many bowed to her as she did so and from the royal box there came also a quick and gracious salute  chauvelin watched her intently all through the commencement of the third act as she sat enthralled with the music her exquisite little hand toying with a small jewelled fan her regal head her throat arms and neck covered with magnificent diamonds and rare gems the gift of the adoring husband who sprawled leisurely by her side  marguerite was passionately fond of music orpheus charmed her tonight the very joy of living was writ plainly upon the sweet young face it sparkled out of the merry blue eyes and lit up the smile that lurked around the lips she was after all but fiveandtwenty in the hey day of youth the darling of a brilliant throng adored feted petted cherished two days ago the day dream had returned from calais bringing her news that her idolised brother had safely landed that he thought of her and would be prudent for her sake  what wonder for the moment and listening to glucks impassioned strains that she forgot her disillusionments forgot her vanished lovedreams forgot even the lazy goodhumoured nonentity who had made up for his lack of spiritual attainments by lavishing worldly advantages upon her  he had stayed beside her in the box just as long as convention demanded making way for his royal highness and for the host of admirers who in a continued procession came to pay homage to the queen of fashion sir percy had strolled away to talk to more congenial friends probably marguerite did not even wonder whither he had goneshe cared so little she had had a little court round her composed of the jeunesse doree of london and had just dismissed them all wishing to be alone with gluck for a brief while  a discreet knock at the door roused her from her enjoyment  come in she said with some impatience without turning to look at the intruder  chauvelin waiting for his opportunity noted that she was alone and now without pausing for that impatient come in he quietly slipped into the box and the next moment was standing behind marguerites chair  a word with you citoyenne he said quietly  marguerite turned quickly in alarm which was not altogether feigned  lud man you frightened me she said with a forced little laugh your presence is entirely inopportune i want to listen to gluck and have no mind for talking  but this is my only opportunity he said as quietly and without waiting for permission he drew a chair close behind herso close that he could whisper in her ear without disturbing the audience and without being seen in the dark background of the box this is my only opportunity he repeated as she vouchsafed him no reply lady blakeney is always so surrounded so feted by her court that a mere old friend has but very little chance  faith man she said impatiently you must seek for another opportunity then i am going to lord grenvilles ball tonight after the opera so are you probably ill give you five minutes then     three minutes in the privacy of this box are quite sufficient for me he rejoined placidly and i think that you will be wise to listen to me citoyenne st just  marguerite instinctively shivered chauvelin had not raised his voice above a whisper he was now quietly taking a pinch of snuff yet there was something in his attitude something in those pale foxy eyes which seemed to freeze the blood in her veins as would the sight of some deadly hitherto unguessed peril is that a threat citoyen she asked at last  nay fair lady he said gallantly only an arrow shot into the air  he paused a moment like a cat which sees a mouse running heedlessly by ready to spring yet waiting with that feline sense of enjoyment of mischief about to be done then he said quietly  your brother st just is in peril  not a muscle moved in the beautiful face before him he could only see it in profile for marguerite seemed to be watching the stage intently but chauvelin was a keen observer he noticed the sudden rigidity of the eyes the hardening of the mouth the sharp almost paralysed tension of the beautiful graceful figure  lud then she said with affected merriment since tis one of your imaginary plots youd best go back to your own seat and leave me enjoy the music  and with her hand she began to beat time nervously against the cushion of the box selina storace was singing the che faro to an audience that hung spellbound upon the prima donnas lips chauvelin did not move from his seat he quietly watched that tiny nervous hand the only indication that his shaft had indeed struck home  well she said suddenly and irrelevantly and with the same feigned unconcern  well citoyenne he rejoined placidly  about my brother  i have news of him for you which i think will interest you but first let me explain    may i  the question was unnecessary he felt though marguerite still held her head steadily averted from him that her every nerve was strained to hear what he had to say  the other day citoyenne he said i asked for your help    france needed it and i thought i could rely on you but you gave me your answer    since then the exigencies of my own affairs and your own social duties have kept up apart    although many things have happened     to the point i pray you citoyen she said lightly the music is entrancing and the audience will get impatient of your talk  one moment citoyenne the day on which i had the honour of meeting you at dover and less than an hour after i had your final answer i obtained possession of some papers which revealed another of those subtle schemes for the escape of a batch of french aristocratsthat traitor de tournay amongst othersall organized by that archmeddler the scarlet pimpernel some of the threads too of this mysterious organization have come into my hands but not all and i want younay you must help me to gather them together  marguerite seemed to have listened to him with marked impatience she now shrugged her shoulders and said gaily  bah man have i not already told you that i care nought about your schemes or about the scarlet pimpernel and had you not spoken about my brother     a little patience i entreat citoyenne he continued imperturbably two gentlemen lord antony dewhurst and sir andrew ffoulkes were at the fishermans rest at dover that same night  i know i saw them there  they were already known to my spies as members of that accursed league it was sir andrew ffoulkes who escorted the comtesse de tournay and her children across the channel when the two young men were alone my spies forced their way into the coffeeroom of the inn gagged and pinioned the two gallants seized their papers and brought them to me  in a moment she had guessed the danger papers    had armand been imprudent    the very thought struck her with nameless terror still she would not let this man see that she feared she laughed gaily and lightly  faith and your impudence pases belief she said merrily robbery and violencein englandin a crowded inn your men might have been caught in the act  what if they had they are children of france and have been trained by your humble servant had they been caught they would have gone to jail or even to the gallows without a word of protest or indiscretion at any rate it was well worth the risk a crowded inn is safer for these little operations than you think and my men have experience  well and those papers she asked carelessly  unfortunately though they have given me cognisance of certain names    certain movements    enough i think to thwart their projected coup for the moment it would only be for the moment and still leaves me in ignorance of the identity of the scarlet pimpernel  la my friend she said with the same assumed flippancy of manner then you are where you were before arent you and you can let me enjoy the last strophe of the aria faith she added ostentatiously smothering an imaginary yawn had you not spoken about my brother     i am coming to him now citoyenne among the papers there was a letter to sir andrew ffoulkes written by your brother st just  well and  that letter shows him to be not only in sympathy with the enemies of france but actually a helper if not a member of the league of the scarlet pimpernel  the blow had been struck at last all along marguerite had been expecting it she would not show fear she was determined to seem unconcerned flippant even she wished when the shock came to be prepared for it to have all her wits about herthose wits which had been nicknamed the keenest in europe even now she did not flinch she knew that chauvelin had spoken the truth the man was too earnest too blindly devoted to the misguided cause he had at heart too proud of his countrymen of those makers of revolutions to stoop to low purposeless falsehoods  that letter of armandsfoolish imprudent armandwas in chauvelins hands marguerite knew that as if she had seen the letter with her own eyes and chauvelin would hold that letter for purposes of his own until it suited him to destroy it or to make use of it against armand all that she knew and yet she continued to laugh more gaily more loudly than she had done before  la man she said speaking over her shoulder and looking him full and squarely in the face did i not say it was some imaginary plot    armand in league with that enigmatic scarlet pimpernel    armand busy helping those french aristocrats whom he despises    faith the tale does infinite credit to your imagination  let me make my point clear citoyenne said chauvelin with the same unruffled calm i must assure you that st just is compromised beyond the slightest hope of pardon  inside the orchestra box all was silent for a moment or two marguerite sat straight upright rigid and inert trying to think trying to face the situation to realise what had best be done  in the house storace had finished the aria and was even now bowing in her classic garb but in approved eighteenthcentury fashion to the enthusiastic audience who cheered her to the echo  chauvelin said marguerite blakeney at last quietly and without that touch of bravado which had characterised her attitude all along chauvelin my friend shall we try to understand one another it seems that my wits have become rusty by contact with this damp climate now tell me you are very anxious to discover the identity of the scarlet pimpernel isnt that so  frances most bitter enemy citoyenne    all the more dangerous as he works in the dark  all the more noble you mean    welland you would now force me to do some spying work for you in exchange for my brother armands safetyis that it  fie two very ugly words fair lady protested chauvelin urbanely there can be no question of force and the service which i would ask of you in the name of france could never be called by the shocking name of spying  at any rate that is what it is called over here she said drily that is your intention is it not  my intention is that you yourself win the free pardon for armand st just by doing me a small service  what is it  only watch for me tonight citoyenne st just he said eagerly listen among the papers which were found about the person of sir andrew ffoulkes there was a tiny note see he added taking a tiny scrap of paper from his pocketbook and handing it to her  it was the same scrap of paper which four days ago the two young men had been in the act of reading at the very moment when they were attacked by chauvelins minions marguerite took it mechanically and stooped to read it there were only two lines written in a distorted evidently disguised handwriting she read them half aloud  remember we must not meet more often than is strictly necessary you have all instructions for the 2nd if you wish to speak to me again i shall be at gs ball  what does it mean she asked  look again citoyenne and you will understand  there is a device here in the corner a small red flower     yes  the scarlet pimpernel she said eagerly and gs ball means grenvilles ball    he will be at my lord grenvilles ball tonight  that is how i interpret the note citoyenne concluded chauvelin blandly lord antony dewhurst and sir andrew ffoulkes after they were pinioned and searched by my spies were carried by my orders to a lonely house in the dover road which i had rented for the purpose there they remained close prisoners until this morning but having found this tiny scrap of paper my intention was that they should be in london in time to attend my lord grenvilles ball you see do you not that they must have a great deal to say to their chief    and thus they will have an opportunity of speaking to him tonight just as he directed them to do therefore this morning those two young gallants found every bar and bolt open in that lonely house on the dover road their jailers disappeared and two good horses standing ready saddled and tethered in the yard i have not seen them yet but i think we may safely conclude that they did not draw rein until they reached london now you see how simple it all is citoyenne  it does seem simple doesnt it she said with a final bitter attempt at flippancy when you want to kill a chicken    you take hold of it    then you wring its neck    its only the chicken who does not find it quite so simple now you hold a knife at my throat and a hostage for my obedience    you find it simple    i dont  nay citoyenne i offer you a chance of saving the brother you love from the consequences of his own folly  marguerites face softened her eyes at last grew moist as she murmured half to herself  the only being in the world who has loved me truly and constantly    but what do you want me to do chauvelin she said with a world of despair in her tearchoked voice in my present position it is wellnigh impossible  nay citoyenne he said drily and relentlessly not heeding that despairing childlike appeal which might have melted a heart of stone as lady blakeney no one suspects you and with your help tonight i maywho knowssucceed in finally establishing the identity of the scarlet pimpernel    you are going to the ball anon    watch for me there citoyenne watch and listen    you can tell me if you hear a chance word or whisper    you can note everyone to whom sir andrew ffoulkes or lord antony dewhurst will speak you are absolutely beyond suspicion now the scarlet pimpernel will be at lord grenvilles ball tonight find out who he is and i will pledge the word of france that your brother shall be safe  chauvelin was putting the knife to her throat marguerite felt herself entangled in one of those webs from which she could hope for no escape a precious hostage was being held for her obedience for she knew that this man would never make an empty threat no doubt armand was already signalled to the committee of public safety as one of the suspect he would not be allowed to leave france again and would be ruthlessly struck if she refused to obey chauvelin for a momentwomanlikeshe still hoped to temporise she held out her hand to this man whom she now feared and hated  if i promise to help you in this matter chauvelin she said pleasantly will you give me that letter of st justs  if you render me useful service tonight citoyenne he replied with a sarcastic smile i will give you that letter    tomorrow  you do not trust me  i trust you absolutely dear lady but st justs life is forfeit to his country    it rests with you to redeem it  i may be powerless to help you she pleaded were i ever so willing  that would be terrible indeed he said quietly for you    and for st just  marguerite shuddered she felt that from this man she could expect no mercy allpowerful he held the beloved life in the hollow of his hand she knew him too well not to know that if he failed in gaining his own ends he would be pitiless  she felt cold in spite of the oppressive air of operahouse the heartappealing strains of the music seemed to reach her as from a distant land she drew her costly lace scarf up around her shoulders and sat silently watching the brilliant scene as if in a dream  for a moment her thoughts wandered away from the loved one who was in danger to that other man who also had a claim on her confidence and her affection she felt lonely frightened for armands sake she longed to seek comfort and advice from someone who would know how to help and console sir percy blakeney had loved her once he was her husband why should she stand alone through this terrible ordeal he had very little brains it is true but he had plenty of muscle surely if she provided the thought and he the manly energy and pluck together they could outwit the astute diplomatist and save the hostage from his vengeful hands without imperilling the life of the noble leader of that gallant little band of heroes sir percy knew st just wellhe seemed attached to himshe was sure that he could help  chauvelin was taking no further heed of her he had said his cruel eitheror and left her to decide he in his turn now appeared to be absorbed in the sourstirring melodies of orpheus and was beating time to the music with his sharp ferretlike head  a discreet rap at the door roused marguerite from her thoughts it was sir percy blakeney tall sleepy goodhumoured and wearing that halfshy halfinane smile which just now seemed to irritate her every nerve  er    your chair is outside    mdear he said with his most exasperating drawl i suppose you will want to go to that demmed ball    excuse meermonsieur chauvelini had not observed you     he extended two slender white fingers toward chauvelin who had risen when sir percy entered the box  are you coming mdear  hush sh sh came in angry remonstrance from different parts of the house demmed impudence commented sir percy with a goodnatured smile  marguerite sighed impatiently her last hope seemed suddenly to have vanished away she wrapped her cloak round her and without looking at her husband  i am ready to go she said taking his arm at the door of the box she turned and looked straight at chauvelin who with his chapeaubras under his arm and a curious smile round his thin lips was preparing to follow the strangely illassorted couple  it is only au revoir chauvelin she said pleasantly we shall meet at my lord grenvilles ball anon  and in her eyes the astute frenchman read no doubt something which caused him profound satisfaction for with a sarcastic smile he took a delicate pinch of snuff then having dusted his dainty lace jabot he rubbed his thin bony hands contentedly together     chapter xi lord grenvilles ball    the historic ball given by the then secretary of state for foreign affairslord grenvillewas the most brilliant function of the year though the autumn season had only just begun everybody who was anybody had contrived to be in london in time to be present there and to shine at this ball to the best of his or her respective ability  his royal highness the prince of wales had promised to be present he was coming on presently from the opera lord grenville himself had listened to the two first acts of orpheus before preparing to receive his guests at ten oclockan unusually late hour in those daysthe grand rooms of the foreign office exquisitely decorated with exotic palms and flowers were filled to overflowing one room had been set apart for dancing and the dainty strains of the minuet made a soft accompaniment to the gay chatter the merry laughter of the numerous and brilliant company  in a smaller chamber facing the top of the fine stairway the distinguished host stood ready to receive his guests distinguished men beautiful women notabilities from every european country had already filed past him had exchanged the elaborate bows and curtsies with him which the extravagant fashion of the time demanded and then laughing and talking had dispersed in the ball reception and card rooms beyond  not far from lord grenvilles elbow leaning against one of the console tables chauvelin in his irreproachable black costume was taking a quiet survey of the brilliant throng he noted that sir percy and lady blakeney had not yet arrived and his keen pale eyes glanced quickly towards the door every time a newcomer appeared  he stood somewhat isolated the envoy of the revolutionary government of france was not likely to be very popular in england at a time when the news of the awful september massacres and of the reign of terror and anarchy had just begun to filtrate across the channel  in his official capacity he had been received courteously by his english colleagues mr pitt had shaken him by the hand lord grenville had entertained him more than once but the more intimate circles of london society ignored him altogether the women openly turned their backs upon him the men who held no official position refused to shake his hand  but chauvelin was not the man to trouble himself about these social amenities which he called mere incidents in his diplomatic career he was blindly enthusiastic for the revolutionary cause he despised all social inequalities and he had a burning love for his own country these three sentiments made him supremely indifferent to the snubs he received in this fogridden loyalist oldfashioned england  but above all chauvelin had a purpose at heart he firmly believed that the french aristocrat was the most bitter enemy of france he would have wished to see every one of them annihilated he was one of those who during this awful reign of terror had been the first to utter the historic and ferocious desire that aristocrats might have but one head between them so that it might be cut off with a single stroke of the guillotine and thus he looked upon every french aristocrat who had succeeded in escaping from france as so much prey of which the guillotine had been unwarrantably cheated there is no doubt that those royalist emigres once they had managed to cross the frontier did their very best to stir up foreign indignation against france plots without end were hatched in england in belgium in holland to try and induce some great power to send troops into revolutionary paris to free king louis and to summarily hang the bloodthirsty leaders of that monster republic  small wonder therefore that the romantic and mysterious personality of the scarlet pimpernel was a source of bitter hatred to chauvelin he and the few young jackanapes under his command well furnished with money armed with boundless daring and acute cunning had succeeded in rescuing hundreds of aristocrats from france ninetenths of the emigres who were feted at the english court owed their safety to that man and to his league  chauvelin had sworn to his colleagues in paris that he would discover the identity of that meddlesome englishman entice him over to france and then    chauvelin drew a deep breath of satisfaction at the very thought of seeing that enigmatic head falling under the knife of the guillotine as easily as that of any other man  suddenly there was a great stir on the handsome staircase all conversation stopped for a moment as the majordomos voice outside announced  his royal highness the prince of wales and suite sir percy blakeney lady blakeney  lord grenville went quickly to the door to receive his exalted guest  the prince of wales dressed in a magnificent court suit of salmoncoloured velvet richly embroidered with gold entered with marguerite blakeney on his arm and on his left sir percy in gorgeous shimmering cream satin cut in the extravagant incroyable style his fair hair free from powder priceless lace at his neck and wrists and the flat chapeaubras under his arm  after the few conventional words of deferential greeting lord grenville said to his royal guest  will your highness permit me to introduce m chauvelin the accredited agent of the french government  chauvelin immediately the prince entered had stepped forward expecting this introduction he bowed very low whilst the prince returned his salute with a curt nod of the head  monsieur said his royal highness coldly we will try to forget the government that sent you and look upon you merely as our guesta private gentleman from france as such you are welcome monsieur  monseigneur rejoined chauvelin bowing once again madame he added bowing ceremoniously before marguerite  ah my little chauvelin she said with unconcerned gaiety and extending her tiny hand to him monsieur and i are old friends your royal highness  ah then said the prince this time very graciously you are doubly welcome monsieur  there is someone else i would crave permission to present to your royal highness here interposed lord grenville  ah who is it asked the prince  madame la comtesse de tournay de basserive and her family who have but recently come from france  by all meansthey are among the lucky ones then  lord grenville turned in search of the comtesse who sat at the further end of the room  lud love me whispered his royal highness to marguerite as soon as he had caught sight of the rigid figure of the old lady lud love me she looks very virtuous and very melancholy  faith your royal highness she rejoined with a smile virtue is like precious odours most fragrant when it is crushed  virtue alas sighed the prince is mostly unbecoming to your charming sex madame  madame la comtesse de tournay de basserive said lord grenville introducing the lady  this is a pleasure madame my royal father as you know is ever glad to welcome those of your compatriots whom france has driven from her shores  your royal highness is ever gracious replied the comtesse with becoming dignity then indicating her daughter who stood timidly by her side my daughter suzanne monseigneur she said  ah charmingcharming said the prince and now allow me comtesse to introduce you lady blakeney who honours us with her friendship you and she will have much to say to one another i vow every compatriot of lady blakeneys is doubly welcome for her sake    her friends are our friends    her enemies the enemies of england  marguerites blue eyes had twinkled with merriment at this gracious speech from her exalted friend the comtesse de tournay who lately had so flagrantly insulted her was here receiving a public lesson at which marguerite could not help but rejoice but the comtesse for whom respect of royalty amounted almost to a religion was too wellschooled in courtly etiquette to show the slightest sign of embarrassment as the two ladies curtsied ceremoniously to one another  his royal highness is ever gracious madame said marguerite demurely and with a wealth of mischief in her twinkling blue eyes but there is no need for his kind of mediation    your amiable reception of me at our last meeting still dwells pleasantly in my memory  we poor exiles madame rejoined the comtesse frigidly show our gratitude to england by devotion to the wishes of monseigneur  madame said marguerite with another ceremonious curtsey  madame responded the comtesse with equal dignity  the prince in the meanwhile was saying a few gracious words to the young vicomte  i am happy to know you monsieur le vicomte he said i knew your father well when he was ambassador in london  ah monseigneur replied the vicomte i was a leetle boy then    and now i owe the honour of this meeting to our protector the scarlet pimpernel  hush said the prince earnestly and quickly as he indicated chauvelin who had stood a little on one side throughout the whole of this little scene watching marguerite and the comtesse with an amused sarcastic little smile around his thin lips  nay monseigneur he said now as if in direct response to the princes challenge pray do not check this gentlemans display of gratitude the name of that interesting red flower is well known to meand to france  the prince looked at him keenly for a moment or two  faith then monsieur he said perhaps you know more about our national hero than we do ourselves    perchance you know who he is    see he added turning to the groups round the room the ladies hang upon your lips    you would render yourself popular among the fair sex if you were to gratify their curiosity  ah monseigneur said chauvelin significantly rumour has it in france that your highness couldan you wouldgive the truest account of that enigmatical wayside flower  he looked quickly and keenly at marguerite as he spoke but she betrayed no emotion and her eyes met his quite fearlessly  nay man replied the prince my lips are sealed and the members of the league jealously guard the secret of their chief    so his fair adorers have to be content with worshipping a shadow here in england monsieur he added with wonderful charm and dignity we but name the scarlet pimpernel and every fair cheek is suffused with a blush of enthusiasm none have seen him save his faithful lieutenants we know not if he be tall or short fair or dark handsome or illformed but we know that he is the bravest gentleman in all the world and we all feel a little proud monsieur when we remember that he is an englishman  ah monsieur chauvelin added marguerite looking almost with defiance across at the placid sphinxlike face of the frenchman his royal highness should add that we ladies think of him as of a hero of old    we worship him    we wear his badge    we tremble for him when he is in danger and exult with him in the hour of his victory  chauvelin did no more than bow placidly both to the prince and to marguerite he felt that both speeches were intendedeach in their wayto convey contempt or defiance the pleasureloving idle prince he despised the beautiful woman who in her golden hair wore a spray of small red flowers composed of rubies and diamondsher he held in the hollow of his hand he could afford to remain silent and to wait events  a long jovial inane laugh broke the sudden silence which had fallen over everyone and we poor husbands came in slow affected accents from gorgeous sir percy we have to stand by    while they worship a demmed shadow  everyone laughedthe prince more loudly than anyone the tension of subdued excitement was relieved and the next moment everyone was laughing and chatting merrily as the gay crowd broke up and dispersed in the adjoining rooms     chapter xii the scrap of paper    marguerite suffered intensely though she laughed and chatted though she was more admired more surrounded more feted than any woman there she felt like one condemned to death living her last day upon this earth  her nerves were in a state of painful tension which had increased a hundredfold during that brief hour which she had spent in her husbands company between the opera and the ball the short ray of hopethat she might find in this goodnatured lazy individual a valuable friend and adviserhad vanished as quickly as it had come the moment she found herself alone with him the same feeling of goodhumoured contempt which one feels for an animal or a faithful servant made her turn away with a smile from the man who should have been her moral support in this heartrending crisis through which she was passing who should have been her coolheaded adviser when feminine sympathy and sentiment tossed her hither and thither between her love for her brother who was far away and in mortal peril and horror of the awful service which chauvelin had exacted from her in exchange for armands safety  there he stood the moral support the coolheaded adviser surrounded by a crowd of brainless emptyheaded young fops who were even now repeating from mouth to mouth and with every sign of the keenest enjoyment a doggerel quatrain which he had just given forth everywhere the absurd silly words met her people seemed to have little else to speak about even the prince had asked her with a little laugh whether she appreciated her husbands latest poetic efforts  all done in the tying of a cravat sir percy had declared to his clique of admirers       we seek him here we seek him there      those frenchies seek him everywhere      is he in heavenis he in hell      that demmed elusive pimpernel  sir percys bon mot had gone the round of the brilliant receptionrooms the prince was enchanted he vowed that life without blakeney would be but a dreary desert then taking him by the arm had led him to the cardroom and engaged him in a long game of hazard  sir percy whose chief interest in most social gatherings seemed to centre round the cardtable usually allowed his wife to flirt dance to amuse or bore herself as much as she liked and tonight having delivered himself of his bon mot he had left marguerite surrounded by a crowd of admirers of all ages all anxious and willing to help her to forget that somewhere in the spacious reception rooms there was a long lazy being who had been fool enough to suppose that the cleverest woman in europe would settle down to the prosaic bonds of english matrimony  her still overwrought nerves her excitement and agitation lent beautiful marguerite blakeney much additional charm escorted by a veritable bevy of men of all ages and of most nationalities she called forth many exclamations of admiration from everyone as she passed  she would not allow herself any more time to think her early somewhat bohemian training had made her something of a fatalist she felt that events would shape themselves that the directing of them was not in her hands from chauvelin she knew that she could expect no mercy he had set a price on armands head and left it to her to pay or not as she chose  later on in the evening she caught sight of sir andrew ffoulkes and lord antony dewhurst who seemingly had just arrived she noticed at once that sir andrew immediately made for little suzanne de tournay and that the two young people soon managed to isolate themselves in one of the deep embrasures of the mullioned windows there to carry on a long conversation which seemed very earnest and very pleasant on both sides  both the young men looked a little haggard and anxious but otherwise they were irreproachably dressed and there was not the slightest sign about their courtly demeanour of the terrible catastrophe which they must have felt hovering round them and round their chief  that the league of the scarlet pimpernel had no intention of abandoning its cause she had gathered through little suzanne herself who spoke openly of the assurance she and her mother had had that the comte de tournay would be rescued from france by the league within the next few days vaguely she began to wonder as she looked at the brilliant and fashionable in the gailylighted ballroom which of these worldly men round her was the mysterious scarlet pimpernel who held the threads of such daring plots and the fate of valuable lives in his hands  a burning curiosity seized her to know him although for months she had heard of him and had accepted his anonymity as everyone else in society had done but now she longed to knowquite impersonally quite apart from armand and oh quite apart from chauvelinonly for her own sake for the sake of the enthusiastic admiration she had always bestowed on his bravery and cunning  he was at the ball of course somewhere since sir andrew ffoulkes and lord antony dewhurst were here evidently expecting to meet their chiefand perhaps to get a fresh mot dordre from him  marguerite looked round at everyone at the aristocratic hightyped norman faces the squarelybuilt fairhaired saxon the more gentle humorous caste of the celt wondering which of these betrayed the power the energy the cunning which had imposed its will and its leadership upon a number of highborn english gentlemen among whom rumour asserted was his royal highness himself  sir andrew ffoulkes surely not with his gentle blue eyes which were looking so tenderly and longingly after little suzanne who was being led away from the pleasant teteatete by her stern mother marguerite watched him across the room as he finally turned away with a sigh and seemed to stand aimless and lonely now that suzannes dainty little figure had disappeared in the crowd  she watched him as he strolled towards the doorway which led to a small boudoir beyond then paused and leaned against the framework of it looking still anxiously all round him  marguerite contrived for the moment to evade her present attentive cavalier and she skirted the fashionable crowd drawing nearer to the doorway against which sir andrew was leaning why she wished to get closer to him she could not have said perhaps she was impelled by an allpowerful fatality which so often seems to rule the destinies of men  suddenly she stopped her very heart seemed to stand still her eyes large and excited flashed for a moment towards that doorway then as quickly were turned away again sir andrew ffoulkes was still in the same listless position by the door but marguerite had distinctly seen that lord hastingsa young buck a friend of her husbands and one of the princes sethad as he quickly brushed past him slipped something into his hand  for one moment longeroh it was the merest flashmarguerite paused the next she had with admirably played unconcern resumed her walk across the roombut this time more quickly towards that doorway whence sir andrew had now disappeared  all this from the moment that marguerite had caught sight of sir andrew leaning against the doorway until she followed him into the little boudoir beyond had occurred in less than a minute fate is usually swift when she deals a blow  now lady blakeney had suddenly ceased to exist it was marguerite st just who was there only marguerite st just who had passed her childhood her early youth in the protecting arms of her brother armand she had forgotten everything elseher rank her dignity her secret enthusiasmseverything save that armand stood in peril of his life and that there not twenty feet away from her in the small boudoir which was quite deserted in the very hands of sir andrew ffoulkes might be the talisman which would save her brothers life  barely another thirty seconds had elapsed between the moment when lord hastings slipped the mysterious something into sir andrews hand and the one when she in her turn reached the deserted boudoir sir andrew was standing with his back to her and close to a table upon which stood a massive silver candelabra a slip of paper was in his hand and he was in the very act of perusing its contents  unperceived her soft clinging robe making not the slightest sound upon the heavy carpet not daring to breathe until she had accomplished her purpose marguerite slipped close behind him    at that moment he looked round and saw her she uttered a groan passed her hand across her forehead and murmured faintly  the heat in the room was terrible    i felt so faint    ah     she tottered almost as if she would fall and sir andrew quickly recovering himself and crumpling in his hand the tiny note he had been reading was only apparently just in time to support her  you are ill lady blakeney he asked with much concern let me     no no nothing she interrupted quickly a chairquick  she sank into a chair close to the table and throwing back her head closing her eyes  there she murmured still faintly the giddiness is passing off    do not heed me sir andrew i assure you i already feel better  at moments like these there is no doubtand psychologists actually assert itthat there is in us a sense which has absolutely nothing to do with the other five it is not that we see it is not that we hear or touch yet we seem to do all three at once marguerite sat there with her eyes apparently closed sir andrew was immediately behind her and on her right was the table with the fivearmed candelabra upon it before her mental vision there was absolutely nothing but armands face armand whose life was in the most imminent danger and who seemed to be looking at her from a background upon which were dimly painted the seething crowd of paris the bare walls of the tribunal of public safety with foucquiertinville the public prosecutor demanding armands life in the name of the people of france and the lurid guillotine with its stained knife waiting for another victim    armand     for one moment there was dead silence in the little boudoir beyond from the brilliant ballroom the sweet notes of the gavotte the froufrou of rich dresses the talk and laughter of a large and merry crowd came as a strange weird accompaniment to the drama which was being enacted here sir andrew had not uttered another word then it was that that extra sense became potent in marguerite blakeney she could not see for her two eyes were closed she could not hear for the noise from the ballroom drowned the soft rustle of that momentous scrap of paper nevertheless she knewas if she had both seen and heardthat sir andrew was even now holding the paper to the flame of one of the candles  at the exact moment that it began to catch fire she opened her eyes raised her hand and with two dainty fingers had taken the burning scrap of paper from the young mans hand then she blew out the flame and held the paper to her nostril with perfect unconcern  how thoughtful of you sir andrew she said gaily surely twas your grandmother who taught you that the smell of burnt paper was a sovereign remedy against giddiness  she sighed with satisfaction holding the paper tightly between her jewelled fingers that talisman which perhaps would save her brother armands life sir andrew was staring at her too dazed for the moment to realize what had actually happened he had been taken so completely by surprise that he seemed quite unable to grasp the fact that the slip of paper which she held in her dainty hand was one perhaps on which the life of his comrade might depend  marguerite burst into a long merry peal of laughter  why do you stare at me like that she said playfully i assure you i feel much better your remedy has proved most effectual this room is most delightedly cool she added with the same perfect composure and the sound of the gavotte from the ballroom is fascinating and soothing  she was prattling on in the most unconcerned and pleasant way whilst sir andrew in an agony of mind was racking his brains as to the quickest method he could employ to get that bit of paper out of that beautiful womans hand instinctively vague and tumultuous thoughts rushed through his mind he suddenly remembered her nationality and worst of all recollected that horrible tale anent the marquis de st cyr which in england no one had credited for the sake of sir percy as well as for her own  what still dreaming and staring she said with a merry laugh you are most ungallant sir andrew and now i come to think of it you seemed more startled than pleased when you saw me just now i do believe after all that it was not concern for my health nor yet a remedy taught you by your grandmother that caused you to burn this tiny scrap of paper    i vow it must have been your lady loves last cruel epistle you were trying to destroy now confess she added playfully holding up the scrap of paper does this contain her final conge or a last appeal to kiss and make friends  whichever it is lady blakeney said sir andrew who was gradually recovering his selfpossession this little note is undoubtedly mine and    not caring whether his action was one that would be styled illbred towards a lady the young man had made a bold dash for the note but marguerites thoughts flew quicker than his own her actions under pressure of this intense excitement were swifter and more sure she was tall and strong she took a quick step backwards and knocked over the small sheraton table which was already topheavy and which fell down with a crash together with the massive candelabra upon it  she gave a quick cry of alarm  the candles sir andrewquick  there was not much damage done one or two of the candles had blown out as the candelabra fell others had merely sent some grease upon the valuable carpet one had ignited the paper shade aver it sir andrew quickly and dexterously put out the flames and replaced the candelabra upon the table but this had taken him a few seconds to do and those seconds had been all that marguerite needed to cast a quick glance at the paper and to note its contentsa dozen words in the same distorted handwriting she had seen before and bearing the same devicea starshaped flower drawn in red ink  when sir andrew once more looked at her he only saw upon her face alarm at the untoward accident and relief at its happy issue whilst the tiny and momentous note had apparently fluttered to the ground eagerly the young man picked it up and his face looked much relieved as his fingers closed tightly over it  for shame sir andrew she said shaking her head with a playful sigh making havoc in the heart of some impressionable duchess whilst conquering the affections of my sweet little suzanne well well i do believe it was cupid himself who stood by you and threatened the entire foreign office with destruction by fire just on purpose to make me drop loves message before it had been polluted by my indiscreet eyes to think that a moment longer and i might have known the secrets of an erring duchess  you will forgive me lady blakeney said sir andrew now as calm as she was herself if i resume the interesting occupation which you have interrupted  by all means sir andrew how should i venture to thwart the lovegod again perhaps he would mete out some terrible chastisement against my presumption burn your lovetoken by all means  sir andrew had already twisted the paper into a long spill and was once again holding it to the flame of the candle which had remained alight he did not notice the strange smile on the face of his fair visavis so intent was he on the work of destruction perhaps had he done so the look of relief would have faded from his face he watched the fateful note as it curled under the flame soon the last fragment fell on the floor and he placed his heel upon the ashes  and now sir andrew said marguerite blakeney with the pretty nonchalance peculiar to herself and with the most winning of smiles will you venture to excite the jealousy of your fair lady by asking me to dance the minuet     chapter xiii eitheror    the few words which marguerite blakeney had managed to read on the halfscorched piece of paper seemed literally to be the words of fate start myself tomorrow    this she had read quite distinctly then came a blur caused by the smoke of the candle which obliterated the next few words but right at the bottom there was another sentence like letters of fire before her mental vision if you wish to speak to me again i shall be in the supperroom at one oclock precisely the whole was signed with the hastilyscrawled little devicea tiny starshaped flower which had become so familiar to her  one oclock precisely it was now close upon eleven the last minuet was being danced with sir andrew ffoulkes and beautiful lady blakeney leading the couples through its delicate and intricate figures  close upon eleven the hands of the handsome louis xv clock upon its ormolu bracket seemed to move along with maddening rapidity two hours more and her fate and that of armand would be sealed in two hours she must make up her mind whether she will keep the knowledge so cunningly gained to herself and leave her brother to his fate or whether she will wilfully betray a brave man whose life was devoted to his fellowmen who was noble generous and above all unsuspecting it seemed a horrible thing to do but then there was armand armand too was noble and brave armand too was unsuspecting and armand loved her would have willingly trusted his life in her hands and now when she could save him from death she hesitated oh it was monstrous her brothers kind gentle face so full of love for her seemed to be looking reproachfully at her you might have saved me margot he seemed to say to her and you chose the life of a stranger a man you do not know whom you have never seen and preferred that he should be safe whilst you sent me to the guillotine  all these conflicting thoughts raged through marguerites brain while with a smile upon her lips she glided through the graceful mazes of the minuet she notedwith that acute sense of hersthat she had succeeded in completely allaying sir andrews fears her selfcontrol had been absolutely perfectshe was a finer actress at this moment and throughout the whole of this minuet than she had ever been upon the boards of the comedie francaise but then a beloved brothers life had not depended upon her histrionic powers  she was too clever to overdo her part and made no further allusions to the supposed billet doux which had caused sir andrew ffoulkes such an agonising five minutes she watched his anxiety melting away under her sunny smile and soon perceived that whatever doubt may have crossed his mind at the moment she had by the time the last bars of the minuet had been played succeeded in completely dispelling it he never realised in what a fever of excitement she was what effort it cost her to keep up a constant ripple of banal conversation  when the minuet was over she asked sir andrew to take her into the next room  i have promised to go down to supper with his royal highness she said but before we part tell me    am i forgiven  forgiven  yes confess i gave you a fright just now    but remember i am not an english woman and i do not look upon the exchanging of billet doux as a crime and i vow ill not tell my little suzanne but now tell me shall i welcome you at my waterparty on wednesday  i am not sure lady blakeney he replied evasively i may have to leave london tomorrow  i would not do that if i were you she said earnestly then seeing the anxious look reappearing in his eyes she added gaily no one can throw a ball better than you can sir andrew we should so miss you on the bowlinggreen  he had led her across the room to one beyond where already his royal highness was waiting for the beautiful lady blakeney  madame supper awaits us said the prince offering his arm to marguerite and i am full of hope the goddess fortune has frowned so persistently on me at hazard that i look with confidence for the smiles of the goddess of beauty  your highness has been unfortunate at the card tables asked marguerite as she took the princes arm  aye most unfortunate blakeney not content with being the richest among my fathers subjects has also the most outrageous luck by the way where is that inimitable wit i vow madam that this life would be but a dreary desert without your smiles and his sallies     chapter xiv one oclock precisely    supper had been extremely gay all those present declared that never had lady blakeney been more adorable nor that demmed idiot sir percy more amusing  his royal highness had laughed until the tears streamed down his cheeks at blakeneys foolish yet funny repartees his doggerel verse we seek him here we seek him there etc was sung to the tune of ho merry britons and to the accompaniment of glasses knocked loudly against the table lord grenville moreover had a most perfect cooksome wags asserted that he was a scion of the old french noblesse who having lost his fortune had come to seek it in the cuisine of the foreign office  marguerite blakeney was in her most brilliant mood and surely not a soul in that crowded supperroom had even an inkling of the terrible struggle which was raging within her heart  the clock was ticking so mercilessly on it was long past midnight and even the prince of wales was thinking of leaving the suppertable within the next halfhour the destinies of two brave men would be pitted against one anotherthe dearlybeloved brother and he the unknown hero  marguerite had not tried to see chauvelin during this last hour she knew that his keen foxlike eyes would terrify her at once and incline the balance of her decision towards armand whilst she did not see him there still lingered in her heart of hearts a vague undefined hope that something would occur something big enormous epochmaking which would shift from her young weak shoulders this terrible burden of responsibility of having to choose between two such cruel alternatives  but the minutes ticked on with that dull monotony which they invariably seem to assume when our very nerves ache with their incessant ticking  after supper dancing was resumed his royal highness had left and there was general talk of departing among the older guests the young were indefatigable and had started on a new gavotte which would fill the next quarter of an hour  marguerite did not feel equal to another dance there is a limit to the most enduring of selfcontrol escorted by a cabinet minister she had once more found her way to the tiny boudoir still the most deserted among all the rooms she knew that chauvelin must be lying in wait for her somewhere ready to seize the first possible opportunity for a teteatete his eyes had met hers for a moment after the foresupper minuet and she knew that the keen diplomat with those searching pale eyes of his had divined that her work was accomplished  fate had willed it so marguerite torn by the most terrible conflict heart of woman can ever know had resigned herself to its decrees but armand must be saved at any cost he first of all for he was her brother had been mother father friend to her ever since she a tiny babe had lost both her parents to think of armand dying a traitors death on the guillotine was too horrible even to dwell uponimpossible in fact that could never be never    as for the stranger the hero    well there let fate decide marguerite would redeem her brothers life at the hands of the relentless enemy then let that cunning scarlet pimpernel extricate himself after that  perhapsvaguelymarguerite hoped that the daring plotter who for so many months had baffled an army of spies would still manage to evade chauvelin and remain immune to the end  she thought of all this as she sat listening to the witty discourse of the cabinet minister who no doubt felt that he had found in lady blakeney a most perfect listener suddenly she saw the keen foxlike face of chauvelin peeping through the curtained doorway  lord fancourt she said to the minister will you do me a service  i am entirely at your ladyships service he replied gallantly  will you see if my husband is still in the cardroom and if he is will you tell him that i am very tired and would be glad to go home soon  the commands of a beautiful woman are binding on all mankind even on cabinet ministers lord fancourt prepared to obey instantly  i do not like to leave your ladyship alone he said  never fear i shall be quite safe hereand i think undisturbed    but i am really tired you know sir percy will drive back to richmond it is a long way and we shall notan we do not hurryget home before daybreak  lord fancourt had perforce to go  the moment he had disappeared chauvelin slipped into the room and the next instant stood calm and impassive by her side  you have news for me he said  an icy mantle seemed to have suddenly settled round marguerites shoulders though her cheeks glowed with fire she felt chilled and numbed oh armand will you ever know the terrible sacrifice of pride of dignity of womanliness a devoted sister is making for your sake  nothing of importance she said staring mechanically before her but it might prove a clue i contrivedno matter howto detect sir andrew ffoulkes in the very act of burning a paper at one of these candles in this very room that paper i succeeded in holding between my fingers for the space of two minutes and to cast my eyes on it for that of ten seconds  time enough to learn its contents asked chauvelin quietly  she nodded then continued in the same even mechanical tone of voice  in the corner of the paper there was the usual rough device of a small starshaped flower above it i read two lines everything else was scorched and blackened by the flame  and what were the two lines  her throat seemed suddenly to have contracted for an instant she felt that she could not speak the words which might send a brave man to his death  it is lucky that the whole paper was not burned added chauvelin with dry sarcasm for it might have fared ill with armand st just what were the two lines citoyenne  one was i start myself tomorrow she said quietly the otherif you wish to speak to me i shall be in the supperroom at one oclock precisely  chauvelin looked up at the clock just above the mantelpiece  then i have plenty of time he said placidly  what are you going to do she asked  she was pale as a statue her hands were icy cold her head and heart throbbed with the awful strain upon her nerves oh this was cruel cruel what had she done to have deserved all this her choice was made had she done a vile action or one that was sublime the recording angel who writes in the book of gold alone could give an answer  what are you going to do she repeated mechanically  oh nothing for the present after that it will depend  on what  on whom i shall see in the supperroom at one oclock precisely  you will see the scarlet pimpernel of course but you do not know him  no but i shall presently  sir andrew will have warned him  i think not when you parted from him after the minuet he stood and watched you for a moment or two with a look which gave me to understand that something had happened between you it was only natural was it not that i should make a shrewd guess as to the nature of that something i thereupon engaged the young man in a long and animated conversationwe discussed herr glucks singular success in londonuntil a lady claimed his arm for supper  since then  i did not lose sight of him through supper when we all came upstairs again lady portarles buttonholed him and started on the subject of pretty mlle suzanne de tournay i knew he would not move until lady portarles had exhausted on the subject which will not be for another quarter of an hour at least and it is five minutes to one now  he was preparing to go and went up to the doorway where drawing aside the curtain he stood for a moment pointing out to marguerite the distant figure of sir andrew ffoulkes in close conversation with lady portarles  i think he said with a triumphant smile that i may safely expect to find the person i seek in the diningroom fair lady  there may be more than one  whoever is there as the clock strikes one will be shadowed by one of my men of these one or perhaps two or even three will leave for france tomorrow one of these will be the scarlet pimpernel  yesand  i also fair lady will leave for france tomorrow the papers found at dover upon the person of sir andrew ffoulkes speak of the neighborhood of calais of an inn which i know well called le chat gris of a lonely place somewhere on the coastthe pere blanchards hutwhich i must endeavor to find all these places are given as the point where this meddlesome englishman has bidden the traitor de tournay and others to meet his emissaries but it seems that he has decided not to send his emissaries that he will start himself tomorrow now one of these persons whom i shall see anon in the supperroom will be journeying to calais and i shall follow that person until i have tracked him to where those fugitive aristocrats await him for that person fair lady will be the man whom i have sought for for nearly a year the man whose energies has outdone me whose ingenuity has baffled me whose audacity has set me wonderingyes mewho have seen a trick or two in my timethe mysterious and elusive scarlet pimpernel  and armand she pleaded  have i ever broken my word i promise you that the day the scarlet pimpernel and i start for france i will send you that imprudent letter of his by special courier more than that i will pledge you the word of france that the day i lay hands on that meddlesome englishman st just will be here in england safe in the arms of his charming sister  and with a deep and elaborate bow and another look at the clock chauvelin glided out of the room  it seemed to marguerite that through all the noise all the din of music dancing and laughter she could hear his catlike tread gliding through the vast receptionrooms that she could hear him go down the massive staircase reach the diningroom and open the door fate had decided had made her speak had made her do a vile and abominable thing for the sake of the brother she loved she lay back in her chair passive and still seeing the figure of her relentless enemy ever present before her aching eyes  when chauvelin reached the supperroom it was quite deserted it had that woebegone forsaken tawdry appearance which reminds one so much of a balldress the morning after  halfempty glasses littered the table unfolded napkins lay about the chairsturned towards one another in groups of twos and threesvery close to one anotherin the far corners of the room which spoke of recent whispered flirtations over cold gamepie and champagne there were sets of three and four chairs that recalled pleasant animated discussions over the latest scandal there were chairs straight up in a row that still looked starchy critical acid like antiquated dowager there were a few isolated single chairs close to the table that spoke of gourmands intent on the most recherche dishes and others overturned on the floor that spoke volumes on the subject of my lord grenvilles cellars  it was a ghostlike replica in fact of that fashionable gathering upstairs a ghost that haunts every house where balls and good suppers are given a picture drawn with white chalk on grey cardboard dull and colourless now that the bright silk dresses and gorgeously embroidered coats were no longer there to fill in the foreground and now that the candles flickered sleepily in their sockets  chauvelin smiled benignly and rubbing his long thin hands together he looked round the deserted supperroom whence even the last flunkey had retired in order to join his friends in the hall below all was silence in the dimlylighted room whilst the sound of the gavotte the hum of distant talk and laughter and the rumble of an occasional coach outside only seemed to reach this palace of the sleeping beauty as the murmur of some flitting spooks far away  it all looked so peaceful so luxurious and so still that the keenest observera veritable prophetcould never have guessed that at this present moment that deserted supperroom was nothing but a trap laid for the capture of the most cunning and audacious plotter those stirring times had ever seen  chauvelin pondered and tried to peer into the immediate future what would this man be like whom he and the leaders of the whole revolution had sworn to bring to his death everything about him was weird and mysterious his personality which he so cunningly concealed the power he wielded over nineteen english gentlemen who seemed to obey his every command blindly and enthusiastically the passionate love and submission he had roused in his little trained band and above all his marvellous audacity the boundless impudence which had caused him to beard his most implacable enemies within the very walls of paris  no wonder that in france the sobriquet of the mysterious englishman roused in the people a superstitious shudder chauvelin himself as he gazed round the deserted room where presently the weird hero would appear felt a strange feeling of awe creeping all down his spine  but his plans were well laid he felt sure that the scarlet pimpernel had not been warned and felt equally sure that marguerite blakeney had not played him false if she had    a cruel look that would have made her shudder gleamed in chauvelins keen pale eyes if she had played him a trick armand st just would suffer the extreme penalty  but no no of course she had not played him false  fortunately the supperroom was deserted this would make chauvelins task all the easier when presently that unsuspecting enigma would enter it alone no one was here now save chauvelin himself  stay as he surveyed with a satisfied smile the solitude of the room the cunning agent of the french government became aware of the peaceful monotonous breathing of some one of my lord grenvilles guests who no doubt had supped both wisely and well and was enjoying a quiet sleep away from the din of the dancing above  chauvelin looked round once more and there in the corner of a sofa in the dark angle of the room his mouth open his eyes shut the sweet sounds of peaceful slumbers proceedings from his nostrils reclined the gorgeouslyapparelled longlimbed husband of the cleverest woman in europe  chauvelin looked at him as he lay there placid unconscious at peace with all the world and himself after the best of suppers and a smile that was almost one of pity softened for a moment the hard lines of the frenchmans face and the sarcastic twinkle of his pale eyes  evidently the slumberer deep in dreamless sleep would not interfere with chauvelins trap for catching that cunning scarlet pimpernel again he rubbed his hands together and following the example of sir percy blakeney he too stretched himself out in the corner of another sofa shut his eyes opened his mouth gave forth sounds of peaceful breathing and    waited     chapter xv doubt    marguerite blakeney had watched the slight sableclad figure of chauvelin as he worked his way through the ballroom then perforce she had had to wait while her nerves tingled with excitement  listlessly she sat in the small still deserted boudoir looking out through the curtained doorway on the dancing couples beyond looking at them yet seeing nothing hearing the music yet conscious of naught save a feeling of expectancy of anxious weary waiting  her mind conjured up before her the vision of what was perhaps at this very moment passing downstairs the halfdeserted diningroom the fateful hourchauvelin on the watchthen precise to the moment the entrance of a man he the scarlet pimpernel the mysterious leader who to marguerite had become almost unreal so strange so weird was this hidden identity  she wished she were in the supperroom too at this moment watching him as he entered she knew that her womans penetration would at once recognise in the strangers facewhoever he might bethat strong individuality which belongs to a leader of mento a hero to the mighty highsoaring eagle whose daring wings were becoming entangled in the ferrets trap  womanlike she thought of him with unmixed sadness the irony of that fate seemed so cruel which allowed the fearless lion to succumb to the gnawing of a rat ah had armands life not been at stake     faith your ladyship must have thought me very remiss said a voice suddenly close to her elbow i had a deal of difficulty in delivering your message for i could not find blakeney anywhere at first     marguerite had forgotten all about her husband and her message to him his very name as spoken by lord fancourt sounded strange and unfamiliar to her so completely had she in the last five minutes lived her old life in the rue de richelieu again with armand always near her to love and protect her to guard her from the many subtle intrigues which were forever raging in paris in those days  i did find him at last continued lord fancourt and gave him your message he said that he would give orders at once for the horses to be put to  ah she said still very absently you found my husband and gave him my message  yes he was in the diningroom fast asleep i could not manage to wake him up at first  thank you very much she said mechanically trying to collect her thoughts  will your ladyship honour me with the contredanse until your coach is ready asked lord fancourt  no i thank you my lord butand you will forgive mei really am too tired and the heat in the ballroom has become oppressive  the conservatory is deliciously cool let me take you there and then get you something you seem ailing lady blakeney  i am only very tired she repeated wearily as she allowed lord fancourt to lead her where subdued lights and green plants lent coolness to the air he got her a chair into which she sank this long interval of waiting was intolerable why did not chauvelin come and tell her the result of his watch  lord fancourt was very attentive she scarcely heard what he said and suddenly startled him by asking abruptly  lord fancourt did you perceive who was in the diningroom just now besides sir percy blakeney  only the agent of the french government m chauvelin equally fast asleep in another corner he said why does your ladyship ask  i know not    i    did you notice the time when you were there  it must have been about five or ten minutes past one    i wonder what your ladyship is thinking about he added for evidently the fair ladys thoughts were very far away and she had not been listening to his intellectual conversation  but indeed her thoughts were not very far away only one storey below in this same house in the diningroom where sat chauvelin still on the watch had he failed for one instant that possibility rose before as a hopethe hope that the scarlet pimpernel had been warned by sir andrew and that chauvelins trap had failed to catch his bird but that hope soon gave way to fear had he failed but thenarmand  lord fancourt had given up talking since he found that he had no listener he wanted an opportunity for slipping away for sitting opposite to a lady however fair who is evidently not heeding the most vigorous efforts made for her entertainment is not exhilarating even to a cabinet minister  shall i find out if your ladyships coach is ready he said at last tentatively  oh thank you    thank you    if you would be so kind    i fear i am but sorry company    but i am really tired    and perhaps would be best alone  but lord fancourt went and still chauvelin did not come oh what had happened she felt armands fate trembling in the balance    she fearednow with a deadly fear that chauvelin had failed and that the mysterious scarlet pimpernel had proved elusive once more then she knew that she need hope for no pity no mercy from him  he had pronounced his eitheror and nothing less would content him he was very spiteful and would affect the belief that she had wilfully misled him and having failed to trap the eagle once again his revengeful mind would be content with the humble preyarmand  yet she had done her best had strained every nerve for armands sake she could not bear to think that all had failed she could not sit still she wanted to go and hear the worst at once she wondered even that chauvelin had not come yet to vent his wrath and satire upon her  lord grenville himself came presently to tell her that her coach was ready and that sir percy was already waiting for herribbons in hand marguerite said farewell to her distinguished host many of her friends stopped her as she crossed the rooms to talk to her and exchange pleasant au revoirs  the minister only took final leave of beautiful lady blakeney on the top of the stairs below on the landing a veritable army of gallant gentlemen were waiting to bid goodbye to the queen of beauty and fashion whilst outside under the massive portico sir percys magnificent bays were impatient pawing the ground  at the top of the stairs just after she had taken final leave of her host she suddenly saw chauvelin he was coming up the stairs slowly and rubbing his thin hands very softly together  there was a curious look on his mobile face partly amused and wholly puzzled as his keen eyes met marguerites they became strangely sarcastic  m chauvelin she said as he stopped on the top of the stairs bowing elaborately before her my coach is outside may i claim your arm  as gallant as ever he offered her his arm and led her downstairs the crowd was very great some of the ministers guests were departing others were leaning against the banisters watching the throng as it filed up and down the wide staircase  chauvelin she said at last desperately i must know what has happened  what has happened dear lady he said with affected surprise where when  you are torturing me chauvelin i have helped you tonight    surely i have the right to know what happened in the diningroom at one oclock just now  she spoke in a whisper trusting that in the general hubbub of the crowd her words would remain unheeded by all save the man at her side  quiet and peace reigned supreme fair lady at that hour i was asleep in one corner of one sofa and sir percy blakeney in another  nobody came into the room at all  nobody  then we have failed you and i  yes we have failedperhaps     but armand she pleaded  ah armand st justs chances hang on a thread    pray heaven dear lady that that thread may not snap  chauvelin i worked for you sincerely earnestly    remember     i remember my promise he said quietly the day that the scarlet pimpernel and i meet on french soil st just will be in the arms of his charming sister  which means that a brave mans blood will be on my hands she said with a shudder  his blood or that of your brother surely at the present moment you must hope as i do that the enigmatical scarlet pimpernel will start for calais today  i am only conscious of one hope citoyen  and that is  that satan your master will have need of you elsewhere before the sun rises today  you flatter me citoyenne  she had detained him for a while midway down the stairs trying to get at the thoughts which lay beyond that thin foxlike mask but chauvelin remained urbane sarcastic mysterious not a line betrayed to the poor anxious woman whether she need fear or whether she dared to hope  downstairs on the landing she was soon surrounded lady blakeney never stepped from any house into her coach without an escort of fluttering human moths around the dazzling light of her beauty but before she finally turned away from chauvelin she held out a tiny hand to him with that pretty gesture of childish appeal which was essentially her own give me some hope my little chauvelin she pleaded  with perfect gallantry he bowed over that tiny hand which looked so dainty and white through the delicately transparent black lace mitten and kissing the tips of the rosy fingers  pray heaven that the thread may not snap he repeated with his enigmatic smile  and stepping aside he allowed the moths to flutter more closely round the candle and the brilliant throng of the jeunesse doree eagerly attentive to lady blakeneys every movement hid the keen foxlike face from her view     chapter xvi richmond    a few minutes later she was sitting wrapped in cozy furs near sir percy blakeney on the boxseat of his magnificent coach and the four splendid bays had thundered down the quiet street  the night was warm in spite of the gentle breeze which fanned marguerites burning cheeks soon london houses were left behind and rattling over old hammersmith bridge sir percy was driving his bays rapidly towards richmond  the river wound in and out in its pretty delicate curves looking like a silver serpent beneath the glittering rays of the moon long shadows from overhanging trees spread occasional deep palls right across the road the bays were rushing along at breakneck speed held but slightly back by sir percys strong unerring hands  these nightly drives after balls and suppers in london were a source of perpetual delight to marguerite and she appreciated her husbands eccentricity keenly which caused him to adopt this mode of taking her home every night to their beautiful home by the river instead of living in a stuffy london house he loved driving his spirited horses along the lonely moonlit roads and she loved to sit on the boxseat with the soft air of an english late summers night fanning her face after the hot atmosphere of a ball or supperparty the drive was not a long oneless than an hour sometimes when the bays were very fresh and sir percy gave them full rein  tonight he seemed to have a very devil in his fingers and the coach seemed to fly along the road beside the river as usual he did not speak to her but stared straight in front of him the ribbons seeming to lie quite loosely in his slender white hands marguerite looked at him tentatively once or twice she could see his handsome profile and one lazy eye with its straight fine brow and drooping heavy lid  the face in the moonlight looked singularly earnest and recalled to marguerites aching heart those happy days of courtship before he had become the lazy nincompoop the effete fop whose life seemed spent in card and supper rooms  but now in the moonlight she could not catch the expression of the lazy blue eyes she could only see the outline of the firm chin the corner of the strong mouth the wellcut massive shape of the forehead truly nature had meant well by sir percy his faults must all be laid at the door of that poor halfcrazy mother and of the distracted heartbroken father neither of whom had cared for the young life which was sprouting up between them and which perhaps their very carelessness was already beginning to wreck  marguerite suddenly felt intense sympathy for her husband the moral crisis she had just gone through made her feel indulgent towards the faults the delinquencies of others  how thoroughly a human being can be buffeted and overmastered by fate had been borne in upon her with appalling force had anyone told her a week ago that she would stoop to spy upon her friends that she would betray a brave and unsuspecting man into the hands of a relentless enemy she would have laughed the idea to scorn  yet she had done these things anon perhaps the death of that brave man would be at her door just as two years ago the marquis de st cyr had perished through a thoughtless words of hers but in that case she was morally innocentshe had meant no serious harmfate merely had stepped in but this time she had done a thing that obviously was base had done it deliberately for a motive which perhaps high moralists would not even appreciate  as she felt her husbands strong arm beside her she also felt how much more he would dislike and despise her if he knew of this nights work thus human beings judge of one another with but little reason and no charity she despised her husband for his inanities and vulgar unintellectual occupations and he she felt would despise her still worse because she had not been strong enough to do right for rights sake and to sacrifice her brother to the dictates of her conscience  buried in her thoughts marguerite had found this hour in the breezy summer night all too brief and it was with a feeling of keen disappointment that she suddenly realised that the bays had turned into the massive gates of her beautiful english home  sir percy blakeneys house on the river has become a historic one palatial in its dimensions it stands in the midst of exquisitely laidout gardens with a picturesque terrace and frontage to the river built in tudor days the old red brick of the walls looks eminently picturesque in the midst of a bower of green the beautiful lawn with its old sundial adding the true note of harmony to its foregrounds and now on this warm early autumn night the leaves slightly turned to russets and gold the old garden looked singularly poetic and peaceful in the moonlight  with unerring precision sir percy had brought the four bays to a standstill immediately in front of the fine elizabethan entrance hall in spite of the late hour an army of grooms seemed to have emerged from the very ground as the coach had thundered up and were standing respectfully round  sir percy jumped down quickly then helped marguerite to alight she lingered outside a moment whilst he gave a few orders to one of his men she skirted the house and stepped on to the lawn looking out dreamily into the silvery landscape nature seemed exquisitely at peace in comparison with the tumultuous emotions she had gone through she could faintly hear the ripple of the river and the occasional soft and ghostlike fall of a dead leaf from a tree  all else was quiet round her she had heard the horses prancing as they were being led away to their distant stables the hurrying of servants feet as they had all gone within to rest the house also was quite still in two separate suites of apartments just above the magnificent receptionrooms lights were still burning they were her rooms and his well divided from each other by the whole width of the house as far apart as their own lives had become involuntarily she sighedat that moment she could really not have told why  she was suffering from unconquerable heartache deeply and achingly she was sorry for herself never had she felt so pitiably lonely so bitterly in want of comfort and of sympathy with another sigh she turned away from the river towards the house vaguely wondering if after such a night she could ever find rest and sleep  suddenly before she reached the terrace she heard a firm step upon the crisp gravel and the next moment her husbands figure emerged out of the shadow he too had skirted the house and was wandering along the lawn towards the river he still wore his heavy driving coat with the numerous lapels and collars he himself had set in fashion but he had thrown it well back burying his hands as was his wont in the deep pockets of his satin breeches the gorgeous white costume he had worn at lord grenvilles ball with its jabot of priceless lace looked strangely ghostly against the dark background of the house  he apparently did not notice her for after a few moments pause he presently turned back towards the house and walked straight up to the terrace  sir percy  he already had one foot on the lowest of the terrace steps but at her voice he started and paused then looked searchingly into the shadows whence she had called to him  she came forward quickly into the moonlight and as soon as he saw her he said with that air of consummate gallantry he always wore when speaking to her  at your service madame but his foot was still on the step and in his whole attitude there was a remote suggestion distinctly visible to her that he wished to go and had no desire for a midnight interview  the air is deliciously cool she said the moonlight peaceful and poetic and the garden inviting will you not stay in it awhile the hour is not yet late or is my company so distasteful to you that you are in a hurry to rid yourself of it  nay madame he rejoined placidly but tis on the other foot the shoe happens to be and ill warrant youll find the midnight air more poetic without my company no doubt the sooner i remove the obstruction the better your ladyship will like it  he turned once more to go  i protest you mistake me sir percy she said hurriedly and drawing a little closer to him the estrangement which alas has arisen between us was none of my making remember  begad you must pardon me there madame he protested coldly my memory was always of the shortest  he looked her straight in the eyes with that lazy nonchalance which had become second nature to him she returned his gaze for a moment then her eyes softened as she came up quite close to him to the foot of the terrace steps  of the shortest sir percy faith how it must have altered was it three years ago or four that you saw me for one hour in paris on your way to the east when you came back two years later you had not forgotten me  she looked divinely pretty as she stood there in the moonlight with the furcloak sliding off her beautiful shoulders the gold embroidery on her dress shimmering around her her childlike blue eyes turned up fully at him  he stood for a moment rigid and still but for the clenching of his hand against the stone balustrade of the terrace  you desired my presence madame he said frigidly i take it that it was not with the view to indulging in tender reminiscences  his voice certainly was cold and uncompromising his attitude before her stiff and unbending womanly decorum would have suggested marguerite should return coldness for coldness and should sweep past him without another word only with a curt nod of her head but womanly instinct suggested that she should remainthat keen instinct which makes a beautiful woman conscious of her powers long to bring to her knees the one man who pays her no homage she stretched out her hand to him  nay sir percy why not the present is not so glorious but that i should not wish to dwell a little in the past  he bent his tall figure and taking hold of the extreme tip of the fingers which she still held out to him he kissed them ceremoniously  i faith madame he said then you will pardon me if my dull wits cannot accompany you there  once again he attempted to go once more her voice sweet childlike almost tender called him back  sir percy  your servant madame  is it possible that love can die she said with sudden unreasoning vehemence methought that the passion which you once felt for me would outlast the span of human life is there nothing left of that love percy    which might help you    to bridge over that sad estrangement  his massive figure seemed while she spoke thus to him to stiffen still more the strong mouth hardened a look of relentless obstinacy crept into the habitually lazy blue eyes  with what object i pray you madame he asked coldly  i do not understand you  yet tis simple enough he said with sudden bitterness which seemed literally to surge through his words though he was making visible efforts to suppress it i humbly put the question to you for my slow wits are unable to grasp the cause of this your ladyships sudden new mood is it that you have the taste to renew the devilish sport which you played so successfully last year do you wish to see me once more a lovesick suppliant at your feet so that you might again have the pleasure of kicking me aside like a troublesome lapdog  she had succeeded in rousing him for the moment and again she looked straight at him for it was thus she remembered him a year ago  percy i entreat you she whispered can we not bury the past  pardon me madame but i understood you to say that your desire was to dwell in it  nay i spoke not of that past percy she said while a tone of tenderness crept into her voice rather did i speak of a time when you loved me still and i    oh i was vain and frivolous your wealth and position allured me i married you hoping in my heart that your great love for me would beget in me a love for you    but alas     the moon had sunk low down behind a bank of clouds in the east a soft grey light was beginning to chase away the heavy mantle of the night he could only see her graceful outline now the small queenly head with its wealth of reddish golden curls and the glittering gems forming the small starshaped red flower which she wore as a diadem in her hair  twentyfour hours after our marriage madame the marquis de st cyr and all his family perished on the guillotine and the popular rumour reached me that it was the wife of sir percy blakeney who helped to send them there  nay i myself told you the truth of that odious tale  not till after it had been recounted to me by strangers with all its horrible details  and you believed them then and there she said with great vehemence without a proof or questionyou believed that i whom you vowed you loved more than life whom you professed you worshipped that i could do a thing so base as these strangers chose to recount you thought i meant to deceive you about it allthat i ought to have spoken before i married you yet had you listened i would have told you that up to the very morning on which st cyr went to the guillotine i was straining every nerve using every influence i possessed to save him and his family but my pride sealed my lips when your love seemed to perish as if under the knife of that same guillotine yet i would have told you how i was duped aye i whom that same popular rumour had endowed with the sharpest wits in france i was tricked into doing this thing by men who knew how to play upon my love for an only brother and my desire for revenge was it unnatural  her voice became choked with tears she paused for a moment or two trying to regain some sort of composure she looked appealingly at him almost as if he were her judge he had allowed her to speak on in her own vehement impassioned way offering no comment no word of sympathy and now while she paused trying to swallow down the hot tears that gushed to her eyes he waited impassive and still the dim grey light of early dawn seemed to make his tall form look taller and more rigid the lazy goodnatured face looked strangely altered marguerite excited as she was could see that the eyes were no longer languid the mouth no longer goodhumoured and inane a curious look of intense passion seemed to glow from beneath his drooping lids the mouth was tightly closed the lips compressed as if the will alone held that surging passion in check  marguerite blakeney was above all a woman with all a womans fascinating foibles all a womans most lovable sins she knew in a moment that for the past few months she had been mistaken that this man who stood here before her cold as a statue when her musical voice struck upon his ear loved her as he had loved her a year ago that his passion might have been dormant but that it was there as strong as intense as overwhelming as when first her lips met his in one long maddening kiss pride had kept him from her and womanlike she meant to win back that conquest which had been hers before suddenly it seemed to her that the only happiness life could ever hold for her again would be in feeling that mans kiss once more upon her lips  listen to the tale sir percy she said and her voice was low sweet infinitely tender armand was all in all to me we had no parents and brought one another up he was my little father and i his tiny mother we loved one another so then one daydo you mind me sir percy the marquis de st cyr had my brother armand thrashedthrashed by his lacqueysthat brother whom i loved better than all the world and his offence that he a plebeian had dared to love the daughter of the aristocrat for that he was waylaid and thrashed    thrashed like a dog within an inch of his life oh how i suffered his humiliation had eaten into my very soul when the opportunity occurred and i was able to take my revenge i took it but i only thought to bring that proud marquis to trouble and humiliation he plotted with austria against his own country chance gave me knowledge of this i spoke of it but i did not knowhow could i guessthey trapped and duped me when i realised what i had done it was too late  it is perhaps a little difficult madame said sir percy after a moment of silence between them to go back over the past i have confessed to you that my memory is short but the thought certainly lingered in my mind that at the time of the marquis death i entreated you for an explanation of those same noisome popular rumours if that same memory does not even now play me a trick i fancy that you refused me all explanation then and demanded of my love a humiliating allegiance it was not prepared to give  i wished to test your love for me and it did not bear the test you used to tell me that you drew the very breath of life but for me and for love of me  and to probe that love you demanded that i should forfeit mine honour he said whilst gradually his impassiveness seemed to leave him his rigidity to relax that i should accept without murmur or question as a dumb and submissive slave every action of my mistress my heart overflowing with love and passion i asked for no explanationi waited for one not doubtingonly hoping had you spoken but one word from you i would have accepted any explanation and believed it but you left me without a word beyond a bald confession of the actual horrible facts proudly you returned to your brothers house and left me alone    for weeks    not knowing now in whom to believe since the shrine which contained my one illusion lay shattered to earth at my feet  she need not complain now that he was cold and impassive his very voice shook with an intensity of passion which he was making superhuman efforts to keep in check  aye the madness of my pride she said sadly hardly had i gone already i had repented but when i returned i found you oh so altered wearing already that mask of somnolent indifference which you have never laid aside until    until now  she was so close to him that her soft loose hair was wafted against his cheek her eyes glowing with tears maddened him the music in her voice sent fire through his veins but he would not yield to the magic charm of this woman whom he had so deeply loved and at whose hands his pride had suffered so bitterly he closed his eyes to shut out the dainty vision of that sweet face of that snowwhite neck and graceful figure round which the faint rosy light of dawn was just beginning to hover playfully  nay madame it is no mask he said icily i swore to you    once that my life was yours for months now it has been your plaything    it has served its purpose  but now she knew that the very coldness was a mask the trouble the sorrow she had gone through last night suddenly came back into her mind but no longer with bitterness rather with a feeling that this man who loved her would help her bear the burden  sir percy she said impulsively heaven knows you have been at pains to make the task which i had set to myself difficult to accomplish you spoke of my mood just now well we will call it that if you will i wished to speak to you    because    because i was in trouble    and had need    of your sympathy  it is yours to command madame  how cold you are she sighed faith i can scarce believe that but a few months ago one tear in my eye had set you wellnigh crazy now i come to you    with a halfbroken heart    and    and     i pray you madame he said whilst his voice shook almost as much as hers in what way can i serve you  percyarmand is in deadly danger a letter of his    rash impetuous as were all his actions and written to sir andrew ffoulkes has fallen into the hands of a fanatic armand is hopelessly compromised    tomorrow perhaps he will be arrested    after that the guillotine    unless    oh it is horrible    she said with a sudden wail of anguish as all the events of the past night came rushing back to her mind horrible    and you do not understand    you cannot    and i have no one to whom i can turn    for help    or even for sympathy     tears now refused to be held back all her trouble her struggles the awful uncertainty of armands fate overwhelmed her she tottered ready to fall and leaning against the tone balustrade she buried her face in her hands and sobbed bitterly  at first mention of armand st justs name and of the peril in which he stood sir percys face had become a shade more pale and the look of determination and obstinacy appeared more marked than ever between his eyes however he said nothing for the moment but watched her as her delicate frame was shaken with sobs watched her until unconsciously his face softened and what looked almost like tears seemed to glisten in his eyes  and so he said with bitter sarcasm the murderous dog of the revolution is turning upon the very hands that fed it    begad madame he added very gently as marguerite continued to sob hysterically will you dry your tears    i never could bear to see a pretty woman cry and i     instinctively with sudden overmastering passion at the sight of her helplessness and of her grief he stretched out his arms and the next would have seized her and held her to him protected from every evil with his very life his very hearts blood    but pride had the better of it in this struggle once again he restrained himself with a tremendous effort of will and said coldly though still very gently  will you not turn to me madame and tell me in what way i may have the honour to serve you  she made a violent effort to control herself and turning her tearstained face to him she once more held out her hand which he kissed with the same punctilious gallantry but marguerites fingers this time lingered in his hand for a second or two longer than was absolutely necessary and this was because she had felt that his hand trembled perceptibly and was burning hot whilst his lips felt as cold as marble  can you do aught for armand she said sweetly and simply you have so much influence at court    so many friends     nay madame should you not seek the influence of your french friend m chauvelin his extends if i mistake not even as far as the republican government of france  i cannot ask him percy    oh i wish i dared to tell you    but    but    he has put a price on my brothers head which     she would have given worlds if she had felt the courage then to tell him everything    all she had done that nighthow she had suffered and how her hand had been forced but she dared not give way to that impulse    not now when she was just beginning to feel that he still loved her when she hoped that she could win him back she dared not make another confession to him after all he might not understand he might not sympathise with her struggles and temptation his love still dormant might sleep the sleep of death  perhaps he divined what was passing in her mind his whole attitude was one of intense longinga veritable prayer for that confidence which her foolish pride withheld from him when she remained silent he sighed and said with marked coldness  faith madame since it distresses you we will not speak of it    as for armand i pray you have no fear i pledge you my word that he shall be safe now have i your permission to go the hour is getting late and     you will at least accept my gratitude she said as she drew quite close to him and speaking with real tenderness  with a quick almost involuntary effort he would have taken her then in his arms for her eyes were swimming in tears which he longed to kiss away but she had lured him once just like this then cast him aside like an illfitting glove he thought this was but a mood a caprice and he was too proud to lend himself to it once again  it is too soon madame he said quietly i have done nothing as yet the hour is late and you must be fatigued your women will be waiting for you upstairs  he stood aside to allow her to pass she sighed a quick sigh of disappointment his pride and her beauty had been in direct conflict and his pride had remained the conqueror perhaps after all she had been deceived just now what she took to be the light of love in his eyes might only have been the passion of pride or who knows of hatred instead of love she stood looking at him for a moment or two longer he was again as rigid as impassive as before pride had conquered and he cared naught for her the grey light of dawn was gradually yielding to the rosy light of the rising sun birds began to twitter nature awakened smiling in happy response to the warmth of this glorious october morning only between these two hearts there lay a strong impassable barrier built up of pride on both sides which neither of them cared to be the first to demolish  he had bent his tall figure in a low ceremonious bow as she finally with another bitter little sigh began to mount the terrace steps  the long train of her goldembroidered gown swept the dead leaves off the steps making a faint harmonious shshsh as she glided up with one hand resting on the balustrade the rosy light of dawn making an aureole of gold round her hair and causing the rubies on her head and arms to sparkle she reached the tall glass doors which led into the house before entering she paused once again to look at him hoping against hope to see his arms stretched out to her and to hear his voice calling her back but he had not moved his massive figure looked the very personification of unbending pride of fierce obstinacy  hot tears again surged to her eyes as she would not let him see them she turned quickly within and ran as fast as she could up to her own rooms  had she but turned back then and looked out once more on to the roselit garden she would have seen that which would have made her own sufferings seem but light and easy to beara strong man overwhelmed with his own passion and his own despair pride had given way at last obstinacy was gone the will was powerless he was but a man madly blindly passionately in love and as soon as her light footsteps had died away within the house he knelt down upon the terrace steps and in the very madness of his love he kissed one by one the places where her small foot had trodden and the stone balustrade there where her tiny hand had rested last     chapter xvii farewell    when marguerite reached her room she found her maid terribly anxious about her  your ladyship will be so tired said the poor woman whose own eyes were half closed with sleep it is past five oclock  ah yes louise i daresay i shall be tired presently said marguerite kindly but you are very tired now so go to bed at once ill get into bed alone  but my lady     now dont argue louise but go to bed give me a wrap and leave me alone  louise was only too glad to obey she took off her mistresss gorgeous balldress and wrapped her up in a soft billowy gown  does your ladyship wish for anything else she asked when that was done  no nothing more put out the lights as you go out  yes my lady goodnight my lady  goodnight louise  when the maid was gone marguerite drew aside the curtains and threw open the windows the garden and the river beyond were flooded with rosy light far away to the east the rays of the rising sun had changed the rose into vivid gold the lawn was deserted now and marguerite looked down upon the terrace where she had stood a few moments ago trying in vain to win back a mans love which once had been so wholly hers  it was strange that through all her troubles all her anxiety for armand she was mostly conscious at the present moment of a keen and bitter heartache  her very limbs seemed to ache with longing for the love of a man who had spurned her who had resisted her tenderness remained cold to her appeals and had not responded to the glow of passion which had caused her to feel and hope that those happy olden days in paris were not all dead and forgotten  how strange it all was she loved him still and now that she looked back upon the last few months of misunderstandings and of loneliness she realised that she had never ceased to love him that deep down in her heart she had always vaguely felt that his foolish inanities his empty laugh his lazy nonchalance were nothing but a mask that the real man strong passionate wilful was there stillthe man she had loved whose intensity had fascinated her whose personality attracted her since she always felt that behind his apparently slow wits there was a certain something which he kept hidden from all the world and most especially from her  a womans heart is such a complex problemthe owner thereof is often most incompetent to find the solution of this puzzle  did marguerite blakeney the cleverest woman in europe really love a fool was it love that she had felt for him a year ago when she married him was it love she felt for him now that she realised that he still loved her but that he would not become her slave her passionate ardent lover once again nay marguerite herself could not have told that not at this moment at any rate perhaps her pride had sealed her mind against a better understanding of her own heart but this she did knowthat she meant to capture that obstinate heart back again that she would conquer once more    and then that she would never lose him     she would keep him keep his love deserve it and cherish it for this much was certain that there was no longer any happiness possible for her without that one mans love  thus the most contradictory thoughts and emotions rushed madly through her mind absorbed in them she had allowed time to slip by perhaps tired out with long excitement she had actually closed her eyes and sunk into a troubled sleep wherein quickly fleeting dreams seemed but the continuation of her anxious thoughtswhen suddenly she was roused from dream or meditation by the noise of footsteps outside her door  nervously she jumped up and listened the house itself was as still as ever the footsteps had retreated through her wideopen window the brilliant rays of the morning sun were flooding her room with light she looked up at the clock it was halfpast sixtoo early for any of the household to be already astir  she certainly must have dropped asleep quite unconsciously the noise of the footsteps also of hushed subdued voices had awakened herwhat could they be  gently on tiptoe she crossed the room and opened the door to listen not a soundthat peculiar stillness of the early morning when sleep with all mankind is at its heaviest but the noise had made her nervous and when suddenly at her feet on the very doorstep she saw something white lying therea letter evidentlyshe hardly dared touch it it seemed so ghostlike it certainly was not there when she came upstairs had louise dropped it or was some tantalising spook at play showing her fairy letters where none existed  at last she stooped to pick it up and amazed puzzled beyond measure she saw that the letter was addressed to herself in her husbands large businesslikelooking hand what could he have to say to her in the middle of the night which could not be put off until the morning  she tore open the envelope and read  a most unforeseen circumstance forces me to leave for the north immediately so i beg your ladyships pardon if i do not avail myself of the honour of bidding you goodbye my business may keep me employed for about a week so i shall not have the privilege of being present at your ladyships waterparty on wednesday i remain your ladyships most humble and most obedient servant percy blakeney  marguerite must suddenly have been imbued with her husbands slowness of intellect for she had perforce to read the few simple lines over and over again before she could fully grasp their meaning  she stood on the landing turning over and over in her hand this curt and mysterious epistle her mind a blank her nerves strained with agitation and a presentiment she could not very well have explained  sir percy owned considerable property in the north certainly and he had often before gone there alone and stayed away a week at a time but it seemed so very strange that circumstances should have arisen between five and six oclock in the morning that compelled him to start in this extreme hurry  vainly she tried to shake off an unaccustomed feeling of nervousness she was trembling from head to foot a wild unconquerable desire seized her to see her husband again at once if only he had not already started  forgetting the fact that she was only very lightly clad in a morning wrap and that her hair lay loosely about her shoulders she flew down the stairs right through the hall towards the front door  it was as usual barred and bolted for the indoor servants were not yet up but her keen ears had detected the sound of voices and the pawing of a horses hoof against the flagstones  with nervous trembling fingers marguerite undid the bolts one by one bruising her hands hurting her nails for the locks were heavy and stiff but she did not care her whole frame shook with anxiety at the very thought that she might be too late that he might have gone without her seeing him and bidding him godspeed  at last she had turned the key and thrown open the door her ears had not deceived her a groom was standing close by holding a couple of horses one of these was sultan sir percys favourite and swiftest horse saddled ready for a journey  the next moment sir percy himself appeared round the further corner of the house and came quickly towards the horses he had changed his gorgeous ball costume but was as usual irreproachably and richly apparelled in a suit of fine cloth with lace jabot and ruffles high topboots and riding breeches  marguerite went forward a few steps he looked up and saw her a slight frown appeared between his eyes  you are going she said quickly and feverishly whither  as i have had the honour of informing your ladyship urgent most unexpected business calls me to the north this morning he said in his usual cold drawly manner  but    your guests tomorrow     i have prayed your ladyship to offer my humble excuses to his royal highness you are such a perfect hostess i do not think i shall be missed  but surely you might have waited for your journey    until after our waterparty    she said still speaking quickly and nervously surely this business is not so urgent    and you said nothing about itjust now  my business as i had the honour to tell you madame is as unexpected as it is urgent    may i therefore crave your permission to go    can i do aught for you in town    on my way back  no    no    thanks    nothing    but you will be back soon  very soon  before the end of the week  i cannot say  he was evidently trying to get away whilst she was straining every nerve to keep him back for a moment or two  percy she said will you not tell me why you go today surely i as your wife have the right to know you have not been called away to the north i know it there were no letters no couriers from there before we left for the opera last night and nothing was waiting for you when we returned from the ball    you are not going to the north i feel convinced    there is some mystery    and     nay there is no mystery madame he replied with a slight tone of impatience my business has to do with armand    there now have i your leave to depart  with armand    but you will run no danger  danger i    nay madame your solicitude does me honour as you say i have some influence my intention is to exert it before it be too late  will you allow me to thank you at least  nay madame he said coldly there is no need for that my life is at your service and i am already more than repaid  and mine will be at yours sir percy if you will but accept it in exchange for what you do for armand she said as impulsively she stretched out both her hands to him there i will not detain you    my thoughts go with you    farewell     how lovely she looked in this morning sunlight with her ardent hair streaming around her shoulders he bowed very low and kissed her hand she felt the burning kiss and her heart thrilled with joy and hope  you will come back she said tenderly  very soon he replied looking longingly into her blue eyes  and    you will remember    she asked as her eyes in response to his look gave him an infinity of promise  i will always remember madame that you have honoured me by commanding my services  the words were cold and formal but they did not chill her this time her womans heart had read his beneath the impassive mask his pride still forced him to wear  he bowed to her again then begged her leave to depart she stood on one side whilst he jumped on to sultans back then as he galloped out of the gates she waved him a final adieu  a bend in the road soon hid him from view his confidential groom had some difficulty in keeping pace with him for sultan flew along in response to his masters excited mood marguerite with a sigh that was almost a happy one turned and went within she went back to her room for suddenly like a tired child she felt quite sleepy  her heart seemed all at once to be in complete peace and though it still ached with undefined longing a vague and delicious hope soothed it as with a balm  she felt no longer anxious about armand the man who had just ridden away bent on helping her brother inspired her with complete confidence in his strength and in his power she marvelled at herself for having ever looked upon him as an inane fool of course that was a mask worn to hide the bitter wound she had dealt to his faith and to his love his passion would have overmastered him and he would not let her see how much he still cared and how deeply he suffered  but now all would be well she would crush her own pride humble it before him tell him everything trust him in everything and those happy days would come back when they used to wander off together in the forests of fontainebleau when they spoke littlefor he was always a silent manbut when she felt that against that strong heart she would always find rest and happiness  the more she thought of the events of the past night the less fear had she of chauvelin and his schemes he had failed to discover the identity of the scarlet pimpernel of that she felt sure both lord fancourt and chauvelin himself had assured her that no one had been in the diningroom at one oclock except the frenchman himself and percyyespercy she might have asked him had she thought of it anyway she had no fears that the unknown and brave hero would fall in chauvelins trap his death at any rate would not be at her door  armand certainly was still in danger but percy had pledged his word that armand would be safe and somehow as marguerite had seen him riding away the possibility that he could fail in whatever he undertook never even remotely crossed her mind when armand was safely over in england she would not allow him to go back to france  she felt almost happy now and drawing the curtains closely together again to shut out the piercing sun she went to bed at last laid her head upon the pillow and like a wearied child soon fell into a peaceful and dreamless sleep     chapter xviii the mysterious device    the day was well advanced when marguerite woke refreshed by her long sleep louise had brought her some fresh milk and a dish of fruit and she partook of this frugal breakfast with hearty appetite  thoughts crowded thick and fast in her mind as she munched her grapes most of them went galloping away after the tall erect figure of her husband whom she had watched riding out of sight more than five hours ago  in answer to her eager inquiries louise brought back the news that the groom had come home with sultan having left sir percy in london the groom thought that his master was about to get on board his schooner which was lying off just below london bridge sir percy had ridden thus far had then met briggs the skipper of the day dream and had sent the groom back to richmond with sultan and the empty saddle  this news puzzled marguerite more than ever where could sir percy be going just now in the day dream on armands behalf he had said well sir percy had influential friends everywhere perhaps he was going to greenwich or    but marguerite ceased to conjecture all would be explained anon he said that he would come back and that he would remember a long idle day lay before marguerite she was expecting a visit of her old schoolfellow little suzanne de tournay with all the merry mischief at her command she had tendered her request for suzannes company to the comtesse in the presence of the prince of wales last night his royal highness had loudly applauded the notion and declared that he would give himself the pleasure of calling on the two ladies in the course of the afternoon the comtesse had not dared to refuse and then and there was entrapped into a promise to send little suzanne to spend a long and happy day at richmond with her friend  marguerite expected her eagerly she longed for a chat about old schooldays with the child she felt that she would prefer suzannes company to that of anyone else and together they would roam through the fine old garden and rich deer park or stroll along the river  but suzanne had not come yet and marguerite being dressed prepared to go downstairs she looked quite a girl this morning in her simple muslin frock with a broad blue sash round her slim waist and the dainty crossover fichu into which at her bosom she had fastened a few late crimson roses  she crossed the landing outside her own suite of apartments and stood still for a moment at the head of the fine oak staircase which led to the lower floor on her left were her husbands apartments a suite of rooms which she practically never entered  they consisted of bedroom dressing and reception room and at the extreme end of the landing of a small study which when sir percy did not use it was always kept locked his own special and confidential valet frank had charge of this room no one was ever allowed to go inside my lady had never cared to do so and the other servants had of course not dared to break this hardandfast rule  marguerite had often with that goodnatured contempt which she had recently adopted towards her husband chaffed him about this secrecy which surrounded his private study laughingly she had always declared that he strictly excluded all prying eyes from his sanctum for fear they should detect how very little study went on within its four walls a comfortable armchair for sir percys sweet slumbers was no doubt its most conspicuous piece of furniture  marguerite thought of all this on this bright october morning as she glanced along the corridor frank was evidently busy with his masters rooms for most of the doors stood open that of the study amongst the others  a sudden burning childish curiosity seized her to have a peep at sir percys sanctum this restriction of course did not apply to her and frank would of course not dare to oppose her still she hoped that the valet would be busy in one of the other rooms that she might have that one quick peep in secret and unmolested  gently on tiptoe she crossed the landing and like blue beards wife trembling half with excitement and wonder she paused a moment on the threshold strangely perturbed and irresolute  the door was ajar and she could not see anything within she pushed it open tentatively there was no sound frank was evidently not there and she walked boldly in  at once she was struck by the severe simplicity of everything around her the dark and heavy hangings the massive oak furniture the one or two maps on the wall in no way recalled to her mind the lazy man about town the lover of racecourses the dandified leader of fashion that was the outward representation of sir percy blakeney  there was no sign here at any rate of hurried departure everything was in its place not a scrap of paper littered the floor not a cupboard or drawer was left open the curtains were drawn aside and through the open window the fresh morning air was streaming in  facing the window and well into the centre of the room stood a ponderous businesslike desk which looked as if it had seen much service on the wall to the left of the desk reaching almost from floor to ceiling was a large fulllength portrait of a woman magnificently framed exquisitely painted and signed with the name of boucher it was percys mother  marguerite knew very little about her except that she had died abroad ailing in body as well as in mind while percy was still a lad she must have been a very beautiful woman once when boucher painted her and as marguerite looked at the portrait she could not but be struck by the extraordinary resemblance which must have existed between mother and son there was the same low square forehead crowned with thick fair hair smooth and heavy the same deepset somewhat lazy blue eyes beneath firmly marked straight brows and in those eyes there was the same intensity behind that apparent laziness the same latent passion which used to light up percys face in the olden days before his marriage and which marguerite had again noted last night at dawn when she had come quite close to him and had allowed a note of tenderness to creep into her voice  marguerite studied the portrait for it interested her after that she turned and looked again at the ponderous desk it was covered with a mass of papers all neatly tied and docketed which looked like accounts and receipts arrayed with perfect method it had never before struck margueritenor had she alas found it worth while to inquireas to how sir percy whom all the world had credited with a total lack of brains administered the vast fortune which his father had left him  since she had entered this neat orderly room she had been taken so much by surprise that this obvious proof of her husbands strong business capacities did not cause her more than a passing thought of wonder but it also strengthened her in the now certain knowledge that with his worldly inanities his foppish ways and foolish talk he was not only wearing a mask but was playing a deliberate and studied part  marguerite wondered again why should he take all this trouble why should hewho was obviously a serious earnest manwish to appear before his fellowmen as an emptyheaded nincompoop  he may have wished to hide his love for a wife who held him in contempt    but surely such an object could have been gained at less sacrifice and with far less trouble than constant incessant acting of an unnatural part  she looked round her quite aimlessly now she was horribly puzzled and a nameless dread before all this strange unaccountable mystery had begun to seize upon her she felt cold and uncomfortable suddenly in this severe and dark room there were no pictures on the wall save the fine boucher portrait only a couple of maps both of parts of france one of the north coast and the other of the environs of paris what did sir percy want with those she wondered  her head began to ache she turned away from this strange blue beards chamber which she had entered and which she did not understand she did not wish frank to find her here and with a fast look round she once more turned to the door as she did so her foot knocked against a small object which had apparently been lying close to the desk on the carpet and which now went rolling right across the room  she stooped to pick it up it was a solid gold ring with a flat shield on which was engraved a small device  marguerite turned it over in her fingers and then studied the engraving on the shield it represented a small starshaped flower of a shape she had seen so distinctly twice before once at the opera and once at lord grenvilles ball     chapter xix the scarlet pimpernel    at what particular moment the strange doubt first crept into marguerites mind she could not herself have said with the ring tightly clutched in her hand she had run out of the room down the stairs and out into the garden where in complete seclusion alone with the flowers and the river and the birds she could look again at the ring and study that device more closely  stupidly senselessly now sitting beneath the shade of an overhanging sycamore she was looking at the plain gold shield with the starshaped little flower engraved upon it  bah it was ridiculous she was dreaming her nerves were overwrought and she saw signs and mysteries in the most trivial coincidences had not everybody about town recently made a point of affecting the device of that mysterious and heroic scarlet pimpernel  did she herself wear it embroidered on her gowns set in gems and enamel in her hair what was there strange in the fact that sir percy should have chosen to use the device as a sealring he might easily have done that    yes    quite easily    and    besides    what connection could there be between her exquisite dandy of a husband with his fine clothes and refined lazy ways and the daring plotter who rescued french victims from beneath the very eyes of the leaders of a bloodthirsty revolution  her thoughts were in a whirlher mind a blank    she did not see anything that was going on around her and was quite startled when a fresh young voice called to her across the garden  cheriecherie where are you and little suzanne fresh as a rosebud with eyes dancing with glee and brown curls fluttering in the soft morning breeze came running across the lawn  they told me you were in the garden she went on prattling merrily and throwing herself with a pretty girlish impulse into marguerites arms so i ran out to give you a surprise you did not expect me quite so soon did you my darling little margot cherie  marguerite who had hastily concealed the ring in the folds of her kerchief tried to respond gaily and unconcernedly to the young girls impulsiveness  indeed sweet one she said with a smile it is delightful to have you all to myself and for a nice whole long day    you wont be bored  oh bored margot how can you say such a wicked thing why when we were in the dear old convent together we were always happy when we were allowed to be alone together  and to talk secrets  the two young girls had linked their arms in one anothers and began wandering round the garden  oh how lovely your home is margot darling said little suzanne enthusiastically and how happy you must be  aye indeed i ought to be happyoughtnt i sweet one said marguerite with a wistful little sigh  how sadly you say it cherie    ah well i suppose now that you are a married woman you wont care to talk secrets with me any longer oh what lots and lots of secrets we used to have at school do you remembersome we did not even confide to sister theresa of the holy angelsthough she was such a dear  and now you have one allimportant secret eh little one said marguerite merrily which you are forthwith going to confide in me nay you need not blush cherie she added as she saw suzannes pretty little face crimson with blushes faith theres naught to be ashamed of he is a noble and true man and one to be proud of as a lover and    as a husband  indeed cherie i am not ashamed rejoined suzanne softly and it makes me very very proud to hear you speak so well of him i think maman will consent she added thoughtfully and i shall beoh so happybut of course nothing is to be thought of until papa is safe     marguerite started suzannes father the comte de tournayone of those whose life would be jeopardised if chauvelin succeeded in establishing the identity of the scarlet pimpernel  she had understood all along from the comtesse and also from one or two of the members of the league that their mysterious leader had pledged his honour to bring the fugitive comte de tournay safely out of france whilst little suzanneunconscious of allsave her own allimportant little secret went prattling on marguerites thoughts went back to the events of the past night  armands peril chauvelins threat his cruel eitheror which she had accepted  and then her own work in the matter which should have culminated at one oclock in lord grenvilles diningroom when the relentless agent of the french government would finally learn who was this mysterious scarlet pimpernel who so openly defied an army of spies and placed himself so boldly and for mere sport on the side of the enemies of france  since then she had heard nothing from chauvelin she had concluded that he had failed and yet she had not felt anxious about armand because her husband had promised her that armand would be safe  but now suddenly as suzanne prattled merrily along an awful horror came upon her for what she had done chauvelin had told her nothing it was true but she remembered how sarcastic and evil he looked when she took final leave of him after the ball had he discovered something then had he already laid his plans for catching the daring plotter redhanded in france and sending him to the guillotine without compunction or delay  marguerite turned sick with horror and her hand convulsively clutched the ring in her dress  you are not listening cherie said suzanne reproachfully as she paused in her long highly interesting narrative  yes yes darlingindeed i am said marguerite with an effort forcing herself to smile i love to hear you talking    and your happiness makes me so very glad    have no fear we will manage to propitiate maman sir andrew ffoulkes is a noble english gentleman he has money and position the comtesse will not refuse her consent    but    now little one    tell me    what is the latest news about your father  oh said suzanne with mad glee the best we could possibly hear my lord hastings came to see maman early this morning he said that all is now well with dear papa and we may safely expect him here in england in less than four days  yes said marguerite whose glowing eyes were fastened on suzannes lips as she continued merrily  oh we have no fear now you dont know cherie that that great and noble scarlet pimpernel himself has gone to save papa he has gone cherie    actually gone    added suzanne excitedly he was in london this morning he will be in calais perhaps tomorrow    where he will meet papa    and then    and then     the blow had fallen she had expected it all along though she had tried for the last halfhour to delude herself and to cheat her fears he had gone to calais had been in london this morning    he    the scarlet pimpernel    percy blakeney    her husband    whom she had betrayed last night to chauvelin  percy    percy    her husband    the scarlet pimpernel    oh how could she have been so blind she understood it all nowall at once    that part he playedthe mask he wore    in order to throw dust in everybodys eyes  and all for the sheer sport and devilry of coursesaving men women and children from death as other men destroy and kill animals for the excitement the love of the thing the idle rich man wanted some aim in lifehe and the few young bucks he enrolled under his banner had amused themselves for months in risking their lives for the sake of an innocent few  perhaps he had meant to tell her when they were first married and then the story of the marquis de st cyr had come to his ears and he had suddenly turned from her thinking no doubt that she might someday betray him and his comrades who had sworn to follow him and so he had tricked her as he tricked all others whilst hundreds now owed their lives to him and many families owed him both life and happiness  the mask of an inane fop had been a good one and the part consummately well played no wonder that chauvelins spies had failed to detect in the apparently brainless nincompoop the man whose reckless daring and resourceful ingenuity had baffled the keenest french spies both in france and in england even last night when chauvelin went to lord grenvilles diningroom to seek that daring scarlet pimpernel he only saw that inane sir percy blakeney fast asleep in a corner of the sofa  had his astute mind guessed the secret then here lay the whole awful horrible amazing puzzle in betraying a nameless stranger to his fate in order to save her brother had marguerite blakeney sent her husband to his death  no no no a thousand times no surely fate could not deal a blow like that nature itself would rise in revolt her hand when it held that tiny scrap of paper last night would have surely have been struck numb ere it committed a deed so appalling and so terrible  but what is it cherie said little suzanne now genuinely alarmed for marguerites colour had become dull and ashen are you ill marguerite what is it  nothing nothing child she murmured as in a dream wait a moment    let me think    think    you said    the scarlet pimpernel had gone today      marguerite cherie what is it you frighten me     it is nothing child i tell you    nothing    i must be alone a minuteanddear one    i may have to curtail our time together today    i may have to go awayyoull understand  i understand that something has happened cherie and that you want to be alone i wont be a hindrance to you dont think of me my maid lucile has not yet gone    we will go back together    dont think of me  she threw her arms impulsively round marguerite child as she was she felt the poignancy of her friends grief and with the infinite tact of her girlish tenderness she did not try to pry into it but was ready to efface herself  she kissed marguerite again and again then walked sadly back across the lawn marguerite did not move she remained there thinking    wondering what was to be done  just as little suzanne was about to mount the terrace steps a groom came running round the house towards his mistress he carried a sealed letter in his hand suzanne instinctively turned back her heart told her that here perhaps was further ill news for her friend and she felt that poor margot was not in a fit state to bear any more  the groom stood respectfully beside his mistress then he handed her the sealed letter  what is that asked marguerite  just come by runner my lady  marguerite took the letter mechanically and turned it over in her trembling fingers  who sent it she said  the runner said my lady replied the groom that his orders were to deliver this and that your ladyship would understand from whom it came  marguerite tore open the envelope already her instinct told her what it contained and her eyes only glanced at it mechanically  it was a letter by armand st just to sir andrew ffoulkesthe letter which chauvelins spies had stolen at the fishermans rest and which chauvelin had held as a rod over her to enforce her obedience  now he had kept his wordhe had sent her back st justs compromising letter    for he was on the track of the scarlet pimpernel  marguerites senses reeled her very soul seemed to be leaving her body she tottered and would have fallen but for suzannes arm round her waist with superhuman effort she regained control over herselfthere was yet much to be done  bring that runner here to me she said to the servant with much calm he has not gone  no my lady  the groom went and marguerite turned to suzanne  and you child run within tell lucile to get ready i fear that i must send you home child andstay tell one of the maids to prepare a travelling dress and cloak for me  suzanne made no reply she kissed marguerite tenderly and obeyed without a word the child was overawed by the terrible nameless misery in her friends face  a minute later the groom returned followed by the runner who had brought the letter  who gave you this packet asked marguerite  a gentleman my lady replied the man at the rose and thistle inn opposite charing cross he said you would understand  at the rose and thistle what was he doing  he was waiting for the coach your ladyship which he had ordered  the coach  yes my lady a special coach he had ordered i understood from his man that he was posting straight to dover  thats enough you may go then she turned to the groom my coach and the four swiftest horses in the stables to be ready at once  the groom and runner both went quickly off to obey marguerite remained standing for a moment on the lawn quite alone her graceful figure was as rigid as a statue her eyes were fixed her hands were tightly clasped across her breast her lips moved as they murmured with pathetic heartbreaking persistence  whats to be done whats to be done where to find himoh god grant me light  but this was not the moment for remorse and despair she had doneunwittinglyan awful and terrible thingthe very worst crime in her eyes that woman ever committedshe saw it in all its horror her very blindness in not having guessed her husbands secret seemed now to her another deadly sin she ought to have known she ought to have known  how could she imagine that a man who could love with so much intensity as percy blakeney had loved her from the firsthow could such a man be the brainless idiot he chose to appear she at least ought to have known that he was wearing a mask and having found that out she should have torn it from his face whenever they were alone together  her love for him had been paltry and weak easily crushed by her own pride and she too had worn a mask in assuming a contempt for him whilst as a matter of fact she completely misunderstood him  but there was no time now to go over the past by her own blindness she had sinned now she must repay not by empty remorse but by prompt and useful action  percy had started for calais utterly unconscious of the fact that his most relentless enemy was on his heels he had set sail early that morning from london bridge provided he had a favourable wind he would no doubt be in france within twentyfour hours no doubt he had reckoned on the wind and chosen this route  chauvelin on the other hand would post to dover charter a vessel there and undoubtedly reach calais much about the same time once in calais percy would meet all those who were eagerly waiting for the noble and brave scarlet pimpernel who had come to rescue them from horrible and unmerited death with chauvelins eyes now fixed upon his every movement percy would thus not only be endangering his own life but that of suzannes father the old comte de tournay and of those other fugitives who were waiting for him and trusting in him there was also armand who had gone to meet de tournay secure in the knowledge that the scarlet pimpernel was watching over his safety  all these lives and that of her husband lay in marguerites hands these she must save if human pluck and ingenuity were equal to the task  unfortunately she could not do all this quite alone once in calais she would not know where to find her husband whilst chauvelin in stealing the papers at dover had obtained the whole itinerary above every thing she wished to warn percy  she knew enough about him by now to understand that he would never abandon those who trusted in him that he would not turn his back from danger and leave the comte de tournay to fall into the bloodthirsty hands that knew of no mercy but if he were warned he might form new plans be more wary more prudent unconsciously he might fall into a cunning trap butonce warnedhe might yet succeed  and if he failedif indeed fate and chauvelin with all the resources at his command proved too strong for the daring plotter after allthen at least she would be there by his side to comfort love and cherish to cheat death perhaps at the last by making it seem sweet if they died both together locked in each others arms with the supreme happiness of knowing that passion had responded to passion and that all misunderstandings were at an end  her whole body stiffened as with a great and firm resolution this she meant to do if god gave her wits and strength her eyes lost their fixed look they glowed with inward fire at the thought of meeting him again so soon in the very midst of most deadly perils they sparkled with the joy of sharing these dangers with himof helping him perhapsof being with him at the lastif she failed  the childlike sweet face had become hard and set the curved mouth was closed tightly over her clenched teeth she meant to do or die with him and for his sake a frown which spoke of an iron will and unbending resolution appeared between the two straight brows already her plans were formed she would go and find sir andrew ffoulkes first he was percys best friend and marguerite remembered with a thrill with what blind enthusiasm the young man always spoke of his mysterious leader  he would help her where she needed help her coach was ready a change of raiment and a farewell to little suzanne and she could be on her way  without haste but without hesitation she walked quietly into the house     chapter xx the friend    less than half an hour later marguerite buried in thoughts sat inside her coach which was bearing her swiftly to london  she had taken an affectionate farewell of little suzanne and seen the child safely started with her maid and in her own coach back to town she had sent one courier with a respectful letter of excuse to his royal highness begging for a postponement of the august visit on account of pressing and urgent business and another on ahead to bespeak a fresh relay of horses at faversham  then she had changed her muslin frock for a dark traveling costume and mantle had provided herself with moneywhich her husbands lavishness always placed fully at her disposaland had started on her way  she did not attempt to delude herself with any vain and futile hopes the safety of her brother armand was to have been conditional on the imminent capture of the scarlet pimpernel as chauvelin had sent her back armands compromising letter there was no doubt that he was quite satisfied in his own mind that percy blakeney was the man whose death he had sworn to bring about  no there was no room for any fond delusions percy the husband whom she loved with all the ardour which her admiration for his bravery had kindled was in immediate deadly peril through her hand she had betrayed him to his enemyunwittingly tis truebut she had betrayed him and if chauvelin succeeded in trapping him who so far was unaware of his danger then his death would be at her door his death when with her very hearts blood she would have defended him and given willingly her life for his  she had ordered her coach to drive her to the crown inn once there she told her coachman to give the horses food and rest then she ordered a chair and had herself carried to the house in pall mall where sir andrew ffoulkes lived  among all percys friends who were enrolled under his daring banner she felt that she would prefer to confide in sir andrew ffoulkes he had always been her friend and now his love for little suzanne had brought him closer to her still had he been away from home gone on the mad errand with percy perhaps then she would have called on lord hastings or lord tonyfor she wanted the help of one of these young men or she would indeed be powerless to save her husband  sir andrew ffoulkes however was at home and his servant introduced her ladyship immediately she went upstairs to the young mans comfortable bachelors chambers and was shown into a small though luxuriously furnished diningroom a moment or two later sir andrew himself appeared  he had evidently been much startled when he heard who his lady visitor was for he looked anxiouslyeven suspiciouslyat marguerite whilst performing the elaborate bows before her which the rigid etiquette of the time demanded  marguerite had laid aside every vestige of nervousness she was perfectly calm and having returned the young mans elaborate salute she began very calmly  sir andrew i have no desire to waste valuable time in much talk you must take certain things i am going to tell you for granted these will be of no importance what is important is that your leader and comrade the scarlet pimpernel    my husband    percy blakeney    is in deadly peril  had she the remotest doubt of the correctness of her deductions she would have had them confirmed now for sir andrew completely taken by surprise had grown very pale and was quite incapable of making the slightest attempt at clever parrying  no matter how i know this sir andrew she continued quietly thank god that i do and that perhaps it is not too late to save him unfortunately i cannot do this quite alone and therefore have come to you for help  lady blakeney said the young man trying to recover himself i     will you hear me first she interrupted this is how the matter stands when the agent of the french government stole your papers that night in dover he found amongst them certain plans which you or your leader meant to carry out for the rescue of the comte de tournay and others the scarlet pimpernelpercy my husbandhas gone on this errand himself today chauvelin knows that the scarlet pimpernel and percy blakeney are one and the same person he will follow him to calais and there will lay hands on him you know as well as i do the fate that awaits him at the hands of the revolutionary government of france no interference from englandfrom king george himselfwould save him robespierre and his gang would see to it that the interference came too late but not only that the muchtrusted leader will also have been unconsciously the means of revealing the hidingplace of the comte de tournay and of all those who even now are placing their hopes in him  she had spoken quietly dispassionately and with firm unbending resolution her purpose was to make that young man trust and help her for she could do nothing without him  i do not understand he repeated trying to gain time to think what was best to be done  aye but i think you do sir andrew you must know that i am speaking the truth look these facts straight in the face percy has sailed for calais i presume for some lonely part of the coast and chauvelin is on his track he has posted for dover and will cross the channel probably tonight what do you think will happen  the young man was silent  percy will arrive at his destination unconscious of being followed he will seek out de tournay and the othersamong these is armand st just my brotherhe will seek them out one after another probably not knowing that the sharpest eyes in the world are watching his every movement when he has thus unconsciously betrayed those who blindly trust in him when nothing can be gained from him and he is ready to come back to england with those whom he has gone so bravely to save the doors of the trap will close upon him and he will be sent to end his noble life upon the guillotine  still sir andrew was silent  you do not trust me she said passionately oh god cannot you see that i am in deadly earnest man man she added while with her tiny hands she seized the young man suddenly by the shoulders forcing him to look straight at her tell me do i look like that vilest thing on eartha woman who would betray her own husband  god forbid lady blakeney said the young man at last that i should attribute such evil motives to you but     but what    tell me    quick man    the very seconds are precious  will you tell me he asked resolutely and looking searchingly into her blue eyes whose hand helped to guide m chauvelin to the knowledge which you say he possesses  mine she said quietly i own iti will not lie to you for i wish you to trust me absolutely but i had no ideahow could i haveof the identity of the scarlet pimpernel    and my brothers safety was to be my prize if i succeeded  in helping chauvelin to track the scarlet pimpernel  she nodded  it is no use telling you how he forced my hand armand is more than a brother to me and    and    how could i guess    but we waste time sir andrew    every second is precious    in the name of god    my husband is in peril    your friendyour comradehelp me to save him  sir andrew felt his position to be a very awkward one the oath he had taken before his leader and comrade was one of obedience and secrecy and yet the beautiful woman who was asking him to trust her was undoubtedly in earnest his friend and leader was equally undoubtedly in imminent danger and     lady blakeney he said at last god knows you have perplexed me so that i do not know which way my duty lies tell me what you wish me to do there are nineteen of us ready to lay down our lives for the scarlet pimpernel if he is in danger  there is no need for lives just now my friend she said drily my wits and four swift horses will serve the necessary purpose but i must know where to find him see she added while her eyes filled with tears i have humbled myself before you i have owned my fault to you shall i also confess my weaknessmy husband and i have been estranged because he did not trust me and because i was too blind to understand you must confess that the bandage which he put over my eyes was a very thick one is it small wonder that i did not see through it but last night after i led him unwittingly into such deadly peril it suddenly fell from my eyes if you will not help me sir andrew i would still strive to save my husband i would still exert every faculty i possess for his sake but i might be powerless for i might arrive too late and nothing would be left for you but lifelong remorse and    and    for me a broken heart  but lady blakeney said the young man touched by the gentle earnestness of this exquisitely beautiful woman do you know that what you propose doing is mans workyou cannot possibly journey to calais alone you would be running the greatest possible risks to yourself and your chances of finding your husband nowwere i to direct you ever so carefullyare infinitely remote  oh i hope there are risks she murmured softly i hope there are dangers tooi have so much to atone for but i fear you are mistaken chauvelins eyes are fixed upon you all he will scarce notice me quick sir andrewthe coach is ready and there is not a moment to be lost    i must get to him i must she repeated with almost savage energy to warn him that that man is on his track    cant you seecant you see that i must get to him    even    even if it be too late to save him    at least    to be by his side    at the least  faith madame you must command me gladly would i or any of my comrades lay down our lives for your husband if you will go yourself     nay friend do you not see that i would go mad if i let you go without me she stretched out her hand to him you will trust me  i await your orders he said simply  listen then my coach is ready to take me to dover do you follow me as swiftly as horses will take you we meet at nightfall at the fishermans rest chauvelin would avoid it as he is known there and i think it would be the safest i will gladly accept your escort to calais    as you say i might miss sir percy were you to direct me ever so carefully well charter a schooner at dover and cross over during the night disguised if you will agree to it as my lacquey you will i think escape detection  i am entirely at your service madame rejoined the young man earnestly i trust to god that you will sight the day dream before we reach calais with chauvelin at his heels every step the scarlet pimpernel takes on french soil is fraught with danger  god grant it sir andrew but now farewell we meet tonight at dover it will be a race between chauvelin and me across the channel tonightand the prizethe life of the scarlet pimpernel  he kissed her hand and then escorted her to her chair a quarter of an hour later she was back at the crown inn where her coach and horses were ready and waiting for her the next moment they thundered along the london streets and then straight on to the dover road at maddening speed  she had no time for despair now she was up and doing and had no leisure to think with sir andrew ffoulkes as her companion and ally hope had once again revived in her heart  god would be merciful he would not allow so appalling a crime to be committed as the death of a brave man through the hand of a woman who loved him and worshipped him and who would gladly have died for his sake  marguerites thoughts flew back to him the mysterious hero whom she had always unconsciously loved when his identity was still unknown to her laughingly in the olden days she used to call him the shadowy king of her heart and now she had suddenly found that this enigmatic personality whom she had worshipped and the man who loved her so passionately were one and the same what wonder that one or two happier visions began to force their way before her mind she vaguely wondered what she would say to him when first they would stand face to face  she had had so many anxieties so much excitement during the past few hours that she allowed herself the luxury of nursing these few more hopeful brighter thoughts gradually the rumble of the coach wheels with its incessant monotony acted soothingly on her nerves her eyes aching with fatigue and many shed and unshed tears closed involuntarily and she fell into a troubled sleep     chapter xxi suspense    it was late into the night when she at last reached the fishermans rest she had done the whole journey in less than eight hours thanks to innumerable changes of horses at the various coaching stations for which she always paid lavishly thus obtaining the very best and swiftest that could be had  her coachman too had been indefatigable the promise of special and rich reward had no doubt helped to keep him up and he had literally burned the ground beneath his mistress coach wheels  the arrival of lady blakeney in the middle of the night caused a considerable flutter at the fishermans rest sally jumped hastily out of bed and mr jellyband was at great pains how to make his important guest comfortable  both of these good folk were far too well drilled in the manners appertaining to innkeepers to exhibit the slightest surprise at lady blakeneys arrival alone at this extraordinary hour no doubt they thought all the more but marguerite was far too absorbed in the importancethe deadly earnestnessof her journey to stop and ponder over trifles of that sort  the coffeeroomthe scene lately of the dastardly outrage on two english gentlemenwas quite deserted mr jellyband hastily relit the lamp rekindled a cheerful bit of fire in the great hearth and then wheeled a comfortable chair by it into which marguerite gratefully sank  will your ladyship stay the night asked pretty miss sally who was already busy laying a snowwhite cloth on the table preparatory to providing a simple supper for her ladyship  no not the whole night replied marguerite at any rate i shall not want any room but this if i can have it to myself for an hour or two  it is at your ladyships service said honest jellyband whose rubicund face was set in its tightest folds lest it should betray before the quality that boundless astonishment which the very worthy fellow had begun to feel  i shall be crossing over at the first turn of the tide said marguerite and in the first schooner i can get but my coachman and men will stay the night and probably several days longer so i hope you will make them comfortable  yes my lady ill look after them shall sally bring your ladyship some supper  yes please put something cold on the table and as soon as sir andrew ffoulkes comes show him in here  yes my lady  honest jellybands face now expressed distress in spite of himself he had great regard for sir percy blakeney and did not like to see his lady running away with young sir andrew of course it was no business of his and mr jellyband was no gossip still in his heart he recollected that her ladyship was after all only one of them furriners what wonder that she was immoral like the rest of them  dont sit up honest jellyband continued marguerite kindly nor you either mistress sally sir andrew may be late  jellyband was only too willing that sally should go to bed he was beginning not to like these goingson at all still lady blakeney would pay handsomely for the accommodation and it certainly was no business of his  sally arranged a simple supper of cold meat wine and fruit on the table then with a respectful curtsey she retired wondering in her little mind why her ladyship looked so serious when she was about to elope with her gallant  then commenced a period of weary waiting for marguerite she knew that sir andrewwho would have to provide himself with clothes befitting a lacqueycould not possibly reach dover for at least a couple of hours he was a splendid horseman of course and would make light in such an emergency of the seventy odd miles between london and dover he would too literally burn the ground beneath his horses hoofs but he might not always get very good remounts and in any case he could not have started from london until at least an hour after she did  she had seen nothing of chauvelin on the road her coachman whom she questioned had not seen anyone answering the description his mistress gave him of the wizened figure of the little frenchman  evidently therefore he had been ahead of her all the time she had not dared to question the people at the various inns where they had stopped to change horses she feared that chauvelin had spies all along the route who might overhear her questions then outdistance her and warn her enemy of her approach  now she wondered at what inn he might be stopping or whether he had had the good luck of chartering a vessel already and was now himself on the way to france that thought gripped her at the heart as with an iron vice if indeed she should not be too late already  the loneliness of the room overwhelmed her everything within was so horribly still the ticking of the grandfathers clockdreadfully slow and measuredwas the only sound which broke this awful loneliness  marguerite had need of all her energy all her steadfastness of purpose to keep up her courage through this weary midnight waiting  everyone else in the house but herself must have been asleep she had heard sally go upstairs mr jellyband had gone to see to her coachman and men and then had returned and taken up a position under the porch outside just where marguerite had first met chauvelin about a week ago he evidently meant to wait up for sir andrew ffoulkes but was soon overcome by sweet slumbers for presentlyin addition to the slow ticking of the clockmarguerite could hear the monotonous and dulcet tones of the worthy fellows breathing  for some time now she had realised that the beautiful warm octobers day so happily begun had turned into a rough and cold night she had felt very chilly and was glad of the cheerful blaze in the hearth but gradually as time wore on the weather became more rough and the sound of the great breakers against the admiralty pier though some distance from the inn came to her as the noise of muffled thunder  the wind was becoming boisterous rattling the leaded windows and the massive doors of the oldfashioned house it shook the trees outside and roared down the vast chimney marguerite wondered if the wind would be favourable for her journey she had no fear of the storm and would have braved worse risks sooner than delay the crossing by an hour  a sudden commotion outside roused her from her meditations evidently it was sir andrew ffoulkes just arrived in mad haste for she heard his horses hoofs thundering on the flagstones outside then mr jellybands sleepy yet cheerful tones bidding him welcome  for a moment then the awkwardness of her position struck marguerite alone at this hour in a place where she was well known and having made an assignation with a young cavalier equally well known and who arrived in disguise what food for gossip to those mischievously inclined  the idea struck marguerite chiefly from its humorous side there was such quaint contrast between the seriousness of her errand and the construction which would naturally be put on her actions by honest mr jellyband that for the first time since many hours a little smile began playing round the corners of her childlike mouth and when presently sir andrew almost unrecognisable in his lacqueylike garb entered the coffeeroom she was able to greet him with quite a merry laugh  faith monsieur my lacquey she said i am satisfied with your appearance  mr jellyband had followed sir andrew looking strangely perplexed the young gallants disguise had confirmed his worst suspicions without a smile upon his jovial face he drew the cork from the bottle of wine set the chairs ready and prepared to wait  thanks honest friend said marguerite who was still smiling at the thought of what the worthy fellow must be thinking at that very moment we shall require nothing more and heres for all the trouble you have been put to on our account  she handed two or three gold pieces to jellyband who took them respectfully and with becoming gratitude  stay lady blakeney interposed sir andrew as jellyband was about to retire i am afraid we shall require something more of my friend jellys hospitality i am sorry to say we cannot cross over tonight  not cross over tonight she repeated in amazement but we must sir andrew we must there can be no question of cannot and whatever it may cost we must get a vessel tonight  but the young man shook his head sadly  i am afraid it is not a question of cost lady blakeney there is a nasty storm blowing from france the wind is dead against us we cannot possibly sail until it has changed  marguerite became deadly pale she had not foreseen this nature herself was playing her a horrible cruel trick percy was in danger and she could not go to him because the wind happened to blow from the coast of france  but we must gowe must she repeated with strange persistent energy you know we must gocant you find a way  i have been down to the shore already he said and had a talk to one or two skippers it is quite impossible to set sail tonight so every sailor assured me no one he added looking significantly at marguerite no one could possibly put out of dover tonight  marguerite at once understood what he meant no one included chauvelin as well as herself she nodded pleasantly to jellyband  well then i must resign myself she said to him have you a room for me  oh yes your ladyship a nice bright airy room ill see to it at once    and there is another one for sir andrewboth quite ready  thats brave now mine honest jelly said sir andrew gaily and clapping his worth host vigorously on the back you unlock both those rooms and leave our candles here on the dresser i vow you are dead with sleep and her ladyship must have some supper before she retires there have no fear friend of the rueful countenance her ladyships visit though at this unusual hour is a great honour to thy house and sir percy blakeney will reward thee doubly if thou seest well to her privacy and comfort  sir andrew had no doubt guessed the many conflicting doubts and fears which raged in honest jellybands head and as he was a gallant gentleman he tried by this brave hint to allay some of the worthy innkeepers suspicions he had the satisfaction of seeing that he had partially succeeded jellybands rubicund countenance brightened somewhat at the mention of sir percys name  ill go and see to it at once sir he said with alacrity and with less frigidity in his manner has her ladyship everything she wants for supper  everything thanks honest friend and as i am famished and dead with fatigue i pray you see to the rooms  now tell me she said eagerly as soon as jellyband had gone from the room tell me all your news  there is nothing else much to tell you lady blakeney replied the young man the storm makes it quite impossible for any vessel to put out of dover this tide but what seems to you at first a terrible calamity is really a blessing in disguise if we cannot cross over to france tonight chauvelin is in the same quandary  he may have left before the storm broke out  god grant he may said sir andrew merrily for very likely then hell have been driven out of his course who knows he may now even be lying at the bottom of the sea for there is a furious storm raging and it will fare ill with all small craft which happen to be out but i fear me we cannot build our hopes upon the shipwreck of that cunning devil and of all his murderous plans the sailors i spoke to all assured me that no schooner had put out of dover for several hours on the other hand i ascertained that a stranger had arrived by coach this afternoon and had like myself made some inquiries about crossing over to france  then chauvelin is still in dover  undoubtedly shall i go waylay him and run my sword through him that were indeed the quickest way out of the difficulty  nay sir andrew do not jest alas i have often since last night caught myself wishing for that fiends death but what you suggest is impossible the laws of this country do not permit of murder it is only in our beautiful france that wholesale slaughter is done lawfully in the name of liberty and of brotherly love  sir andrew had persuaded her to sit down to the table to partake of some supper and to drink a little wine this enforced rest of at least twelve hours until the next tide was sure to be terribly difficult to bear in the state of intense excitement in which she was obedient in these small matters like a child marguerite tried to eat and drink  sir andrew with that profound sympathy born in all those who are in love made her almost happy by talking to her about her husband he recounted to her some of the daring escapes the brave scarlet pimpernel had contrived for the poor french fugitives whom a relentless and bloody revolution was driving out of their country he made her eyes glow with enthusiasm by telling her of his bravery his ingenuity his resourcefulness when it meant snatching the lives of men women and even children from beneath the very edge of that murderous everready guillotine  he even made her smile quite merrily by telling her of the scarlet pimpernels quaint and many disguises through which he had baffled the strictest watch set against him at the barricades of paris this last time the escape of the comtesse de tournay and her children had been a veritable masterpieceblakeney disguised as a hideous old marketwoman in filthy cap and straggling grey locks was a sight fit to make the gods laugh  marguerite laughed heartily as sir andrew tried to describe blakeneys appearance whose gravest difficulty always consisted in his great height which in france made disguise doubly difficult  thus an hour wore on there were many more to spend in enforced inactivity in dover marguerite rose from the table with an impatient sigh she looked forward with dread to the night in the bed upstairs with terribly anxious thoughts to keep her company and the howling of the storm to help chase sleep away  she wondered where percy was now the day dream was a strong wellbuilt seagoing yacht sir andrew had expressed the opinion that no doubt she had got in the lee of the wind before the storm broke out or else perhaps had not ventured into the open at all but was lying quietly at gravesend  briggs was an expert skipper and sir percy handled a schooner as well as any master mariner there was no danger for them from the storm  it was long past midnight when at last marguerite retired to rest as she had feared sleep sedulously avoided her eyes her thoughts were of the blackest during these long weary hours whilst that incessant storm raged which was keeping her away from percy the sound of the distant breakers made her heart ache with melancholy she was in the mood when the sea has a saddening effect upon the nerves it is only when we are very happy that we can bear to gaze merrily upon the vast and limitless expanse of water rolling on and on with such persistent irritating monotony to the accompaniment of our thoughts whether grave or gay when they are gay the waves echo their gaiety but when they are sad then every breaker as it rolls seems to bring additional sadness and to speak to us of hopelessness and of the pettiness of all our joys     chapter xxii calais    the weariest nights the longest days sooner or later must perforce come to an end  marguerite had spent over fifteen hours in such acute mental torture as wellnigh drove her crazy after a sleepless night she rose early wild with excitement dying to start on her journey terrified lest further obstacles lay in her way she rose before anyone else in the house was astir so frightened was she lest she should miss the one golden opportunity of making a start  when she came downstairs she found sir andrew ffoulkes sitting in the coffeeroom he had been out half an hour earlier and had gone to the admiralty pier only to find that neither the french packet nor any privately chartered vessel could put out of dover yet the storm was then at its fullest and the tide was on the turn if the wind did not abate or change they would perforce have to wait another ten or twelve hours until the next tide before a start could be made and the storm had not abated the wind had not changed and the tide was rapidly drawing out  marguerite felt the sickness of despair when she heard this melancholy news only the most firm resolution kept her from totally breaking down and thus adding to the young mans anxiety which evidently had become very keen  though he tried to hide it marguerite could see that sir andrew was just as anxious as she was to reach his comrade and friend this enforced inactivity was terrible to them both  how they spent that wearisome day at dover marguerite could never afterwards say she was in terror of showing herself lest chauvelins spies happened to be about so she had a private sittingroom and she and sir andrew sat there hour after hour trying to take at long intervals some perfunctory meals which little sally would bring them with nothing to do but to think to conjecture and only occasionally to hope  the storm had abated just too late the tide was by then too far out to allow a vessel to put off to sea the wind had changed and was settling down to a comfortable northwesterly breezea veritable godsend for a speedy passage across to france  and there those two waited wondering if the hour would ever come when they could finally make a start there had been one happy interval in this long weary day and that was when sir andrew went down once again to the pier and presently came back to tell marguerite that he had chartered a quick schooner whose skipper was ready to put to sea the moment the tide was favourable  from that moment the hours seemed less wearisome there was less hopelessness in the waiting and at last at five oclock in the afternoon marguerite closely veiled and followed by sir andrew ffoulkes who in the guise of her lacquey was carrying a number of impedimenta found her way down to the pier  once on board the keen fresh seaair revived her the breeze was just strong enough to nicely swell the sails of the foam crest as she cut her way merrily towards the open  the sunset was glorious after the storm and marguerite as she watched the white cliffs of dover gradually disappearing from view felt more at peace and once more almost hopeful  sir andrew was full of kind attentions and she felt how lucky she had been to have him by her side in this her great trouble  gradually the grey coast of france began to emerge from the fastgathering evening mists one or two lights could be seen flickering and the spires of several churches to rise out of the surrounding haze  half an hour later marguerite had landed upon french shore she was back in that country where at this very moment men slaughtered their fellowcreatures by the hundreds and sent innocent women and children in thousands to the block  the very aspect of the country and its people even in this remote seacoast town spoke of that seething revolution three hundred miles away in beautiful paris now rendered hideous by the constant flow of the blood of her noblest sons by the wailing of the widows and the cries of fatherless children  the men all wore red capsin various stages of cleanlinessbut all with the tricolor cockade pinned on the leftside marguerite noticed with a shudder that instead of the laughing merry countenance habitual to her own countrymen their faces now invariably wore a look of sly distrust  every man nowadays was a spy upon his fellows the most innocent word uttered in jest might at any time be brought up as a proof of aristocratic tendencies or of treachery against the people even the women went about with a curious look of fear and of hate lurking in their brown eyes and all watched marguerite as she stepped on shore followed by sir andrew and murmured as she passed along sacres aristos or else sacres anglais  otherwise their presence excited no further comment calais even in those days was in constant business communication with england and english merchants were often seen on this coast it was well known that in view of the heavy duties in england a vast deal of french wines and brandies were smuggled across this pleased the french bourgeois immensely he liked to see the english government and the english king both of whom he hated cheated out of their revenues and an english smuggler was always a welcome guest at the tumbledown taverns of calais and boulogne  so perhaps as sir andrew gradually directed marguerite through the tortuous streets of calais many of the population who turned with an oath to look at the strangers clad in english fashion thought that they were bent on purchasing dutiable articles for their own fogridden country and gave them no more than a passing thought  marguerite however wondered how her husbands tall massive figure could have passed through calais unobserved she marvelled what disguise he assumed to do his noble work without exciting too much attention  without exchanging more than a few words sir andrew was leading her right across the town to the other side from that where they had landed and the way towards cap gris nez the streets were narrow tortuous and mostly evilsmelling with a mixture of stale fish and damp cellar odours there had been heavy rain here during the storm last night and sometimes marguerite sank ankledeep in the mud for the roads were not lighted save by the occasional glimmer from a lamp inside a house  but she did not heed any of these petty discomforts we may meet blakeney at the chat gris sir andrew had said when they landed and she was walking as if on a carpet of roseleaves for she was going to meet him almost at once  at last they reached their destination sir andrew evidently knew the road for he had walked unerringly in the dark and had not asked his way from anyone it was too dark then for marguerite to notice the outside aspect of this house the chat gris as sir andrew had called it was evidently a small wayside inn on the outskirts of calais and on the way to gris nez it lay some little distance from the coast for the sound of the sea seemed to come from afar  sir andrew knocked at the door with the knob of his cane and from within marguerite heard a sort of grunt and the muttering of a number of oaths sir andrew knocked again this time more peremptorily more oaths were heard and then shuffling steps seemed to draw near the door presently this was thrown open and marguerite found herself on the threshold of the most dilapidated most squalid room she had ever seen in all her life  the paper such as it was was hanging from the walls in strips there did not seem to be a single piece of furniture in the room that could by the wildest stretch of imagination be called whole most of the chairs had broken backs others had no seats to them one corner of the table was propped up with a bundle of faggots there where the fourth leg had been broken  in one corner of the room there was a huge hearth over which hung a stockpot with a not altogether unpalatable odour of hot soup emanating therefrom on one side of the room high up in the wall there was a species of loft before which hung a tattered blueandwhite checked curtain a rickety set of steps led up to this loft  on the great bare walls with their colourless paper all stained with varied filth there were chalked up at intervals in great bold characters the words liberteegalitefraternite  the whole of this sordid abode was dimly lighted by an evilsmelling oillamp which hung from the rickety rafters of the ceiling it all looked so horribly squalid so dirty and uninviting that marguerite hardly dared to cross the threshold  sir andrew however had stepped unhesitatingly forward  english travellers citoyen he said boldly and speaking in french  the individual who had come to the door in response to sir andrews knock and who presumably was the owner of this squalid abode was an elderly heavily built peasant dressed in a dirty blue blouse heavy sabots from which wisps of straw protruded all round shabby blue trousers and the inevitable red cap with the tricolour cockade that proclaimed his momentary political views he carried a short wooden pipe from which the odour of rank tobacco emanated he looked with some suspicion and a great deal of contempt at the two travellers muttering sacrrres anglais and spat upon the ground to further show his independence of spirit but nevertheless he stood aside to let them enter no doubt well aware that these same saccres anglais always had wellfilled purses  oh lud said marguerite as she advanced into the room holding her handkerchief to her dainty nose what a dreadful hole are you sure this is the place  aye tis the place sure enough replied the young man as with his laceedged fashionable handkerchief he dusted a chair for marguerite to sit on but i vow i never saw a more villainous hole  faith she said looking round with some curiosity and a great deal of horror at the dilapidated walls the broken chairs the rickety table it certainly does not look inviting  the landlord of the chat grisby name brogardhad taken no further notice of his guests he concluded that presently they would order supper and in the meanwhile it was not for a free citizen to show deference or even courtesy to anyone however smartly they might be dressed  by the hearth sat a huddledup figure clad seemingly mostly in rags that figure was apparently a woman although even that would have been hard to distinguish except for the cap which had once been white and for what looked like the semblance of a petticoat she was sitting mumbling to herself and from time to time stirring the brew in her stockpot  hey my friend said sir andrew at last we should like some supper    the citoyenne there he added is concocting some delicious soup ill warrant and my mistress has not tasted food for several hours  it took brogard some few minutes to consider the question a free citizen does not respond too readily to the wishes of those who happen to require something of him  sacrrres aristos he murmured and once more spat upon the ground  then he went very slowly up to a dresser which stood in a corner of the room from this he took an old pewter souptureen and slowly and without a word he handed it to his betterhalf who in the same silence began filling the tureen with the soup out of her stockpot  marguerite had watched all these preparations with absolute horror were it not for the earnestness of her purpose she would incontinently have fled from this abode of dirt and evil smells  faith our host and hostess are not cheerful people said sir andrew seeing the look of horror on marguerites face i would i could offer you a more hearty and more appetising meal    but i think you will find the soup eatable and the wine good these people wallow in dirt but live well as a rule  nay i pray you sir andrew she said gently be not anxious about me my mind is scarce inclined to dwell on thoughts of supper  brogard was slowly pursuing his gruesome preparations he had placed a couple of spoons also two glasses on the table both of which sir andrew took the precaution of wiping carefully  brogard had also produced a bottle of wine and some bread and marguerite made an effort to draw her chair to the table and to make some pretence at eating sir andrew as befitting his role of lacquey stood behind her chair  nay madame i pray you he said seeing that marguerite seemed quite unable to eat i beg of you to try and swallow some foodremember you have need of all your strength  the soup certainly was not bad it smelt and tasted good marguerite might have enjoyed it but for the horrible surroundings she broke the bread however and drank some of the wine  nay sir andrew she said i do not like to see you standing you have need of food just as much as i have this creature will only think that i am an eccentric englishwoman eloping with her lacquey if youll sit down and partake of this semblance of supper beside me  indeed brogard having placed what was strictly necessary upon the table seemed not to trouble himself any further about his guests the mere brogard had quietly shuffled out of the room and the man stood and lounged about smoking his evilsmelling pipe sometimes under marguerites very nose as any freeborn citizen who was anybodys equal should do  confound the brute said sir andrew with native british wrath as brogard leant up against the table smoking and looking down superciliously at these two sacrrres anglais  in heavens name man admonished marguerite hurriedly seeing that sir andrew with britishborn instinct was ominously clenching his fist remember that you are in france and that in this year of grace this is the temper of the people  id like to scrag the brute muttered sir andrew savagely  he had taken marguerites advice and sat next to her at table and they were both making noble efforts to deceive one another by pretending to eat and drink  i pray you said marguerite keep the creature in a good temper so that he may answer the questions we must put to him  ill do my best but begad id sooner scrag him than question him hey my friend he said pleasantly in french and tapping brogard lightly on the shoulder do you see many of our quality along these parts many english travellers i mean  brogard looked round at him over his near shoulder puffed away at his pipe for a moment or two as he was in no hurry then muttered  heusometimes  ah said sir andrew carelessly english travellers always know where they can get good wine eh my friendnow tell me my lady was desiring to know if by any chance you happen to have seen a great friend of hers an english gentleman who often comes to calais on business he is tall and recently was on his way to parismy lady hoped to have met him in calais  marguerite tried not to look at brogard lest she should betray before him the burning anxiety with which she waited for his reply but a freeborn french citizen is never in any hurry to answer questions brogard took his time then he said very slowly  tall englishmantodayyes  yes today muttered brogard sullenly then he quietly took sir andrews hat from a chair close by put it on his own head tugged at his dirty blouse and generally tried to express in pantomime that the individual in question wore very fine clothes sacrre aristo he muttered that tall englishman  marguerite could scarce repress a scream  its sir percy right enough she murmured and not even in disguise  she smiled in the midst of all her anxiety and through her gathering tears at the thought of the ruling passion strong in death of percy running into the wildest maddest dangers with the latestcut coat upon his back and the laces of his jabot unruffled  oh the foolhardiness of it she sighed quick sir andrew ask the man when he went  ah yes my friend said sir andrew addressing brogard with the same assumption of carelessness my lord always wears beautiful clothes the tall englishman you saw was certainly my ladys friend and he has gone you say  he went    yes    but hes coming back    herehe ordered supper     sir andrew put his hand with a quick gesture of warning upon marguerites arm it came none too sooe for the next moment her wild mad joy would have betrayed her he was safe and well was coming back here presently she would see him in a few moments perhaps    oh the wildness of her joy seemed almost more than she could bear  here she said to brogard who seemed suddenly to have been transformed in her eyes into some heavenborn messenger of bliss heredid you say the english gentleman was coming back here  the heavenborn messenger of bliss spat upon the floor to express his contempt for all and sundry aristos who chose to haunt the chat gris  heu he muttered he ordered supperhe will come back    sacrre anglais he added by way of protest against all this fuss for a mere englishman  but where is he nowdo you know she asked eagerly placing her dainty white hand upon the dirty sleeve of his blue blouse  he went to get a horse and cart said brogard laconically as with a surly gesture he shook off from his arm that pretty hand which princes had been proud to kiss  at what time did he go  but brogard had evidently had enough of these questionings he did not think that it was fitting for a citizenwho was the equal of anybodyto be thus catechised by these sacrres aristos even though they were rich english ones it was distinctly more fitting to his newborn dignity to be as rude as possible it was a sure sign of servility to meekly reply to civil questions  i dont know he said surlily i have said enough voyons les aristos    he came today he ordered supper he went outhell come back voila  and with this parting assertion of his rights as a citizen and a free man to be as rude as he well pleased brogard shuffled out of the room banging the door after him     chapter xxiii hope    faith madame said sir andrew seeing that marguerite seemed desirous to call her surly host back again i think wed better leave him alone we shall not get anything more out of him and we might arouse his suspicions one never knows what spies may be lurking around these godforsaken places  what care i she replied lightly now i know that my husband is safe and that i shall see him almost directly  hush he said in genuine alarm for she had talked quite loudly in the fulness of her glee the very walls have ears in france these days  he rose quickly from the table and walked round the bare squalid room listening attentively at the door through which brogard has just disappeared and whence only muttered oaths and shuffling footsteps could be heard he also ran up the rickety steps that led to the attic to assure himself that there were no spies of chauvelins about the place  are we alone monsieur my lacquey said marguerite gaily as the young man once more sat down beside her may we talk  as cautiously as possible he entreated  faith man but you wear a glum face as for me i could dance with joy surely there is no longer any cause for fear our boat is on the beach the foam crest not two miles out at sea and my husband will be here under this very roof within the next half hour perhaps sure there is naught to hinder us chauvelin and his gang have not yet arrived  nay madam that i fear we do not know  what do you mean  he was at dover at the same time that we were  held up by the same storm which kept us from starting  exactly buti did not speak of it before for i feared to alarm youi saw him on the beach not five minutes before we embarked at least i swore to myself at the time that it was himself he was disguised as a cure so that satan his own guardian would scarce have known him but i heard him then bargaining for a vessel to take him swiftly to calais and he must have set sail less than an hour after we did  marguerites face had quickly lost its look of joy the terrible danger in which percy stood now that he was actually on french soil became suddenly and horribly clear to her chauvelin was close upon his heels here in calais the astute diplomatist was allpowerful a word from him and percy could be tracked and arrested and     every drop of blood seemed to freeze in her veins not even during the moments of her wildest anguish in england had she so completely realised the imminence of the peril in which her husband stood chauvelin had sworn to bring the scarlet pimpernel to the guillotine and now the daring plotter whose anonymity hitherto had been his safeguard stood revealed through her own hand to his most bitter most relentless enemy  chauvelinwhen he waylaid lord tony and sir andrew ffoulkes in the coffeeroom of the fishermans resthad obtained possession of all the plans of this latest expedition armand st just the comte de tournay and other fugitive royalists were to have met the scarlet pimpernelor rather as it had been originally arranged two of his emissarieson this day the 2nd of october at a place evidently known to the league and vaguely alluded to as the pere blanchards hut  armand whose connection with the scarlet pimpernel and disavowal of the brutal policy of the reign of terror was still unknown to his countryman had left england a little more than a week ago carrying with him the necessary instructions which would enable him to meet the other fugitives and to convey them to this place of safety  this much marguerite had fully understood from the first and sir andrew ffoulkes had confirmed her surmises she knew too that when sir percy realized that his own plans and his directions to his lieutenants had been stolen by chauvelin it was too late to communicate with armand or to send fresh instructions to the fugitives  they would of necessity be at the appointed time and place not knowing how grave was the danger which now awaited their brave rescuer  blakeney who as usual had planned and organized the whole expedition would not allow any of his younger comrades to run the risk of almost certain capture hence his hurried note to them at lord grenvilles ballstart myself tomorrowalone  and now with his identity known to his most bitter enemy his every step would be dogged the moment he set foot in france he would be tracked by chauvelins emissaries followed until he reached that mysterious hut where the fugitives were waiting for him and there the trap would be closed on him and on them  there was but one hourthe hours start which marguerite and sir andrew had of their enemyin which to warn percy of the imminence of his danger and to persuade him to give up the foolhardy expedition which could only end in his own death  but there was that one hour  chauvelin knows of this inn from the papers he stole said sir andrew earnestly and on landing will make straight for it  he has not landed yet she said we have an hours start on him and percy will be here directly we shall be midchannel ere chauvelin has realised that we have slipped through his fingers  she spoke excitedly and eagerly wishing to infuse into her young friend some of that buoyant hope which still clung to her heart but he shook his head sadly  silent again sir andrew she said with some impatience why do you shake your head and look so glum  faith madame he replied tis only because in making your rosecoloured plans you are forgetting the most important factor  what in the world do you meani am forgetting nothing    what factor do you mean she added with more impatience  it stands six foot odd high replied sir andrew quietly and hath name percy blakeney  i dont understand she murmured  do you think that blakeney would leave calais without having accomplished what he set out to do  you mean      theres the old comte de tournay     the comte     she murmured  and st just    and others     my brother she said with a heartbroken sob of anguish heaven help me but i fear i had forgotten  fugitives as they are these men at this moment await with perfect confidence and unshaken faith the arrival of the scarlet pimpernel who has pledged his honour to take them safely across the channel  indeed she had forgotten with the sublime selfishness of a woman who loves with her whole heart she had in the last twentyfour hours had no thought save for him his precious noble life his dangerhe the loved one the brave hero he alone dwelt in her mind  my brother she murmured as one by one the heavy tears gathered in her eyes as memory came back to her of armand the companion and darling of her childhood the man for whom she had committed the deadly sin which had so hopelessly imperilled her brave husbands life  sir percy blakeney would not be the trusted honoured leader of a score of english gentlemen said sir andrew proudly if he abandoned those who placed their trust in him as for breaking his word the very thought is preposterous  there was silence for a moment or two marguerite had buried her face in her hands and was letting the tears slowly trickle through her trembling fingers the young man said nothing his heart ached for this beautiful woman in her awful grief all along he had felt the terrible impasse in which her own rash act had plunged them all he knew his friend and leader so well with his reckless daring his mad bravery his worship of his own word of honour sir andrew knew that blakeney would brave any danger run the wildest risks sooner than break it and with chauvelin at his very heels would make a final attempt however desperate to rescue those who trusted in him  faith sir andrew said marguerite at last making brave efforts to dry her tears you are right and i would not now shame myself by trying to dissuade him from doing his duty as you say i should plead in vain god grant him strength and ability she added fervently and resolutely to outwit his pursuers he will not refuse to take you with him perhaps when he starts on his noble work between you you will have cunning as well as valour god guard you both in the meanwhile i think we should lose no time i still believe that his safety depends upon his knowing that chauvelin is on his track  undoubtedly he has wonderful resources at his command as soon as he is aware of his danger he will exercise more caution his ingenuity is a veritable miracle  then what say you to a voyage of reconnaissance in the village whilst i wait here against his comingyou might come across percys track and thus save valuable time if you find him tell him to bewarehis bitterest enemy is on his heels  but this is such a villainous hole for you to wait in  nay that i do not mindbut you might ask our surly host if he could let me wait in another room where i could be safer from the prying eyes of any chance traveller offer him some ready money so that he should not fail to give me word the moment the tall englishman returns  she spoke quite calmly even cheerfully now thinking out her plans ready for the worst if need be she would show no more weakness she would prove herself worthy of him who was about to give his life for the sake of his fellowmen  sir andrew obeyed her without further comment instinctively he felt that hers now was the stronger mind he was willing to give himself over to her guidance to become the hand whilst she was the directing hand  he went to the door of the inner room through which brogard and his wife had disappeared before and knocked as usual he was answered by a salvo of muttered oaths  hey friend brogard said the man peremptorily my lady friend would wish to rest here awhile could you give her the use of another room she would wish to be alone  he took some money out of his pocket and allowed it to jingle significantly in his hand brogard had opened the door and listened with his usual surly apathy to the young mans request at the sight of the gold however his lazy attitude relaxed slightly he took his pipe from his mouth and shuffled into the room  he then pointed over his shoulder at the attic up in the wall  she can wait up there he said with a grunt its comfortable and i have no other room  nothing could be better said marguerite in english she at once realised the advantages such a position hidden from view would give her give him the money sir andrew i shall be quite happy up there and can see everything without being seen  she nodded to brogard who condescended to go up to the attic and to shake up the straw that lay on the floor  may i entreat you madam to do nothing rash said sir andrew as marguerite prepared in her turn to ascend the rickety flight of steps remember this place is infested with spies do not i beg of you reveal yourself to sir percy unless you are absolutely certain that you are alone with him  even as he spoke he felt how unnecessary was this caution marguerite was as calm as clearheaded as any man there was no fear of her doing anything that was rash  nay she said with a slight attempt at cheerfulness that i can faithfully promise you i would not jeopardise my husbands life nor yet his plans by speaking to him before strangers have no fear i will watch my opportunity and serve him in the manner i think he needs it most  brogard had come down the steps again and marguerite was ready to go up to her safe retreat  i dare not kiss your hand madam said sir andrew as she began to mount the steps since i am your lacquey but i pray you be of good cheer if i do not come across blakeney in half an hour i shall return expecting to find him here  yes that will be best we can afford to wait for half an hour chauvelin cannot possibly be here before that god grant that either you or i may have seen percy by then good luck to you friend have no fear for me  lightly she mounted the rickety wooden steps that led to the attic brogard was taking no further heed of her she could make herself comfortable there or not as she chose sir andrew watched her until she had reached the curtains across and the young man noted that she was singularly well placed there for seeing and hearing whilst remaining unobserved  he had paid brogard well the surly old innkeeper would have no object in betraying her then sir andrew prepared to go at the door he turned once again and looked up at the loft through the ragged curtains marguerites sweet face was peeping down at him and the young man rejoiced to see that it looked serene and even gently smiling with a final nod of farewell to her he walked out into the night     chapter xxiv the deathtrap    the next quarter of an hour went by swiftly and noiselessly in the room downstairs brogard had for a while busied himself with clearing the table and rearranging it for another guest  it was because she watched these preparations that marguerite found the time slipping by more pleasantly it was for percy that this semblance of supper was being got ready evidently brogard had a certain amount of respect for the tall englishman as he seemed to take some trouble in making the place look a trifle less uninviting than it had done before  he even produced from some hidden recess in the old dresser what actually looked like a tablecloth and when he spread it out and saw it was full of holes he shook his head dubiously for a while then was at much pains so to spread it over the table as to hide most of its blemishes  then he got out a serviette also old and ragged but possessing some measure of cleanliness and with this he carefully wiped the glasses spoons and plates which he put on the table  marguerite could not help smiling to herself as she watched all these preparations which brogard accomplished to an accompaniment of muttered oaths clearly the great height and bulk of the englishman or perhaps the weight of his fist had overawed this freeborn citizen of france or he would never have been at such trouble for any sacrre aristo  when the table was setsuch as it wasbrogard surveyed it with evident satisfaction he then dusted one of the chairs with the corner of his blouse gave a stir to the stockpot threw a fresh bundle of faggots on to the fire and slouched out of the room  marguerite was left alone with her reflections she had spread her travelling cloak over the straw and was sitting fairly comfortably as the straw was fresh and the evil odours from below came up to her only in a modified form  but momentarily she was almost happy happy because when she peeped through the tattered curtains she could see a rickety chair a torn tablecloth a glass a plate and a spoon that was all but those mute and ugly things seemed to say to her that they were waiting for percy that soon very soon he would be here that the squalid room being still empty they would be alone together  that thought was so heavenly that marguerite closed her eyes in order to shut out everything but that in a few minutes she would be alone with him she would run down the ladder and let him see her then he would take her in his arms and she would let him see that after that she would gladly die for him and with him for earth could hold no greater happiness than that  and then what would happen she could not even remotely conjecture she knew of course that sir andrew was right that percy would do everything he had set out to accomplish that shenow she was herecould do nothing beyond warning him to be cautious since chauvelin himself was on his track after having cautioned him she would perforce have to see him go off upon the terrible and daring mission she could not even with a word or look attempt to keep him back she would have to obey whatever he told her to do even perhaps have to efface herself and wait in indescribable agony whilst he perhaps went to his death  but even that seemed less terrible to bear than the thought that he should never know how much she loved himthat at any rate would be spared her the squalid room itself which seemed to be waiting for him told her that he would be here soon  suddenly her oversensitive ears caught the sound of distant footsteps drawing near her heart gave a wild leap of joy was it percy at last no the step did not seem quite as long nor quite as firm as his she also thought that she could hear two distinct sets of footsteps yes that was it two men were coming this way two strangers perhaps to get a drink or     but she had not time to conjecture for presently there was a peremptory call at the door and the next moment it was violently open from the outside whilst a rough commanding voice shouted  hey citoyen brogard hola  marguerite could not see the newcomers but through a hole in one of the curtains she could observe one portion of the room below  she heard brogards shuffling footsteps as he came out of the inner room muttering his usual string of oaths on seeing the strangers however he paused in the middle of the room well within range of marguerites vision looked at them with even more withering contempt than he had bestowed upon his former guests and muttered sacrrree soutane  marguerites heart seemed all at once to stop beating her eyes large and dilated had fastened on one of the newcomers who at this point had taken a quick step forward towards brogard he was dressed in the soutane broadbrimmed hat and buckled shoes habitual to the french cure but as he stood opposite the innkeeper he threw open his soutane for a moment displaying the tricolour scarf of officialism which sight immediately had the effect of transforming brogards attitude of contempt into one of cringing obsequiousness  it was the sight of this french cure which seemed to freeze the very blood in marguerites veins she could not see his face which was shaded by his broadbrimmed hat but she recognized the thin bony hands the slight stoop the whole gait of the man it was chauvelin  the horror of the situation struck her as with a physical blow the awful disappointment the dread of what was to come made her very senses reel and she needed almost superhuman effort not to fall senseless beneath it all  a plate of soup and a bottle of wine said chauvelin imperiously to brogard then clear out of hereunderstand i want to be alone  silently and without any muttering this time brogard obeyed chauvelin sat down at the table which had been prepared for the tall englishman and the innkeeper busied himself obsequiously round him dishing up the soup and pouring out the wine the man who had entered with chauvelin and whom marguerite could not see stood waiting close by the door  at a brusque sign from chauvelin brogard had hurried back to the inner room and the former now beckoned to the man who had accompanied him  in him marguerite at once recognised desgas chauvelins secretary and confidential factotum whom she had often seen in paris in days gone by he crossed the room and for a moment or two listened attentively at the brogards door not listening asked chauvelin curtly  no citoyen  for a moment marguerite dreaded lest chauvelin should order desgas to search the place what would happen if she were to be discovered she hardly dared to imagine fortunately however chauvelin seemed more impatient to talk to his secretary than afraid of spies for he called desgas quickly back to his side  the english schooner he asked  she was lost sight of at sundown citoyen replied desgas but was then making west towards cap gris nez  ahgood muttered chauvelin and now about captain jutleywhat did he say  he assured me that all the orders you sent him last week have been implicitly obeyed all the roads which converge to this place have been patrolled night and day ever since and the beach and cliffs have been most rigorously searched and guarded  does he know where this pere blanchards hut is  no citoyen nobody seems to know of it by that name there are any amount of fishermans huts all along the course    but     thatll do now about tonight interrupted chauvelin impatiently  the roads and the beach are patrolled as usual citoyen and captain jutley awaits further orders  go back to him at once then tell him to send reinforcements to the various patrols and especially to those along the beachyou understand  chauvelin spoke curtly and to the point and every word he uttered struck at marguerites heart like the deathknell of her fondest hopes  the men he continued are to keep the sharpest possible lookout for any stranger who may be walking riding or driving along the road or the beach more especially for a tall stranger whom i need not describe further as probably he will be disguised but he cannot very well conceal his height except by stooping you understand  perfectly citoyen replied desgas  as soon as any of the men have sighted a stranger two of them are to keep him in view the man who loses sight of the tall stranger after he is once seen will pay for his negligence with his life but one man is to ride straight back here and report to me is that clear  absolutely clear citoyen  very well then go and see jutley at once see the reinforcements start off for the patrol duty then ask the captain to let you have a halfadozen more men and bring them here with you you can be back in ten minutes go  desgas saluted and went to the door  as marguerite sick with horror listened to chauvelins directions to his underling the whole of the plan for the capture of the scarlet pimpernel became appallingly clear to her chauvelin wished that the fugitives should be left in false security waiting in their hidden retreat until percy joined them then the daring plotter was to be surrounded and caught redhanded in the very act of aiding and abetting royalists who were traitors to the republic thus if his capture were noised abroad even the british government could not legally protest in his favour having plotted with the enemies of the french government france had the right to put him to death  escape for him and them would be impossible all the roads patrolled and watched the trap well set the net wide at present but drawing together tighter and tighter until it closed upon the daring plotter whose superhuman cunning even could not rescue him from its meshes now  desgas was about to go but chauvelin once more called him back marguerite vaguely wondered what further devilish plans he could have formed in order to entrap one brave man alone against twoscore of others she looked at him as he turned to speak to desgas she could just see his face beneath the broadbrimmed curess hat there was at that moment so much deadly hatred such fiendish malice in the thin face and pale small eyes that marguerites last hope died in her heart for she felt that from this man she could expect no mercy  i had forgotten repeated chauvelin with a weird chuckle as he rubbed his bony talonlike hands one against the other with a gesture of fiendish satisfaction the tall stranger may show fight in any case no shooting remember except as a last resort i want that tall stranger alive    if possible  he laughed as dante has told us that the devils laugh at the sight of the torture of the damned marguerite had thought that by now she had lived through the whole gamut of horror and anguish that human heart could bear yet now when desgas left the house and she remained alone in this lonely squalid room with that fiend for company she felt as if all that she had suffered was nothing compared with this he continued to laugh and chuckle to himself for awhile rubbing his hands together in anticipation of his triumph  his plans were well laid and he might well triumph not a loophole was left through which the bravest the most cunning man might escape every road guarded every corner watched and in that lonely hut somewhere on the coast a small band of fugitives waiting for their rescuer and leading him to his deathnay to worse than death that fiend there in a holy mans garb was too much of a devil to allow a brave man to die the quick sudden death of a soldier at the post of duty  he above all longed to have the cunning enemy who had so long baffled him helpless in his power he wished to gloat over him to enjoy his downfall to inflict upon him what moral and mental torture a deadly hatred alone can devise the brave eagle captured and with noble wings clipped was doomed to endure the gnawing of the rat and she his wife who loved him and who had brought him to this could do nothing to help him  nothing save to hope for death by his side and for one brief moment in which to tell him that her lovewhole true and passionatewas entirely his  chauvelin was now sitting close to the table he had taken off his hat and marguerite could just see the outline of his thin profile and pointed chin as he bent over his meagre supper he was evidently quite contented and awaited events with perfect calm he even seemed to enjoy brogards unsavoury fare marguerite wondered how so much hatred could lurk in one human being against another  suddenly as she watched chauvelin a sound caught her ear which turned her very heart to stone and yet that sound was not calculated to inspire anyone with horror for it was merely the cheerful sound of a gay fresh voice singing lustily god save the king     chapter xxv the eagle and the fox    marguerites breath stopped short she seemed to feel her very life standing still momentarily whilst she listened to that voice and to that song in the singer she had recognised her husband chauvelin too had heard it for he darted a quick glance towards the door then hurriedly took up his broadbrimmed hat and clapped it over his head  the voice drew nearer for one brief second the wild desire seized marguerite to rush down the steps and fly across the room to stop that song at any cost to beg the cheerful singer to flyfly for his life before it be too late she checked the impulse just in time chauvelin would stop her before she reached the door and moreover she had no idea if he had any soldiers posted within his call her impetuous act might prove the deathsignal of the man she would have died to save  long to reign over us god save the king  sang the voice more lustily than ever the next moment the door was thrown open and there was dead silence for a second or so  marguerite could not see the door she held her breath trying to imagine what was happening  percy blakeney on entering had of course at once caught sight of the cure at the table his hesitation lasted less than five seconds the next moment marguerite saw his tall figure crossing the room whilst he called in a loud cheerful voice  hello there no one about wheres that fool brogard  he wore the magnificent coat and ridingsuit which he had on when marguerite last saw him at richmond so many hours ago as usual his getup was absolutely irreproachable the fine mechlin lace at his neck and wrists were immaculate and white his fair hair was carefully brushed and he carried his eyeglass with his usual affected gesture in fact at this moment sir percy blakeney bart might have been on his way to a gardenparty at the prince of wales instead of deliberately coldbloodedly running his head in a trap set for him by his deadliest enemy  he stood for a moment in the middle of the room whilst marguerite absolutely paralysed with horror seemed unable even to breathe  every moment she expected that chauvelin would give a signal that the place would fill with soldiers that she would rush down and help percy to sell his life dearly as he stood there suavely unconscious she very nearly screamed out to him  fly percytis your deadly enemyfly before it be too late  but she had not time even to do that for the next moment blakeney quietly walked to the table and jovially clapped the cure on the back said in his own drawly affected way  oddss fish    er    m chauvelin    i vow i never thought of meeting you here  chauvelin who had been in the very act of conveying soup to his mouth fairly choked his thin face became absolutely purple and a violent fit of coughing saved this cunning representative of france from betraying the most boundless surprise he had ever experienced there was no doubt that this bold move on the part of the enemy had been wholly unexpected as far as he was concerned and the daring impudence of it completely nonplussed him for the moment  obviously he had not taken the precaution of having the inn surrounded with soldiers blakeney had evidently guessed that much and no doubt his resourceful brain had already formed some plan by which he could turn this unexpected interview to account  marguerite up in the loft had not moved she had made a solemn promise to sir andrew not to speak to her husband before strangers and she had sufficient selfcontrol not to throw herself unreasoningly and impulsively across his plans to sit still and watch these two men together was a terrible trial of fortitude marguerite had heard chauvelin give the orders for the patrolling of all the roads she knew that if percy now left the chat grisin whatever direction he happened to gohe could not go far without being sighted by some of captain jutleys men on patrol on the other hand if he stayed then desgas would have time to come back with the dozen men chauvelin had specially ordered  the trap was closing in and marguerite could do nothing but watch and wonder the two men looked such a strange contrast and of the two it was chauvelin who exhibited a slight touch of fear marguerite knew him well enough to guess what was passing in his mind he had no fear for his own person although he certainly was alone in a lonely inn with a man who was powerfully built and who was daring and reckless beyond the bounds of probability she knew that chauvelin would willingly have braved perilous encounters for the sake of the cause he had at heart but what he did fear was that this impudent englishman would by knocking him down double his own chances of escape his underlings might not succeed so well in capturing the scarlet pimpernel when not directed by the cunning hand and the shrewd brain which had deadly hate for an incentive  evidently however the representative of the french government had nothing to fear for the moment at the hands of his powerful adversary blakeney with his most inane laugh and pleasant goodnature was solemnly patting him on the back  i am so demmed sorry    he was saying cheerfully so very sorry    i seem to have upset you    eating soup too    nasty awkward thing soup    er    begada friend of mine died once    er    choked    just like you    with a spoonful of soup  and he smiled shyly goodhumouredly down at chauvelin  odds life he continued as soon as the latter had somewhat recovered himself beastly hole this    aint it now la you dont mind he added apologetically as he sat down on a chair close to the table and drew the soup tureen towards him that fool brogard seems to be asleep or something  there was a second plate on the table and he calmly helped himself to soup then poured himself out a glass of wine  for a moment marguerite wondered what chauvelin would do his disguise was so good that perhaps he meant on recovering himself to deny his identity but chauvelin was too astute to make such an obviously false and childish move and already he too had stretched out his hand and said pleasantly  i am indeed charmed to see you sir percy you must excuse mehmi thought you the other side of the channel sudden surprise almost took my breath away  la said sir percy with a goodhumoured grin it did that quite didnt itermerchaubertin  pardon mechauvelin  i beg pardona thousand times yeschauvelin of course    er    i never could cotton to foreign names     he was calmly eating his soup laughing with pleasant goodhumour as if he had come all the way to calais for the express purpose of enjoying supper at this filthy inn in the company of his archenemy  for the moment marguerite wondered why percy did not knock the little frenchman down then and thereand no doubt something of the sort must have darted through his mind for every now and then his lazy eyes seemed to flash ominously as they rested on the slight figure of chauvelin who had now quite recovered himself and was also calmly eating his soup  but the keen brain which had planned and carried through so many daring plots was too farseeing to take unnecessary risks this place after all might be infested with spies the innkeeper might be in chauvelins pay one call on chauvelins part might bring twenty men about blakeneys ears for aught he knew and he might be caught and trapped before he could help or at least warn the fugitives this he would not risk he meant to help the others to get them safely away for he had pledged his word to them and his word he would keep and whilst he ate and chatted he thought and planned whilst up in the loft the poor anxious woman racked her brain as to what she should do and endured agonies of longing to rush down to him yet not daring to move for fear of upsetting his plans  i didnt know blakeney was saying jovially that you    er    were in holy orders  i    er    hem    stammered chauvelin the calm impudence of his antagonist had evidently thrown him off his usual balance  but la i should have known you anywhere continued sir percy placidly as he poured himself out another glass of wine although the wig and hat have changed you a bit  do you think so  lud they alter a man so    but    begad i hope you dont mind my having made the remark    demmed bad form making remarks    i hope you dont mind  no no not at allhem i hope lady blakeney is well said chauvelin hurriedly changing the topic of conversation  blakeney with much deliberation finished his plate of soup drank his glass of wine and momentarily it seemed to marguerite as if he glanced all round the room quite well thank you he said at last drily there was a pause during which marguerite could watch these two antagonists who evidently in their minds were measuring themselves against one another she could see percy almost full face where he sat at the table not ten yards from where she herself was crouching puzzled not knowing what to do or what she should think she had quite controlled her impulse now of rushing down and disclosing herself to her husband a man capable of acting a part in the way he was doing at the present moment did not need a womans word to warn him to be cautious  marguerite indulged in the luxury dear to every tender womans heart of looking at the man she loved she looked through the tattered curtain across at the handsome face of her husband in whose lazy blue eyes and behind whose inane smile she could now so plainly see the strength energy and resourcefulness which had caused the scarlet pimpernel to be reverenced and trusted by his followers there are nineteen of us ready to lay down our lives for your husband lady blakeney sir andrew had said to her and as she looked at the forehead low but square and broad the eyes blue yet deepset and intense the whole aspect of the man of indomitable energy hiding behind a perfectly acted comedy his almost superhuman strength of will and marvellous ingenuity she understood the fascination which he exercised over his followers for had he not also cast his spells over her heart and her imagination  chauvelin who was trying to conceal his impatience beneath his usual urbane manner took a quick look at his watch desgas should not be long another two or three minutes and this impudent englishman would be secure in the keeping of half a dozen of captain jutleys most trusted men  you are on your way to paris sir percy he asked carelessly  odds life no replied blakeney with a laugh only as far as lillenot paris for me    beastly uncomfortable place paris just now    eh monsieur chaubertin    beg pardon    chauvelin  not for an english gentleman like yourself sir percy rejoined chauvelin sarcastically who takes no interest in the conflict that is raging there  la you see its no business of mine and our demmed government is all on your side of the business old pitt darent say bo to a goose you are in a hurry sir he added as chauvelin once again took out his watch an appointment perhaps    i pray you take no heed of me    my times my own  he rose from the table and dragged a chair to the hearth once more marguerite was terribly tempted to go to him for time was getting on desgas might be back at any moment with his men percy did not know that and    oh how horrible it all wasand how helpless she felt  i am in no hurry continued percy pleasantly but la i dont want to spend any more time than i can help in this godforsaken hole but begad sir he added as chauvelin had surreptitiously looked at his watch for the third time that watch of yours wont go any faster for all the looking you give it you are expecting a friend maybe  ayea friend  not a ladyi trust monsieur labbe laughed blakeney surely the holy church does not allow    eh    what but i say come by the fire    its getting demmed cold  he kicked the fire with the heel of his boot making the logs blaze in the old hearth he seemed in no hurry to go and apparently was quite unconscious of his immediate danger he dragged another chair to the fire and chauvelin whose impatience was by now quite beyond control sat down beside the hearth in such a way as to command a view of the door desgas had been gone nearly a quarter of an hour it was quite plain to marguerites aching senses that as soon as he arrived chauvelin would abandon all his other plans with regard to the fugitives and capture this impudent scarlet pimpernel at once  hey m chauvelin the latter was saying airily tell me i pray you is your friend pretty demmed smart these little french women sometimeswhat but i protest i need not ask he added as he carelessly strode back towards the suppertable in matters of taste the church has never been backward    eh  but chauvelin was not listening his every faculty was now concentrated on that door through which presently desgas would enter marguerites thoughts too were centered there for her ears had suddenly caught through the stillness of the night the sound of numerous and measured treads some distance away  it was desgas and his men another three minutes and they would be here another three minutes and the awful thing would have occurred the brave eagle would have fallen in the ferrets trap she would have moved now and screamed but she dared not for whilst she heard the soldiers approaching she was looking at percy and watching his every movement he was standing by the table whereon the remnants of the supper plates glasses spoons salt and pepperpots were scattered pellmell his back was turned to chauvelin and he was still prattling along in his own affected and inane way but from his pocket he had taken his snuffbox and quickly and suddenly he emptied the contents of the pepperpot into it  then he again turned with an inane laugh to chauvelin  eh did you speak sir  chauvelin had been too intent on listening to the sound of those approaching footsteps to notice what his cunning adversary had been doing he now pulled himself together trying to look unconcerned in the very midst of his anticipated triumph no he said presently that isas you were saying sir percy  i was saying said blakeney going up to chauvelin by the fire that the jew in piccadilly has sold me better snuff this time than i have ever tasted will you honour me monsieur labbe  he stood close to chauvelin in his own careless debonnaire way holding out his snuffbox to his archenemy  chauvelin who as he told marguerite once had seen a trick or two in his day had never dreamed of this one with one ear fixed on those fastapproaching footsteps one eye turned to that door where desgas and his men would presently appear lulled into false security by the impudent englishmans airy manner he never even remotely guessed the trick which was being played upon him  he took a pinch of snuff  only he who has ever by accident sniffed vigorously a dose of pepper can have the faintest conception of the hopeless condition in which such a sniff would reduce any human being  chauvelin felt as if his head would burstsneeze after sneeze seemed nearly to choke him he was blind deaf and dumb for the moment and during that moment blakeney quietly without the slightest haste took up his hat took some money out of his pocket which he left on the table then calmly stalked out of the room     chapter xxvi the jew    it took marguerite some time to collect her scattered senses the whole of this last short episode had taken place in less than a minute and desgas and the soldiers were still about two hundred yards away from the chat gris  when she realised what had happened a curious mixture of joy and wonder filled her heart it all was so neat so ingenious chauvelin was still absolutely helpless far more so than he could even have been under a blow from the fist for now he could neither see nor hear nor speak whilst his cunning adversary had quietly slipped through his fingers  blakeney was gone obviously to try and join the fugitives at the pere blanchards hut for the moment true chauvelin was helpless for the moment the daring scarlet pimpernel had not been caught by desgas and his men but all the roads and the beach were patrolled every place was watched and every stranger kept in sight how far could percy go thus arrayed in his gorgeous clothes without being sighted and followed now she blamed herself terribly for not having gone down to him sooner and given him that word of warning and of love which perhaps after all he needed he could not know of the orders which chauvelin had given for his capture and even now perhaps     but before all these horrible thoughts had taken concrete form in her brain she heard the grounding of arms outside close to the door and desgas voice shouting halt to his men  chauvelin had partially recovered his sneezing had become less violent and he had struggled to his feet he managed to reach the door just as desgas knock was heard on the outside  chauvelin threw open the door and before his secretary could say a word he had managed to stammer between two sneezes  the tall strangerquickdid any of you see him  where citoyen asked desgas in surprise  here man through that door not five minutes ago  we saw nothing citoyen the moon is not yet up and     and you are just five minutes too late my friend said chauvelin with concentrated fury  citoyen    i     you did what i ordered you to do said chauvelin with impatience i know that but you were a precious long time about it fortunately theres not much harm done or it had fared ill with you citoyen desgas  desgas turned a little pale there was so much rage and hatred in his superiors whole attitude  the tall stranger citoyen he stammered  was here in this room five minutes ago having supper at that table damn his impudence for obvious reasons i dared not tackle him alone brogard is too big a fool and that cursed englishman appears to have the strength of a bullock and so he slipped away under your very nose  he cannot go far without being sighted citoyen  ah  captain jutley sent forty men as reinforcements for the patrol duty twenty went down to the beach he again assured me that the watch had been constant all day and that no stranger could possibly get to the beach or reach a boat without being sighted  thats gooddo the men know their work they have had very clear orders citoyen and i myself spoke to those who were about to start they are to shadowas secretly as possibleany stranger they may see especially if he be tall or stoop as if he would disguise his height  in no case to detain such a person of course said chauvelin eagerly that impudent scarlet pimpernel would slip through clumsy fingers we must let him get to the pere blanchards hut now there surround and capture him  the men understand that citoyen and also that as soon as a tall stranger has been sighted he must be shadowed whilst one man is to turn straight back and report to you  that is right said chauvelin rubbing his hands well pleased  i have further news for you citoyen  what is it  a tall englishman had a long conversation about threequarters of an hour ago with a jew reuben by name who lives not ten paces from here  yesand queried chauvelin impatiently  the conversation was all about a horse and cart which the tall englishman wished to hire and which was to have been ready for him by eleven oclock  it is past that now where does that reuben live  a few minutes walk from this door  send one of the men to find out if the stranger has driven off in reubens cart  yes citoyen  desgas went to give the necessary orders to one of the men not a word of this conversation between him and chauvelin had escaped marguerite and every word they had spoken seemed to strike at her heart with terrible hopelessness and dark foreboding  she had come all this way and with such high hopes and firm determination to help her husband and so far she had been able to do nothing but to watch with a heart breaking with anguish the meshes of the deadly net closing round the daring scarlet pimpernel  he could not now advance many steps without spying eyes to track and denounce him her own helplessness struck her with the terrible sense of utter disappointment the possibility of being the slightest use to her husband had become almost nil and her only hope rested in being allowed to share his fate whatever it might ultimately be  for the moment even her chance of ever seeing the man she loved again had become a remote one still she was determined to keep a close watch over his enemy and a vague hope filled her heart that whilst she kept chauvelin in sight percys fate might still be hanging in the balance  desgas left chauvelin moodily pacing up and down the room whilst he himself waited outside for the return of the man whom he had sent in search of reuben thus several minutes went by chauvelin was evidently devoured with impatience apparently he trusted no one this last trick played upon him by the daring scarlet pimpernel had made him suddenly doubtful of success unless he himself was there to watch direct and superintend the capture of this impudent englishman  about five minutes later desgas returned followed by an elderly jew in a dirty threadbare gaberdine worn greasy across the shoulders his red hair which he wore after the fashion of the polish jews with the corkscrew curls each side of his face was plentifully sprinkled with greya general coating of grime about his cheeks and his chin gave him a peculiarly dirty and loathsome appearance he had the habitual stoop those of his race affected in mock humility in past centuries before the dawn of equality and freedom in matters of faith and he walked behind desgas with the peculiar shuffling gait which has remained the characteristic of the jew trader in continental europe to this day  chauvelin who had all the frenchmans prejudice against the despised race motioned to the fellow to keep at a respectful distance the group of the three men were standing just underneath the hanging oillamp and marguerite had a clear view of them all  is this the man asked chauvelin  no citoyen replied desgas reuben could not be found so presumably his cart has gone with the stranger but this man here seems to know something which he is willing to sell for a consideration  ah said chauvelin turning away with disgust from the loathsome specimen of humanity before him  the jew with characteristic patience stood humbly on one side leaning on the knotted staff his greasy broadbrimmed hat casting a deep shadow over his grimy face waiting for the noble excellency to deign to put some questions to him  the citoyen tells me said chauvelin peremptorily to him that you know something of my friend the tall englishman whom i desire to meet    morbleu keep your distance man he added hurriedly as the jew took a quick and eager step forward  yes your excellency replied the jew who spoke the language with that peculiar lisp which denotes eastern origin i and reuben goldstein met a tall englishman on the road close by here this evening  did you speak to him  he spoke to us your excellency he wanted to know if he could hire a horse and cart to go down along the st martin road to a place he wanted to reach tonight  what did you say  i did not say anything said the jew in an injured tone reuben goldstein that accursed traitor that son of belial     cut that short man interrupted chauvelin roughly and go on with your story  he took the words out of my mouth your excellency when i was about to offer the wealthy englishman my horse and cart to take him wheresoever he chose reuben had already spoken and offered his halfstarved nag and his brokendown cart  and what did the englishman do  he listened to reuben goldstein your excellency and put his hand in his pocket then and there and took out a handful of gold which he showed to that descendant of beelzebub telling him that all that would be his if the horse and cart were ready for him by eleven oclock  and of course the horse and cart were ready  well they were ready for him in a manner so to speak your excellency reubens nag was lame as usual she refused to budge at first it was only after a time and with plenty of kicks that she at last could be made to move said the jew with a malicious chuckle  then they started  yes they started about five minutes ago i was disgusted with that strangers folly an englishman toohe ought to have known reubens nag was not fit to drive  but if he had no choice  no choice your excellency protested the jew in a rasping voice did i not repeat to him a dozen times that my horse and cart would take him quicker and more comfortably than reubens bag of bones he would not listen reuben is such a liar and has such insinuating ways the stranger was deceived if he was in a hurry he would have had better value for his money by taking my cart  you have a horse and cart too then asked chauvelin peremptorily  aye that i have your excellency and if your excellency wants to drive     do you happen to know which way my friend went in reuben goldsteins cart  thoughtfully the jew rubbed his dirty chin marguerites heart was beating wellnigh to bursting she had heard the peremptory question she looked anxiously at the jew but could not read his face beneath the shadow of his broadbrimmed hat vaguely she felt somehow as if he held percys fate in his long dirty hands  there was a long pause whilst chauvelin frowned impatiently at the stooping figure before him at last the jew slowly put his hand in his breast pocket and drew out from its capacious depths a number of silver coins he gazed at them thoughtfully then remarked in a quiet tone of voice  this is what the tall stranger gave me when he drove away with reuben for holding my tongue about him and his doings  chauvelin shrugged his shoulders impatiently  how much is there there he asked  twenty francs your excellency replied the jew and i have been an honest man all my life  chauvelin without further comment took a few pieces of gold out of his own pocket and leaving them in the palm of his hand he allowed them to jingle as he held them out towards the jew  how many gold pieces are there in the palm of my hand he asked quietly  evidently he had no desire to terrorize the man but to conciliate him for his own purposes for his manner was pleasant and suave no doubt he feared that threats of the guillotine and various other persuasive methods of that type might addle the old mans brains and that he would be more likely to be useful through greed of gain than through terror of death  the eyes of the jew shot a quick keen glance at the gold in his interlocutors hand  at least five i should say your excellency he replied obsequiously  enough do you think to loosen that honest tongue of yours  what does your excellency wish to know  whether your horse and cart can take me to where i can find my friend the tall stranger who has driven off in reuben goldsteins cart  my horse and cart can take your honour there where you please  to a place called the pere blanchards hut  your honour has guessed said the jew in astonishment  you know the place which road leads to it  the st martin road your honour then a footpath from there to the cliffs  you know the road repeated chauvelin roughly  every stone every blade of grass your honour replied the jew quietly  chauvelin without another word threw the five pieces of gold one by one before the jew who knelt down and on his hands and knees struggled to collect them one rolled away and he had some trouble to get it for it had lodged underneath the dresser chauvelin quietly waited while the old man scrambled on the floor to find the piece of gold  when the jew was again on his feet chauvelin said  how soon can your horse and cart be ready  they are ready now your honour  where  not ten meters from this door will your excellency deign to look  i dont want to see it how far can you drive me in it  as far as the pere blanchards hut your honour and further than reubens nag took your friend i am sure that not two leagues from here we shall come across that wily reuben his nag his cart and the tall stranger all in a heap in the middle of the road  how far is the nearest village from here  on the road which the englishman took miquelon is the nearest village not two leagues from here  there he could get fresh conveyance if he wanted to go further  he couldif he ever got so far  can you  will your excellency try said the jew simply  that is my intention said chauvelin very quietly but remember if you have deceived me i shall tell off two of my most stalwart soldiers to give you such a beating that your breath will perhaps leave your ugly body for ever but if we find my friend the tall englishman either on the road or at the pere blanchards hut there will be ten more gold pieces for you do you accept the bargain  the jew again thoughtfully rubbed his chin he looked at the money in his hand then at this stern interlocutor and at desgas who had stood silently behind him all this while after a moments pause he said deliberately  i accept  go and wait outside then said chauvelin and remember to stick to your bargain or by heaven i will keep to mine  with a final most abject and cringing bow the old jew shuffled out of the room chauvelin seemed pleased with his interview for he rubbed his hands together with that usual gesture of his of malignant satisfaction  my coat and boots he said to desgas at last  desgas went to the door and apparently gave the necessary orders for presently a soldier entered carrying chauvelins coat boots and hat  he took off his soutane beneath which he was wearing closefitting breeches and a cloth waistcoat and began changing his attire  you citoyen in the meanwhile he said to desgas go back to captain jutley as fast as you can and tell him to let you have another dozen men and bring them with you along the st martin road where i daresay you will soon overtake the jews cart with myself in it there will be hot work presently if i mistake not in the pere blanchards hut we shall corner our game there ill warrant for this impudent scarlet pimpernel has had the audacityor the stupidity i hardly know whichto adhere to his original plans he has gone to meet de tournay st just and the other traitors which for the moment i thought perhaps he did not intend to do when we find them there will be a band of desperate men at bay some of our men will i presume be put hors de combat these royalists are good swordsmen and the englishman is devilish cunning and looks very powerful still we shall be five against one at least you can follow the cart closely with your men all along the st martin road through miquelon the englishman is ahead of us and not likely to look behind him  whilst he gave these curt and concise orders he had completed his change of attire the priests costume had been laid aside and he was once more dressed in his usual dark tightfitting clothes at last he took up his hat  i shall have an interesting prisoner to deliver into your hands he said with a chuckle as with unwonted familiarity he took desgas arm and led him towards the door we wont kill him outright eh friend desgas the pere blanchards hut isan i mistake nota lonely spot upon the beach and our men will enjoy a bit of rough sport there with the wounded fox choose your men well friend desgas    of the sort who would enjoy that type of sporteh we must see that scarlet pimpernel wither a bitwhatshrink and tremble eh    before we finally    he made an expressive gesture whilst he laughed a low evil laugh which filled marguerites soul with sickening horror  choose your men well citoyen desgas he said once more as he led his secretary finally out of the room     chapter xxvii on the track    never for a moment did marguerite blakeney hesitate the last sounds outside the chat gris had died away in the night she had heard desgas giving orders to his men and then starting off towards the fort to get a reinforcement of a dozen more men six were not thought sufficient to capture the cunning englishman whose resourceful brain was even more dangerous than his valour and his strength  then a few minutes later she heard the jews husky voice again evidently shouting to his nag then the rumble of wheels and noise of a rickety cart bumping over the rough road  inside the inn everything was still brogard and his wife terrified of chauvelin had given no sign of life they hoped to be forgotten and at any rate to remain unperceived marguerite could not even hear their usual volleys of muttered oaths  she waited a moment or two longer then she quietly slipped down the broken stairs wrapped her dark cloak closely round her and slipped out of the inn  the night was fairly dark sufficiently so at any rate to hide her dark figure from view whilst her keen ears kept count of the sound of the cart going on ahead she hoped by keeping well within the shadow of the ditches which lined the road that she would not be seen by desgas men when they approached or by the patrols which she concluded were still on duty  thus she started to do this the last stage of her weary journey alone at night and on foot nearly three leagues to miquelon and then on to the pere blanchards hut wherever that fatal spot might be probably over rough roads she cared not  the jews nag could not get on very fast and though she was wary with mental fatigue and nerve strain she knew that she could easily keep up with it on a hilly road where the poor beast who was sure to be halfstarved would have to be allowed long and frequent rests the road lay some distance from the sea bordered on either side by shrubs and stunted trees sparsely covered with meagre foliage all turning away from the north with their branches looking in the semidarkness like stiff ghostly hair blown by a perpetual wind  fortunately the moon showed no desire to peep between the clouds and marguerite hugging the edge of the road and keeping close to the low line of shrubs was fairly safe from view everything around her was so still only from far very far away there came like a long soft moan the sound of the distant sea  the air was keen and full of brine after that enforced period of inactivity inside the evilsmelling squalid inn marguerite would have enjoyed the sweet scent of this autumnal night and the distant melancholy rumble of the autumnal night and the distant melancholy rumble of the waves she would have revelled in the calm and stillness of this lonely spot a calm broken only at intervals by the strident and mournful cry of some distant gull and by the creaking of the wheels some way down the road she would have loved the cool atmosphere the peaceful immensity of nature in this lonely part of the coast but her heart was too full of cruel foreboding of a great ache and longing for a being who had become infinitely dear to her  her feet slipped on the grassy bank for she thought it safest not to walk near the centre of the road and she found it difficult to keep up a sharp pace along the muddy incline she even thought it best not to keep too near to the cart everything was so still that the rumble of the wheels could not fail to be a safe guide  the loneliness was absolute already the few dim lights of calais lay far behind and on this road there was not a sign of human habitation not even the hut of a fisherman or of a woodcutter anywhere near far away on her right was the edge of the cliff below it the rough beach against which the incoming tide was dashing itself with its constant distant murmur and ahead the rumble of the wheels bearing an implacable enemy to his triumph  marguerite wondered at what particular spot on this lonely coast percy could be at this moment not very far surely for he had had less than a quarter of an hours start of chauvelin she wondered if he knew that in this cool oceanscented bit of france there lurked many spies all eager to sight his tall figure to track him to where his unsuspecting friends waited for him and then to close the net over him and them  chauvelin on ahead jolted and jostled in the jews vehicle was nursing comfortable thoughts he rubbed his hands together with content as he thought of the web which he had woven and through which that ubiquitous and daring englishman could not hope to escape as the time went on and the old jew drove him leisurely but surely along the dark road he felt more and more eager for the grand finale of this exciting chase after the mysterious scarlet pimpernel the capture of the audacious plotter would be the finest leaf in citoyen chauvelins wreath of glory caught redhanded on the spot in the very act of aiding and abetting the traitors against the republic of france the englishman could claim no protection from his own country chauvelin had in any case fully made up his mind that all intervention should come too late  never for a moment did the slightest remorse enter his heart as to the terrible position in which he had placed the unfortunate wife who had unconsciously betrayed her husband as a matter of fact chauvelin had ceased even to think of her she had been a useful tool that was all  the jews lean nag did little more than walk she was going along at a slow jog trot and her driver had to give her long and frequent halts  are we a long way yet from miquelon asked chauvelin from time to time  not very far your honour was the uniform placid reply  we have not yet come across your friend and mine lying in a heap in the roadway was chauvelins sarcastic comment  patience noble excellency rejoined the son of moses they are ahead of us i can see the imprint of the cart wheels driven by that traitor that son of the amalekite  you are sure of the road  as sure as i am of the presence of those ten gold pieces in the noble excellencys pockets which i trust will presently be mine  as soon as i have shaken hands with my friend the tall stranger they will certainly be yours  hark what was that said the jew suddenly  through the stillness which had been absolute there could now be heard distinctly the sound of horses hoofs on the muddy road  they are soldiers he added in an awed whisper  stop a moment i want to hear said chauvelin  marguerite had also heard the sound of galloping hoofs coming towards the cart and towards herself for some time she had been on the alert thinking that desgas and his squad would soon overtake them but these came from the opposite direction presumably from miquelon the darkness lent her sufficient cover she had perceived that the cart had stopped and with utmost caution treading noiselessly on the soft road she crept a little nearer  her heart was beating fast she was trembling in every limb already she had guessed what news these mounted men would bring every stranger on these roads or on the beach must be shadowed especially if he be tall or stoops as if he would disguise his height when sighted a mounted messenger must at once ride back and report those had been chauvelins orders had then the tall stranger been sighted and was this the mounted messenger come to bring the great news that the hunted hare had run its head into the noose at last  marguerite realizing that the cart had come to a standstill managed to slip nearer to it in the darkness she crept close up hoping to get within earshot to hear what the messenger had to say  she heard the quick words of challenge  liberte fraternite egalite then chauvelins quick query  what news  two men on horseback had halted beside the vehicle  marguerite could see them silhouetted against the midnight sky she could hear their voices and the snorting of their horses and now behind her some little distance off the regular and measured tread of a body of advancing men desgas and his soldiers  there had been a long pause during which no doubt chauvelin satisfied the men as to his identity for presently questions and answers followed each other in quick succession  you have seen the stranger asked chauvelin eagerly  no citoyen we have seen no tall stranger we came by the edge of the cliff  then  less than a quarter of a league beyond miquelon we came across a rough construction of wood which looked like the hut of a fisherman where he might keep his tools and nets when we first sighted it it seemed to be empty and at first we thought that there was nothing suspicious about until we saw some smoke issuing through an aperture at the side i dismounted and crept close to it it was then empty but in one corner of the hut there was a charcoal fire and a couple of stools were also in the hut i consulted with my comrades and we decided that they should take cover with the horses well out of sight and that i should remain on the watch which i did  well and did you see anything  about half an hour later i heard voices citoyen and presently two men came along towards the edge of the cliff they seemed to me to have come from the lille road one was young the other quite old they were talking in a whisper to one another and i could not hear what they said one was young and the other quite old marguerites aching heart almost stopped beating as she listened was the young one armandher brotherand the old one de tournaywere they the two fugitives who unconsciously were used as a decoy to entrap their fearless and noble rescuer  the two men presently went into the hut continued the soldier whilst marguerites aching nerves seemed to catch the sound of chauvelins triumphant chuckle and i crept nearer to it then the hut is very roughly built and i caught snatches of their conversation  yesquickwhat did you hear  the old man asked the young one if he were sure that was right place oh yes he replied tis the place sure enough and by the light of the charcoal fire he showed to his companion a paper which he carried here is the plan he said which he gave me before i left london we were to adhere strictly to that plan unless i had contrary orders and i have had none here is the road we followed see    here the fork    here we cut across the st martin road    and here is the footpath which brought us to the edge of the cliff i must have made a slight noise then for the young man came to the door of the hut and peered anxiously all round him when he again joined his companion they whispered so low that i could no longer hear them  welland asked chauvelin impatiently  there were six of us altogether patrolling that part of the beach so we consulted together and thought it best that four should remain behind and keep the hut in sight and i and my comrade rode back at once to make report of what we had seen  you saw nothing of the tall stranger  nothing citoyen  if your comrades see him what would they do  not lose sight of him for a moment and if he showed signs of escape or any boat came in sight they would close in on him and if necessary they would shoot the firing would bring the rest of the patrol to the spot in any case they would not let the stranger go  aye but i did not want the stranger hurtnot just yet murmured chauvelin savagely but there youve done your best the fates grant that i may not be too late     we met half a dozen men just now who have been patrolling this road for several hours  well  they have seen no stranger either yet he is on ahead somewhere in a cart or else    here there is not a moment to lose how far is that hut from here  about a couple of leagues citoyen  you can find it againat oncewithout hesitation  i have absolutely no doubt citoyen  the footpath to the edge of the cliffeven in the dark  it is not a dark night citoyen and i know i can find my way repeated the soldier firmly  fall in behind then let your comrade take both your horses back to calais you wont want them keep beside the cart and direct the jew to drive straight ahead then stop him within a quarter of a league of the footpath see that he takes the most direct road  whilst chauvelin spoke desgas and his men were fast approaching and marguerite could hear their footsteps within a hundred yards behind her now she thought it unsafe to stay where she was and unnecessary too as she had heard enough she seemed suddenly to have lost all faculty even for suffering her heart her nerves her brain seemed to have become numb after all these hours of ceaseless anguish culminating in this awful despair  for now there was absolutely not the faintest hope within two short leagues of this spot the fugitives were waiting for their brave deliverer he was on his way somewhere on this lonely road and presently he would join them then the welllaid trap would close two dozen men led by one whose hatred was as deadly as his cunning was malicious would close round the small band of fugitives and their daring leader they would all be captured armand according to chauvelins pledged word would be restored to her but her husband percy whom with every breath she drew she seemed to love and worship more and more he would fall into the hands of a remorseless enemy who had no pity for a brave heart no admiration for the courage of a noble soul who would show nothing but hatred for the cunning antagonist who had baffled him so long  she heard the soldier giving a few brief directions to the jew then she retired quickly to the edge of the road and cowered behind some low shrubs whilst desgas and his men came up  all fell in noiselessly behind the cart and slowly they all started down the dark road marguerite waited until she reckoned that they were well outside the range of earshot then she too in the darkness which suddenly seemed to have become more intense crept noiselessly along     chapter xxviii the pere blanchards hut    as in a dream marguerite followed on the web was drawing more and more tightly every moment round the beloved life which had become dearer than all to see her husband once again to tell him how she had suffered how much she had wronged and how little understood him had become now her only aim she had abandoned all hope of saving him she saw him gradually hemmed in on all sides and in despair she gazed round her into the darkness and wondered whence he would presently come to fall into the deathtrap which his relentless enemy had prepared for him  the distant roar of the waves now made her shudder the occasional dismal cry of an owl or a seagull filled her with unspeakable horror she thought of the ravenous beastsin human shapewho lay in wait for their prey and destroyed them as mercilessly as any hungry wolf for the satisfaction of their own appetite of hate marguerite was not afraid of the darkness she only feared that man on ahead who was sitting at the bottom of a rough wooden cart nursing thoughts of vengeance which would have made the very demons in hell chuckle with delight  her feet were sore her knees shook under her from sheer bodily fatigue for days now she had lived in a wild turmoil of excitement she had not had a quiet rest for three nights now she had walked on a slippery road for nearly two hours and yet her determination never swerved for a moment she would see her husband tell him all and if he was ready to forgive the crime which she had committed in her blind ignorance she would yet have the happiness of dying by his side  she must have walked on almost in a trance instinct alone keeping her up and guiding her in the wake of the enemy when suddenly her ears attuned to the slightest sound by that same blind instinct told her that the cart had stopped and that the soldiers had halted they had come to their destination no doubt on the right somewhere close ahead was the footpath that led to the edge of the cliff and to the hut  heedless of any risks she crept up quite close up to where chauvelin stood surrounded by his little troop he had descended from the cart and was giving some orders to the men these she wanted to hear what little chance she yet had of being useful to percy consisted in hearing absolutely every word of his enemys plans  the spot where all the party had halted must have lain some eight hundred meters from the coast the sound of the sea came only very faintly as from a distance chauvelin and desgas followed by the soldiers had turned off sharply to the right of the road apparently on to the footpath which led to the cliffs the jew had remained on the road with his cart and nag  marguerite with infinite caution and literally crawling on her hands and knees had also turned off to the right to accomplish this she had to creep through the rough low shrubs trying to make as little noise as possible as she went along tearing her face and hands against the dry twigs intent only upon hearing without being seen or heard fortunatelyas is usual in this part of francethe footpath was bordered by a low rough hedge beyond which was a dry ditch filled with coarse grass in this marguerite managed to find shelter she was quite hidden from view yet could contrive to get within three yards of where chauvelin stood giving orders to his men  now he was saying in a low and peremptory whisper where is the pere blanchards hut  about eight hundred meters from here along the footpath said the soldier who had lately been directing the party and halfway down the cliff  very good you shall lead us before we begin to descend the cliff you shall creep down to the hut as noiselessly as possible and ascertain if the traitor royalists are there do you understand  i understand citoyen  now listen very attentively all of you continued chauvelin impressively and addressing the soldiers collectively for after this we may not be able to exchange another word so remember every syllable i utter as if your very lives depended on your memory perhaps they do he added drily  we listen citoyen said desgas and a soldier of the republic never forgets an order  you who have crept up to the hut will try to peep inside if an englishman is there with those traitors a man who is tall above the average or who stoops as if he would disguise his height then give a sharp quick whistle as a signal to your comrades all of you he added once more speaking to the soldiers collectively then quickly surround and rush into the hut and each seize one of the men there before they have time to draw their firearms if any of them struggle shoot at their legs or arms but on no account kill the tall man do you understand  we understand citoyen  the man who is tall above the average is probably also strong above the average it will take four or five of you at least to overpower him  there was a little pause then chauvelin continued  if the royalist traitors are still alone which is more than likely to be the case then warn your comrades who are lying in wait there and all of you creep and take cover behind the rocks and boulders round the hut and wait there in dead silence until the tall englishman arrives then only rush the hut when he is safely within its doors but remember that you must be as silent as the wolf is at night when he prowls around the pens i do not wish those royalists to be on the alertthe firing of a pistol a shriek or call on their part would be sufficient perhaps to warn the tall personage to keep clear of the cliffs and of the hut and he added emphatically it is the tall englishman whom it is your duty to capture tonight  you shall be implicitly obeyed citoyen  then get along as noiselessly as possible and i will follow you  what about the jew citoyen asked desgas as silently like noiseless shadows one by one the soldiers began to creep along the rough and narrow footpath  ah yes i had forgotten about the jew said chauvelin and turning towards the jew he called him peremptorily  here you    aaron moses abraham or whatever your confounded name may be he said to the old man who had quietly stood beside his lean nag as far away from the soldiers as possible  benjamin rosenbaum so it please your honour he replied humbly  it does not please me to hear your voice but it does please me to give you certain orders which you will find it wise to obey  so it please your honour     hold your confounded tongue you shall stay here do you hear with your horse and cart until our return you are on no account to utter the faintest sound or to even breathe louder than you can help nor are you on any consideration whatever to leave your post until i give you orders to do so do you understand  but your honour protested the jew pitiably  there is no question of but or of any argument said chauvelin in a tone that made the timid old man tremble from head to foot if when i return i do not find you here i most solemnly assure you that wherever you may try to hide yourself i can find you and that punishment swift sure and terrible will sooner or later overtake you do you hear me  but your excellency     i said do you hear me  the soldiers had all crept away the three men stood alone together in the dark and lonely road with marguerite there behind the hedge listening to chauvelins orders as she would to her own death sentence  i heard your honour protested the jew again while he tried to draw nearer to chauvelin and i swear by abraham isaac and jacob that i would obey your honour most absolutely and that i would not move from this place until your honour once more deigned to shed the light of your countenance upon your humble servant but remember your honour i am a poor man my nerves are not as strong as those of a young soldier if midnight marauders should come prowling round this lonely road i might scream or run in my fright and is my life to be forfeit is some terrible punishment to come on my poor old head for that which i cannot help  the jew seemed in real distress he was shaking from head to foot clearly he was not the man to be left by himself on this lonely road the man spoke truly he might unwittingly in sheer terror utter the shriek that might prove a warning to the wily scarlet pimpernel  chauvelin reflected for a moment  will your horse and cart be safe alone here do you think he asked roughly  i fancy citoyen here interposed desgas that they will be safer without that dirty cowardly jew than with him there seems no doubt that if he gets scared he will either make a bolt of it or shriek his head off  but what am i to do with the brute  will you send him back to calais citoyen  no for we shall want him to drive back the wounded presently said chauvelin with grim significance  there was a pause againdesgas waiting for the decision of his chief and the old jew whining beside his nag  well you lazy lumbering old coward said chauvelin at last you had better shuffle along behind us here citoyen desgas tie this handkerchief tightly round the fellows mouth  chauvelin handed a scarf to desgas who solemnly began winding it round the jews mouth meekly benjamin rosenbaum allowed himself to be gagged he evidently preferred this uncomfortable state to that of being left alone on the dark st martin road then the three men fell in line  quick said chauvelin impatiently we have already wasted much valuable time  and the firm footsteps of chauvelin and desgas the shuffling gait of the old jew soon died away along the footpath  marguerite had not lost a single one of chauvelins words of command her every nerve was strained to completely grasp the situation first then to make a final appeal to those wits which had so often been called the sharpest in europe and which alone might be of service now  certainly the situation was desperate enough a tiny band of unsuspecting men quietly awaiting the arrival of their rescuer who was equally unconscious of the trap laid for them all it seemed so horrible this net as it were drawn in a circle at dead of night on a lonely beach round a few defenceless men defenceless because they were tricked and unsuspecting of these one was the husband she idolised another the brother she loved she vaguely wondered who the others were who were also calmly waiting for the scarlet pimpernel while death lurked behind every boulder of the cliffs  for the moment she could do nothing but follow the soldiers and chauvelin she feared to lose her way or she would have rushed forward and found that wooden hut and perhaps been in time to warn the fugitives and their brave deliverer yet  for a second the thought flashed through her mind of uttering the piercing shrieks which chauvelin seemed to dread as a possible warning to the scarlet pimpernel and his friendsin the wild hope that they would hear and have yet time to escape before it was too late but she did not know if her shrieks would reach the ears of the doomed men her effort might be premature and she would never be allowed to make another her mouth would be securely gagged like that of the jew and she a helpless prisoner in the hands of chauvelins men  like a ghost she flitted noiselessly behind that hedge she had taken her shoes off and her stockings were by now torn off her feet she felt neither soreness nor weariness indomitable will to reach her husband in spite of adverse fate and of a cunning enemy killed all sense of bodily pain within her and rendered her instincts doubly acute  she heard nothing save the soft and measured footsteps of percys enemies on in front she saw nothing butin her minds eyethat wooden hut and he her husband walking blindly to his doom  suddenly those same keen instincts within her made her pause in her mad haste and cower still further within the shadow of the hedge the moon which had proved a friend to her by remaining hidden behind a bank of clouds now emerged in all the glory of an early autumn night and in a moment flooded the weird and lonely landscape with a rush of brilliant light  there not two hundred metres ahead was the edge of the cliff and below stretching far away to free and happy england the sea rolled on smoothly and peaceably marguerites gaze rested for an instant on the brilliant silvery waters and as she gazed her heart which had been numb with pain for all these hours seemed to soften and distend and her eyes filled with hot tears not three miles away with white sails set a graceful schooner lay in wait  marguerite had guessed rather than recognized her it was the day dream percys favourite yacht and all her crew of british sailors her white sails glistening in the moonlight seemed to convey a message to marguerite of joy and hope which yet she feared could never be she waited there out at sea waited for her master like a beautiful white bird all ready to take flight and he would never reach her never see her smooth deck again never gaze any more on the white cliffs of england the land of liberty and of hope  the sight of the schooner seemed to infuse into the poor wearied woman the superhuman strength of despair there was the edge of the cliff and some way below was the hut where presently her husband would meet his death but the moon was out she could see her way now she would see the hut from a distance run to it rouse them all warn them at any rate to be prepared and to sell their lives dearly rather than be caught like so many rats in a hole  she stumbled on behind the hedge in the low thick grass of the ditch she must have run on very fast and had outdistanced chauvelin and desgas for presently she reached the edge of the cliff and heard their footsteps distinctly behind her but only a very few yards away and now the moonlight was full upon her her figure must have been distinctly silhouetted against the silvery background of the sea  only for a moment though the next she had cowered like some animal doubled up within itself she peeped down the great rugged cliffsthe descent would be easy enough as they were not precipitous and the great boulders afforded plenty of foothold suddenly as she gazed she saw at some little distance on her left and about midway down the cliffs a rough wooden construction through the wall of which a tiny red light glimmered like a beacon her very heart seemed to stand still the eagerness of joy was so great that it felt like an awful pain  she could not gauge how distant the hut was but without hesitation she began the steep descent creeping from boulder to boulder caring nothing for the enemy behind or for the soldiers who evidently had all taken cover since the tall englishman had not yet appeared  on she pressed forgetting the deadly foe on her track running stumbling footsore halfdazed but still on    when suddenly a crevice or stone or slippery bit of rock threw her violently to the ground she struggled again to her feet and started running forward once more to give them that timely warning to beg them to flee before he came and to tell him to keep awayaway from this deathtrapaway from this awful doom but now she realised that other steps quicker than her own were already close at her heels the next instant a hand dragged at her skirt and she was down on her knees again whilst something was wound round her mouth to prevent her uttering a scream  bewildered half frantic with the bitterness of disappointment she looked round her helplessly and bending down quite close to her she saw through the mist which seemed to gather round her a pair of keen malicious eyes which appeared to her excited brain to have a weird supernatural green light in them she lay in the shadow of a great boulder chauvelin could not see her features but he passed his thin white fingers over her face  a woman he whispered by all the saints in the calendar  we cannot let her loose thats certain he muttered to himself i wonder now     suddenly he paused after a few moments of deadly silence he gave forth a long low curious chuckle while once again marguerite felt with a horrible shudder his thin fingers wandering over her face  dear me dear me he whispered with affected gallantry this is indeed a charming surprise and marguerite felt her resistless hand raised to chauvelins thin mocking lips  the situation was indeed grotesque had it not been at the same time so fearfully tragic the poor weary woman broken in spirit and half frantic with the bitterness of her disappointment receiving on her knees the banal gallantries of her deadly enemy  her senses were leaving her half choked with the tight grip round her mouth she had no strength to move or to utter the faintest sound the excitement which all along had kept up her delicate body seemed at once to have subsided and the feeling of blank despair to have completely paralyzed her brain and nerves  chauvelin must have given some directions which she was too dazed to hear for she felt herself lifted from off her feet the bandage round her mouth was made more secure and a pair of strong arms carried her towards that tiny red light on ahead which she had looked upon as a beacon and the last faint glimmer of hope     chapter xxix trapped    she did not know how long she was thus carried along she had lost all notion of time and space and for a few seconds tired nature mercifully deprived her of consciousness  when she once more realised her state she felt that she was placed with some degree of comfort upon a mans coat with her back resting against a fragment of rock the moon was hidden again behind some clouds and the darkness seemed in comparison more intense the sea was roaring some two hundred feet below her and on looking all round she could no longer see any vestige of the tiny glimmer of red light  that the end of the journey had been reached she gathered from the fact that she heard rapid questions and answers spoken in a whisper quite close to her  there are four men in there citoyen they are sitting by the fire and seem to be waiting quietly  the hour  nearly two oclock  the tide  coming in quickly  the schooner  obviously an english one lying some three kilometers out but we cannot see her boat  have the men taken cover  yes citoyen  they will not blunder  they will not stir until the tall englishman comes then they will surround and overpower the five men  right and the lady  still dazed i fancy shes close beside you citoyen  and the jew  hes gagged and his legs strapped together he cannot move or scream  good then have your gun ready in case you want it get close to the hut and leave me to look after the lady  desgas evidently obeyed for marguerite heard him creeping away along the stony cliff then she felt that a pair of warm thin talonlike hands took hold of both her own and held them in a grip of steel  before that handkerchief is removed from your pretty mouth fair lady whispered chauvelin close to her ear i think it right to give you one small word of warning what has procured me the honour of being followed across the channel by so charming a companion i cannot of course conceive but if i mistake it not the purpose of this flattering attention is not one that would commend itself to my vanity and i think that i am right in surmising moreover that the first sound which your pretty lips would utter as soon as the cruel gag is removed would be one that would prove a warning to the cunning fox which i have been at such pains to track to his lair  he paused a moment while the steellike grasp seemed to tighten round her wrist then he resumed in the same hurried whisper  inside that hut if again i am not mistaken your brother armand st just waits with that traitor de tournay and two other men unknown to you for the arrival of the mysterious rescuer whose identity has for so long puzzled our committee of public safetythe audacious scarlet pimpernel no doubt if you scream if there is a scuffle here if shots are fired it is more than likely that the same long legs that brought this scarlet enigma here will as quickly take him to some place of safety the purpose then for which i have travelled all these miles will remain unaccomplished on the other hand it only rests with yourself that your brotherarmandshall be free to go off with you tonight if you like to england or any other place of safety  marguerite could not utter a sound as the handkerchief was would very tightly round her mouth but chauvelin was peering through the darkness very closely into her face no doubt too her hand gave a responsive appeal to his last suggestion for presently he continued  what i want you to do to ensure armands safety is a very simple thing dear lady  what is it marguerites hand seemed to convey to his in response  to remainon this spot without uttering a sound until i give you leave to speak ah but i think you will obey he added with that funny dry chuckle of his as marguerites whole figure seemed to stiffen in defiance of this order for let me tell you that if you scream nay if you utter one sound or attempt to move from here my menthere are thirty of them aboutwill seize st just de tournay and their two friends and shoot them hereby my ordersbefore your eyes  marguerite had listened to her implacable enemys speech with everincreasing terror numbed with physical pain she yet had sufficient mental vitality in her to realize the full horror of this terrible eitheror he was once more putting before her eitheror ten thousand times more appalling and horrible than the one he had suggested to her that fatal night at the ball  this time it meant that she should keep still and allow the husband she worshipped to walk unconsciously to his death or that she should by trying to give him a word of warning which perhaps might even be unavailing actually give the signal for her own brothers death and that of three other unsuspecting men  she could not see chauvelin but she could almost feel those keen pale eyes of his fixed maliciously upon her helpless form and his hurried whispered words reached her ear as the deathknell of her last faint lingering hope  nay fair lady he added urbanely you can have no interest in anyone save in st just and all you need do for his safety is to remain where you are and to keep silent my men have strict orders to spare him in every way as for that enigmatic scarlet pimpernel what is he to you believe me no warning from you could possibly save him and now dear lady let me remove this unpleasant coercion which has been placed before your pretty mouth you see i wish you to be perfectly free in the choice which you are about to make  her thoughts in a whirl her temples aching her nerves paralyzed her body numb with pain marguerite sat there in the darkness which surrounded her as with a pall from where she sat she could not see the sea but she heard the incessant mournful murmur of the incoming tide which spoke of her dead hopes her lost love the husband she had with her own hand betrayed and sent to his death  chauvelin removed he handkerchief from her mouth she certainly did not scream at that moment she had no strength to do anything but barely to hold herself upright and to force herself to think  oh think think think of what she should do the minutes flew on in this awful stillness she could not tell how fast or how slowly she heard nothing she saw nothing she did not feel the sweetsmelling autumn air scented with the briny odour of the sea she no longer heard the murmur of the waves the occasional rattling of a pebble as it rolled down some steep incline more and more unreal did the whole situation seem it was impossible that she marguerite blakeney the queen of london society should actually be sitting here on this bit of lonely coast in the middle of the night side by side with a most bitter enemy and oh it was not possible that somewhere not many hundred feet away perhaps from where she stood the being she had once despised but who now in every moment of this weird dreamlike life became more and more dearit was not possible that he was unconsciously even now walking to his doom whilst she did nothing to save him  why did she not with unearthly screams that would reecho from one end of the lonely beach to the other send out a warning to him to desist to retrace his steps for death lurked here whilst he advanced once or twice the screams rose to her throatas if by instinct then before her eyes there stood the awful alternative her brother and those three men shot before her eyes practically by her orders she their murderer  oh that fiend in human shape next to her knew humanfemalenature well he had played upon her feelings as a skilful musician plays upon an instrument he had gauged her very thoughts to a nicety  she could not give that signalfor she was weak and she was a woman how could she deliberately order armand to be shot before her eyes to have his dear blood upon her head he dying perhaps with a curse on her upon his lips and little suzannes father too he an old man and the othersoh it was all too too horrible  wait wait wait how long the early morning hours sped on and yet it was not dawn the sea continued its incessant mournful murmur the autumnal breeze sighed gently in the night the lonely beach was silent even as the grave  suddenly from somewhere not very far away a cheerful strong voice was heard singing god save the king     chapter xxx the schooner    marguerites aching heart stood still she felt more than she heard the men on the watch preparing for the fight her senses told her that each with sword in hand was crouching ready for the spring  the voice came nearer and nearer in the vast immensity of these lonely cliffs with the loud murmur of the sea below it was impossible to say how near or how far nor yet from which direction came that cheerful singer who sang to god to save his king whilst he himself was in such deadly danger faint at first the voice grew louder and louder from time to time a small pebble detached itself apparently from beneath the firm tread of the singer and went rolling down the rocky cliffs to the beach below  marguerite as she heard felt that her very life was slipping away as if when that voice drew nearer when that singer became entrapped     she distinctly heard the click of desgas gun close to her     no no no no oh god in heaven this cannot be let armands blood then be on her own head let her be branded as his murderer let even he whom she loved despise and loathe her for this but god oh god save him at any cost  with a wild shriek she sprang to her feet and darted round the rock against which she had been cowering she saw the little red gleam through the chinks of the hut she ran up to it and fell against its wooden walls which she began to hammer with clenched fists in an almost maniacal frenzy while she shouted  armand armand for gods sake fire your leader is near he is coming he is betrayed armand armand fire in heavens name  she was seized and thrown to the ground she lay there moaning bruised not caring but still halfsobbing halfshrieking  percy my husband for gods sake fly armand armand why dont you fire  one of you stop that woman screaming hissed chauvelin who hardly could refrain from striking her  something was thrown over her face she could not breathe and perforce she was silent  the bold singer too had become silent warned no doubt of his impending danger by marguerites frantic shrieks the men had sprung to their feet there was no need for further silence on their part the very cliffs echoed the poor heartbroken womans screams  chauvelin with a muttered oath which boded no good to her who had dared to upset his most cherished plans had hastily shouted the word of command  into it my men and let no one escape from that hut alive  the moon had once more emerged from between the clouds the darkness on the cliffs had gone giving place once more to brilliant silvery light some of the soldiers had rushed to the rough wooden door of the hut whilst one of them kept guard over marguerite  the door was partially open one of the soldiers pushed it further but within all was darkness the charcoal fire only lighting with a dim red light the furthest corner of the hut the soldiers paused automatically at the door like machines waiting for further orders  chauvelin who was prepared for a violent onslaught from within and for a vigorous resistance from the four fugitives under cover of the darkness was for the moment paralyzed with astonishment when he saw the soldiers standing there at attention like sentries on guard whilst not a sound proceeded from the hut  filled with strange anxious foreboding he too went to the door of the hut and peering into the gloom he asked quickly  what is the meaning of this  i think citoyen that there is no one there now replied one of the soldiers imperturbably  you have not let those four men go thundered chauvelin menacingly i ordered you to let no man escape alivequick after them all of you quick in every direction  the men obedient as machines rushed down the rocky incline towards the beach some going off to right and left as fast as their feet could carry them  you and your men will pay with your lives for this blunder citoyen sergeant said chauvelin viciously to the sergeant who had been in charge of the men and you too citoyen he added turning with a snarl to desgas for disobeying my orders  you ordered us to wait citoyen until the tall englishman arrived and joined the four men in the hut no one came said the sergeant sullenly  but i ordered you just now when the woman screamed to rush in and let no one escape  but citoyen the four men who were there before had been gone some time i think     you thinkyou    said chauvelin almost choking with fury and you let them go     you ordered us to wait citoyen protested the sergeant and to implicitly obey your commands on pain of death we waited  i heard the men creep out of the hut not many minutes after we took cover and long before the woman screamed he added as chauvelin seemed still quite speechless with rage  hark said desgas suddenly  in the distance the sound of repeated firing was heard chauvelin tried to peer along the beach below but as luck would have it the fitful moon once more hid her light behind a bank of clouds and he could see nothing  one of you go into the hut and strike a light he stammered at last  stolidly the sergeant obeyed he went up to the charcoal fire and lit the small lantern he carried in his belt it was evident that the hut was quite empty  which way did they go asked chauvelin  i could not tell citoyen said the sergeant they went straight down the cliff first then disappeared behind some boulders  hush what was that  all three men listened attentively in the far very far distance could be heard faintly echoing and already dying away the quick sharp splash of half a dozen oars chauvelin took out his handkerchief and wiped the perspiration from his forehead  the schooners boat was all he gasped  evidently armand st just and his three companions had managed to creep along the side of the cliffs whilst the men like true soldiers of the welldrilled republican army had with blind obedience and in fear of their own lives implicitly obeyed chauvelins ordersto wait for the tall englishman who was the important capture  they had no doubt reached one of the creeks which jut far out to sea on this coast at intervals behind this the boat of the day dream must have been on the lookout for them and they were by now safely on board the british schooner  as if to confirm this last supposition the dull boom of a gun was heard from out at sea  the schooner citoyen said desgas quietly shes off  it needed all chauvelins nerve and presence of mind not to give way to a useless and undignified access of rage there was no doubt now that once again that accursed british head had completely outwitted him how he had contrived to reach the hut without being seen by one of the thirty soldiers who guarded the spot was more than chauvelin could conceive that he had done so before the thirty men had arrived on the cliff was of course fairly clear but how he had come over in reuben goldsteins cart all the way from calais without being sighted by the various patrols on duty was impossible of explanation it really seemed as if some potent fate watched over that daring scarlet pimpernel and his astute enemy almost felt a superstitious shudder pass through him as he looked round at the towering cliffs and the loneliness of this outlying coast  but surely this was reality and the year of grace 1792 there were no fairies and hobgoblins about chauvelin and his thirty men had all heard with their own ears that accursed voice singing god save the king fully twenty minutes after they had all taken cover around the hut by that time the four fugitives must have reached the creek and got into the boat and the nearest creek was more than a mile from the hut  where had that daring singer got to unless satan himself had lent him wings he could not have covered that mile on a rocky cliff in the space of two minutes and only two minutes had elapsed between his song and the sound of the boats oars away at sea he must have remained behind and was even now hiding somewhere about the cliffs the patrols were still about he would still be sighted no doubt chauvelin felt hopeful once again  one or two of the men who had run after the fugitives were now slowly working their way up the cliff one of them reached chauvelins side at the very moment that this hope arose in the astute diplomatists heart  we were too late citoyen the soldier said we reached the beach just before the moon was hidden by that bank of clouds the boat had undoubtedly been on the lookout behind that first creek a mile off but she had shoved off some time ago when we got to the beach and was already some way out to sea we fired after her but of course it was no good she was making straight and quickly for the schooner we saw her very clearly in the moonlight  yes said chauvelin with eager impatience she had shoved off some time ago you said and the nearest creek is a mile further on  yes citoyen i ran all the way straight to the beach though i guessed the boat would have waited somewhere near the creek as the tide would reach there earliest the boat must have shoved off some minutes before the woman began to scream  bring the light in here he commanded eagerly as he once more entered the hut  the sergeant brought his lantern and together the two men explored the little place with a rapid glance chauvelin noted its contents the cauldron placed close under an aperture in the wall and containing the last few dying embers of burned charcoal a couple of stools overturned as if in the haste of sudden departure then the fishermans tools and his nets lying in one corner and beside them something small and white  pick that up said chauvelin to the sergeant pointing to this white scrap and bring it to me  it was a crumpled piece of paper evidently forgotten there by the fugitives in their hurry to get away the sergeant much awed by the citoyens obvious rage and impatience picked the paper up and handed it respectfully to chauvelin  read it sergeant said the latter curtly  it is almost illegible citoyen    a fearful scrawl     i ordered you to read it repeated chauvelin viciously  the sergeant by the light of his lantern began deciphering the few hastily scrawled words  i cannot quite reach you without risking your lives and endangering the success of your rescue when you receive this wait two minutes then creep out of the hut one by one turn to your left sharply and creep cautiously down the cliff keep to the left all the time till you reach the first rock which you see jutting far out to seabehind it in the creek the boat is on the lookout for yougive a long sharp whistleshe will come upget into hermy men will row you to the schooner and thence to england and safetyonce on board the day dream send the boat back for me tell my men that i shall be at the creek which is in a direct line opposite the chat gris near calais they know it i shall be there as soon as possiblethey must wait for me at a safe distance out at sea till they hear the usual signal do not delayand obey these instructions implicitly  then there is the signature citoyen added the sergeant as he handed the paper back to chauvelin  but the latter had not waited an instant one phrase of the momentous scrawl had caught his ear i shall be at the creek which is in a direct line opposite the chat gris near calais that phrase might yet mean victory for him which of you knows this coast well he shouted to his men who now one by one all returned from their fruitless run and were all assembled once more round the hut  i do citoyen said one of them i was born in calais and know every stone of these cliffs  there is a creek in a direct line from the chat gris  there is citoyen i know it well  the englishman is hoping to reach that creek he does not know every stone of these cliffs he may go there by the longest way round and in any case he will proceed cautiously for fear of the patrols at any rate there is a chance to get him yet a thousand francs to each man who gets to that creek before that longlegged englishman  i know of a short cut across the cliffs said the soldier and with an enthusiastic shout he rushed forward followed closely by his comrades  within a few minutes their running footsteps had died away in the distance chauvelin listened to them for a moment the promise of the reward was lending spurs to the soldiers of the republic the gleam of hate and anticipated triumph was once more apparent on his face  close to him desgas still stood mute and impassive waiting for further orders whilst two soldiers were kneeling beside the prostrate form of marguerite chauvelin gave his secretary a vicious look his welllaid plan had failed its sequel was problematical there was still a great chance now that the scarlet pimpernel might yet escape and chauvelin with that unreasoning fury which sometimes assails a strong nature was longing to vent his rage on somebody  the soldiers were holding marguerite pinioned to the ground though she poor soul was not making the faintest struggle overwrought nature had at last peremptorily asserted herself and she lay there in a dead swoon her eyes circled by deep purple lines that told of long sleepless nights her hair matted and damp round her forehead her lips parted in a sharp curve that spoke of physical pain  the cleverest woman in europe the elegant and fashionable lady blakeney who had dazzled london society with her beauty her wit and her extravagances presented a very pathetic picture of tiredout suffering womanhood which would have appealed to any but the hard vengeful heart of her baffled enemy  it is no use mounting guard over a woman who is half dead he said spitefully to the soldiers when you have allowed five men who were very much alive to escape  obediently the soldiers rose to their feet  youd better try and find that footpath again for me and that brokendown cart we left on the road  then suddenly a bright idea seemed to strike him  ah bythebye where is the jew  close by here citoyen said desgas i gagged him and tied his legs together as you commanded  from the immediate vicinity a plaintive moan reached chauvelins ears he followed his secretary who led the way to the other side of the hut where fallen into an absolute heap of dejection with his legs tightly pinioned together and his mouth gagged lay the unfortunate descendant of israel  his face in the silvery light of the moon looked positively ghastly with terror his eyes were wide open and almost glassy and his whole body was trembling as if with ague while a piteous wail escaped his bloodless lips the rope which had originally been wound round his shoulders and arms had evidently given way for it lay in a tangle about his body but he seemed quite unconscious of this for he had not made the slightest attempt to move from the place where desgas had originally put him like a terrified chicken which looks upon a line of white chalk drawn on a table as on a string which paralyzes its movements  bring the cowardly brute here commanded chauvelin  he certainly felt exceedingly vicious and since he had no reasonable grounds for venting his illhumour on the soldiers who had but too punctually obeyed his orders he felt that the son of the despised race would prove an excellent butt with true french contempt of the jew which has survived the lapse of centuries even to this day he would not go too near him but said with biting sarcasm as the wretched old man was brought in full light of the moon by the two soldiers  i suppose now that being a jew you have a good memory for bargains  answer he again commanded as the jew with trembling lips seemed too frightened to speak  yes your honour stammered the poor wretch  you remember then the one you and i made together in calais when you undertook to overtake reuben goldstein his nag and my friend the tall stranger eh  b    b    but    your honour     there is no but i said do you remember  y    y    y    yes    your honour  what was the bargain  there was dead silence the unfortunate man looked round at the great cliffs the moon above the stolid faces of the soldiers and even at the poor prostate inanimate woman close by but said nothing  will you speak thundered chauvelin menacingly  he did try poor wretch but obviously he could not there was no doubt however that he knew what to expect from the stern man before him  your honour    he ventured imploringly  since your terror seems to have paralyzed your tongue said chauvelin sarcastically i must needs refresh your memory it was agreed between us that if we overtook my friend the tall stranger before he reached this place you were to have ten pieces of gold  a low moan escaped from the jews trembling lips  but added chauvelin with slow emphasis if you deceived me in your promise you were to have a sound beating one that would teach you not to tell lies  i did not your honour i swear it by abraham     and by all the other patriarchs i know unfortunately they are still in hades i believe according to your creed and cannot help you much in your present trouble now you did not fulfil your share of the bargain but i am ready to fulfil mine here he added turning to the soldiers the buckleend of your two belts to this confounded jew  as the soldiers obediently unbuckled their heavy leather belts the jew set up a howl that surely would have been enough to bring all the patriarchs out of hades and elsewhere to defend their descendant from the brutality of this french official  i think i can rely on you citoyen soldiers laughed chauvelin maliciously to give this old liar the best and soundest beating he has ever experienced but dont kill him he added drily  we will obey citoyen replied the soldiers as imperturbably as ever  he did not wait to see his orders carried out he knew that he could trust these soldierswho were still smarting under his rebukenot to mince matters when given a free hand to belabour a third party  when that lumbering coward has had his punishment he said to desgas the men can guide us as far as the cart and one of them can drive us in it back to calais the jew and the woman can look after each other he added roughly until we can send somebody for them in the morning they cant run away very far in their present condition and we cannot be troubled with them just now  chauvelin had not given up all hope his men he knew were spurred on by the hope of the reward that enigmatic and audacious scarlet pimpernel alone and with thirty men at his heels could not reasonably be expected to escape a second time  but he felt less sure now the englishmans audacity had baffled him once whilst the woodenheaded stupidity of the soldiers and the interference of a woman had turned his hand which held all the trumps into a losing one if marguerite had not taken up his time if the soldiers had had a grain of intelligence if    it was a long if and chauvelin stood for a moment quite still and enrolled thirty odd people in one long overwhelming anathema nature poetic silent balmy the bright moon the calm silvery sea spoke of beauty and of rest and chauvelin cursed nature cursed man and woman and above all he cursed all longlegged meddlesome british enigmas with one gigantic curse  the howls of the jew behind him undergoing his punishment sent a balm through his heart overburdened as it was with revengeful malice he smiled it eased his mind to think that some human being at least was like himself not altogether at peace with mankind  he turned and took a last look at the lonely bit of coast where stood the wooden hut now bathed in moonlight the scene of the greatest discomfiture ever experienced by a leading member of the committee of public safety  against a rock on a hard bed of stone lay the unconscious figure of marguerite blakeney while some few paces further on the unfortunate jew was receiving on his broad back the blows of two stout leather belts wielded by the stolid arms of two sturdy soldiers of the republic the howls of benjamin rosenbaum were fit to make the dead rise from their graves they must have wakened all the gulls from sleep and made them look down with great interest at the doings of the lords of the creation  that will do commanded chauvelin as the jews moans became more feeble and the poor wretch seemed to have fainted away we dont want to kill him  obediently the soldiers buckled on their belts one of them viciously kicking the jew to one side  leave him there said chauvelin and lead the way now quickly to the cart ill follow  he walked up to where marguerite lay and looked down into her face she had evidently recovered consciousness and was making feeble efforts to raise herself her large blue eyes were looking at the moonlit scene round her with a scared and terrified look they rested with a mixture of horror and pity on the jew whose luckless fate and wild howls had been the first signs that struck her with her returning senses then she caught sight of chauvelin in his neat dark clothes which seemed hardly crumpled after the stirring events of the last few hours he was smiling sarcastically and his pale eyes peered down at her with a look of intense malice  with mock gallantry he stooped and raised her icycold hand to his lips which sent a thrill of indescribable loathing through marguerites weary frame  i much regret fair lady he said in his most suave tones that circumstances over which i have no control compel me to leave you here for the moment but i go away secure in the knowledge that i do not leave you unprotected our friend benjamin here though a trifle the worse for wear at the present moment will prove a gallant defender of your fair person i have no doubt at dawn i will send an escort for you until then i feel sure that you will find him devoted though perhaps a trifle slow  marguerite only had the strength to turn her head away her heart was broken with cruel anguish one awful thought had returned to her mind together with gathering consciousness what had become of percywhat of armand  she knew nothing of what had happened after she heard the cheerful song god save the king which she believed to be the signal of death  i myself concluded chauvelin must now very reluctantly leave you au revoir fair lady we meet i hope soon in london shall i see you at the prince of wales garden partynoah well au revoirremember me i pray to sir percy blakeney  and with a last ironical smile and bow he once more kissed her hand and disappeared down the footpath in the wake of the soldiers and followed by the imperturbable desgas     chapter xxxi the escape    marguerite listenedhalfdazed as she wasto the fastretreating firm footsteps of the four men  all nature was so still that she lying with her ear close to the ground could distinctly trace the sound of their tread as they ultimately turned into the road and presently the faint echo of the old cartwheels the halting gait of the lean nag told her that her enemy was a quarter of a league away how long she lay there she knew not she had lost count of time dreamily she looked up at the moonlit sky and listened to the monotonous roll of the waves  the invigorating scent of the sea was nectar to her wearied body the immensity of the lonely cliffs was silent and dreamlike her brain only remained conscious of its ceaseless its intolerable torture of uncertainty  she did not know  she did not know whether percy was even now at this moment in the hands of the soldiers of the republic enduringas she had done herselfthe gibes and jeers of his malicious enemy she did not know on the other hand whether armands lifeless body did not lie there in the hut whilst percy had escaped only to hear that his wifes hands had guided the human bloodhounds to the murder of armand and his friends  the physical pain of utter weariness was so great that she hoped confidently her tired body could rest here for ever after all the turmoil the passion and the intrigues of the last few dayshere beneath that clear sky within sound of the sea and with this balmy autumn breeze whispering to her a last lullaby all was so solitary so silent like unto dreamland even the last faint echo of the distant cart had long ago died away afar  suddenly    a sound    the strangest undoubtedly that these lonely cliffs of france had ever heard broke the silent solemnity of the shore  so strange a sound was it that the gentle breeze ceased to murmur the tiny pebbles to roll down the steep incline so strange that marguerite wearied overwrought as she was thought that the beneficial unconsciousness of the approach of death was playing her halfsleeping senses a weird and elusive trick  it was the sound of a good solid absolutely british damn  the sea gulls in their nests awoke and looked round in astonishment a distant and solitary owl set up a midnight hoot the tall cliffs frowned down majestically at the strange unheardof sacrilege  marguerite did not trust her ears halfraising herself on her hands she strained every sense to see or hear to know the meaning of this very earthly sound  all was still again for the space of a few seconds the same silence once more fell upon the great and lonely vastness  then marguerite who had listened as in a trance who felt she must be dreaming with that cool magnetic moonlight overhead heard again and this time her heart stood still her eyes large and dilated looked round her not daring to trust her other sense  odds life but i wish those demmed fellows had not hit quite so hard  this time it was quite unmistakable only one particular pair of essentially british lips could have uttered those words in sleepy drawly affected tones  damn repeated those same british lips emphatically zounds but im as weak as a rat  in a moment marguerite was on her feet  was she dreaming were those great stony cliffs the gates of paradise was the fragrant breath of the breeze suddenly caused by the flutter of angels wings bringing tidings of unearthly joys to her after all her suffering orfaint and illwas she the prey of delirium  she listened again and once again she heard the same very earthly sounds of good honest british language not the least akin to whisperings from paradise or flutter of angels wings  she looked round her eagerly at the tall cliffs the lonely hut the great stretch of rocky beach somewhere there above or below her behind a boulder or inside a crevice but still hidden from her longing feverish eyes must be the owner of that voice which once used to irritate her but now would make her the happiest woman in europe if only she could locate it  percy percy she shrieked hysterically tortured between doubt and hope i am here come to me where are you percy percy     its all very well calling me mdear said the same sleepy drawly voice but odds life i cannot come to you those demmed frogeaters have trussed me like a goose on a spit and i am weak as a mouse    i cannot get away  and still marguerite did not understand she did not realise for at least another ten seconds whence came that voice so drawly so dear but alas with a strange accent of weakness and of suffering there was no one within sight    except by that rock    great god    the jew    was she mad or dreaming     his back was against the pale moonlight he was half crouching trying vainly to raise himself with his arms tightly pinioned marguerite ran up to him took his head in both her hands    and look straight into a pair of blue eyes goodnatured even a trifle amusedshining out of the weird and distorted mask of the jew  percy    percy    my husband she gasped faint with the fulness of her joy thank god thank god  la mdear he rejoined goodhumouredly we will both do that anon an you think you can loosen these demmed ropes and release me from my inelegant attitude  she had no knife her fingers were numb and weak but she worked away with her teeth while great welcome tears poured from her eyes onto those poor pinioned hands  odds life he said when at last after frantic efforts on her part the ropes seemed at last to be giving way but i marvel whether it has ever happened before that an english gentleman allowed himself to be licked by a demmed foreigner and made no attempt to give as good as he got  it was very obvious that he was exhausted from sheer physical pain and when at last the rope gave way he fell in a heap against the rock  marguerite looked helplessly round her  oh for a drop of water on this awful beach she cried in agony seeing that he was ready to faint again  nay mdear he murmured with his goodhumoured smile personally i should prefer a drop of good french brandy an youll dive in the pocket of this dirty old garment youll find my flask    i am demmed if i can move  when he had drunk some brandy he forced marguerite to do likewise  la thats better now eh little woman he said with a sigh of satisfaction heighho but this is a queer rigup for sir percy blakeney bart to be found in by his lady and no mistake begad he added passing his hand over his chin i havent been shaved for nearly twenty hours i must look a disgusting object as for these curls     and laughingly he took off the disfiguring wig and curls and stretched out his long limbs which were cramped from many hours stooping then he bent forward and looked long and searchingly into his wifes blue eyes  percy she whispered while a deep blush suffused her delicate cheeks and neck if you only knew     i do know dear    everything he said with infinite gentleness  and can you ever forgive  i have naught to forgive sweetheart your heroism your devotion which i alas so little deserved have more than atoned for that unfortunate episode at the ball  then you knew    she whispered all the time     yes he replied tenderly i knew    all the time    but begad had i but known what a noble heart yours was my margot i should have trusted you as you deserved to be trusted and you would not have had to undergo the terrible sufferings of the past few hours in order to run after a husband who has done so much that needs forgiveness  they were sitting side by side leaning up against a rock and he had rested his aching head on her shoulder she certainly now deserved the name of the happiest woman in europe  it is a case of the blind leading the lame sweetheart is it not he said with his goodnatured smile of old odds life but i do not know which are the more sore my shoulders or your little feet  he bent forward to kiss them for they peeped out through her torn stockings and bore pathetic witness to her endurance and devotion  but armand    she said with sudden terror and remorse as in the midst of her happiness the image of the beloved brother for whose sake she had so deeply sinned rose now before her mind  oh have no fear for armand sweetheart he said tenderly did i not pledge you my word that he should be safe he with de tournay and the others are even now on board the day dream  but how she gasped i do not understand  yet tis simple enough mdear he said with that funny halfshy halfinane laugh of his you see when i found that that brute chauvelin meant to stick to me like a leech i thought the best thing i could do as i could not shake him off was to take him along with me i had to get to armand and the others somehow and all the roads were patrolled and every one on the lookout for your humble servant i knew that when i slipped through chauvelins fingers at the chat gris that he would lie in wait for me here whichever way i took i wanted to keep an eye on him and his doings and a british head is as good as a french one any day  indeed it had proved to be infinitely better and marguerites heart was filled with joy and marvel as he continued to recount to her the daring manner in which he had snatched the fugitives away right from under chauvelins very nose  dressed as the dirty old jew he said gaily i knew i should not be recognized i had met reuben goldstein in calais earlier in the evening for a few gold pieces he supplied me with this rigout and undertook to bury himself out of sight of everybody whilst he lent me his cart and nag  but if chauvelin had discovered you she gasped excitedly your disguise was good    but he is so sharp  odds fish he rejoined quietly then certainly the game would have been up i could but take the risk i know human nature pretty well by now he added with a note of sadness in his cheery young voice and i know these frenchmen out and out they so loathe a jew that they never come nearer than a couple of yards of him and begad i fancy that i contrived to make myself look about as loathsome an object as it is possible to conceive  yesand then she asked eagerly  zooksthen i carried out my little plan that is to say at first i only determined to leave everything to chance but when i heard chauvelin giving his orders to the soldiers i thought that fate and i were going to work together after all i reckoned on the blind obedience of the soldiers chauvelin had ordered them on pain of death not to stir until the tall englishman came desgas had thrown me down in a heap quite close to the hut the soldiers took no notice of the jew who had driven citoyen chauvelin to this spot i managed to free my hands from the ropes with which the brute had trussed me i always carry pencil and paper with me wherever i go and i hastily scrawled a few important instructions on a scrap of paper then i looked about me i crawled up to the hut under the very noses of the soldiers who lay under cover without stirring just as chauvelin had ordered them to do then i dropped my little note into the hut through a chink in the wall and waited in this note i told the fugitives to walk noiselessly out of the hut creep down the cliffs keep to the left until they came to the first creek to give a certain signal when the boat of the day dream which lay in wait not far out to sea would pick them up they obeyed implicitly fortunately for them and for me the soldiers who saw them were equally obedient to chauvelins orders they did not stir i waited for nearly half an hour when i knew that the fugitives were safe i gave the signal which caused so much stir  and that was the whole story it seemed so simple and marguerite could but marvel at the wonderful ingenuity the boundless pluck and audacity which had evolved and helped to carry out this daring plan  but those brutes struck you she gasped in horror at the bare recollection of the fearful indignity  well that could not be helped he said gently whilst my little wifes fate was so uncertain i had to remain here by her side odds life he added merrily never fear chauvelin will lose nothing by waiting i warrant wait till i get him back to englandla he shall pay for the thrashing he gave me with compound interest i promise you  marguerite laughed it was so good to be beside him to hear his cheery voice to watch that goodhumoured twinkle in his blue eyes as he stretched out his strong arms in longing for that foe and anticipation of his welldeserved punishment  suddenly however she started the happy blush left her cheek the light of joy died out of her eyes she had heard a stealthy footfall overhead and a stone had rolled down from the top of the cliffs right down to the beach below  whats that she whispered in horror and alarm  oh nothing mdear he muttered with a pleasant laugh only a trifle you happened to have forgotten    my friend ffoulkes     sir andrew she gasped  indeed she had wholly forgotten the devoted friend and companion who had trusted and stood by her during all these hours of anxiety and suffering she remembered him now tardily and with a pang of remorse  aye you had forgotten him hadnt you mdear said sir percy merrily fortunately i met him not far from the chat gris before i had that interesting supper party with my friend chauvelin    odds life but i have a score to settle with that young reprobatebut in the meanwhile i told him of a very long very circuitous road which chauvelins men would never suspect just about the time when we are ready for him eh little woman  and he obeyed asked marguerite in utter astonishment  without word or question see here he comes he was not in the way when i did not want him and now he arrives in the nick of time ah he will make pretty little suzanne a most admirable and methodical husband  in the meanwhile sir andrew ffoulkes had cautiously worked his way down the cliffs he stopped once or twice pausing to listen for whispered words which would guide him to blakeneys hidingplace  blakeney he ventured to say at last cautiously blakeney are you there  the next moment he rounded the rock against which sir percy and marguerite were leaning and seeing the weird figure still clad in the jews long gaberdine he paused in sudden complete bewilderment  but already blakeney had struggled to his feet  here i am friend he said with his funny inane laugh all alive though i do look a begad scarecrow in these demmed things  zooks ejaculated sir andrew in boundless astonishment as he recognized his leader of all the     the young man had seen marguerite and happily checked the forcible language that rose to his lips at sight of the exquisite sir percy in this weird and dirty garb  yes said blakeney calmly of all the    hem    my friendi have not yet had time to ask you what you were doing in france when i ordered you to remain in london insubordination what wait till my shoulders are less sore and by god see the punishment youll get  odds fish ill bear it said sir andrew with a merry laugh seeing that you are alive to give it    would you have had me allow lady blakeney to do the journey alone but in the name of heaven man where did you get these extraordinary clothes  lud they are a bit quaint aint they laughed sir percy jovially but odds fish he added with sudden earnestness and authority now you are here ffoulkes we must lose no more time that brute chauvelin may send some one to look after us  marguerite was so happy she could have stayed here for ever hearing his voice asking a hundred questions but at mention of chauvelins name she started in quick alarm afraid for the dear life she would have died to save  but how can we get back she gasped the roads are full of soldiers between here and calais and     we are not going back to calais sweetheart he said but just the other side of gris nez not half a league from here the boat of the day dream will meet us there  the boat of the day dream  yes he said with a merry laugh another little trick of mine i should have told you before that when i slipped that note into the hut i also added another for armand which i directed him to leave behind and which has sent chauvelin and his men running full tilt back to the chat gris after me but the first little note contained my real instructions including those to old briggs he had my orders to go out further to sea and then towards the west when well out of sight of calais he will send the galley to a little creek he and i know of just beyond gris nez the men will look out for mewe have a preconcerted signal and we will all be safely aboard whilst chauvelin and his men solemnly sit and watch the creek which is just opposite the chat gris  the other side of gris nez but i    i cannot walk percy she moaned helplessly as trying to struggle to her tired feet she found herself unable even to stand  i will carry you dear he said simply the blind leading the lame you know  sir andrew was ready too to help with the precious burden but sir percy would not entrust his beloved to any arms but his own  when you and she are both safely on board the day dream he said to his young comrade and i feel that mlle suzannes eyes will not greet me in england with reproachful looks then it will be my turn to rest  and his arms still vigorous in spite of fatigue and suffering closed round marguerites poor weary body and lifted her as gently as if she had been a feather  then as sir andrew discreetly kept out of earshot there were many things said or rather whispered which even the autumn breeze did not catch for it had gone to rest  all his fatigue was forgotten his shoulders must have been very sore for the soldiers had hit hard but the mans muscles seemed made of steel and his energy was almost supernatural it was a weary tramp half a league along the stony side of the cliffs but never for a moment did his courage give way or his muscles yield to fatigue on he tramped with firm footstep his vigorous arms encircling the precious burden and    no doubt as she lay quiet and happy at times lulled to momentary drowsiness at others watching through the slowly gathering morning light the pleasant face with the lazy drooping blue eyes ever cheerful ever illumined with a goodhumoured smile she whispered many things which helped to shorten the weary road and acted as a soothing balsam to his aching sinews  the manyhued light of dawn was breaking in the east when at last they reached the creek beyond gris nez the galley lay in wait in answer to a signal from sir percy she drew near and two sturdy british sailors had the honour of carrying my lady into the boat  half an hour later they were on board the day dream the crew who of necessity were in their masters secrets and who were devoted to him heart and soul were not surprised to see him arriving in so extraordinary a disguise  armand st just and the other fugitives were eagerly awaiting the advent of their brave rescuer he would not stay to hear the expressions of their gratitude but found the way to his private cabin as quickly as he could leaving marguerite quite happy in the arms of her brother  everything on board the day dream was fitted with that exquisite luxury so dear to sir percy blakeneys heart and by the time they all landed at dover he had found time to get into some of the sumptuous clothes which he loved and of which he always kept a supply on board his yacht  the difficulty was to provide marguerite with a pair of shoes and great was the little middys joy when my lady found that she could put foot on english shore in his best pair  the rest is silencesilence and joy for those who had endured so much suffering yet found at last a great and lasting happiness  but it is on record that at the brilliant wedding of sir andrew ffoulkes bart with mlle suzanne de tournay de basserive a function at which h r h the prince of wales and all the elite of fashionable society were present the most beautiful woman there was unquestionably lady blakeney whilst the clothes of sir percy blakeney were the talk of the jeunesse doree of london for many days  it is also a fact that m chauvelin the accredited agent of the french republican government was not present at that or any other social function in london after that memorable evening at lord grenvilles ball
