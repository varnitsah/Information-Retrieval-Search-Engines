432     introduction   when henry james wrote the reminiscences of his youth he shewed conclusively what indeed could be doubtful to none who knew him that it would be impossible for anyone else to write his life his life was no mere succession of facts such as could be compiled and recorded by another hand it was a densely knit cluster of emotions and memories each one steeped in lights and colours thrown out by the rest the whole making up a picture that no one but himself could dream of undertaking to paint strictly speaking this may be true of every human being but in most lives experience is taken as it comes and left to rest in the memory where it happens to fall henry james never took anything as it came the thing that happened to him was merely the point of departure for a deliberate and as time went on a more and more masterly creative energy which could never leave a sight or sound of any kind until it had been looked at and listened to with absorbed attention pondered in thought linked with its associations and which did not spend itself until the remembrance had been crystallised in expression so that it could then be appropriated like a tangible object to recall his habit of talk is to become aware that he never ceased creating his life in this way as it was lived he was always engaged in the poetic fashioning of experience turning his share of impressions into rounded and lasting images from the beginning this had been his only method of dealing with existence and in later years it even meant a tax upon his strength with which he had consciously to reckon not long before his death he confessed that at last he found himself too much exhausted for the wear and tear of discrimination and the phrase indicates the strain upon him of the mere act of living looked at from without his life was uneventful enough the even career of a man of letters singularly fortunate in all his circumstances within it was a cycle of vivid and incessant adventure known only to himself except in so far as he himself put it into words so much of it as he left unexpressed is lost therefore like a novel that he might have written but of which there can now be no question since its only possible writer is gone  fortunately a great part of it survives in his letters and it is of these that his biography must be composed the material is plentiful for he was at all times a copious letterwriter overflowing into swift and easy improvisation to his family and to the many friends with whom he corresponded regularly his letters have been widely preserved and several thousands of them have passed through my hands ranging from his twentyfifth year until within a few days of his last illness they give as complete a portrait of him as we can now hope to possess his was a nature in which simplicity and complexity were very curiously contrasted and it would need all his own power of fusing innumerable details into coherency to create a picture that would seem sufficient to those who knew him yet even his letters varied as they are give full expression to one side of his life only the side that he shewed to the world he lived in and loved after all the prodigal display of mind that is given in these volumes the free outpouring of curiosity and sympathy and power a close reader must still be left with the sense that something the most essential and revealing strain is little more than suggested here and there the daily drama of his work with all the comfort and joy it brought him does not very often appear as more than an undertone to the conversation of the letters it was like a mystery to which he was dedicated but of which he shrank from speaking quite openly much as he always delighted in sociable communion citizen of the world child of urbanity as he was all his friends must have felt that at heart he lived in solitude and that few were ever admitted into the inner shrine of his labour there it was nevertheless that he lived most intensely and most serenely in outward matters he was constantly haunted by anxiety and never looked forward with confidence he was of those to whom the future is always ominous who dread the treachery of apparent calm even more than actual ill weather it was very different in the presence of his work there he never knew the least failure of assurance he threw his full weight on the belief that supported him and it was never shaken  that belief was in the sanctity and sufficiency of the life of art it was a conviction that needed no reasoning and he accepted it without question it was absolute for him that the work of the imagination was the highest and most honourable calling conceivable being indeed nothing less than the actual creation of life out of the void he did not scruple to claim that except through art there is no life that can be known or appraised it is the artist who takes over the deed so called from the doer to give it back again in the form in which it can be seen and measured for the first time without the brain that is able to close round the loose unappropriated fact and render all its aspects the fact itself does not exist for us this was the standard below which henry james would never allow the conception of his office to drop and he had the reward of complete exemption from any chill of misgiving his life as a creator of art alone with his work was one of unclouded happiness it might be hampered and hindered by external accidents but none of them could touch the real core of his security which was his faith in his vocation and his knowledge of his genius these certainties remained with him always and he would never trifle with them in any mood his impatience with argument on the whole aesthetic claim was equally great whether it was argument in defence of the sanctuary or in profanation of it silence seclusion concentration he held to be the only fitting answer for an artist he disliked the idea that the service of art should be questioned and debated in the open still more to see it organised and paraded and publicly celebrated as though the world could do it any acceptable honour he had as little in common with those who would use the artistic profession to persuade and proselytise as with those who would brandish it defiantly in the face of the vulgar  thus it is that he is seldom to be heard giving voice to the matters which most deeply occupied him he preferred to dwell with them apart and to leave them behind when he emerged sometimes he would drop a word that shewed what was passing beneath sometimes on a particular challenge or to one in whom he felt an understanding sympathy he would speak out with impressive authority but generally he liked to enter into other peoples thought and to meet them on their own ground there his natural kindliness and his keen dramatic interest were both satisfied at once he enjoyed friendship his letters shew how freely and expansively and with his steady and vigilant eye he watched the play of character he was insatiable for anything that others could give him from their personal lives whatever he could seize in this way was food for his own ruminating fancy he welcomed any grain of reality any speck of significance round which his imagination could pile its rings it was very noticeable how promptly and eagerly he would reach out to such things as they floated by in talk it was as though he feared to leave them to inexpert hands and felt that other people could hardly be trusted with their own experience he remembered how much of his time he had spent in exploring their consciousness when he spoke of himself as a confirmed spectator one who looked on from the brink instead of plunging on his own account but if this seemed a pale substitute for direct contact he knew very well that it was a much richer and more adventurous life really than it is given to most people to lead there is no life to the man who does not feel it no adventure to the man who cannot see the whole of it the greatest share goes to the man who can taste it most fully however it reaches him henry james might sometimes look back as he certainly did with a touch of ruefulness in reflecting on all the experience he had only enjoyed at second hand but he could never doubt that what he had he possessed much more truly than any of those from whom he had taken it there was no hour in which he was not alive with the whole of his sensibility he could scarcely persuade himself that he might have had time for more and indeed at other moments he would admit that he had lived in the way that was at any rate the right way for him even his very twinges of regret were not wasted like everything else they helped to swell the sum of life as they did to such purpose for strether the poor sensitive gentleman of the ambassadors whose manner of living was very near his creators  these letters then while they shew at every point the abundant life he led in his surroundings have to be read with the remembrance that the central fact of all the fact that gave everything else its meaning to himself is that of which least is told the gap moreover cannot be filled from other sources he seems to have taken pains to leave nothing behind him that should reveal this privacy he put forth his finished work to speak for itself and swept away all the traces of its origin there was a high pride in his complete lack of tenderness towards the evidence of past labourthe notes manuscripts memoranda that a man of letters usually accumulates and that shew him in the company of his work it is only to the stroke of chance which left two of his novels unfinished that we owe the outspoken colloquies with himself since published over the germination of those storiesa door of entry into the presence of his imagination that would have been summarily closed if he had lived to carry out his plan and though in the prefaces to the collected edition of his works we have what is perhaps the most comprehensive statement ever made of the life of art a biographia literaria without parallel for fulness and elaboration he was there dealing with his books in retrospect as a critic from without analysing and reconstructing his own creations or if he went further than this and touched on the actual circumstances of their production it was because these had for him the charm of an old romance remote enough to be recalled without indiscretion so it is that while in a sense he was the most personal of writersfor he could not put three words together without marking them as his own and giving them the very ring of his voiceyet compared with other such deliberate craftsmen as stevenson or gustave flaubert he baffles and evades curiosity about the private affairs of his work if curiosity were merely futile it would be fitting to suppress the chance relic i shall offer in a momentfor it so happens that a single glimpse of unique clarity is open to us revealing him as no one saw him in his life but the attempt to picture the mind of an artist is only an intrusion if it is carried into trivial and inessential things it can never be pushed too far as henry james would have been the first to maintain into a real sharing of his aesthetic life  the relic in question consists of certain pencilled pages found among his papers in which he speaks with only himself for listener they belong to the same order as the notes for the unfinished novels but they are even more informal and confidential nothing else of the kind seems to have survived the schemes and motives that must have swarmed in his brain far too numerously for notation have all vanished but this one at rye some years before the end he began one night to feel his way towards a novel which he had in minda subject afterwards abandoned in the form projected at first the rough notes in which he casts about to clear the ground are mostly filled with the mere details of his planthe division of the action the characters required a tentative scenario these i pass over in order to quote some passages where he suddenly breaks away leaves his imaginary scene and surrenders to the awe and wonder of finding himself again where he has so often stood before on the threshold and brink of creation it is as though for once at an hour of midnight silence and solitude he opened the innermost chamber of his mind and stood face to face with his genius there is no moment of all his days in which it is now possible to approach him more closely such a moment represented to himself the pith of lifethe first tremor of inspiration in which he might be almost afraid to stir or breathe for fear of breaking the spell if it were not that he goes to meet it with a peculiar confidence       i take this up again after an interruptioni in fact throw myself      upon it under the secousse of its being brought home to me even      more than i expected that my urgent material reasons for getting      settled at productive work again are of the very most imperative      je mentendsi have had a discomfiture through a stupid      misapprehension of my own indeed and i must now take up projected      tasksthis long time entrevus and brooded over with the firmest      possible hand i neednt expatiate on thison the sharp      consciousness of this hour of the dimlydawning new year i mean i      simply make an appeal to all the powers and forces and divinities      to whom ive ever been loyal and who havent failed me yetafter      all never never yet infinitely interestingand yet somehow with      a beautiful sharp poignancy in it that makes it strange and rather      exquisitely formidable as with an unspeakable deep agitation the      whole artistic question that comes up for me in the train of this      idea  of the donnée for a situation that i began here the      other day to fumble out i mean i come back i come back yet again      and again to my only seeing it in the dramatic wayas i can only      see everything and anything now the way that filled my mind and      floated and uplifted me when a fortnight ago i gave my few      indications to x momentary sidewindsthings of no real      authoritybreak in every now and then to put their inferior little      questions to me but i come back i come back as i say i all      throbbingly and yearningly and passionately oh mon bon come back      to this way that is clearly the only one in which i can do anything      now and that will open out to me more and more and that has      overwhelming reasons pleading all beautifully in its breast what      really happens is that the closer i get to the problem of the      application of it in any particular case the more i get into      that application so that the more doubts and torments fall away      from me the more i know where i am the more everything spreads      and shines and draws me on and im justified of my logic and my      passion causons causons mon bonoh celestial soothing      sanctifying process with all the high sane forces of the sacred      time fighting through it on my side let me fumble it gently and      patiently outwith fever and fidget laid to restas in all the      old enchanted months it only looms it only shines and shimmers      too beautiful and too interesting it only hangs there too rich      and too full and with too much to give and to pay it only presents      itself too admirably and too vividly too straight and square and      vivid as a little organic and effective action       thus just these first little wavings of the oh so tremulously      passionate little old wand now make for me i feel a sort of      promise of richness and beauty and variety a sort of portent of      the happy presence of the elements the good days of last august      and even my broken september and my better october come back to me      with their gage of divine possibilities and i welcome these to my      arms i press them with unutterable tenderness i seem to emerge      from these recent bad daysthe fruit of blind accidentand the      prospect clears and flushes and my poor blest old genius pats me      so admirably and lovingly on the back that i turn i screw round      and bend my lips to passionately in my gratitude kiss its hands  to the exaltation of this wonderful unbosoming he had been brought by fifty years of devout and untiring service where so little is heard of it all the amount of patience and energy that he had consecrated to it might easily be mistaken his immense industry all through his crowded london years passes almost unnoticed so little it seems to conflict with this life in the world his share in which with the close friendships he formed and the innumerable relations he cultivated could have been no fuller if he had had nothing to do but to amuse himself with the spectacle in one way however it is possible to divine how heavily the weight of his work pressed on him the change that divides the general tone and accent of his younger and middle age from that of his later years is too striking to be overlooked the impression is unmistakeable that for a long while indeed until he was almost an old man he felt the constant need of husbanding and economising his resources so that except to those who knew him intimately he was apt to seem a little cold and cautious hesitating to commit himself freely or to allow promiscuous claims later on all this was very different there were certain habits of reserve perhaps that he never threw off all his friends remember for example how carefully he distinguished the different angles of his affection so to call themadjusting his various relations as though in fear lest they should cross each other and form an embarrassing complexity yet any scruples or precautions of this sort that still hung about him only enhanced the large and genial authority of his presence there seemed to have come a time when after long preparation and cogitation he was able to relax and to enjoy the fruit of his labour not indeed that his labour was over it never was that while strength lasted but he gave the effect of feeling himself to be at length completely the master of his situation at ease and at home in his world the new note is very perceptible in the letters which broaden out with opulent vigour as time goes on reaching their best comparatively late  that at last he felt at home was doubtless indeed the literal truth and it was enough to account for this ample liberation of spirit his decision to settle in europe the great step of his life was inevitable though it was not taken without long reflection but it was none the less a decision for which he had to pay heavily as he was himself very well aware if he regarded his own part as that of an onlooker the sense in which he understood observation was to the highest degree exacting he watched indeed but he watched with every faculty and he intended that every thread of intelligence he could throw out to seize the truth of the old historic world should be as strong as instruction study general indoctrination could make it it would be useless for him to live where the human drama most attracted him unless he could grasp it with an assured hand and he could never do this if he was to remain a stranger and a sojourner merely feeding on the picturesque surface of appearances to justify his expatriation he must work his own life completely into the texture of his new surroundings and the story of his middle years is to be read as the most patient and laborious of attempts to do so its extraordinary success need hardly be insisted on its failure necessary and foredoomed from certain points of view is perhaps not less obvious but the great fact of interest is the sight of him taking up the task with eyes it is needless to say fully open to all its demands and never resting until he could be certain of having achieved all that was possible so long as he was in the thick of it the task occupied the whole of his attention he took it with full seriousness there never was a scholar more immersed in research than was henry james in the study of his chosen world there were times indeed when he might be thought to take it even more seriously than the case required the world is not used to such deference from a rare critical talent and it certainly has much less respect for its own standards than henry james had or seemed to have his respect was of course very freely mingled with irony and yet it would be rash to say that his irony preponderated he probably felt that this in his condition was a luxury which he could only afford within limits he could never forget that he had somehow to make up to himself for arriving as an alien from a totally different social climate for his own satisfaction he had to wake and toil while others slept keeping his everready and rebellious criticism for an occasional hour of relief  the world with which he thus sought to identify himself was a small affair by most of our measurements it was a circle of sensibilities that it might be easy to dismiss as hypertrophied and overcivilised too deeply smothered in the veils of artificial life to repay so much patient attention yet the little world of urbane leisure satisfied him because he found a livelier interest always in the results and effects and implications of things than in the groundwork itself so that the field of study he desired was that in which initial forces had travelled furthest from their prime passing step by step from their origin to the level where diffused and transformed they were still just discernible to acute perception it is not through any shy timidity that so often in his books he requires us to infer the presence of naked emotion from the faintest stirrings of an all but unruffled surface it is because these monitory signals transmitted from so far tell a story that would be weakened by a directer method the tiny movement that is the last expression of an act or a fact carries within it the history of all it has passed through on the waya treasure of interest that the act the fact in itself had not possessed and so in the social scene wherever its crude beginnings have been left furthest behind wherever its forms have been most rubbed and toned by the hands of succeeding generations there he found not an obliteration of sharp character but a positive enhancement of it with the whole of its past crowded into its bosom the kind of life therefore that might have been thought too trifling to bear the weight of his grave and powerful scrutiny was exactly the life that he pursued for its expressive value he clung to civilisation he was faithful throughout to a few yards of townpavement not because he was scared by the rough freedom of the wild but rather because he was impatient of its insipidity he is very often to be heard crying out against the tyrannous claims of his world when they interfere with his work his leisure his health but at the moment of greatest revulsion he never suggests that the claims may be fraudulent after all or that this small corner of modernity is not the best and most fruitful that the age has to shew  it must be a matter of pride to an english reader that this corner happened to be found among ourselves henry james came to london however more by a process of exhaustion than by deliberate choice and plenty of chastening considerations for a londoner will appear in his letters if he elected to live among thick english wits rather than in any nimbler atmosphere it was at first largely because english ways and manners lay more open to an explorer than the closer compacter societies of the mainland gradually as we know well his affection was kindled into devoted loyalty it remained true none the less that with much that is common ground among educated people of our time and place he was never really in touch one has only to think of the part played in the england he frequented by school and college by countryhomes by church and politics and professions to understand how much of the ordinary consciousness was closed to him yet it is impossible to say that these limitations were imposed on him only because he was a stranger among strangers they belonged to the conditions of his being from much further back they were implied in his queer unanchored youth in which he and his greatly gifted family had been able to grow in the free exercise of their talents without any of the foundations of settled life henry jamess genius opened and flourished in the void his ripe wisdom and culture seemed to have been able to dispense entirely with the mere training that most people require before they can feel secure in their critical outlook and sense of proportion there could be no better proof of the fact that imagination if only there is enough of it will do the work of all the other faculties unaided whatever were the gaps in his knowledgeknowledge of life generally and of the life of the mind in particularhis imagination covered them all and so it was that without ever acquiring a thousand things that go to the making of a full experience and a sound taste he yet enjoyed and possessed everything that it was in them to give  his taste indeed his judgment of quality seems to have been bestowed upon him in its essentials like a gift of nature from the very first he was sure of his taste and could account for it his earliest writing shews if anything too large a portion of tact and composure a critic might have said that such a perfect control of his means was not the most hopeful sign in a young author henry james reversed the usual procedure of a beginner keeping warily to matter well within his power of managementand this is observable too in his early lettersuntil he was ready to deal with matter more robust in his instinct for perfection he never went wrongnever floundered into raw enthusiasms never lost his way never had painfully to recover himself he travelled steadily forward with no need of guidance enriching himself with new impressions and wasting none of them he accepted nothing that did not minister in some way to the use of his gifts whatever struck him as impossible to assimilate to these he passed by without a glance he could not be tempted by any interest unrelated to the central line of his work he had enough even so he felt to occupy a dozen lives and he grudged every moment that did not leave its deposit of stuff appropriate to his purpose the play of his thought was so ample and ardent that it disguised his resolute concentration he responded so lavishly and to so much that he seemed ready to take up and transform and adorn whatever was offered him but this in truth was far from the fact and by shifting the recollection one may see the impatient gesture with which he would sweep aside the distraction that made no appeal to him it was natural that he should care nothing for any abstract speculation or inquiry he was an artist throughout desiring only the refracted light of human imperfection never the purity of colourless reason more surprising was his refusal for it was almost that of the appeal of musicand not wordless music only but even the song and melody of poetry it cannot be by accident that poetry scarcely appears at all in such a picture of a literary life as is given by his letters the purely lyrical ear seems to have been strangely sealed in himhe often declared as much himself and poetry in general though he could be deeply stirred by it he inclined to put away from him perhaps for the very reason that it meant too forcible a deflection from the right line of his energy all this careful gathering up of his powers in any case this determined deafness to irrelevant voices gave a commanding warrant to the critical panoply of his later life his certainty and consistency his principle his intellectual integrityby all these the pitch of his opinions wherever he delivered them reached a height that was unforgettably impressive  i have tried to touch so far as possible on the different strains in henry jamess artistic experience but to many who read these letters it will be another aspect altogether that his name first recalls they will remember how much of his life was lived in his relations with his countless friends and how generously he poured out his best for them but if as i have suggested much of his mind appears fitfully and obscurely in his letters this side is fully irradiated from first to last never surely has any circle of friendship received so magnificent a tribute of expressed affection and sympathy it was lavished from day to day and all the resources of his art were drawn upon to present it with due honour as time goes on a kind of personal splendour shines through the correspondence which only becomes more natural more direct a communication of himself as it is uttered with increasing mastery the familiar form of the letter was changed under his hand into what may really be called a new province of art a revelation of possibilities hitherto unexplored perfect in expression as they are these letters are true extemporisations thrown off always at great speed as though with a single sweep of the hand for all their richness of texture and roundness of phrase at their most characteristic they are like free flights of virtuosity flung out with enjoyment in the hours of a masters ease and the abundance of his creative vigour is shewn by the fact that there should always be so much more of it to spare even after the exhausting strain of his regular work but the greater wonder is that this liberal gesture never became mechanical never a fixed manner displayed for any and all alike without regard to the particular mind addressed not for a moment does he forget to whom he is speaking he writes in the thought of his correspondent always perceptibly turning to that relation singled out for the time from all the rest each received of his best but some peculiar inalienable share in it  if anything can give to those who did not know him an impression of henry jamess talk it will be some of the finest of these later letters one difference indeed is immediately to be marked his pondering hesitation as he talked his search over the whole field of expression for the word that should do justice to the picture forming in his mindthis gives place in the letters to a flow unchecked one sonorous phrase uncoiling itself after another without effort pen in hand or as he finally preferred dictating to his secretary it was apparently easier for him to seize upon the images he sought to detach one by one from the clinging and populous background of his mind in conversation the effort seemed to be greater and save in rare moments of exceptional fervourno one who heard him will forget how these recurred more and more in the last year of his life under the deep excitement of the warhe liked to take his time in working out his thought with due deliberation but apart from this the letters exactly reflect the colour and contour of his talkhis grandiose courtesy his luxuriant phraseology his relish for some extravagantly colloquial turn embedded in a ciceronian period his humour at once so majestic and so burly intercourse with him was not quite easy perhaps his style was too hieratic too richly adorned and arrayed for that but it was enough to surrender simply to the current of his thought the listener felt himself gathered up and cared forfelt that henry james assumed all the responsibility and would deal with the occasion in his own way that way was never to give a mere impersonal display of his own but to create and develop a reciprocal relation to both sides of which he was more than capable of doing the fullest justice no words seem satisfactory in describing the dominance he exerted over any scene in which he figuredyet exerted by no overriding or ignoring of the presence of others rather with the quickest most apprehending susceptibility to it but better than by any description is this memory imparted by the eloquent roll and ring of his letters  he grew old in the honour of a wide circle of friends of all ages and of a public which if small was deeply devoted he stood so completely outside the evolution of english literature that his position was special and unrelated but it was a position at last unanimously acknowledged signs of the admiration and respect felt for him by all who held the belief in the art of letters even by those whose line of development most diverged from histhese he unaffectedly enjoyed and many came to him none the less he knew very well that in all he most cared for in what was to him the heart and essence of life he was solitary to the end however much his work might be applauded the spirit of rapt and fervent faith in which it was conceived was a hermitage so he undoubtedly felt that no one else had perceived or divined his story of the figure in the carpet was told of himself no one brought him what he could accept as true and final comprehension he could never therefore feel that he had reached a time when his work was finished and behind him old age only meant an imagination more crowded than ever a denser throng of shapes straining to be released before it was too late he bitterly resented the hindrances of illhealth during some of his last years as an interruption a curtailment of the span of his activity there were so many and so far better books that he still wished to write his interest in life growing rather than weakening clashed against the artificial restraints as they seemed of physical age whenever these were relaxed it leaped forward to work again the challenge of the war with germany roused him to a height of passion he had never touched before in the outer world and if the strain of it exhausted his strength as well it might it gave him one last year of the fullest and deepest experience perhaps that he had ever known it wore out his body which was too tired and spent to live longer but he carried away the power of his spirit still in its prime     note   the best thanks of the editor are due to henry jamess family and particularly to his niece mrs bruce porter for much valuable help mrs porter undertook the collecting and copying of all the letters addressed to correspondents in america and it is owing to her that the completion of these volumes inevitably hindered by the war has not been further delayed     i  first european years 186974   the letters in this section take up the story of henry jamess life at the exact point to which he brought it in the second instalment of his reminiscences notes of a son and brother it will be remembered that the third volume the middle years of which only a fragment was written opens with his arrival in england in february 1869 and the first letter here printed is dated from london a few days later but in evoking his youth it was no part of henry jamess design to write a consecutive tale and the order of dates and events is constantly obscured in the abundance of his memories for convenience therefore a brief summary may be given of the course of his early years                                       henry james was born on april 15 1843 at 2 washington place new york he was the second child of his parents the elder by a year being his brother william the younger members of the family were wilkinson wilky robertson bob and alice their father henry james the elder was a man whose striking genius has never received full justice except at the hands of his illustrious sons though from them with profound and affectionate admiration he was the most brilliant of a remarkable group of many brothers and sisters whose portraits or some of them are sketched in a small boy and others originally of irish descent the james family had been settled for a couple of generations in the state of new york and in particular at albany the founder of the american branch had been a prosperous man of business whose successful career left him in a position to bequeath to his numerous descendants a fortune large enough to enable them all to live in complete independence of the commercial world henry james the elder has been sometimes described as the reverend but in fact he never occupied any position but that of a detached philosopher lecturer man of letters to his brothers and their extensive progeny he was a trusted and untiring moral support of a kind that many of them distinctly needed the bereavements of the family were many their misfortunes various and his genial charity and good faith were an inexhaustible resource his wife was mary walsh she too belonged to a substantial new york family of scotch origin several members of which are commemorated in a small boy her sister katharine was for many years an inmate of the elder henrys household and to the end of her life the cherished friend of his children  the second henry james has left so full and vivid a portrait of his father that it is unnecessary to dwell on the happy influences under which the family passed their youth the ideas of the head of the house as his remote speculations were familiarly known at home lay outside the range of his second son but in the preface to a collection of papers posthumously issued in 1884 they are sympathetically expounded and appraised by william james whose adventurous mind impatient of academic rules and forms was more akin to his fathers though it developed on quite other lines it is natural to speak of the father as a swedenborgian for the writings of swedenborg had been the chief source of his inspiration and supplied the tincture of his thought he did not however himself admit this description of his point of view which indeed was original and unconventional to the last degree it was directed towards an ideal to use william jamess words of the true relation between mankind and its creator elaborated and reaffirmed in book after book and always in a style so peculiarly vivacious and attractive that it is difficult to explain the indifference with which they were received and which has allowed them to fall completely forgotten to the memory of his fathers courageous spirit his serene simplicity and luminous humour none of which ever failed in the face of repeated disappointment the younger henry years later devoted his beautiful tribute of art and piety  his recollections of childhood began surprisingly enough when he was little more than a year old in the summer of 1844 the parents carried their two infants william and henry for a visit to europe an adventure not altogether lost upon the younger for he actually retained an impression of paris a glimpse of the place vendôme to be the foundation of all his european experience his earliest american memories were of albany but the family were soon established in fourteenth street new york which was their home for some ten years a settlement only broken by family visits and summer weeks by the sea the childrens extraordinarily haphazard and promiscuous education went forward under various teachers their fathers erratic rule having apparently but one principle that they should stay nowhere long enough to receive any formal imprint to henry at least their schooling meant nothing whatever but the opportunity of conducting his own education in his own way and he made the utmost of the easy freedom they enjoyed he was able to stare and brood to his hearts content and thus to feed his imagination on the only pasturage it required  in 1855 the whole household migrated to europe for a visit of three years this the grand event of henrys childhood was really the determination of his whole career for he then absorbed once for all what he afterwards called the european virusthe nostalgia for the old world which made it impossible for him to rest in peace elsewhere all this time was one long draught of romance though indeed as an initiation into the ways of french and english life it could hardly have been a more incoherent enterprise true to his law the head of the household planted the young family in one place only to sweep them away as soon as they might begin to form associations there the summer of 1855 was spent at geneva then the classic spot for the acquisition of the languages according to the point of view of new york but geneva was abandoned before the end of the year and the family settled in london for the winter at first in berkeley street afterwards in st johns wood for any real contact with the place this was a blank interlude the tuition of a young scotchman later one of r l stevensons masters seems to have been the solitary local tie provided for the children by the middle of 1856 they were in paris and here they were able to use their opportunities a little more fully of these one of the oddest was the educational institution fezandié which they attended for a time but there was more for them to learn at the louvre and the luxembourg and it was to this time that henry james afterwards ascribed his first conscious perception of what might be meant by the life of art in the course of the two following years they twice spent some months at boulognesurmer returning each time to paris again during the second visit to boulogne henry was laid low by the very serious attack of typhus that descends on the last page of a small boy  in 1858 the family was rushed back to america for a year at newport but they were once more at geneva for the winter of 185960 here henry was at first put to the strangest of all his strange educational courses at the severely mathematical and commercial institution rochette but presently pleading for humaner studies he was set free to attend lectures at the academy where at sixteen for the first time and after so many arid experiences he tasted instruction more or less adapted to his parts needless to say it did not last long in the following summer the three elder boys were sent as private pupils to the houses of certain professors at bonn by this time williams marked talent for painting had decided his ambition and it was quite in line with the originality of the household that they should at once return to america leaving paris behind them for good in order that william might study art henry alone of them by his account felt that their proceedings needed a great deal of explanation the new experiment as shortlived as all the rest was entered upon with ardour and the family was reestablished at newport in the autumn of 1860 the distinguished master william hunt had his studio there and for a time henry himself haunted it tentatively while his brother was working with a zeal that was soon spent  if we may trust his own report henry james had reached the age of seventeen with a curiously vague understanding of his own talent no doubt it is possible to read the notes too literally and indeed i have the fortunate opportunity of giving a sidelight upon this period of his youth which proves as much but if he was not quite the indeterminate brooder he depicts he was far from rivalling the unusual precocity and decision of his brothers and he was only now beginning to take real stock of his gifts he had been provided with almost none of the sort of training by which he might have profited and it is not to be supposed that his always indulgent parent would have neglected the taste of a literary son if it had shewn itself distinctly he had been left to discover his line of progress as best he might and his advance towards literature was slow and shy yet it would seem that by this time he must have made up his mind more definitely than he suggests in recalling the newport years the sidelight i mentioned is thrown by some interesting notes sent me by mr thomas sergeant perry who made the acquaintance of the family at newport and was to remain their lifelong friend his description shews that henry james had now his own ambitions even if he preferred to nurse them unobtrusively       the first time i saw the james boys writes mr perry was at the      end of june or early in july 1858 shortly after their arrival in      newport for a years stay this year of their life is not recorded      by h j in his notes of a son and brother or rather its      memories are crowded into the chronicle of the longer stay of the      family in america beginning with 1860 mr duncan pell who knew      mr james the father told his son and me that we ought to call on      the boys and we did but they were out a day or two later we      called again and found them in we all went together to the pells      house and spent the evening in simple joys       i have often thought that the three brothers shewed that evening      some of their characteristic qualities i remember walking with      wilky hanging on my arm talking to me as if he had found an old      friend after long absence when we got to the house and the rest of      us were chattering h j sat on the windowseat reading leslies      life of constable with a certain air of remoteness william was      full of merriment and we were soon playing a simple and childish      game in a small boy and others h j speaks of wilkys      successful sociability his instinct for intercourse his genius      for making friends and these amiable traits shewed themselves      that evening as clearly as his other brothers jollity very soon      afterwards h j with his two younger brothers entered the school      where i was studying that of the rev w c leverett who is      mentioned in the notes i recall h j as an uninterested      scholar part of one day in a week was devoted to declaiming      eloquent pieces from sargents standard speaker and i have not      forgotten his amusement at seeing in the manual of english      literature that we were studying in the half page devoted to mrs      browning that she had married r browning himself no mean poet      this compact information gave him great delight for we were      reading browning it was then too that he read for the first time      the vicar of wakefield and with great pleasure       it was at that time that we began to take long walks together      almost every afternoon along the cliffs over the beaches to the      paradise rocks to the point or inland wherever it might be a      thousand scrappy recollections of the strolls still remain      fragments of talk visions of the place thus it was near the lily      pond that we long discussed fouriers plan for regenerating the      world harry had heard his father describe the great reformers      proposal to establish universal happiness and like a good son he      tried to carry the good news further at another time he fell      under the influence of ruskin he devoted himself to the      conscientious copying of a leaf and very faithfully drew a little      rock that jutted above the surface of the lily pond these artistic      gropings and those in hunts studio where he copied casts were      not his main interest his chief interest was literature we read      the english magazines and reviews and the revue des deux mondes      with rapture we fished in various waters and i well remember when      w j brought home a volume of schopenhauer and showed us with      delight the ugly mug of the philosopher and read us amusing      specimens of his delightful pessimism it was w j too who told us      about renan one cool evening of february when the twilight lingers      till after six h j in his books speaks without enthusiasm of      his school studies but he and i read together at mr leveretts      school a very fair amount of latin literature like shakespeare he      had less greek       the departure of the james family to geneva in october 1859 was a      grievous blow they returned however with characteristic      suddenness the next september and came at once to newport during      their stay abroad h j and i had kept up a lively correspondence      most unfortunately all his letters which i had faithfully      preserved were destroyed during one of my absences in europe and      among them a poem probably the only thing of the kind he ever      tried a short narrative in the manner of tennysons dora he had      entirely forgotten it very naturally when he said in his notes      the muse was of course the muse of prose fictionnever for the      briefest hour in my case the presumable not to say the presuming      the muchtakingforgranted muse of rhyme with whom i had never      had even in thought the faintest flirtation       after his return to america in 1860 the question what he should do      with his life became more urgent of course it was in literature      that he took the greatest interest one task that he set himself      was translating alfred de mussets lorenzaccio and into this      version he introduced some scenes of his own exactly what they      were i do not recall though i read them with an even intenser      interest than i did the original text he was continually writing      stories mainly of a romantic kind the heroes were for the most      part villains but they were white lambs by the side of the      sophisticated heroines who seemed to have read all balzac in the      cradle and to be positively dripping with lurid crimes he began      with these extravagant pictures of course in adoration of the great      master whom he always so warmly admired       h j seldom entrusted these early efforts to the criticism of his      familythey did not see all he wrote they were too keen critics      too sharpwitted to be allowed to handle every essay of this      budding talent their judgments would have been too true their      comments would have been too merciless and hence for sheer      selfpreservation he hid a good part of his work from them not      that they were cruel far from it their frequent solitude in      foreign parts where they had no familiar companions had welded      them together in a way that would have been impossible in america      where each would have had separate distractions of his own their      loneliness forced them to grow together most harmoniously but      their long exercise in literary criticism would have made them      possibly merciless judges of h js crude beginnings       the following anecdote will shew what i mean mr james the father      was getting out a somewhat abstruse book called substance and      shadow or morality and religion in their relation to life w j      amused himself and all the family by designing a small cut to be      put on the title page representing a man beating a dead horse      this will illustrate the joyous chaff that filled the jameses      house there was no limit to it there were always books to tell      about and laugh over or to admire and there was an abundance of      good talk with no shadow of pedantry or priggishness h js      spirits were never so high as those of the others if they had      been he still would have had but little chance in a conflict of      wits with them on account of his slow speech his halting choice      of words and phrases but as a companion in our walks he was      delightful he had plenty of humour as his books shew and above      all he had a most affectionate heart no one ever had more certain      and more unobtrusive kindness than he he had a certain air of      aloofness but he was not indifferent to those who had no claim      upon him and to his friends he was most tenderly devoted those      who knew him will not need to be assured of that  the civil war which presently broke upon the leisurely life of newport went deep into the mind and character of henry james but his part in it could only be that of an onlooker for about this time an accidental strain developed results that gave him many years of uncertain health he had to live much in the experience of his brothers which he eagerly did the two youngest fought in the war wilky receiving a grave wound of which he carried the mark for the rest of his lifehe died in 1883 henry went to harvard in 1862 where william no longer a painter but a man of science had preceded him the year before by the beginning of 1864 the rest of the family had settled in boston at ashburton place whence they finally moved out to cambridge in 1866 this was the end of their wanderings for the remainder of his parents lives cambridge was henrys american home and with the instalment there of his brother william the centre of all the family associations but the long connection with new england never superseded for henry at least the native tie with new york and he was gratified when his name was at last carried back there again many years afterwards by another generation  in boston and cambridge henry james at length touched a purely literary circle the beginning of such fruitful friendships as those with professor c e norton and mr w d howells meant his open and professed dedication to literature the harvard law school left as little direct impression on him as any of his other exposures to ordinary teaching but at last he had finished with these makeshifts his new friends helped him into his proper channel under their auspices he made his way into publication and became a regular contributor of criticism and fiction to several journals and reviews there followed some very uneventful and industrious years disturbed to some extent by illhealth but broken by no long absences from cambridge his constant companion and literary confidant was mr howells who writes to me that people were very much struck with his work in the magazinethe atlantic monthly of which this friend was at that time assistant editorbut mostly not pleased with it it was a common thing to hear them say oh yes we like mr james very much but we cannot bear his stories mr howells adds i could scarcely exaggerate the intensity of our literary association it included not only what he was doing and thinking himself in fiction and criticism of whatever he was reading but what other people were trying to do in our american magazines beneath these activities we are to imagine the deep preoccupation growing and growing of the idea of a possible return to europe it is not very clear why the satisfaction of his wish was delayed for as long as it was his doubtful health can hardly have amounted to a hindrance and the authority of his parents was far too light and sympathetic to stand in his way yet it is only by the end of 1868 as i find from a letter of that time that a journey to europe has ceased to look positively and aggressively impossible thereafter things move more quickly and three months later he arrives at the great moment memorable ever afterwards of his landing at liverpool                                       from this point the letters speak for themselves and only the slenderest commentary is required he went first to london where the hospitable nortons had been installed on a visit for some while these good friends opened the way to many interesting impressions for him but he was only briefly in london at this time for healths sake he spent three weeks alone at great malvern in some sort of hydropathic establishment among very british company he writes of his great delight in the beauty of the place and how he is gluttonised on british commonplace indoors after a tour which included oxford and cambridge and several english cathedrals he had a few weeks more of london and then passed on to switzerland he was at geneva by the end of may from where he writes that he is very wellwhich has ceased to be a wonder the nortons joined him at vevey he left them in july for a small swiss tour before making the great adventure of crossing the alps for the first time by venice and florence he reached rome in november he gave himself up there to rapturous and solitary wanderings i see no people to speak of or for that matter to speak to in december he was at naples for a fortnight and then returned northwards by assisi perugia genoa avignon to paris italy had made the deep and final impression on him for which he was so well prepared already he writes i feel my bows beneath her weight settle comfortably into the water out of italy you dont know how vulgar a world it is presently he was in england and at malvern again everywhere saturating himself in the sense of old history and romance to make the most of an opportunity which he did not then hope to prolong it behoves me he writes to professor norton as a luckless american diabolically tempted of the shallow and the superficial really to catch the flavour of an old civilization it hardly matters which and to strive to raise myself for one brief moment at least in the attitude of observation at the end of april 1870 he sailed for america  after a year of europe his hunger for the old world was greater than ever but he had no present thought of settling there permanently for two years he resumed the quiet life of his american cambridge busily engaged on a succession of sketches reviews and short stories of which only one a passionate pilgrim survives in the collected edition of his works i enjoy america he says in a letter of 1870 with a poignancy that perpetually surprises me but the wishthe absolute sense of needto see italy again constantly increases he spends a quiet lowtoned sort of winter reading somewhat writing a little and going out occasionally he wrote his first piece of fiction that was long enough to be called a novelwatch and ward afterwards so completely disowned and ignored by him that he always named as his first novel roderick hudson of four years later but the memory of italy had fatally shaken his rest and there began a long and anxious struggle with his sense of duty to his native land in his letters of this time the attitude of the good american remains resolute however its a complex fate being an american he writes early in 1872 and one of the responsibilities it entails is fighting against a superstitious valuation of europe it was still as a tourist and a pilgrim only that he crossed the atlantic again with his sister and aunt miss katharine walsh in may 1872  he came with a definite commission to contribute a series of transatlantic sketches to the american nation and the first material was gathered in an english tour that ranged from chester to north devon still with his sister and aunt he wandered for three months in switzerland north italy and bavaria settling upon paris now alone for the autumn it was here that he began his intimacy with j r lowell in afternoon walks with him between mornings of work and evenings at the théâtre français he declares that he saw no one else in parishis mind was firmly set upon italy to rome he went for the first six months of 1873 where he was now at home enough among ancient solitudes to have time and thought for social novelty thirty years later in his life of william wetmore story he revived the american world of what was still a barely modernised rome the world into which he was plunged by acquaintance with the sculptor and his circle now and thenceforward it was not so much the matter for sketches of travel that he was collecting as it was the matter for the greater part of his bestknown fiction the american in europe was to be his own subject and he began to make it so the summer months were mainly spent at homburg which was also to leave its mark on several of his tales his elder brother joined him when he returned to rome but william contracted a malaria and they moved to florence early in 1874 here henry was soon left alone in rooms on piazza sta maria novella for some months of close and happy concentration on roderick hudson the novel had already been engaged by mr howells for the atlantic monthly and its composition marks the definite end of henry jamess literary apprenticeship he had arrived at it by wary stages of the large amount of work behind him though much of it was of slight value nothing had been wasted every page of his writing had been in the direct line towards the perfect literary manners of his matured skill but hitherto he had written experimentally and to occasion he was now an established novelist in his own right  he returned to america in the autumn of 1874 after some summer wanderings that are shewn by the transatlantic sketches to have taken him through holland and belgium but it happens that at this point there is an almost empty gap of a year and more in his surviving correspondence and it is not possible to follow him closely he disappears with the still agitating question upon his handswhere was he to livehis american loyalty still fighting it out with his european inclination the steps are lost by which the doubt was determined in the course of another year at home it is only certain that when he next came to europe twelve months later it had been quieted for ever     to miss alice james       h js lodging in half moon st and his landlord mr lazarus      fox are described it will be remembered in the middle years      he had arrived in london from america a few days before the date of      the following letter to his sister professor charles norton with      his wife and sisters was living at this time in kensington   7 half moon st w march 10th 1869  ma sœur chérie  i have half an hour before dinnertime why shouldnt i begin a letter for saturdays steamer i really feel as if i had livedi dont say a lifetimebut a year in this murky metropolis i actually believe that this feeling is owing to the singular permanence of the impressions of childhood to which any present experience joins itself on without a broken link in the chain of sensation nevertheless i may say that up to this time i have been crushed under a sense of the mere magnitude of londonits inconceivable immensityin such a way as to paralyse my mind for any appreciation of details this is gradually subsiding but what does it leave behind it an extraordinary intellectual depression as i may say and an indefinable flatness of mind the place sits on you broods on you stamps on you with the feet of its myriad bipeds and quadrupeds in fine it is anything but a cheerful or a charming city yet it is a very splendid one it gives you here at the west end and in the city proper a vast impression of opulence and prosperity but you dont want a dissertation of commonplaces on london and you would like me to touch on my own individual experience well my dear since last week it has been sufficient altho by no means immense on saturday i received a visit from mr leslie stephen blessed man who came unsolicited with the utmost civility in the world and invited me to dine with him the next day this i did in company with miss jane norton his wife made me very welcome and they both appear to much better effect in their own premises than they did in america after dinner he conducted us by the underground railway to see the beasts in the regents park to which as a member of the zoological society he has admittance sundays  in the evening i dined with the invaluable nortons and went with chas and madame miss s and miss jane via underground railway to hear ruskin lecture at university college on greek myths i enjoyed it much in spite of fatigue but as i am to meet him some day through the nortons i shall reserve comments on wednesday evening i dined at the ns toujours norton you see in company with miss dickensdickenss only unmarried daughterplainfaced ladylike in black silk and black lace and the image of her father i exchanged but ten words with her but yesterday my dear old sister was my crowning dayseeing as how i spent the greater part of it in the house of mr wm morris poet fitly to tell the tale i should need a fresh pen paper and spirits a few hints must suffice to begin with i breakfasted by way of a change with the nortons along with mr sam ward who has just arrived and mr aubrey de vere tu sais the catholic poet a pleasant honest old man and very much less highflown than his name he tells good stories in a light natural way after a space i came home and remained until 412 pm when i had given rendezvous to cn and ladies at mr morriss door they going by appointment to see his shop and c having written to say he would bring me morris lives on the same premises as his shop in queens square bloomsbury an antiquated exfashionable region smelling strong of the last century with a hoary effigy of queen anne in the middle morriss poetry you see is only his subtrade to begin with he is a manufacturer of stained glass windows tiles ecclesiastical and medieval tapestry altarcloths and in fine everything quaint archaic preraphaeliteand i may add exquisite of course his business is small and may be carried on in his house the things he makes are so handsome rich and expensive besides being articles of the very last luxury that his fabrique cant be on a very large scale but everything he has and does is superb and beautiful but more curious than anything is himself he designs with his own head and hands all the figures and patterns used in his glass and tapestry and furthermore works the latter stitch by stitch with his own fingersaided by those of his wife and little girls oh ma chère such a wife je nen reviens passhe haunts me still a figure cut out of a missalout of one of rossettis or hunts picturesto say this gives but a faint idea of her because when such an image puts on flesh and blood it is an apparition of fearful and wonderful intensity its hard to say whether shes a grand synthesis of all the preraphaelite pictures ever madeor they a keen analysis of herwhether shes an original or a copy in either case she is a wonder imagine a tall lean woman in a long dress of some dead purple stuff guiltless of hoops or of anything else i should say with a mass of crisp black hair heaped into great wavy projections on each of her temples a thin pale face a pair of strange sad deep dark swinburnian eyes with great thick black oblique brows joined in the middle and tucking themselves away under her hair a mouth like the oriana in our illustrated tennyson a long neck without any collar and in lieu thereof some dozen strings of outlandish beadsin fine complete on the wall was a large nearly fulllength portrait of her by rossetti so strange and unreal that if you hadnt seen her youd pronounce it a distempered vision but in fact an extremely good likeness after dinner we stayed to dinner miss grace miss s s and i morris read us one of his unpublished poems from the second series of his unearthly paradise and his wife having a bad toothache lay on the sofa with her handkerchief to her face there was something very quaint and remote from our actual life it seemed to me in the whole scene morris reading in his flowing antique numbers a legend of prodigies and terrors the story of bellerophon it was around us all the picturesque bricabrac of the apartment every article of furniture literally a specimen of something or other and in the corner this dark silent medieval woman with her medieval toothache morris himself is extremely pleasant and quite different from his wife he impressed me most agreeably he is short burly corpulent very careless and unfinished in his dress and looks a little like b g hosmer if you can imagine b g infinitely magnified and fortified he has a very loud voice and a nervous restless manner and a perfectly unaffected and businesslike address his talk indeed is wonderfully to the point and remarkable for clear good sense he said no one thing that i remember but i was struck with the very good judgment shown in everything he uttered hes an extraordinary example in short of a delicate sensitive genius and taste saved by a perfectly healthy body and temper all his designs are quite as good or rather nearly so as his poetry altogether it was a long rich sort of visit with a strong peculiar flavour of its own ouf what a repulsively long letter this sort of thing wont do a few general reflections a burst of affection say another sheet and i must close farewell dear girl and dear incomparable all  your h     to his mother   7 half moon st w march 26 1869  my dearest mother  this will have been my fifth weekly bundle since my arrival and i cant promiseor rather i forbear to threatenthat it shall be as hugely copious as the others but theres no telling where my pen may take me you see i am still in what my old landlord never speaks of but as this great metropolis and i hope you will believe me when i add moreover that i am in the best of health and spirits during the last week i have been knocking about in a quiet way and have deeply enjoyed my little adventures the last few days in particular have been extremely pleasant you have perhaps fancied that i have been rather stingyminded towards this wondrous england and that i was not taking things in quite the magnanimous intellectual manner that befits a youth of my birth and breeding the truth is that the face of things here throws a sensitive american back on himselfback on his prejudices and national passions and benumbs for a while the faculty of appreciation and the sense of justice but with time if he is worth a copper the characteristic beauty of the land dawns upon him just as certain vicious chilblains are now dawning upon my poor feet and he feels that he would fain plant his restless feet into the rich old soil and absorb the burden of the misty air if i were in anything like working order now i should be very sorry to leave england i should like to settle down for a year and expose my body to the english climate and my mind to english institutions but a truce to this cheap discursive stuff i date the moment from which my mind rose erect in impartial might to a little sail i took on the thames the other day in one of the little penny steamers which shoot along its dirty bosom it was a grey raw english day and the banks of the river as far as i went hideous nevertheless i enjoyed it it was too cold to go up to greenwich the weather by the way since my arrival has been horribly damp and bleak and no more like spring than in a boston january the next day i went with several of the nortons to dine at ruskins out of town this too was extremely pleasant ruskin himself is a very simple matter in face in manner in talk in mind he is weakness pure and simple i use the word not invidiously but scientifically he has the beauties of his defects but to see him only confirms the impression given by his writing that he has been scared back by the grim face of reality into the world of unreason and illusion and that he wanders there without a compass and a guideor any light save the fitful flashes of his beautiful genius the dinner was very nice and easy owing in a great manner to ruskins two charming young nieces who live with himone a lovely young irish girl with a rich virginal broguea creature of a truly delightful british maidenly simplicityand the other a nice scotch lass who keeps house for him but i confess coldblooded villain that i am that what i most enjoyed was a portrait by titianan old doge a work of transcendent beauty and elegance such as to give one a new sense of the meaning of art but dearest mammy i must pull up pile in scraps of news osculate my sister most passionately likewise my aunt be assured of my sentiments and present them to my father and brother  thy henry jr     to his mother   florence hôtel de leurope october 13th 1869  my darling mammy  for the past six weeks that i have been in italy ive hardly until within a day or two exchanged five minutes talk with any one but the servants in the hotels and the custodians in the churches as far as meeting people is concerned ive not as yet had in europe a very brilliant record yesterday i met at the uffizi miss anna vernon of newport and her friend mrs carter with whom i had some discourse and on the same morning i fell in with a somewhat seedy and sickly american who seemed to be doing the gallery with an awful minuteness and who after some conversation proposed to come and see me he called this morning and has just left but he seems a vague and feeble brother and i anticipate no wondrous joy from his acquaintance the hardly in the clause above is meant to admit two or three englishmen with whom i have been thrown for a few hours one especially whom i met at verona won my affections so rapidly that i was really sad at losing him but he has vanished leaving only a delightful impression and not even a namea man of about 38 with a sort of quiet perfection of english virtue about him such as i have rarely found in another willy asked me in one of his recent letters for an opinion of the english which i havent yet had time to givetho at times i have felt as if it were a theme on which i could write from a full mind in fact however i have very little right to have any opinion on the matter ive seen far too few specimens and those too superficially the only thing im certain about is that i like themlike them heartily w asked if as individuals they kill the individual american to this i would say that the englishmen i have met not only kill but bury in unfathomable depths the americans i have met a set of people less framed to provoke national selfcomplacency than the latter it would be hard to imagine there is but one word to use in regard to themvulgar vulgar vulgar their ignorancetheir stingy defiant grudging attitude towards everything europeantheir perpetual reference of all things to some american standard or precedent which exists only in their own unscrupulous windbagsand then our unhappy poverty of voice of speech and of physiognomythese things glare at you hideously on the other hand we seem a people of character we seem to have energy capacity and intellectual stuff in ample measure what i have pointed at as our vices are the elements of the modern man with culture quite left out its the absolute and incredible lack of culture that strikes you in common travelling americans the pleasantness of the english on the other side comes in a great measure from the fact of their each having been dipped into the crucible which gives them a sort of coating of comely varnish and colour they have been smoothed and polished by mutual social attrition they have manners and a language we lack both but particularly the latter i have seen very nasty britons certainly but as a rule they are such as to cause your heart to warm to them the women are at once better and worse than the men occasionally they are hard flat and greasy and dowdy to downright repulsiveness but frequently they have a modest matronly charm which is the perfection of womanishness and which makes italian and frenchwomenand to a certain extent even our ownseem like a species of feverish highlydeveloped invalids you see englishmen here in italy to a particularly good advantage in the midst of these false and beautiful italians they glow with the light of the great fact that after all they love a bathtub and they hate a lie  16th sunday i have seen some nice americans and i still love my country i have called upon mrs huntington and her two daughterslate of cambridgewhom i met in switzerland and who have an apartment here the daughters more than reconcile me to the shrillvoiced sirens of new englands rockbound coast the youngest is delightfully beautiful and sweetand the elder delightfully sweet and plainwith a plainness qui vaut bien des beautés  maman de mon âme farewell i have kept my letter three days hoping for news from home i hope you are not paying me back for that silence of six weeks ago blessings on your universal heads  thy lone and loving exile h j jr     to william james   hôtel dangleterre rome oct 30th 1869  my dearest wm  the afternoon after i had posted those two letters i took a walk out of florence to an enchanting old chartreusean ancient monastery perched up on top of a hill and turreted with little cells like a feudal castle i attacked it and carried it by stormie obtained admission and went over it on coming out i swore to myself that while i had life in my body i wouldnt leave a country where adventures of that complexion are the common incidents of your daily constitutional but that i would hurl myself upon rome and fight it out on this line at the peril of my existence here i am then in the eternal city it was easy to leave florence the cold had become intolerable and the rain perpetual i started last night and at 1012 oclock and after a bleak and fatiguing journey of 12 hours found myself here with the morning light there are several places on the route i should have been glad to see but the weather and my own condition made a direct journey imperative i rushed to this hotel a very slow and obstructed rush it was i confess thanks to the longueurs and lenteurs of the papal dispensation and after a wash and a breakfast let myself loose on the city from midday to dusk i have been roaming the streets que vous en diraije at lastfor the first timei live it beats everything it leaves the rome of your fancyyour educationnowhere it makes veniceflorenceoxfordlondonseem like little cities of pasteboard i went reeling and moaning thro the streets in a fever of enjoyment in the course of four or five hours i traversed almost the whole of rome and got a glimpse of everythingthe forum the coliseum stupendissimo the pantheon the capitol st peters the column of trajan the castle of st angeloall the piazzas and ruins and monuments the effect is something indescribable for the first time i know what the picturesque is in st peters i stayed some time its even beyond its reputation it was filled with foreign ecclesiasticsgreat armies encamped in prayer on the marble plains of its pavementan inexhaustible physiognomical study to crown my day on my way home i met his holiness in persondriving in prodigious purple statesitting dim within the shadows of his coach with two uplifted benedictory fingerslike some dusky hindoo idol in the depths of its shrine even if i should leave rome tonight i should feel that i have caught the keynote of its operation on the senses i have looked along the grassy vista of the appian way and seen the topmost stonework of the coliseum sitting shrouded in the light of heaven like the edge of an alpine chain ive trod the forum and i have scaled the capitol ive seen the tiber hurrying along as swift and dirty as history from the high tribune of a great chapel of st peters i have heard in the papal choir a strange old man sing in a shrill unpleasant soprano ive seen troops of little tonsured neophytes clad in scarlet marching and countermarching and ducking and flopping like poor little raw recruits for the heavenly host in fine ive seen rome and i shall go to bed a wiser man than i last roseyesterday morning  a toi h j jr     to william james       minny temple is the beloved young cousin commemorated in the last      pages of notes of a son and brother the news of her death came      to h j at malvern almost immediately after the following letter      was written   great malvern march 8th 1870  beloved bill  you ask me in your last letter so cordially to write home every week if its only a line that altho i have very little to say on this windy march afternoon i cant resist the homeward tendency of my thoughts i wrote to alice some eight days agoraving largely about the beauty of malvern in the absence of a better theme so i havent even that topic to make talk of but as i say my thoughts are facing squarely homeward and that is enough now that im in england youd rather have me talk of the present than of pluperfect italy but life furnishes so few incidents here that i cudgel my brains in vain plenty of gentle emotions from the scenery etc but only man is vile among my fellowpatients here i find no intellectual companionship never from a single englishman of them all have i heard the first word of appreciation and enjoyment of the things here that i find delightful to a certain extent this is natural but not to the extent to which they carry it as for the women i give em up in advance i am tired of their plainness and stiffness and tastelessnesstheir dowdy beads and their lindsey woolsey trains nay this is peevish and brutal personally with all their faults they are well enough i revolt from their dreary deathly want ofwhat shall i call itclover hooper has itintellectual graceminny temple has itmoral spontaneity they live wholly in the realm of the cut and dried have you ever been to florence oh yes isnt it a most peculiarly interesting city oh yes i think its so very nice have you read romola oh yes i suppose you admire it oh yes i think it so very clever the english have such a mortal mistrust of anything like criticism or keen analysis which they seem to regard as a kind of maudlin foreign flummery that i rarely remember to have heard on english lips any other intellectual verdict no matter under what provocation than this broad synthesisso immensely clever what exasperates you is not that they cant say more but that they wouldnt if they could ah but they are a great people for all that i reecho with all my heart your impatience for the moment of our meeting again i should despair of ever making you know how your conversation ma manqué or how when regained i shall enjoy it all i ask for is that i may spend the interval to the best advantageand you too the more we shall have to say to each other the better your last letter spoke of father and mother having shocking coldsi hope they have melted away among the things i have recently read is fathers marriage paper in the atlanticwith great enjoyment of its manner and approval of its matter i see he is becoming one of our prominent magazinists he will send me the thing from old and new a young scotchman here gets the nation sent him by his brother from ny whose are the three french papers on women they are so very clever a proposi retract all those brutalities about the engländerinnen they are the mellow mothers and daughters of a mighty race but i must pull in i have still lots of unsatisfied curiosity and unexpressed affection but they must stand over farewell salute my parents and sister and believe me your brother of brothers  h james jr     to his father   great malvern march 19th 70  dear father  the other afternoon i trudged over to worcesterthrough a region so thicksown with good old english effectswith elmscattered meadows and sheepcropped commons and the ivysmothered dwellings of small gentility and highgabled heavytimbered brokenplastered farmhouses and stiles leading to delicious meadow footpaths and lodgegates leading to faroff manorswith all things suggestive of the opening chapters of halfremembered novels devoured in infancythat i felt as if i were pressing all england to my soul as i neared the good old town i saw the great cathedral tower high and square rise far into the clouddappled blue and as i came nearer still i stopped on the bridge and viewed the great ecclesiastical pile cast downward into the yellow severn and going further yet i entered the town and lounged about the close and gazed my fill at that most soulsustaining sightthe waning afternoon far aloft on the broad perpendicular field of the cathedral spiretasted too as deeply of the peculiar stillness and repose of the closesaw a ruddy english lad come out and lock the door of the old foundation school which marries its heavy gothic walls to the basement of the church and carry the vast big key into one of the still canonical housesand stood wondering as to the effect on a mans mind of having in ones boyhood haunted the cathedral shade as a kings scholar and yet kept ruddy with much cricket in misty meadows by the severn this is a sample of the meditations suggested in my daily walks envy meif you can without hating i wish i could describe them allcolwell green especially where weather favouring i expect to drag myself this afternoonwhere each square yard of ground lies verdantly brimming with the deepest british picturesque and half begging half deprecating a sketch you should see how a certain stilebroken footpath here winds through the meadows to a little grey rookhaunted church another region fertile in walks is the great line of hills half an hours climb will bring you to the top of the beaconthe highest of the rangeand here is a breezy world of bounding turf with twenty counties at your feetand when the mist is thick something immensely english in the situation as if you were wandering on some mighty seaward cliffs or downs haunted by vague traditions of an early battle you may wander for hoursdelighting in the great green landscape as it responds forever to the cloudy movements of heavenscaring the sheepwishing horribly that your mother and sister werei cant say mountedon a couple of little whiteaproned donkeys climbing comfortably at your side but at this rate i shall tire you out with my walks as effectually as i sometimes tire myself kiss mother for her letterand for that villainous cold i enfold you all in an immense embrace  your faithful son h     to charles eliot norton       professor norton and his family were still at this time in europe      arthur sedgwick was mrs nortons brother   cambridge mass jan 16 71  my dear charles  if i had needed any reminder and quickener of a very oldtime intention to take some morning and put into most indifferent words my frequent thoughts of you i should have found one very much to the purpose in a letter from grace received some ten days ago but really i needed no deeper consciousness of my great desire to punch a hole in the massive silence which has grown up between us  cambridge and boston society still rejoices in that imposing fixedness of outline which is ever so inspiring to contemplate in cambridge i see arthur sedgwick and howells but little of any one else arthur seems not perhaps an enthusiastic but a welloccupied man and talks much in a wholesome way of meaning to go abroad howells edits and observes and producesthe latter in his own particular line with more and more perfection his recent sketches in the atlantic collected into a volume belong i think by the wondrous cunning of their manner to very good literature he seems to have resolved himself however into one who can write solely of what his fleshly eyes have seen and for this reason i wish he were located where they would rest upon richer and fairer things than this immediate landscape looking about for myself i conclude that the face of nature and civilization in this our country is to a certain point a very sufficient literary field but it will yield its secrets only to a really grasping imagination this i think howells lacks of course i dont to write well and worthily of american things one need even more than elsewhere to be a master but unfortunately one is less i myself have been scribbling some little tales which in the course of time you will have a chance to read to write a series of good little tales i deem ample work for a lifetime i dream that my lifetime shall have done it its at least a relief to have arranged ones lifetime  there is an immensity of stupid feeling and brutal writing prevalent here about recent english conduct and attitudeinnocuous to some extent i think from its very stupidity but i confess there are now to my mind few things of more appealing interest than the various problems with which england finds herself confronted and this owing to the fact that on the whole the country is so deeplyso tragicallycharged with a consciousness of her responsibilities dangers and duties she presents in this respect a wondrous contrast to ourselves we retarding our healthy progress by all the gross weight of our maniac contempt of the refined idea england striving vainly to compel her lumbersome carcase by the straining wings of conscience and desire of course i speak of the better spirits there and the worst here we have over here the high natural light of chance and space and prosperity but at moments dark things seem to be almost more blessed by the dimmer radiance shed by impassioned thought but i must stay my gossiping hand     to his parents       this next visit to europe had begun in the spring of 1872 he had      reached germany in the company of his sister and aunt by way of      england switzerland and italy   heidelberg sept 15th 72  dear father and mother  i think i should manifest an energy more becoming a child of yours if i were to sustain my nodding head at least enough longer to scrawl the initial words of my usual letter we are travellers in the midst of travel you heard from me last at innsbrückor rather i think at botzen just before a place beautiful by nature but most ugly by man and we came by an admirable five hours run through the remnant of the tyrol to munich where we spent two rather busy days its a singular place and one difficult to write of with a serious countenance it has a fine lot of old pictures but otherwise it is a nightmare of pretentious vacuity a city of chalky stuccoa florence and athens in canvas and planks to have come thither from venice is a sensation we found reality at last at nüremburg by which place combined with this it seemed a vast pity not to proceed rather than by stupid stuttgart nüremburg is excellentand comparisons are odious but i would give a thousand ns for one ray of verona we came on hither by a morning and noon of railway which has not in the least prevented a goodly afternoon and evening at the castle here the castle which i think you have all seen in your own travels is an incomparable ruin and holds its own against any italian memories the light the weather the time were all this evening most propitious to our visit this rapid week in germany has filled us with reflections and observations tossed from the railway windows on our course and irrecoverable at this late hour to me this hasty and most partial glimpse of germany has been most satisfactory it has cleared from my mind the last mists of uncertainty and assured me that i can never hope to become an unworthiest adoptive grandchild of the fatherland it is well to listen to the voice of the spirit to cease hairsplitting and treat ones self to a good square antipathywhen it is so very sympathetic i may cultivate mine away but it has given me a weeks wholesome nourishment  strasbourg we have seen strasbourga palpably conquered cityand the cathedral which beats everything we have ever seen externally it amazed me which somehow i hadnt expected it to do strasbourg is gloomy battered and painful but apparently already much germanized we take tomorrow the formidable journey to paris  yours in hope and love h james jr     to w d howells       mr howellss novel just published was a chance acquaintance      an allusion at the end of this letter recalls the great fire that      had recently devastated the business quarter of boston   berne june 22d 1873  my veritably dear howells  your letter of may 12th came to me a week ago after a journey to florence and back and gave me exquisite pleasure i found it in the montreux postoffice and wandered further till i found the edge of an open vineyard by the lake and there i sat down with my legs hanging over the azure flood and broke the seal thank you for everything for liking my writing and for being glad i like yours your letter made me homesick and when you told of the orchards by fresh pond i hung my head for melancholy what is the meaning of this destiny of desolate exilethis dreary necessity of having month after month to do without our friends for the sake of this arrogant old europe which so little befriends us this is a hot sunday afternoon from my window i look out across the rushing aar at some beautiful undivided meadows backed by black pine woods and blue mountains but i would rather be taking up my hat and stick and going to invite myself to tea with you i left italy a couple of weeks since and since then have been taking gloomy views of things i feel as if i had left my genius behind in rome but i suppose i am well away from rome just now the roman and even the florentine lotus had become with the warm weather an indigestible diet i heard from my mother a day or two since that your book is having a salebless it i havent yet seen the last part and should like to get the volume as a whole would it trouble you to have it sent by post to brown shipley  co london your fifth part i extremely relished it was admirably touched i wished the talk in which the offer was made had been given instead of the mere résumé but i suppose you had good and sufficient reasons for doing as you did but your work is a success and kitty a creation i have envied you greatly as i read the delight of feeling her grow so real and complete so true and charming i think in bringing her through with such unerring felicity your imagination has fait ses preuves i should like to tell you a vast deal about myself and i believe you would like to hear it but as far as vastness goes i should have to invent it and its too hot for such work i send you another and for the present last travelling pieceabout perugia etc it goes with this in another cover a safe journey to it i hope you may squeeze it in this year it has numbers in pages more than you desire but i think it is within bounds as you will see there is an elision of several i have done in all these months since ive been abroad less writing than i hoped rome for direct working was not goodtoo many distractions and a languefying atmosphere but for impressions it was priceless and ive got a lot duskily garnered away somewhere under my waning thats an n not a v chevelure which some day may make some figure i shall make the coming year more productive or retire from business altogether believe in me yet awhile longer and i shall reward your faith by dribblings somewhat less meagre i say nothing about the fire i cant trouble you with ejaculations and inquiries which my letters from home will probably already have answered at this rate apparently the lord loveth boston immeasurably but what a grim old jehovah it is  my blessing dear howells on all your affections labours and desires write me a word when you can b  s london and believe me always faithfully yours  h james jr     to miss grace norton   florence jan 14th 74  dear grace  i have been jerked away from rome where i had been expecting to spend this winter just as i was warming to the feast and florence tho very well in itself doesnt go so far as it might as a substitute for rome its like having a great plumpudding set down on the table before you and then seeing it whisked away and finding yourself served with wholesome tapioca my brother after a month of great enjoyment and prosperity at rome had a stroke of malaria happily quite light which made it necessary for him to depart and i am here charitably to keep him company i oughtnt to speak light words of florence to you who know it so well and with reason love it so well and they are really words from my pens end simply and not from my heart i have an inextinguishable relish for florence and now that i have been back here a fortnight this early love is beginning to shake off timidly the ponderous shadow of rome just as i was leaving rome came to me charless letter of dec 5th for which pray thank him warmly i gather from it that he is in vulgar parlance taking america rather hard and i suppose your feelings and janes on the matter resemble his own but its not for me to blame him for i take it hard enough even here in florence and though i have a vague theory that there is a way of being contented there i am afraid that when i go back i shall need all my ingenuity to put it into practice what charles says about our civilization seems to me perfectly true but practically i dont feel as if the facts were so melancholy the great fact for us all there is that relish europe as we may we belong much more to that than to this and stand in a much less factitious and artificial relation to it i feel forever how europe keeps holding one at arms length and condemning one to a meagre scraping of the surface i have been nearly a year in italy and have hardly spoken to an italian creature save washerwomen and waiters this youll say is my own stupidity but granting this gladly it proves that even a creature addicted as much to sentimentalizing as i am over the whole mise en scène of italian life doesnt find an easy initiation into what lies behind it sometimes i am overwhelmed with the pitifulness of this absurd want of reciprocity between italy itself and all my rhapsodies about it there is certainly however terribly little doubt that practically for those who have been happy in europe even cambridge the brilliant is not an easy place to live in when i saw you in london plunged up to your necks in that full rich abundant various london life i knew that a day of reckoning was coming and i heaved a secret prophetic sigh i can well understand charless saying that the memory of these and kindred things is a perpetual private  pang but pity our poor bare country and dont revile england and italy with their countless helps to life and pleasure are the lands for happiness and selfoblivion it would seem that in our great unendowed unfurnished unentertained and unentertaining continent where we all sit sniffing as it were the very earth of our foundations we ought to have leisure to turn out something handsome from the very heart of simple human nature but after i have been at home a couple of months i will tell you what i think meanwhile i aspire to linger on here in italy and make the most of iteven in poor little overshadowed florence and in a society limited to waiters and washerwomen in your letter of last summer you amiably reproach me with not giving you personal tidings and warn me in my letters against mistaking you for the nation heaven forbid but i have no nouvelles intimes and in this solitary way of life i dont ever feel especially like a person i write more or less in the mornings walk about in the afternoons and doze over a book in the evenings you can do as well as that in cambridge     to his mother   florence may 17th 1874  dearest mother  the days pass evenly and rapidly here in my comfortable little dwelling on this lively and also dusty old piazza sta maria novella the centre of the square is not paved and the dust hovers over it in clouds which compel one to live with closed windows but i remove to my bedroom which is on a sidestreet and very cool and clean nothing particular happens to me and my time is passed between sleeping and scribbling both of which i do very well lunching and dining walking and conversing with my small circle of acquaintance tell willy i thank him greatly for setting before me so vividly the question of my going home or staying i feel equally with him the importance of the decision i have been meaning as you know for some time past to return in the autumn and i see as yet no sufficient reason for changing my plan i shall go with the full prevision that i shall not find life at home simpatico but rather painfully and as regards literary work obstructively the reverse and not even with the expectation that time will make it easier but simply on sternly practical grounds ie because i can find more abundant literary occupation by being on the premises and relieve you and father of your burdensome financial interposition but i shrink from willys apparent assumption that going now is to pledge myself to stay forever i feel as if my three years in europe with much of them so maladif were a very moderate allowance for one who gets so much out of it as i do and i dont think i could really hold up my head if i didnt hope to eat a bigger slice of the pudding with a few more social plums in it especially at some future time if at the end of a period at home i dont feel an overwhelming desire to come back it will be so much gained but i should prepare myself for great deceptions if i didnt take the possibility of such desire into account one oughtnt i suppose to bother too much about the future but arrange as best one can with the present and the present bids me go home and try and get more things published what makes the question particularly difficult to decide is that though i should make more money at home american prices would devour it twice as fast but even allowing for this i should keep ahead of my expenses better than here i know that when the time comes it will be unutterably hard to leave and i shall be wondering whether if i were to stay another year i shouldnt propitiate the minotaur and return more resignedly but to this i shall answer that a year wouldnt be a tenth part enough and that besides as things stand i should be perplexed where to spend it florence fond as i have grown of it is worth far too little to me socially for me to think complacently of another winter here here have i been living in these rooms for five weeksand not a creature save gryzanowski has crossed my thresholdcounting out my little italian who comes twice a week and whom i have to pay for his conversation if i knew any one in england i should be tempted to go there for a year for there i could work to advantageie get hold of new books to review but i cant face as it is a year of british solitude what i desire now more than anything else and what would do me more good is a régal of intelligent and suggestive society especially male but i dont know how or where to find it it exists i suppose in paris and london but i cant get at it i chiefly desire it because it would i am sure increase my powers of work these are going very well however as it is and i have for the present an absorbing task in my novel consider then that if nothing extremely unexpected turns up i shall depart in the autumn i have no present plans for the summer beyond ending my month in my roomson the 11th of june i hope dearest mammy that you will be able to devise some agreeable plan for your own summer and will spend it in repose and comfort has the trunk reached quincy st pray guard jealously my few clothesa summer suit and a coat and two white waistcoats that i would give much for here now but dont let father and willy wear them out as they will serve me still farewell sweet mother i must close i wrote last asking you to have my credit renewed i suppose it has been done love abounding to all i will write soon to willy i wrote lately to a  yours ever h     ii  paris and london  18751881   after another uneventful american year at cambridge 18745 during which roderick hudson was running its course in the atlantic monthly henry james came to europe again with the clear intention of staying for good his first idea was to settle in paris there he would find the literary world with which he had the strongest affinity and it does not seem to have occurred to him at the time to seek a european home anywhere else his knowledge of england was still very slight and he needed something more substantial to live and work upon than the romance of italy in paris he settled therefore in the autumn of 1875 taking rooms at 29 rue du luxembourg he began to write the american to contribute parisian letters to the new york tribune and to frequent the society of a few of his compatriots he made the valued acquaintance of ivan turgenev and through him of the group which surrounded gustave flaubertedmond de goncourt alphonse daudet guy de maupassant zola and others but the letters which follow will shew the kind of doubts that began to arise after a winter in parisdoubts of the possibility of paris as a place where an american imagination could really take root and flourish he found the circle of literature tightly closed to outside influences it seemed to exclude all culture but its own after a fashion that aroused his opposition he speaks sarcastically on one occasion of having watched turgenev and flaubert seriously discussing daudets jack while he reflected that none of the three had read or knew english enough to read daniel deronda during a summer stay at etretat these doubts increased and when he went back to paris in the autumn of 1876 he had already begun to feel the tug of an inclination towards london his brother william seems to have given the final impulse which sent him over and before the end of the year he was in london at last  he took rooms at 3 bolton street just off piccadilly and at first found the change from glittering charming civilised paris rather rude but within a few weeks he was deep in london with doors unnumbered opening to him and a general welcome for the rising young novelist from america letter after letter was sent home with accounts of the visits and dinnerparties which were soon his habitual round he quickly discovered that this was his appointed home and set himself deliberately to cultivate it but his relief at finding a place of which he could really take possession was entirely compatible with candid criticism letter after letter too is filled with caustic reflections on the minds and manners of the english and as the following pages contain not a few of these so it should here be pointed out that his correspondence was the only outlet open to these irrepressible sentiments and that they must be seen in due proportion with the perfect courtesy of appreciation that he always shewed to his wellmeaning hosts he was very much alone in his observing detachment during these years i wish greatly he writes to miss norton about this time you and charles were here so that i might have some one to say the things that are in me too i mean the things about england and the englishthe feelings impressions judgments emotions of every kind that are being perpetually generated and that i cant utter to a single briton of them all with the smallest chance of being understood the absence of a sympathetic compatriotic intelligent spirit like yours is my greatest deprivation here and everything is corked up  but whatever the shortcomings of the english might be london life closed round him and held him fast he would break away for an occasional excursion abroad or he would carry his work into seaside lodgings for the end of the summer otherwise he clung to london with such country visits as sprang naturally from his numerous relations with the town and were simply an extension of these during the years covered by the present section he spent some weeks in rome towards the end of 1877 three months in paris in the autumn of 1879 and two in italy again at florence and naples in the following spring by 1881 he was sufficiently acclimatised in london to feel the need of escaping from the season then so much more organised and exacting an institution than it has since become he went to venice in march and did not return till july but these were the only variations from the life of a cockney convaincu as he admitted himself to be the wonder is that he found time under such conditions to accomplish the large amount of work he still put forth year by year in spite of health that continued somewhat uncertain he was able to concentrate upon his writing in the midst of all distractions daisy miller the europeans confidence washington square and the portrait of a lady all belong to the first five years of his london life besides an unbroken stream of shorter piecesfiction picturesque sketches reviews of bookscontributed to several english and american periodicals time slipped by and he began to wait upon the right opportunity for a long visit to his own country it was not indeed that he felt himself to be losing touch with it his appetite for american news was unassuageable and by means of a correspondence as copious as ever he jealously preserved and cherished every possible tie with his old home but he turned to his own family then as always afterwards with an affection stimulated by his unfathered state in england his parents were growing old his elder brother who had married in 1878 was beginning to enjoy and exhibit the maturity of his genius and it was more than time for a renewal of associations on the spot by the autumn of 1881 he had finished the portrait of a lady the longest and in every way the most important of his works hitherto and he could also feel that his grounding in london so to call it was solid and secure after six years of absence he then saw america again     to his father   29 rue du luxembourg april 11th 1876  dear father  the slender thread of my few personal relations hangs on without snapping but it doesnt grow very stout you crave chiefly news i suppose about ivan sergeitch turgenev whom i have lately seen several times i spent a couple of hours with him at his room some time since and i have seen him otherwise at mme viardots the latter has invited me to her musical parties thursdays and to her sundays en famille i have been to a couple of the former and as yet only one of the latter she herself is a most fascinating and interesting woman ugly yet also very handsome or in the french sense trèsbelle her musical parties are rigidly musical and to me therefore rigidly boresome especially as she herself sings very little i stood the other night on my legs for three hours from 11 till 2 in a suffocating room listening to an interminable fiddling with the only consolation that gustave doré standing beside me seemed as bored as myself but when mme viardot does sing it is superb she sang last time a scene from glucks alcestis which was the finest piece of musical declamation of a grandly tragic sort that i can conceive her sundays seem rather dingy and calculated to remind one of concord historical games etc but it was both strange and sweet to see poor turgenev acting charades of the most extravagant description dressed out in old shawls and masks going on all fours etc the charades are their usual sunday evening occupation and the good faith with which turgenev at his age and with his glories can go into them is a striking example of that spontaneity which europeans have and we have not fancy longfellow lowell or charles norton doing the like and every sunday evening i am likewise gorged with music at mme de blocquevilles where i continue to meet emile montégut whom i dont like so well as his writing and dont forgive for having à lavenir spoiled his writing a little for me calling the other day on mme de b i found with her m caro the philosopher a man in the expression of whose mouth you would discover depths of dishonesty but a most witty and agreeable personage i had also the other day a very pleasant call upon flaubert whom i like personally more and more each time i see him but i think i easilymore than easilysee all round him intellectually there is something wonderfully simple honest kindly and touchingly inarticulate about him he talked of many things of théo gautier among others who was his intimate friend he said nothing new or rare about him except that he thought him after the père hugo the greatest of french poets much above alfred de musset but gautier in his extreme perfection was unique and he recited some of his sonnets in a way to make them seem the most beautiful things in the world find in especial in the volume i left at home one called les portraits ovales i went down to chartres the other day and had a charming timebut i wont speak of it as i have done it in the tribune the american papers over here are accablants and the vulgarity and repulsiveness of the tribune whenever i see it strikes me so violently that i feel tempted to stop my letter but i shall not though of late there has been a painful dearth of topics to write about but soon comes the salon i am very glad indeed that howells is pleased with my new tale i am now actively at work upon it i am well pleased that the atlantic has obtained it his own novel i have not read but he is to send it to me  your home news has all been duly digested tell willy that i will answer his most interesting letter specifically and say to my dearest sister that if she will tell me whichblack or whiteshe prefers i will send her gratis a fichu of écru lace which i am told is the proper thing for her to have  ever dearest daddy your loving son  h james jr     to w d howells       the story was the american which began to appear in the      atlantic monthly in june 1876   29 rue du luxembourg paris may 28th 1876  dear howells  i have just received an hour ago your letter of may 14th i shall be very glad to do my best to divide my story so that it will make twelve numbers and i think i shall probably succeed of course 26 pp is an impossible instalment for the magazine i had no idea the second number would make so much though i half expected your remonstrance i shall endeavour to give you about 14 pp and to keep doing it for seven or eight months more i sent you the other day a fourth part a portion of which i suppose you will allot to the fifth  my heart was touched by your regret that i hadnt given you a great deal of my newsthough my reason suggested that i could not have given you what there was not to give la plus belle fille du monde ne peut donner que ce quelle a i turn out news in very small quantitiesit is impossible to imagine an existence less pervaded with any sort of chiaroscuro i am turning into an old and very contented parisian i feel as if i had struck roots into the parisian soil and were likely to let them grow tangled and tenacious there it is a very comfortable and profitable place on the wholei mean especially on its general and cosmopolitan side of pure parisianism i see absolutely nothing the great merit of the place is that one can arrange ones life here exactly as one pleasesthat there are facilities for every kind of habit and taste and that everything is accepted and understood paris itself meanwhile is a sort of painted background which keeps shifting and changing and which is always there to be looked at when you please and to be most easily and comfortably ignored when you dont all this if you were only here you would feel much better than i can tell youand you would write some happy piece of your prose about it which would make me feel it better afresh ergo comewhen you can i shall probably be here still of course every good thing is still better in spring and in spite of much mean weather i have been liking paris these last weeks more than ever in fact i have accepted destiny here under the vernal influence if you sometimes read my poor letters in the tribune you get a notion of some of the things i see and do i suppose also you get some gossip about me from quincy st besides this there is not a great deal to tell i have seen a certain number of people all winter who have helped to pass the time but i have formed but one or two relations of permanent value and which i desire to perpetuate i have seen almost nothing of the literary fraternity and there are fifty reasons why i should not become intimate with them i dont like their wares and they dont like any others and besides they are not accueillants turgenev is worth the whole heap of them and yet he himself swallows them down in a manner that excites my extreme wonder but he is the most loveable of men and takes all things easily he is so pure and strong a genius that he doesnt need to be on the defensive as regards his opinions and enjoyments the mistakes he may make dont hurt him his modesty and naïveté are simply infantine i gave him some time since the message you sent him and he bade me to thank you very kindly and to say that he had the most agreeable memory of your two books he has just gone to russia to bury himself for two or three months on his estate and try and finish a long novel he has for three or four years been working upon i hope to heaven he may i suspect he works little here  i interrupted this a couple of hours since to go out and pay a visit to gustave flaubert it being his time of receiving and his last sunday in paris and i owing him a farewell he is a very fine old fellow and the most interesting man and strongest artist of his circle i had him for an hour alone and then came in his following talking much of emile zolas catastrophezola having just had a serial novel for which he was handsomely paid interrupted on account of protests from provincial subscribers against its indecency the opinion apparently was that it was a bore but that it could only do the book good on its appearance in a volume among your tribulations as editor i take it that this particular one is not in store for you on my way down from flauberts i met poor zola climbing the staircase looking very pale and sombre and i saluted him with the flourish natural to a contributor who has just been invited to make his novel last longer yet  your inquiry why i dont go to spain is sublimeis what philip van artevelde says of the lake of como softly sublime profusely fair i shall spend my summer in the most tranquil and frugal hole i can unearth in france and i have no prospect of travelling for some time to come the waverley oaks seem strangely far awayyet i remember them well and the day we went there i am sorry i am not to see your novel sooner but i applaud your energy in proposing to change it the printed thing always seems to me dead and done with i suppose you will write something about philadelphiai hope so as otherwise i am afraid i shall know nothing about it i salute your wife and children a thousand times and wish you an easy and happy summer and abundant inspiration  yours very faithfully h james jr     to william james   etretat july 29th 1876  dear wm  i have little to tell you of myself i shall be here till august 1520 and shall then go and spend the rest of the month with the childes near orléans an ugly country i believe and after that try to devise some frugal scheme for keeping out of paris till as late as possible in the autumn the winter there always begins soon enough i am much obliged to you for your literary encouragement and adviceglad especially you like my novel i cant judge it your remarks on my french tricks in my letters are doubtless most just and shall be heeded but its an odd thing that such tricks should grow at a time when my last layers of resistance to a longencroaching weariness and satiety with the french mind and its utterance has fallen from me like a garment i have done with em forever and am turning english all over i desire only to feed on english life and the contact of english mindsi wish greatly i knew some easy and smoothflowing as life is in paris i would throw it over tomorrow for an even very small chance to plant myself for a while in england if i had but a single good friend in london i would go thither i have got nothing important out of paris nor am likely to my life there makes a much more succulent figure in your letters my mention of its thin ingredients as it comes back to me than in my own consciousness a good deal of boulevard and thirdrate americanism few retributive relations otherwise i know the théâtre français by heart  daniel deronda danl himself is indeed a dead though amiable failure but the book is a large affair i shall write an article of some sort about it all desire is dead within me to produce something on george sand though perhaps i shall all the same mercenarily and mechanicallythough only if i am forced please make a point of mentioning by the way whether a letter of mine upon her exclusively did appear lately in the tribune i dont see the t regularly and have missed it they misprint sadly i never said eg in announcing her death that she was fearfully shy i used no such vile adverb but anotheri forget which  i am hoping from day to day for another letter from home as the period has come round i hope your own plans for the summer will prosper and health and happiness be your portion give much love to father and to the ladies  yours always h james jr     to william james       h j had by this time been settled in london for some three      months   athenaeum club pall mall march 29th 77  dear wm  london life jogs along with me pausing every now and then at some more or less succulent patch of herbage i was almost ashamed to tell you through mother that i unworthy was seeing a bit of huxley i went to his house again last sunday eveninga pleasant easy nodresscoat sort of house in our old marlboro place by the way huxley is a very genial comfortable beingyet with none of the noisy and windy geniality of some folks here whom you find with their backs turned when you are responding to the remarks that they have made you but of course my talk with him is mere amiable generalities these however he likes to cultivate for recreations sake of a sunday evening the thundering spencer i have not lately seen here some mornings since i breakfasted with lord houghton againhe invites me most dotingly present john morley goldwin smith pleasanter than my prejudice against him henry cowper frederick wedmore and a monstrous cleverly agreeably talking mp mr otway john morley has a most agreeable face but he hardly opened his mouth he is like so many of the men who have done much here very younglooking yesterday i dined with lord houghtonwith gladstone tennyson dr schliemann the excavator of old mycenae etc and half a dozen other men of high culture i sat next but one to the bard and heard most of his talk which was all about port wine and tobacco he seems to know much about them and can drink a whole bottle of port at a sitting with no incommodity he is very swarthy and scraggy and strikes one at first as much less handsome than his photos but gradually you see that its a face of genius he had i know not what simplicity speaks with a strange rustic accent and seemed altogether like a creature of some primordial english stock a thousand miles away from american manufacture behold me after dinner conversing affably with mr gladstonenot by my own seeking but by the almost importunate affection of lord h but i was glad of a chance to feel the personality of a great political leaderor as g is now thought here even i think by his partisans exleader that of gladstone is very fascinatinghis urbanity extremehis eye that of a man of geniusand his apparent selfsurrender to what he is talking of without a flaw he made a great impression on megreater than any one i have seen here though tis perhaps owing to my naïveté and unfamiliarity with statesmen  did i tell you that i had been to the oxford and cambridge boatrace but i have paragraphed it in the nation to which i refer you it was for about two minutes a supremely beautiful sight but for those two minutes i had to wait a horribly bleak hour and a half shivering in midthames under the sour marchwind i cant think of any other adventures save that i dined two or three days since at mrs godfrey lushingtons they are very nice blushing people with a parcel of quiet folk but next to a divine little miss lushington so pretty english girls can be who told me that she lived in the depths of the city at guys hospital whereof her father is administrator guys hospitalof which i have read in all old english novels so does one move all the while here on identified ground this is the eve of good friday a most lugubrious day hereand all the world save 4000000 or so are out of london for the ten days easter holiday i think of making two or three excursions of a few hours apiece to places near london whence i can come back to sleep canterbury chichester etc but as i shall commemorate them for lucre i wont talk of them thus  farewell dear brother i wont prattle further encourage alice to write to me my blessings on yourself from your fraternal  h j jr     to miss grace norton   3 bolton st piccadilly august 7th 1877  dear grace  i feel now more at home in london than anywhere else in the worldso much so that i am afraid my sense of peculiarities my appreciation of people and things as london people and things is losing its edge i have taken a great fancy to the place i wont say to the people and things and yet these must have a part in it it makes a very interesting residence at any rate not the ideal and absolutely interestingbut the relative and comparative one i have however formed no intimaciesnot even any close acquaintances i incline to believe that i have passed the age when one forms friendships or that every one else has i have seen and talked a little with a considerable number of people but i have become familiar with almost none to tell the truth i find myself a good deal more of a cosmopolitan thanks to that combination of the continent and the usa which has formed my lot than the average briton of culture and to beto have become by force of circumstancesa cosmopolitan is of necessity to be a good deal alone i dont think that london by itself does a very great deal for peoplefor its residents and those of them who are not out of the general social herd are potentially deadly provincial i have become in all these years as little provincial as possible i dont say it from fatuity and i may say it to you and yet to be so is i think necessary for forming here many close relations so my interest in london is chiefly that of an observer in a place where there is most in the world to observe i see no essential reason however why i should not some day see much more of certain britons and think that i very possibly may but i doubt if i should ever marryor want to marryan english wife this is an extremely interesting time here and indeed that is one reason why i have not been able to bring myself to go abroad as i have been planning all this month to do i cant give up the morning papers i am not one of the outsiders who thinks that the greatness of england is now exploded but there mingles with my interest in her prospects and doings in all this horrible eastern question a sensible mortification and sadness she has not resolutely played a parteven a wrong one she has been weak and helpless and above all unskilful she has drifted and stumbled and not walked like a great nation one has a feeling that the affairs of europe are really going to be settled without her at any rate the cynical brutal barbarous proturkish attitude of an immense mass of people here i am no fanatic for russia but i think the emperor of r might have been treated like a gentleman has thrown into vivid relief the most discreditable side of the english character i dont think it is the largest side by any means but when one comes into contact with it one is ready to give up the race  i saw the lowells and can testify to their apparent goodhumour and prosperity it was a great pleasure to talk with lowell but he is morbidly anglophobic though when an englishman asked me if he was not i denied it i envied him his residence in a land of colour and warmth of social freedom and personal picturesqueness so many absent things here where the dusky misery and the famous hypocrisy which foreign writers descant so much upon seem sometimes to usurp the whole field of vision but i shall in all probability go abroad myself by sept 1st go straight to our blessed italy i hope to be a while at siena where you may be sure that i shall think of you  yours always dear grace in all tender affection  h james jr     to miss grace norton   paris dec 15th 1877  dear grace  i hoped after getting your letter of october 15th to write you from siena but i never got there i only got to rome where your letter came to me and in rome i spent the whole of the seven weeks that i was able to give to italy i have just come back and am on my way to london whither i find i gravitate as toward the place in the world in which on the whole i feel most at home i went directly to rome some seven weeks since and came directly back but i spent a few days in florence on my way down italy was still more her irresistible ineffable old self than ever and getting away from rome was really no joke in spite of the changesand they are very perceptiblethe old enchantment of rome taking its own good time steals over you and possesses you till it becomes really almost a nuisance and an importunity that is it keeps you from working from staying indoors etc to do those things in sufficient measure one must live in an ugly country and that is why instead of lingering in that golden climate i am going back to poor smutty dusky philistine london florence had never seemed to me more lovely empty melancholy bankrupt as i believe she is she is turning into an old sleeping soundless city like pisa this sensible sadness with the glorious weather gave the place a great charm the bootts were there staying in a villa at bellosguardo and i spent many hours in their garden sitting in the autumn sunshine and staring stupidly at that nevertobeenoughappreciated view of the little city and the mountains  i have had an autumn of things rather than of people and have not much to relate in regard to human nature here in paris for a few days i find i know really too many peopleespecially as they are for the most part acquaintances retained for the sake of social decency rather than of strong sentiment they consume all my time so that i cant even go to the théâtre français in rome i found the relics and fragments of the ancient american group which has been much broken upor rather broken down but neither in its meridian nor in its decline has it had any very irresistible charms the chief quality acquired by americans who have lived thirty years in europe seems to me a fierce susceptibility on the subject of omitted calls  public matters here just now are more interesting than privateand in france indeed are as interesting as can be parliamentary government is really being put to the test and bearing it the poor foolish old marshal has at last succumbed to the liberal majority and has apparently no stomach to renew his resistance plevna is taken by the russians and england is supposed to be dreadfully snubbed but one is only snubbed if one feels it and it remains to be seen how england will take the russian success but one has a feeling nowto me it is a very painful onethat england will take anything that overcautious and somewhat sordid counsels will always prevail on the continent certainly her ancient prestige is gone and i almost wish she would fight in a bad cause if only to shew that she still can and that she is not one vast moneygetting birmingham i really think we are assisting at the political decadence of our mighty motherland when so mealymouthed an organ as the times is correctly held to represent the sentiment of the majority this must be but i must say that even the decline of england seems to me a tremendous and even almost an inspiring spectacle and if the british empire is once more to shrink up into that plethoric little island the process will be the greatest drama in history  this will reach you about xmastime and i imagine you reading it at a window that looks out upon the snowladen pines and hemlocks of shady hill that white winter light that is sent up into a room from the deep snow is something that one quite loses the memory of here and yet as i think of it now it is associated in my mind with all kinds of pleasant and comfortable indoor scenes i am afraid that for you the season will have no great animation but you will i suppose see a good deal of infantine exhilaration about you     to william james   8 bolton st w may 1st 78  dear william  there were many interesting allusions in your letter which i should like to take up one by one i should like to see the fair hellenists of baltimore and i greatly regret that living over here my person cannot profit by my american reputation it is a great loss to have ones person in one country and ones glory in another especially when there are lovely young women in the case neither can ones glory then profit by ones personas i flatter myself even in your jealous teeth that mine might in baltimore also about my going to washington and its being my duty etc i think there is much in that but i cant whisk about the world quite so actively as you seem to recommend it would be great folly for me à peine established in london and getting a footing here to break it all off for the sake of going to spend four or five months in washington i expect to spend many a year in londoni have submitted myself without reserve to that londonizing process of which the effect is to convince you that having lived here you may if need be abjure civilization and bury yourself in the country but may not in pursuit of civilization live in any smaller town i am still completely an outsider here and my only chance for becoming a little of an insider in that limited sense in which an american can ever do so is to remain here for the present after thata couple of years hencei shall go home for a year embrace you all and see everything of the country i can including washington meanwhile if one will take what comes one is by no means cut off from getting impressions here i know what i am about and i have always my eyes on my native land  i am very glad that howellss play seemed so pretty on the stage much of the dialogue as it read was certainly charming but i should have been afraid of the slimness and unscenic quality of the plot for myself in answer to your adjuration it has long been my most earnest and definite intention to commence at playwriting as soon as i can this will be soon and then i shall astound the world my inspection of the french theatre will fructify i have thoroughly mastered dumas augier and sardou whom it is greatly lacking to howellsby the wayto have studied and i know all they know and a great deal more besides seriously speaking i have a great many ideas on this subject and i sometimes feel tempted to retire to some frugal village for twelve months where my current expenses being inconsiderable i might have leisure to work them off even if i could only find some manager or publisher sufficiently devoted to believe in this and make me an allowance for such a period i would afterwards make a compact and sign it with my blood to reimburse him in thousands but i shall not have to come to this or to depend upon it  i received a few days since your article on h spencer but i have not yet had time to read it i shall very presently attacki wont say understand it mother speaks to me of your articles in renouviers magazineand why have you not sent me those i wish you would do so punctually i met herbert spencer the other sunday at george eliots whither i had at last bent my steps gh lewes introduced me to him as an american and it seemed to me that at this fact coupled with my name his attention was aroused and he was on the point of asking me if i were related to you but something instantly happened to separate me from him and soon afterwards he went away the leweses were very urbane and friendly and i think that i shall have the right dorénavant to consider myself a sunday habitué the great ge herself is both sweet and superior and has a delightful expression in her large long pale equine face i had my turn at sitting beside her and being conversed with in a low but most harmonious tone and bating a tendency to aborder only the highest themes i have no fault to find with her  we expect to hear at any hour that war has broken out and yet it may not be it will be a good deal of a scandal if it doesespecially if the english find themselves fighting side by side with the bloody filthy turks and their own indian sepoys and to think that a clever jew should have juggled old england into it the papers are full of the paris exhibition which opens today but it leaves me perfectly incurious blessings on all from yours fraternally  h james jr     to miss alice james       h j was at this time contributing a series of articles on english      life and letters to the american nation   tillypronie aberdeen sept 15th 1878  dearest sister  on this howling stormy sunday on a scotch mountainside i dont know what i can do better than give you a little oldworld news i have had none of yours in some time but i venture to interpret that as a good sign and to believe that peace and plenty hovers over quincy street i shall continue in this happy faith and in the belief that you are gently putting forth your strength again until the contrary is proved behold me in scotland and very well pleased to be here i am staying with the clarks of whom you have heard me speak and than whom there could not be a more tenderly hospitable couple sir john caresses me like a brother and her ladyship supervises me like a mother i have been here for four or five days and i feel that i have done a very good thing in coming to scotland once you get the hang of it and apprehend the type it is a most beautiful and admirable little countryfit for distinction etc to make up a trio with italy and greece there is a little very good company in the house including my brilliant friend lady hamilton gordon and every day has brought with it some pretty entertainment i wish i could relate these episodes in detail but i shall probably do a little of it in mercenary print on the first day i went to some highland sports given by lord huntly and to a sumptuous lunch in a coquettish marquee which formed an episode of the same the next day i spent roaming over the moors and hills in company with a remarkably nice young fellow staying in the house sidney holland grandson of the late sir henry his father married a daughter of sir chas trevelyan sister of my friend mrs dugdale nothing can be more breezy and glorious than a ramble on these purple hills and a lounge in the sunwarmed heather the real way to enjoy them is of course supposed to be with an eye to the grouse and partridges but this is happily little of a shooting house though holland keeps the tableone of the best in england or rather in scotland which is saying moresupplied with game the next day i took part in a cavalcade across the hills to see a ruined castle and in the evening if you please stiff and sore as i was and am still with my exploits in the saddle which had been sufficiently honourable i went to a ball fifteen miles distant the ball was given by a certain old mr cunliffe brooks a great proprietor hereabouts and possessor of a shootinglodge with a ballroom a fact which sufficiently illustrates the luxury of these angloscotch arrangements at the ball was the famous beauty mrs langtry who was staying in the house and who is probably for the moment the most celebrated woman in england she is in sooth divinely handsome and it was extremely odd to see her dancing a highland reel which she had been practising for three days with young lord huntly who is a very handsome fellow and who in his kilt and tartan leaping and hooting and romping opposite to this london divinity offered a vivid reminder of ancient caledonian barbarism and of the roughness which lurks in all british amusements and only wants a pretext to explode we came home from our ball where i took out two young ladies who had gone with us for a polka apiece at four am and i found it difficult on that morning at breakfast to comply with that rigid punctuality which is the custom of the house today our fine weather has come to an end and we are closely involved in a ferocious wet tornado but i am glad of the rest and quiet and i have just bolted out of the library to escape the morning service read by the worthy nevin the american episcopal chaplain in rome who is staying here to which the dumb and decent servants are trooping in i am fast becoming a good enough englishman to respect inveterately my own habits and do wherever i may be only exactly what i want this is the secret of prosperity hereprovided of course one has a certain number of sociable and conformable habits and civil inclinations as a startingpoint after that the more positive your idiosyncrasies the more positive the convenience but it is drawing toward lunch and i cant carry my personality quite so far as to be late for that  i have said enough dear sister to make you see that i continue to see the world with perhaps even enviable profit but dont envy me too much for the british countryhouse has at moments for a cosmopolitanised american an insuperable flatness on the other hand to do it justice there is no doubt of its being one of the ripest fruits of timeand here in scotland where you get the conveniences of mayfair dovetailed into the last romanticism of natureof the highest results of civilization such as it is at any rate i shall probably have a little more of it scotland is decidedly a thing to see and which it would have been idiocy to have foregone did i tell you i was now london correspondent of the nation farewell dearest child and sister i wish i could blow you a little of the salubrity of bonnie scotland the lunchbell is striking up and i hurry off with comprehensive blessings  ever your faithfullest h j jr     to william james       the brief allusion at the end of this letter to two memorable      visits will recall the picture he long afterwards made of them and      of the lady who inducted him in the middle years the closing      paragraph of daisy miller it may be mentioned gives a glance at      the heros subsequent history and a hint that he became much      interested in a clever foreign lady the story about to appear in      the cornhill was an international episode   devonshire club st jamess sw nov 14th 78  my dear william  i was much depressed on reading your letter by your painful reflections on the europeans but now an hour having elapsed i am beginning to hold up my head a little the more so as i think i myself estimate the book very justly and am aware of its extreme slightness i think you take these things too rigidly and unimaginativelytoo much as if an artistic experiment were a piece of conduct to which ones life were somehow committed but i think also that youre quite right in pronouncing the book thin and empty i dont at all despair yet of doing something fat meanwhile i hope you will continue to give me when you can your free impression of my performances it is a great thing to have some one write to one of ones things as if one were a third person and you are the only individual who will do this i dont think however you are always right by any means as for instance in your objection to the closing paragraph of daisy miller which seems to me queer and narrow and as regards which i dont seize your point of view jen appelle to the sentiment of any other storyteller whatsoever i am sure none such would wish the paragraph away you may sayah but other readers would but that is the same for the teller is but a more developed reader i dont trust your judgment altogether if you will permit me to say so about details but i think you are altogether right in returning always to the importance of subject i hold to this strongly and if i dont as yet seem to proceed upon it more it is because being very artistic i have a constant impulse to try experiments of form in which i wish to not run the risk of wasting or gratuitously using big situations but to these i am coming now it is something to have learned how to write and when i look round me and see how few people doing my sort of work know how to my sense i dont regret my stepbystep evolution i dont advise you however to read the two last things i have writtenone a thing in the dec and jan cornhill which i will send home and the other a piece i am just sending to howells they are each quite in the same manner as the europeans  i have written you a letter after all i am tired and must stop i went into the country the other day to stay with a friend a couple of days mrs greville and went with her to lunch with tennyson who after lunch read us locksley hall the next day we went to george eliots  blessings on alice ever your  h j jr     to his mother   3 bolton st w january 18th 1879  my dearest mother  i have before me your letter of december 30th with its account of your christmas festivities and other agreeable talk and i endeavour on this beastly winter night before my carboniferous hearth to transport myself into the family circle  mrs kemble has returned to town for the winteran event in which i always take pleasure as she is certainly one of the women i know whom i like best i confess i find people in general very vulgarminded and superficialand it is only by a pious fiction to keep myself going and keep on the social harness that i succeed in postulating them as anything else or better it is therefore a kind of rest and refreshment to see a woman who extremely annoying as she sometimes is gives one a positive sense of having a deep rich human nature and having cast off all vulgarities the people of this world seem to me for the most part nothing but surface and sometimesoh ye gods such desperately poor surface mrs kemble has no organized surface at all she is like a straight deep cistern without a cover or even sometimes a bucket into which as a mode of intercourse one must tumble with a splash you mustnt judge her by her indifferent book which is no more a part of her than a pudding she might make please tell william and alice that i received a short time since their kind note written on the eve of their going to newport and complimenting me on the first part of the international episode you will have read the second part by this time and i hope that you wont like many of my friends here as i partly know and partly suspect take it ill of me as against my british entertainers it seems to me myself that i have been very delicate but i shall keep off dangerous ground in future it is an entirely new sensation for them the people here to be at all delicately ironised or satirised from the american point of view and they dont at all relish it their conception of the normal in such a relation is that the satire should be all on their side against the americans and i suspect that if one were to push this a little further one would find that they are extremely sensitive but i like them too much and feel too kindly to them to go into the satirebusiness or even the lightironical in any case in which it would wound themeven if in such a case i should see my way to it very clearly macmillan is just on the point of bringing out daisy miller the international episode and four meetings in two little bigprinted volumes like those of the europeans there is every reason to expect for them a very good success as daisy m has been as i have told you before a really quite extraordinary hit i will send you the new volumes farewell dearest mother i send my filial duty to father who i hope is worrying comfortably through the winter i am afraid that since you wrote you have had severe weatherand looking and listening always for a letter remain your very lovingest  h james jr     to miss grace norton       the short novel he was now just finishing was confidence   3 bolton st w sunday am june 8th 1879  my dear grace  it is difficult to talk to you about my impressionsit takes a great deal of space to generalise and when one is talking of london it takes even more to specify i am afraid also in truth that i am living here too long to be an observeri am sinking into dull british acceptance and conformity the other day i was talking to a very clever foreignera german if you can admit the cleverwho had lived a long time in england and of whom i had asked some opinion oh i know nothing of the english he said i have lived here too longtwenty years the first year i really knew a great deal but i have lost it that is getting to be my state of mind and i am sometimes really appalled at the matter of course way of looking at the indigenous life and manners into which i am gradually dropping i am losing my standardmy charming little standard that i used to think so high my standard of wit of grace of good manners of vivacity of urbanity of intelligence of what makes an easy and natural style of intercourse and this in consequence of my having dined out during the past winter 107 times when i come home you will think me a sad barbariani may not even just at first appreciate your fine points you must take that speech about my standard with a grain of saltbut excuse me i am treating youa proof of the accusation i have brought against myselfas if you were also a dulleyed briton the truth is i am so fond of london that i can afford to abuse itand london is on the whole such a fine thing that it can afford to be abused it has all sorts of superior qualities but it has also and english life generally and the english character have a certain number of great plump flourishing uglinesses and drearinesses which offer themselves irresistibly as pincushions to criticism and irony the british mind is so totally unironical in relation to itself that this is a perpetual temptation you will know the things i meanyou will remember themlet that suffice non ragioniam di lori dont suppose you will envy me for having dined out 107 timesyou will simply wonder what can have induced me to perpetrate such a folly and how i have survived to tell the tale i admit that it is enough for the present and for the rest of the summer i shall take in sail when the warm weather comes i find london evenings very detestable and i marvel at the powers of endurance of my fellow factors as it is now the fashion to call human beingsactorspoor blundering unapplauded comedians would be a better name would you like a little gossip i am afraid i have nothing very lively in hand but i take what comes uppermost i am to dine tonight at sir frederick pollocks to meet one or two of the more genteel members of the comédie française who are here just now playing with immense success and supplying the london world with that invaluable boon a topic i mean the whole comédie is here en masse for six weeks i have been to see them two or three times and i find their artistic perfection gives one an immense lift out of british air i took with me one night mrs kemble who is a great friend of mine and to my sense one of the most interesting and delightful of women i have a sort of notion you dont like her but you would if you knew her better she is to my mind the first woman in london and is moreover one of the consolations of my life another night i had with me a person whom it would divert you to knowa certain mrs greville a cousin by marriage of the greville papers the queerest creature living but a mixture of the ridiculous and the amiable in which the amiable preponderates she is crazy stagestruck scatterbrained what the french call extravagante but i cant praise her better than by saying that though she is on the whole the greatest fool i have ever known i like her very much and get on with her most easily i am just finishing a short novel which will appear presently in six numbers of scribner this is to say please dont read it in that puerile periodical where its appearance is due towhat you will be glad to hearlarge pecuniary inducements but wait till it comes out as a book it is worth being read in that shape i have asked you no questionsyet i have finished my letter let my blessing my tender good wishes and affectionate assurances of every kind stand instead of them divide these with charles with your mother with the children and believe me dear grace always very faithfully yours  h james jr     to w d howells       hjs forthcoming story in the cornhill was washington square   3 bolton street w jan 31st 1880  my dear howells  your letter of jan 19th and its enclosure your review of my hawthorne came to me last night and i must thank you without delay for each of them  your review of my book is very handsome and friendly and commands my liveliest gratitude of course your graceful strictures seem to yourself more valid than they do to me the little book was a tolerably deliberate and meditated performance and i should be prepared to do battle for most of the convictions expressed it is quite true i use the word provincial too many timesi hated myself fort even while i did it just as i overdo the epithet dusky but i dont at all agree f with you in thinking that if it is not provincial for an englishman to be english a frenchman french etc so it is not provincial for an american to be american so it is not provincial for a russian an australian a portuguese a dane a laplander to savour of their respective countries that would be where the argument would land you i think it is extremely provincial for a russian to be very russian a portuguese very portuguese for the simple reason that certain national types are essentially and intrinsically provincial i sympathize even less with your protest against the idea that it takes an old civilization to set a novelist in motiona proposition that seems to me so true as to be a truism it is on manners customs usages habits forms upon all these things matured and established that a novelist livesthey are the very stuff his work is made of and in saying that in the absence of those dreary and wornout paraphernalia which i enumerate as being wanting in american society we have simply the whole of human life left you beg to my sense the question i should say we had just so much less of it as these same paraphernalia represent and i think they represent an enormous quantity of it i shall feel refuted only when we have produced setting the present high companyyourself and mefor obvious reasons apart a gentleman who strikes me as a novelistas belonging to the company of balzac and thackeray of course in the absence of this godsend it is but a harmless amusement that we should reason about it and maintain that if right were right he should already be here i will freely admit that such a genius will get on only by agreeing with your view of the caseto do something great he must feel as you feel about it but then i doubt whether such a geniusa man of the faculty of balzac and thackeraycould agree with you when he does i will lie flat on my stomach and do him homagein the very centre of the contributors club or on the threshold of the magazine or in any public place you may appointbut i didnt mean to wrangle with youi meant only to thank you and to express my sense of how happily you turn those thingsi am greatly amused at your picture of the contributing bloodhounds whom you are holding in check i wish immensely that you would let them fly at methough there is no reason certainly that the decent public should be bespattered periodically with my gore however my tender or rather my very tough flesh is prescient already of the higginsonian fangs happy man to be going like that to see your plays acted it is a sensation i am dying though not as yet trying to cultivate what a tremendous quantity of work you must get through in these years i am impatient for the next atlantic what is your cornhill novel about i am to precede it with a poorish story in three numbersa tale purely american the writing of which made me feel acutely the want of the paraphernalia i must add however to return for a moment to this that i applaud and esteem you highly for not feeling it ie the want you are certainly rightmagnificently and heroically rightto do so and on the day you make your readersi mean the readers who know and appreciate the paraphernaliado the same you will be the american balzac thats a great missiongo in for it wherever you go receive and distribute among your wife and children the blessing of yours ever  h james jr     to charles eliot norton   3 bolton street w nov 13th 1880  my dear charles  i wish you could take a good holiday and spend it in these countries i have got to feel like such an old european that i could almost pretend to help to do you the honours i am at least now a thoroughly naturalised londonera cockney convaincu i am attached to london in spite of the long list of reasons why i should not be i think it on the whole the best point of view in the world there are times when the fog the smoke the universal uncleanness the combined unwieldiness and flatness of much of the social lifethese and many other mattersoverwhelm the spirit and fill it with a yearning for other climes but nevertheless one reverts one sticks one abides one even cherishes considering that i lose all patience with the english about fifteen times a day and vow that i renounce them for ever i get on with them beautifully and love them well our dear vasari i fear couldnt have made much of them and they would have been improved by a slight infusion of the florentine spirit but for all that they are for me the great raceeven at this hour of their possible decline taking them altogether they are more complete than other folk more largely nourished deeper denser stronger i think it takes more to make an englishman on the whole than to make anyone elseand i say this with a consciousness of all that often seems to me to have been left out of their composition but the question is interminable and idle into the bargain i am passing a quiet autumn london has not yet waked up from the stagnation that belongs to this period the only incident of consequence that has lately occurred to me was my dining a few days since at the guildhall at the big scrambling banquet which the lord mayor gives on the 9th november to the cabinet foreign ministers etc it was uncomfortable but amusingyou have probably done it yourself i met lowell there whom i see besides with tolerable frequency he is just back from a visit to scotland which he appears to have enjoyed including a speechmaking at edinburgh he gets on here i think very smoothly and happily for though he is critical in the gross he is not in the detail and takes things with a sort of boyish simplicity he is universally liked and appreciated his talk enjoyed as well it may be after some of their own and his poor longsuffering wife is doing very well i therefore hope he will be left undisturbed by garfield to enjoy the fruition of the long period of discomfort he has passed through it will be in the highest degree indecent to remove him though i wish he had a pair of secretaries that ministered a little more to the idea of american brilliancy lowell has to do that quite by himself  believe me always faithfully yours  h james jr     to his mother   mentmore leighton buzzard november 28th 1880  dearest mammy  this is a pleasant sunday and i have been spending it from yesterday evening in a very pleasant place pleasant is indeed rather an odd term to apply to this gorgeous residence and the manner of life which prevails in it but it is that as well as other things beside lady rosebery it is her enviable dwelling asked me down here a week ago and i stop till tomorrow am there are several people here but no one very important save john bright and lord northbrook the last liberal viceroy of india millais the painter has been here for a part of the day and i took a walk with him this afternoon back from the stables where we had been to see three winners of the derby trotted out in succession this will give you an idea of the scale of mentmore where everything is magnificent the house is a huge modern palace filled with wonderful objects accumulated by the late sir meyer de rothschild lady rs father all of them are precious and many are exquisite and their general rothschildish splendour is only equalled by their profusion  i have spent a good part of the time in listening to the conversation of john bright whom though i constantly see him at the reform club i had never met before he has the repute of being often grumpy but on this occasion he has been in extremely good form and has discoursed uninterruptedly and pleasantly he gives one an impression of sturdy honest vigorous english middleclass liberalism accompanied by a certain infusion of genius which helps one to understand how his name has become the great rallyingpoint of that sentiment he reminds me a good deal of a superior new englanderwith a fatter damper nature however than theirs they are at afternoon tea downstairs in a vast gorgeous hall where an upper gallery looks down like the colonnade in paul veroneses pictures and the chairs are all golden thrones belonging to ancient doges of venice i have retired from the glittering scene to meditate by my bedroom fire on the fleeting character of earthly possessions and to commune with my mammy until a supreme being in the shape of a dumb footman arrives to ventilate my shirt and turn my stockings inside out the beautiful red ones imparted by alicewhich he must admire so much though he doesnt venture to show it preparatory to my dressing for dinner tomorrow i return to london and to my personal occupation always doubly valued after 48 hours passed among ces gensci whose chief effect upon me is to sharpen my desire to distinguish myself by personal achievement of however limited a character it is the only answer one can make to their atrocious good fortune lord rosebery however with youth cleverness a delightful face a happy character a rothschild wife of numberless millions to distinguish and demoralize him wears them with such tact and bonhomie that you almost forgive him he is extremely nice with bright draws him out defers to him etc with a delicacy rare in an englishman but after all there is much to saymore than can be said in a letterabout ones relations with these people you may be interested by the way to know that lord r said this morning at lunch that his ideal of the happy life was that of cambridge mass living like longfellow you may imagine that at this the company looked awfully vague and i thought of proposing to him to exchange mentmore for 20 quincy street  i have little other personal news than this which i have given you in some detail for entertainments sake i embrace you dearest mother and also your two companions  ever your fondest h james jr     to mrs fanny kemble   hôtel de la ville milan march 24th 81  my dear mrs kemble  your good letter of nearly four weeks ago lies before mewhere it has been lying for some days pastmaking me think of you so much that i ended by feeling as if i had answered it on reflection i see that i havent howeverthat is not in any way that you will appreciate shall you appreciate a letter from milan on a day blustering and hateful as any you yourself can lately have been visited with i have been spending the last eight days at this place but i take myself offfor southern partstomorrow so that by waiting a little i might have sent you a little more of the genuine breath of italy but i can do thatand i shall do itat any rate and meanwhile let my milanese news go for what it is worth you see i travel very deliberately as i started for rome six weeks ago and i have only got thus far my slowness has had various causes among others my not being in a particular hurry to join the little nest of my compatriots and yours who cluster about the piazza di spagna i have enjoyed the independence of lingering in places where i had no visits to payand this indeed has been the only charm of milan which has seemed prosaic and winterish as if it were on the wrong side of the alps i have written a good deal not letters and seen that mouldering old fresco of leonardo which is so magnificent in its ruin and the lovely young raphael in the brera the sposalizio which is still so fresh and juvenile and lucrezia borgias strawcoloured lock of hair at the ambrosian library and several other small and great curiosities i have kept pretty well out of the cathedral as the chill of dantes frozen circle abides within it and i have had a sore throat ever since i left soft san remo on the other hand i have also been to the scala which is a mighty theatre and where i heard der freyschütz done à litalienne and sat through about an hour and three quarters of a ballet which was to last three the italians truly are eternal children they paid infinitely more attention to the ballet than to the opera and followed with breathless attention and an air of the most serious credulity the interminable adventures of a danseuse who went through every possible alternation of human experience on the points of her toes the more i see of them the more struck i am with their having no sense of the ridiculous  it must have been at marseilles i think that i wrote you before so that there is an hiatus in my biography to fill up i went from marseilles to nice which i found more than usually detestable and pervaded to an intolerable pitch with a bad french carnival which set me on the road again till i reached san remo which you may know and which if you dont you ought to i spent more than a fortnight there among the olives and the oranges between a big yellow sun and a bright blue sea the walks and drives are lovely and in the course of one of them a drive i called upon our friends the george howards who have been wintering at bordighera a few miles away but he was away in england getting himself elected to parliament you may have heard that he has just been returned for east cumberland and she was away with him helping him the idea of leaving the oranges and olives for that i saw however a most delightful little maid their eldest daughter of about 15 who had a mixture of shyness and frankness the softness of the papa and the decision of the mother with which i quite fell in love i didnt fall in love with mrs william morris the strange pale livid gaunt silent and yet in a manner graceful and picturesque wife of the poet and papermaker who is spending the winter with the howards though doubtless she too has her merits she has for instance wonderful aesthetic hair from san remo i came along the rest of the coast to genoa not by carriage however as i might have done for i was rather afraid of three days on end of my own society that is not on end but sitting down when i am tired of myself in common situations i can get up and walk away so in a word i came in the train and the train came in a tunnelfor it was almost all onefor five or six hours i have been going to venicebut it is so cold and blustering that i think tomorrow when i depart from this place the idea of reaching the southernmost point will get the better of me and i shall make straight for rome i will write you from therewhere i first beheld you that is familiarity if i may be allowed the expression enough meanwhile about myself my intentions and delays let me hear or at least let me ask about your own circumstances and propensities you must have felt spattered like all the world with the blood of the poor russian czar arent you glad you are not an empress but you are god save your majestymrs greville sent me swinburnes complicated dirge upon her poor simple mother and i thought it wanting in all the qualities that one liked in mrs t i should like very much to send a tender message to mrs gordon indefinitebut very tender to you i am both tender and definite save when i cross  ever very faithfully yours h james jr     iii  the middle years  18821888   after his long absence henry james had a few crowded months of american impressions during the winter of 18812 in boston new york and washington he was as sociable as usual whereever he went and he used to the full the opportunity of reviving old memories and creating new it will be seen that he confesses to having enjoyed a certain success since the publication of daisy miller three years before he had known what it was to be a wellknown author in london but it was a fresh sensation on his native ground unhappily this interesting episode was cut short by the first great sorrow that had fallen upon his house his mother died suddenly in february 1882 to the end of his life henry james was to remember this loss as the deepest stroke he had ever received though she appears but little in his reminiscences there is no doubt that her presence her completely selfless devotion to her husband and children had been the greatest of all facts in their lives her care her pride in them the surrender of her whole nature and will to her love for them had accompanied and supported all their doings her husband during the long years in which he poured out the strange fruits of his thought to a steadily indifferent world had rested unreservedly on her true and gentle companionship her second sons letters to her from europe will already have shewn the easy and delightful relation that existed between her and her children they confided in her and leaned on her and rallied her with an intimacy deepened by the almost unbroken union of the whole household throughout their youth henry james stayed by his father for some months after her death and would have stayed longer but his father was anxious that he should return to his own work and life he sailed for england accordingly in may 1882  a summer in london was followed by the autumn excursion to touraine and provence portrayed in a little tour in france at tours he had the company of mrs fanny kemble and her daughter and as usual he spent a few weeks in paris before going home he arrived in london in december to receive almost at once a message announcing that his father was seriously ill he started immediately for america but it was already too late his father had died so they felt from mere cessation of the will to live bereft of their mother nothinghe had enabled himself to make perfectly surewas in the least worth while without her this attested he passed away or went out with entire simplicity promptness and ease for the definite reason that his support had failed so henry james wrote thirty years later in the notes of a son and brother and his letters of the time confirm the impression there passes away with him he says in one of them a certain sense of inspiration and protection which had i think accompanied each of us even to middle life thenceforward it was to his elder brother that henry james always looked for something of the same kind of support and many letters will shew how close the bond remained in the mere prose of business william took complete charge of his brothers share in the family affairs for which the younger never claimed the smallest aptitude but during the months that followed their fathers death william was in europe and it fell to henry to be occupied with the details of their property for perhaps the first and last time the patrimony consisted mainly of certain houses in the town of syracuse n y where their grandfather had had interests and where james street is still one of the principal thoroughfares henry was kept in america by the necessity of taking part in some rather complicated dispositions arising out of the terms of their fathers will and also by his care for the future of his sister alice the youngest of the family her health was very insecure and he proposed that she should join him in europe but for the present she preferred to settle in boston where he helped her to instal herself he did not finally return to london until the following august 1883  this was his last visit to america for more than twenty years he now subsided once more into the life of london with its incessant round of sociability and its equally incessant accompaniment of creative work gradually his tone in regard to his english setting is modified and deepened in the correspondence of these middle years it is no longer the interested but slightly rebellious immigrant who speaks it is rather the oldestablished colonist now identified with his surroundings a sharer in the general fortunes and responsibilities of the place if he still regards himself as an observer from without and is still capable as he once says of raging against british density in hours of irritation and disgust it is none the less noticeable that english difficulties english wars and politics and social troubles of all of which these years were very full begin to affect him as matters that concern his pride and solicitude for the country there mingles with his exasperation an ardent desire that the english race may continue to stand high in the world in spite of the many voices prophesying decadence and disaster he writes as one who now has a stake in an old and honourable institution and who feels a personal interest in its wellbeing and its good fame not indeed that he took or ever for a moment wished to take any share in the common life of the place but that of the most private fellowship he resolutely avoided the least appearance of publicity always refused to be drawn into popular functions organisations associations of any sort and clung more and more in the midst of all distractions to the secrecy and seclusion of his work and for that inner life these years were a very important turningpoint he now reached a period of his development when an immensely enlarged world of art seemed to open before him and at the same time he made the discoveryone that had a deep and special effect upon himthat he was not the kind of writer who is rewarded with a big audience both these matters are heard of in the letters of this time but their consequences do not appear fully until somewhat later they were various and farreaching and some of them can hardly be called fortunate  meanwhile the outward incidents of his life were as few and simple as ever the stream of social engagements remained indeed at its height notwithstanding his protests of withdrawal from the world but otherwise there is little to chronicle but the publication of his books and his yearly journeys abroad early in 1884 he spent some weeks in paris where the death of turgenev had made a gap that he greatly felt for the rest of the year he was occupied in writing the bostonians and went no further from london than to carry his manuscript into lodgings at dover for august and september a little later his sister alice arrived from america to make the experiment of life in europe for the benefit of her now confirmed illhealth her presence near at hand for the few years that remained to her was a source of much pleasure and also of constant anxiety to her brother she was a woman of rare talent and of strongly marked character but the life of an invalid which proved to be all she was capable of prevented her from using her opportunities and from taking the place that would have been open to her she lived in great retirement at first in london afterwards chiefly at bournemouth and leamington henry james was unwearied in his care for her he visited her constantly and never without keen delight in her company and her vigorous talk his brotherly attention had yet a further reward in the summer of 1885 when she was at bournemouth to be near her he spent several weeks there and was able at the same time to cultivate the society of another imprisoned invalid close by with whom he had already had some acquaintance this was robert louis stevenson and the intimacy that thus arose very fortunately still survives in many admirable letters of each to the other stevensons side of the correspondence edited by sir sidney colvin is well known and henry jamess can now be added to it there could be no more illuminating interchange between two fine artists so unlike in everything but their common passion  by this time the bostonians was beginning to appear in an american magazine and a little later again at dover the princess casamassima was finished for two years henry james now wrote nothing but shorter pieces among them the aspern papers the lesson of the master the reverberator with growing disconcertment as he found how tardily they seemed to appeal to editors american or english in the autumn of 1885 he spent his accustomed month in paris after which he scarcely stirred from london for another year early in 1886 he at last accomplished a move from his bolton street lodging never a very cheerful or convenient abode to a flat in kensington 13 de vere mansions presently known as 34 de vere gardens close to the palace and the park where he had much more agreeable conditions of light and air and quiet he was planning however for another long absence in italy away from the interruptions of london and this he secured during the first seven months of 1887 for most of the time he was at florence where he took rooms in a villa overhanging the view from bellosguardo and he paid two lengthy visits to venice staying first with mrs bronson in the apartment so often occupied by browning and later with mr and mrs daniel curtis in the splendid old palazzo barbaro where years afterwards he placed the exquisite and stricken heroine of the wings of the dove for the climax of her story he returned to england late in the summer to settle down to the writing of the tragic musethe first time as he mentions that he had attacked a purely english subject on a large scale i am getting to know english life better than american he writes in september 1888 when he was still working upon the book  and to understand the english character or at least the mind as well as if i had invented itwhich indeed he adds lightly i think i could have done without any very extraordinary expenditure of ingenuity the end of the summer of 1888 was spent in an hotel at torquay which became one of his favourite retreats and later in the autumn he was for a short while abroad at geneva and paris with a flying dip into northern italy the letter to his brother written from geneva with which this section closes lucidly sums up the conclusions he had by now drawn from the experience of a dozen years of england at the age of fortyfive he could feel that he had exhausted the study of the old international distinctions english and american that had engaged him for so long he was indeed to return to them again later on and to devote to them the final elaboration of his art but that lay far ahead and now for many years he faced in other directions  a vivid glimpse of henry james at this time is given in the following note of reminiscence kindly written for this page by mr edmund gosse       in the late summer of 1886 an experience more often imagined than      enjoyed actually took place in the shape of a party of friends      independently dispersed in the hotel or in lodgings through the      worcestershire village of broadway but with the home of frank      millet the american painter as their centre edwin abbey john s      sargent alfred parsons fred barnard and i and others lived      through five bright weeks of perfect weather in boisterous      intimacy early in september henry james joined us for a short      visit the millets possessed on their domain a medieval ruin a      small ecclesiastical edifice which was very roughly repaired so as      to make a kind of refuge for us and there in the mornings henry      james and i would write while abbey and millet painted on the      floor below and sargent and parsons tilted their easels just      outside we were all within shouting distance and not much serious      work was done for we were in towering spirits and everything was      food for laughter henry james was the only sedate one of us      allbenign indulgent but grave and not often unbending beyond a      genial chuckle we all treated him with some involuntary respect      though he asked for none it is remembered with what affability he      wore a garland of flowers at a birthday feast and even nobly      descending took part one night in a cakewalk but mostly though      not much our senior he was serious mildly avuncular but very      happy and unupbraiding       in those days henry james wore a beard of vague darkish brown      matching his hair which had not yet withdrawn from his temples      and these bushy ornaments had the effect of making him in a sense      shadowy almost every afternoon he took a walk with me rarely with      sargent never with the sedentary rest these walks were long in      time but not in distance for henry was inclined to saunter he had      not wholly recovered from that weakness of the muscles of his back      which had so long troubled him and i suppose that this was the      cause of a curious stiffness in his progress which proceeded      rather slowly he had certain preferences in particular for the      level road through the green landscape to the ancient grey village      of aston somerville he always made the same remark as if he had      never noticed it before that aston was so italian so tuscan       his talk which flowed best with one of us alone was enchanting      with me largely it concerned the craft of letters i remember      little definitely but recall how most of us with the ladies      spent one long rollicking day in rowing down the winding avon from      evesham to pershore there was much singing in the english boat      as marvell says and edwin abbey obliged profusely on the banjo      henry james i can still see sitting like a beneficent deity a sort      of bearded buddha at the prow manifestly a little afraid that      some of us would tumble into the river     to miss henrietta reubell   metropolitan club washington d c  jan 9th 1882  my dear miss reubell  i have never yet thanked you for the amiable note in which you kindly invited me to write to you from the americas and the best way i can do so now is to simply respond to your invitation i am in the americas indeed and behold i write these countries are extremely pleasant and i recommend you to come and see them au plus tôt you would have a great career here and would returnif you should return at allwith a multitude of scalps at your slim girdle there is a great demand for brilliant women and i can promise you that you would be intimately appreciated i shall return about the first of maybut without any blond scalps though with a great many happy impressions though i should perhaps not linger upon the point myself i believe i have had a certain success as for ces gensci they have had great success with me and have been delightfully genial and hospitable it is here that people treat you well venezy voir you have had a great many things i know but you have not had a winter in the americas the people are extremely nice and humane i didnt care for it much at firstbut it improves immensely on acquaintance and after you have got the right point of view and diapason it is a wonderfully entertaining and amusing country the skies are as blue as the blotting paper as yet unspotted on which this scrawl reposes and the sunshine which is deliciously warm has always an air de fête i have seen multitudes of people and no one has been disagreeable that is different from your pretentious old world of washington i can speak as yet but little having come but four days ago but it is like nothing else in the old world or the new enormous spaces hundreds of miles of asphalte a charming climate and the most entertaining society in america i spent a month in boston and another in new york and have paid three or four visits in the country all this was very jolly and it is pleasant to be in ones native land where one is someone and something if i were to abide by my vanity only i should never return to that europe which ignores me unfortunately i love my europe better than my vanity and i appreciate you if i may say so better than either therefore i shall returnabout the month of may i am thinking tremendously about writing to mrs boitkindly tell her so my very friendly regards to your dear mother and your brother a word to cambridge mass my fathers will always reach me it would be very charming of you to address one to yours very faithfully  h james     to charles eliot norton   20 quincy street cambridge mass  feb 7th 1882  my dear charles  only a word to thank you very heartily for your little note of friendship and to send you a grateful message as well from my father and sister my mothers death is the greatest change that could befall us but our lives are so full of her still that we scarcely yet seem to have lost her the long beneficence of her own life remains and survives  i shall see you after your return to shady hill as i am to be for a good while in these regions i wish to remain near my father who is infirm and rather tottering and i shall settle myself in boston for the next four or five months in other words i shall be constantly in cambridge and will often look in at you i hope you have enjoyed your pilgrimage  ever faithfully yours h james jr     to mrs john l gardner       the play referred to in this letter is doubtless the dramatic      version of daisy miller it remained unacted but was published      in america in 1883   3 bolton st piccadilly june 5th 1882  my dear mrs gardner  a little greeting across the sea i meant to send it as soon as i touched the shore but the huge grey mass of london has interposed i experience the need of proving to you that i missed seeing you before i left americathough i tried one daythe one before i quitted boston but you were still in new york contributing the harmony of your presence and the melodies of your toilet to the din of wagnerian fiddles and the crash of teutonic cymbals you must have passed me in the train that last saturday but you have never done anything but pass meand dépasser me so it doesnt so much matter that final interviewthat supreme farewellwill however always be one of the most fascinating incidents of lifethe incidents that didnt occur and leave me to muse on what they might have done for us i think with extraordinary tenderness of those two pretty little evenings when i read you my play they make a charming picturea perfect picturein my mind and the memory of them appeals to all that is most raffiné in my constitution drop a teara diminutive tear as your tears must besmall but beautifullyshaped pearls upon the fact that my drama is not after all to be brought out in new york at least for the present it is possible it may see the light here i am to read it to the people of the st jamess theatre next week please dont speak of this london seems big and black and horrible and delightfulboston seems only the last named you indeed could make it horrible for me if you chose and you could also make it big but i doubt if you could make it black it would be a fair and glittering horror suggestive of icicles and white fur i wonder if you are capable of writing me three words let one of them tell me you are well the secondwhat you please the third that you sometimes bestow a friendly thought upon yours very faithfully  h james jr     to miss grace norton   hôtel du midi toulouse  oct 17th 1882  my dear grace  you shall have a letter this morning whatever happens i am waiting for the train to carcassonne and you will perhaps ask yourself why you are thus sandwiched between these two mouldy antiquities it is precisely because they are mouldy that i invoke your genial presence toulouse is dreary and not interesting and i am afraid that carcassonne will answer to the same description i heard given a couple of weeks ago by an english lady in touraine of the charming château damboise rather curious you know but very very dirty therefore my spirit turns for comfort to what i have known best in life i got your last excellent letter an abominable number of weeks ago and i hereby propose as a rule of our future correspondence that i be graciously absolved from ever specifying the time that has elapsed since the arrival of the letter i am supposed to be answering this custom will ease me off immensely your last however is not so remote but that the scolding you gave me for sending your previous letter to mrs kemble is fearfully fresh in my mind my dear grace i regret extremely having irritated you but i would fain wrestle with you on this subject i think you have a false code about the showing of lettersand in calling it a breach of confidence you surely confound the limits of things of course there is always a particular discretion for the particular case but what are letters but talk and what is the showing them but the repetition of talk the same rules that govern that of course govern the other but i dont see why they should be more stringent it is indeed i think of the very essence of a good letter to be shownit is wasted if it is kept for one was not mme de sévignés last always handed about to a hundred peoplewas not horace walpoles what was right for them is it seems to me right for you however i make this little protest simply for the theorys sake and promise you solemnly that in practice in future you shall be my own exclusive and peculiar sévigné yet i dont at all insist on being your exclusive walpole i have indeed the sweet security of the conviction that you will never want as they say you dont in cambridge to exhibit my epistles only i give you full leave to read them aloud at your soirées have your soirées recommenced by the way where are you my dear grace and how are you the question about your whereabouts will perhaps make you smile if anything in this letter can as i make no doubt you are enjoying the gorgeous charm i speak without irony of a cambridge october for myself as you see i am doing the south of francefor literary purposes into which i wont pretend to enter as they are not of a very elevated character i am trying to write some articles about these regions for an american illustratedharperbut i dont foresee as yet any very brilliant results i left england some five weeks ago and after a few days in paris came down into tourainefor the sake of the châteaux of the loire at the hotel at tours where i spent 12 days i had the advantage of the society of mrs kemble and her daughter mrs wister with the son of the latter we made some excursions togetherthat is minus mrs k a large void who was too infirm to junket about and then the ladies returned to paris and i took my way further afield touraine is charming chenonceaux chambord blois etc very interesting and that episode was on the whole a successenlivened too by my exciting company but the rest of france that is those parts i have been through is rather disappointing though i suppose when i recite my itinerary you will feel that i ought to have found a world of picturesquenessi mean at bourges le mans angers nantes la rochelle poitiers etc the cathedral of bourges is worth a long pilgrimage to see but for the rest france has preserved the physiognomy of the past much less than england and than italy besides when i come into the south i dont console myself for not being in the latter country i dont care for these people and in fine i rather hate it i return to paris on november 1st and spend a month there then i return to england for the winter when i am in that country i want to get out of it and when i am out of it i languish for its heavy air england is just now in a rather cocky mood and disposed to carry it high with her little egyptian victories it is such a satisfaction to me to see her again counting for something in europe that i would give her carte blanche to go as far as she choosesor dares but at the same time i hope she wont exhibit a vulgar greed it has a really dramatic interest for me to see how the great gladstone will acquit himself of a situation in which all his high principles will be subjected to an extraordinary strain he will be i suspect neither very lofty nor very base but will compromise i dont suppose however you care much about these faraway matters i hope my dear grace that your life is taking more and more a possible shapethat your summer has left you some pleasant memories and your winter brings some cheerful hopes i dont think i shall be so long againat any rate my letters are no proof of my sentimentsby which i mean that my silence is no disproof for after all i wish to be believed when i tell you that i am most affectionately yours  henry james jr     to william james   131 mt vernon st boston  dec 26th 82  my dear william  you will already have heard the circumstances under which i arrived at new york on thursday 21st at noon after a very rapid and prosperous but painful passage letters from alice and katherine l were awaiting me at the dock telling me that dear father was to be buried that morning i reached boston at 11 that night there was so much delay in getting uptown i found bob at the station here he had come on for the funeral only and returned to milwaukee the next morning alice who was in bed was very quiet and a k was perfect they told me everythingor at least they told me a great dealbefore we parted that night and what they told me was deeply touching and yet not at all literally painful father had been so tranquil so painless had died so easily and as it were deliberately and there had been nonenot the leastof that anguish and confusion which we imagined in london he simply after the improvement of which we were written before i sailed had a sudden relapsea series of swoonsafter which he took to his bed not to rise again he had no visible maladystrange as it may seem the softening of the brain was simply a gradual refusal of food because he wished to die there was no dementia except a sort of exaltation of his belief that he had entered into the spiritual life nothing could persuade him to eat and yet he never suffered or gave the least sign of suffering from inanition all this will seem strange and incredible to you but told with all the details as aunt kate has told it to me it becomes realtaking father as he wasalmost natural he prayed and longed to die he ebbed and faded away though in spite of his strength becoming continually less he was able to see people and talk he wished to see as many people as he could and he talked with them without effort he saw f boott and talked much two or three days before he died alice says he said the most picturesque and humorous things he knew i was coming and was glad but not impatient he was delighted when he was told that you would stay in my rooms in my absence and seemed much interested in the idea he had no belief apparently that he should live to see me but was perfectly cheerful about it he slept a great deal and as a k says there was so little of the sickroom about him he lay facing the windows which he would never have darkenednever pained by the light 27th am will send this now and write again tonight all our wish here is that you should remain abroad the next six months  ever your h james     to george du maurier       the article on george du maurier was that reprinted in partial      portraits 1888   115 east 25th street new york  april 17th 1883  my dear du maurier  i send you by this post the sheets of that little tribute to your genius which i spoke of to you so many months ago and which appears in the century for may the magazine is not yet out or i would send you that and the long delay makes my article so slight in itself rather an impotent conclusion let me hasten to assure you that the london society tacked to the title is none of my doing but that of the editors of the magazine who put in an urgent plea for it such as my poor remarks are i hope you will find in them nothing disagreeable but only the expression of an exceeding friendliness may my blessing go with them and a multitude of good wishes  i should have been to see you again long ago if i had not suddenly been called to america by the death of my father in december last the autumn before that i spent altogether abroad and have scarcely been in england since i bade you goodbye after that very delightful walk and talk we had together last julyan episode of which i have the happiest tenderest memory romantic hampstead seems very far away from east 25th st though east 25th st has some good points i have been spending the winter in boston and am here only on a visit to a friend and though i am new yorkais dorigine i never return to this wonderful city without being entertained and impressed afresh new york is full of types and figures and curious social idiosyncrasies and i only wish we had some one here to hold up the mirror with a 15th part of your talent it is altogether an extraordinary growing swarming glittering pushing chattering goodnatured cosmopolitan place and perhaps in some ways the best imitation of paris that can be found yet with a great originality of its own but i didnt mean to be so geographical i only meant to shake hands and to remind myself again that if my dear old london life is interrupted it isnt heaven be praised finished and that therefore there is a usea delightful and superior usein keeping up my relations i am talking a good deal like mrs ponsonby de tomkyns but when you reflect that you are not sir gorgius midas you will acquit me i have a fair prospect of returning to england late in the summer and that will be for a long day i hope your winter has used you kindly and that mrs du maurier is well and also the other ornaments of your home including the great st bernard i greet them all most kindly and am ever very faithfully yours  henry james     to miss grace norton   131 mount vernon st boston july 28th 1883  my dear grace  before the sufferings of others i am always utterly powerless and your letter reveals such depths of suffering that i hardly know what to say to you this indeed is not my last wordbut it must be my first you are not isolated verily in such states of feeling as thisthat is in the sense that you appear to make all the misery of all mankind your own only i have a terrible sense that you give all and receive nothingthat there is no reciprocity in your sympathythat you have all the affliction of it and none of the returns howeveri am determined not to speak to you except with the voice of stoicism i dont know why we livethe gift of life comes to us from i dont know what source or for what purpose but i believe we can go on living for the reason that always of course up to a certain point life is the most valuable thing we know anything about and it is therefore presumptively a great mistake to surrender it while there is any yet left in the cup in other words consciousness is an illimitable power and though at times it may seem to be all consciousness of misery yet in the way it propagates itself from wave to wave so that we never cease to feel and though at moments we appear to try to pray to there is something that holds one in ones place makes it a standpoint in the universe which it is probably good not to forsake you are right in your consciousness that we are all echoes and reverberations of the same and you are noble when your interest and pity as to everything that surrounds you appears to have a sustaining and harmonizing power only dont i beseech you generalize too much in these sympathies and tendernessesremember that every life is a special problem which is not yours but anothers and content yourself with the terrible algebra of your own dont melt too much into the universe but be as solid and dense and fixed as you can we all live together and those of us who love and know live so most we help each othereven unconsciously each in our own effort we lighten the effort of others we contribute to the sum of success make it possible for others to live sorrow comes in great wavesno one can know that better than youbut it rolls over us and though it may almost smother us it leaves us on the spot and we know that if it is strong we are stronger inasmuch as it passes and we remain it wears us uses us but we wear it and use it in return and it is blind whereas we after a manner see my dear grace you are passing through a darkness in which i myself in my ignorance see nothing but that you have been made wretchedly ill by it but it is only a darkness it is not an end or the end dont think dont feel any more than you can help dont conclude or decidedont do anything but wait everything will pass and serenity and accepted mysteries and disillusionments and the tenderness of a few good people and new opportunities and ever so much of life in a word will remain you will do all sorts of things yet and i will help you the only thing is not to melt in the meanwhile i insist upon the necessity of a sort of mechanical condensationso that however fast the horse may run away there will when he pulls up be a somewhat agitated but perfectly identical g n left in the saddle try not to be illthat is all for in that there is a failure you are marked out for success and you must not fail you have my tenderest affection and all my confidence ever your faithful friend  henry james     to william james   hôtel de hollande paris feb 20th 84  my dear william  i owe you an answer to two lettersespecially to the one in which you announce to me the birth of your little israelite i bid him the most affectionate welcome into this world of care and i hope that by this time he has begun to get used to it i am too delighted to hear of alices wellbeing and trust it has now merged into complete recovery apropos of the babe allow me to express an earnest hope that you will give him some handsome and pictorial name within discreet limits most of our names are rather colourlesscollezlui dessus therefore a little patch of brightnessand dont call him after any onegive him a name quite to himself and let it be only one i have seen several times the gifted sargent whose work i admire exceedingly and who is a remarkably artistic nature and charming fellow i have also spent an evening with a daudet and a morning at auteuil with ed de goncourt seeing these people does me a world of good and this intellectual vivacity and raffinement make an english mind seem like a sort of gluepot but their ignorance corruption and complacency are strange full strange i wish i had time to give you more of my impressions of them they are at any rate very interesting and daudet who has a remarkable personal charm and is as beautiful as the day was extremely nice to me i saw also zola at his house and the whole group are of course intense pessimists daudet justified this to me as regards himself by the general sadness of life and his fear for instance whenever he comes in that his wife and children may have died while he was out i hope you manage to keep free from this apprehension i return to london on the 27th to stick fast there till the summer i embrace alice and the little jew and am ever your affectionate  henry     to w d howells   paris feb 21st 1884  my dear howells  your letter of the 2d last gives me great pleasure a frozen atlantic seemed to stretch between us and i had had no news of you to speak of save an allusion in a late letter of t b a to your having infantdisease in your house you give me a good account of this and i hope your tax is paid this year at least these are not things to make a hardened bachelor mend his wayshardened as i am however i am not proof against being delighted to hear that my barberina tale entertained you i am not prepared even to resent the malignity of your remark that the last third is not the best it isnt the last part is squeezed together and écourté it is always the fault of my things that the head and trunk are too big and the legs too short i spread myself always at first from a nervous fear that i shall not have enough of my peculiar tap to go round but i always or generally have and therefore at the end have to fill one of the cups to overflowing my tendency to this disproportion remains incorrigible i begin short tales as if they were to be long novels apropos of which ask osgood to show you also the sheets of another thing i lately sent hima new england winter it is not very goodon the contrary but it will perhaps seem to you to put into form a certain impression of bostonwhat you tell me of the success of s last novel sickens and almost paralyses me it seems to me the book so contemptibly bad and ignoble that the idea of people reading it in such numbers makes one return upon ones self and ask what is the use of trying to write anything decent or serious for a public so absolutely idiotic it must be totally wasted i would rather have produced the basest experiment in the naturalism that is being practised here than such a piece of sixpenny humbug work so shamelessly bad seems to me to dishonour the novelists art to a degree that is absolutely not to be forgiven just as its success dishonours the people for whom one supposes ones self to write excuse my ferocities which more discreetly and philosophically i think you must share and dont mention it please to any one as it will be set down to greeneyed jealousy  i came to this place three weeks sinceon the principle that anything is quieter than london but i return to the british scramble in a few days paris speaks to me always for about such a time as this with many voices but at the end of a month i have learned all it has to say i have been seeing something of daudet goncourt and zola and there is nothing more interesting to me now than the effort and experiment of this little group with its truly infernal intelligence of art form mannerits intense artistic life they do the only kind of work today that i respect and in spite of their ferocious pessimism and their handling of unclean things they are at least serious and honest the floods of tepid soap and water which under the name of novels are being vomited forth in england seem to me by contrast to do little honour to our race i say this to you because i regard you as the great american naturalist i dont think you go far enough and you are haunted with romantic phantoms and a tendency to factitious glosses but you are in the right path and i wish you repeated triumphs therebeginning with your americovenetianthough i slightly fear from what you tell me that he will have a certain gloss it isnt for me to reproach you with that however the said gloss being a constant defect of my characters they have too much of ittoo damnably much but i am a failurecomparatively read zolas last thing la joie de vivre this title of course has a desperate irony but the work is admirably solid and serious addiostia bene i wish you could send me anything you have in the way of advancesheets it is rather hard that as you are the only english novelist i read except miss woolson i should not have more comfort with you give my love to winnie i am sure she will dance herself well why doesnt mrs howells try it too  tout à vous henry james     to john addington symonds   3 bolton st piccadilly w paris  feb 22nd 1884  my dear j a symonds  your good letter came to me just as i was leaving london for a month in this placeto return there in a few days and the distractions and interruptions incidental to a short stay in paris must account for my not having immediately answered it as the spirit moved me to do i thank you for it very kindly and am much touched by your telling me that a communication from me should in any degree and for a moment have lighted up the horizon of the alpine crevice in which i can well believe you find it hard and even cruel to be condemned to pass life to condole with you on a fate so stern must seem at the best but a hollow business i will therefore only wish you a continuance of the courage of which your abundant and delightful work gives such evidence and take pleasure in thinking that there may be entertainment for you in any of my small effusionsi did send you the century more than a year ago with my paper on venice not having then the prevision of my reprinting it with some other things i sent it you because it was a constructive way of expressing the good will i felt for you in consequence of what you have written about the land of italyand of intimating to you somewhat dumbly that i am an attentive and sympathetic reader i nourish for the said italy an unspeakably tender passion and your pages always seemed to say to me that you were one of a small number of people who love it as much as i doin addition to your knowing it immeasurably better i wanted to recognize this to your knowledge for it seemed to me that the victims of a common passion should sometimes exchange a look and i sent you off the magazine at a venture i thank you very sincerely for the goodnatured things you say of its companions it is all very light work indeed and the only merit i should dream of anyone finding in it would be that it is prettily turned i thank you still further for your offer to send me the tauchnitz volumes of your italian local sketches i know them already well as i have said and possess them in the english issue but i shall welcome them warmly directly from youespecially as i gather that they have occasional retouchings  i lately spent a number of months in america after a long absence but i live in london and have put my constant address at the top of my letter i imagine that it is scarcely ever in your power to come to england but do take note of my whereabouts for this happy and possibly to you ideal contingency i should very much like to see youbut i go little nowadays to switzerland in summer though at one time i was there a good deal i think it possible moreover that at that season you get out of your alps i certainly should in your place for the alps are easily too many for mei can well imagine the innumerable things you miss at davosyear after yearand i will say it i think of you with exceeding sympathy as a sign of that i shall send you everything i publish  i shake hands with you and am very truly yours  henry james     to alphonse daudet   3 bolton st piccadilly w london 19 juin 1884  mon cher

ajouter à celles que vous avez donnéesde tout ce que le roman peut accomplir comme révélation de la vie et du drôle de mélange que nous sommes la fille est étudiée avec une patience merveilleusecest un de ces portraits qui épuisent un type je vous avouerai que je trouve le jeune homme un peu sacrifiécomme étude et comme recherchesa figure me paraissant moins éclairéeen comparaison de celle de la femmequil ne le faudrait pour lntérêt moral la valeur tragique jaurais voulu que vous nous eussiez fait voir davantage par où il a passéen matière dexpérience plus personnelle et plus intime encore que les coucheries avec fannyen matière de rammollissement de volonté et de relâchement dâme en un mot le drame ne se passe peutêtre pas assez dans lâme et dans la conscience de jean cest à mesure que nous touchons à son caractère même que la situation devient intéressanteet ce caractère vous me faites leffet de lavoir un peu négligé vous me direz que voilà un jugement bien anglais et que nous inventons des abstractions comme nous disons afin de nous dispenser de toucher aux grosses réalités jestime pourtant quil ny a rien de plus réel de plus positif de plus à peindre quun caractère cest là quon trouve bien la couleur et la forme vous lavez bien prouvé du reste dans chacun de vos livres et en vous disant que vous avez laissé lamant de sapho un peu trop en blanc ce nest quavec vousmême que je vous compare mais je ne voulais que vous remercier et répondre à votre envoi je vous souhaite tout le repos quil vous faudra pour recommencer encore je garde de cette soirée que jai passée chez vous au mois de février une impression toute colorée je vous prie de me rappeler au souvenir bienveillant de madame daudet je vous serre la main et suis votre bien dévoué confrère  henry james     to robert louis stevenson       h js article on the art of fiction was reprinted in partial      portraits stevensons rejoinder was the essay called a humble      remonstrance included in memories and portraits   3 bolton st w dec 5th 1884  my dear robert louis stevenson  i read only last night your paper in the december longmans in genial rejoinder to my article in the same periodical on besants lecture and the result of that charming halfhour is a friendly desire to send you three words not words of discussion dissent retort or remonstrance but of hearty sympathy charged with the assurance of my enjoyment of everything you write its a luxury in this immoral age to encounter some one who does writewho is really acquainted with that lovely art it wouldnt be fair to contend with you here besides we agree i think much more than we disagree and though there are points as to which a more irrepressible spirit than mine would like to try a fall that is not what i want to saybut on the contrary to thank you for so much that is suggestive and felicitous in your remarksjustly felt and brilliantly said they are full of these things and the current of your admirable style floats pearls and diamonds excellent are your closing words and no one can assent more than i to your proposition that all art is a simplification it is a pleasure to see that truth so neatly uttered my pages in longman were simply a plea for liberty they were only half of what i had to say and some day i shall try and express the remainder then i shall tickle you a little affectionately as i pass you will say that my liberty is an obese divinity requiring extra measures but after one more go i shall hold my tongue the native gaiety of all that you write is delightful to me and when i reflect that it proceeds from a man whom life has laid much of the time on his back as i understand it i find you a genius indeed there must be pleasure in it for you too i ask colvin about you whenever i see him and i shall have to send him this to forward to you i am with innumerable good wishes yours very faithfully  henry james     to william james       the literary remains of the late henry james with an      introduction by william james had just been published in america   3 bolton street w jan 2d 1885  dear william  i must give some response however brief to your letter of dec 21st enclosing the project of your house and a long letter from r temple three days ago too came the two copies of fathers and your book which have given me great filial and fraternal joy all i have had time to read as yet is the introductionyour part of which seems to me admirable perfect it must have been very difficult to do and you couldnt have done it better and how beautiful and extraordinarily individual some of them magnificent all the extracts from fathers writings which you have selected so happily it comes over me as i read them more than ever before how intensely original and personal his whole system was and how indispensable it is that those who go in for religion should take some heed of it i cant enter into it much myselfi cant be so theological nor grant his extraordinary premises nor throw myself into conceptions of heavens and hells nor be sure that the keynote of nature is humanity etc but i can enjoy greatly the spirit the feeling and the manner of the whole thing full as this last is of things that displease me too and feel really that poor father struggling so alone all his life and so destitute of every worldly or literary ambition was yet a great writer at any rate your task is beautifully and honourably donemay it be as great or even half as great a service as it deserves to be to his memory the book came at a bad time for alice as she has had an upset which i will tell you of but though she has been able to have it in her hand but for a moment it evidently gives her great pleasure she burst into tears when i gave it to her exclaiming how beautiful it is that william should have done it isnt it isnt it beautiful and how good william is how good how good and we talked of poor fathers fading away into silence and darkness the waves of the world closing over this system which he tried to offer it and of how we were touched by this act of yours which will i am sure do so much to rescue him from oblivion i have received no notice from scribner of the arrival of the other volumes and shall write to him in a day or two if i dont hear but i am rather embarrassed as to what to do with so manywishing only to dispose of them in a manner which will entail some prospect of decent consideration and courtesy i can give away five or six copies to persons who will probably have some attention and care for them eg fredk harrison stopford brooke burnejones mrs orr etc but the newspapers and reviews are so grim and philistine and impenetrable and stupid that i can scarcely think of any to which it isnt almost an act of untenderness to send it but i will go into the matter with scribner the project for your house is charmingvery big it looks and of a most pleasant type love to all  ever your henry     to miss grace norton   3 bolton st w jan 24th 1885  my dear grace                                       it is a feature of life in this place that the longer it lasts the more ones liabilities of every kind accumulatethe more things there are to be done every hour of the day i have so many to do that i am thinking of inventing some new day with 40 or 50 hoursor else some newer one still with only half a dozen as that would simplify a large proportion of ones diurnal duties out of existence i am having a quieter winter than i have had for some years in london and have seen very few new people and not even many old friends my quietness comparative of course is my solemn choice and means that i have been dining out much less than at most former times for the sacred purpose of getting my evenings to myself i have been sitting at the festive british board for so many years now that i feel as if i had earned the right to give it up save in really seductive cases you can guess the proportion of these it is the only way to find any time to readand my reading was going to the dogs therefore i propose to become henceforth an occasional and not a regular diner with the wellfounded hope that my mind body spirits temper and general view of the human understanding and of the conversational powers of the english race will be the gainers by it moreover there is very little going onthe country is gloomy anxious and london reflects its gloom westminster hall and the tower were half blown up two days ago by irish dynamiters there is a catastrophe to the little british force in the soudan in the air rather an ominous want of news since gen stewarts victory at aboukir a week ago and a general sense of rocks ahead in the foreign relations of the countrycombined with an exceeding want of confidenceindeed a deep disgustwith the present ministry in regard to such relations i find such a situation as this extremely interesting and it makes me feel how much i am attached to this country and on the whole to its sometimes exasperating people the possible malheursreverses dangers embarrassments the decline in a word of old england go to my heart and i can imagine no spectacle more touching more thrilling and even dramatic than to see this great precarious artificial empire on behalf of which nevertheless so much of the strongest and finest stuff of the greatest race for such they are has been expended struggling with forces which perhaps in the long run will prove too many for it if she only will struggle and not collapse and surrender and give up a part which looking at europe as it is today still may be great the drama will be well worth watching from such a good near standpoint as i have here but i didnt mean to be so beastly political another drama interesting me is the question of poor dear j r lowells possible recall after cleveland mounts the throne this to me is tragic pathetic his position here is in the highest degree honourable useful agreeablein short perfect and to give it all up to return from one day to another to john holmes and the brattle street horsecar which is very much what it amounts tosave when he goes to see you seems to me to be the sport of a cruel a barbaric fortune i havent asked you about yourselfthe complexion of your winter etc but there are some things i know sufficiently without asking so do youas that i am always praying for you though i dont pray in general and dont understand it i make this brilliant exception for you  your very faithful friend henry james     to william james       the first number of the bostonians appeared this month in the      century magazine containing scenes in which the veteran      philanthropist miss birdseye figured   3 bolton st w feb 14th 1885  dear william  i am quite appalled by your note of the 2nd in which you assault me on the subject of my having painted a portrait from life of miss peabody i was in some measure prepared for it by lowells as i found the other day taking for granted that she had been my model and an allusion to the same effect in a note from aunt kate still i didnt expect the charge to come from you i hold that i have done nothing to deserve it i should be very sorryin fact deadly sick or fatally illif i thought miss peabody herself supposed i intended to represent her i absolutely had no shadow of such an intention i have not seen miss p for twenty years i never had but the most casual observation of her i didnt know whether she was alive or dead and she was not in the smallest degree my startingpoint or example miss birdseye was evolved entirely from my moral consciousness like every other person i have ever drawn and originated in my desire to make a figure who should embody in a sympathetic pathetic picturesque and at the same time grotesque way the humanitary and cidevant transcendental tendencies which i thought it highly probable i should be accused of treating in a contemptuous manner in so far as they were otherwise represented in the tale i wished to make this figure a woman because so it would be more touching and an old weary battered and simpleminded woman because that deepened the same effect i elaborated her in my minds eyeand after i had got going reminded myself that my creation would perhaps be identified with miss peabodythat i freely admit so i have in mind the sense of being careful at the same time that i didnt see what i could do but go my way according to my own fancy and make my image as living as i saw it the one definite thing about which i had a scruple was some touch about miss birdseyes spectaclesi remembered that miss peabodys were always in the wrong place but i didnt see really why i should deprive myself of an effect as regards this point which is common to a thousand old people so i thought no more about miss p at all but simply strove to realize my vision if i have made my old woman live it is my misfortune and the thing is doubtless a rendering a vivid rendering of my idea if it is at the same time a rendering of miss p i am absolutely irresponsibleand extremely sorry for the accident if there is any chance of its being represented to her that i have undertaken to reproduce her in a novel i will immediately write to her in the most respectful manner to say that i have done nothing of the kind that an old survivor of the new england reform period was an indispensable personage in my story that my paucity of data and not my repletion is the faulty side of the whole picture that as i went i had no sight or thought of her but only of an imaginary figure which was much nearer to me and that in short i have the vanity to claim that miss birdseye is a creation you may think i protest too much but i am alarmed by the sentence in your letterit is really a pretty bad business and haunted by the idea that this may apply to some rumour you have heard of miss peabodys feeling atteinte i can imagine no other reason why you should call the picture of miss birdseye a bad business or indeed any business at all i would write to miss p on this chanceonly i dont like to assume that she feels touched when it is possible that she may not and knows nothing about the matter if you can ascertain whether or no she does and will let me know i will should there be need or fitness immediately write to her miss birdseye is a subordinate figure in the bostonians and after appearing in the first and second numbers vanishes till toward the end where she reenters briefly and pathetically and honourably dies but though subordinate she is i think the best figure in the book she is treated with respect throughout and every virtue of heroism and disinterestedness is attributed to her she is represented as the embodiment of pure the purest philanthropy the story is i think the best fiction i have written and i expected you if you said anything about it would intimate that you thought as muchso that i find this charge on the subject of miss peabody a very cold douche indeed  ever yours h james     to james russell lowell       lowell was now leaving london after having held the post of      american minister there since 1880   st albans cliff bournemouth  may 29th 1885  my dear lowell  my hope of coming up to town again has been defeated and it comes over me that your departure is terribly near therefore i write you a line of hearty and affectionate farewellmitigated by the sense that after all it is only for a few months that we are to lose you i trust serenely to your own conviction of this fact but for extra safety just remark that if you dont return to london next winter i shall hurl myself across the ocean at you like a lasso as i look back upon the years of your mission my heart swells and almost breaks again as it did when i heard you were superseded at the thought that anything so perfect should be gratuitously destroyed but there is a part of your function which can go on again indefinitely whenever you take it upand that i repeat i hope you will do soon rather than late i think with the tenderest pleasure of the many fireside talks i have had with you from the firstand with a pleasure dimmed with sadness of so many of our more recent ones you are tied to london now by innumerable cords and fibres and i should be glad to think that you ever felt me ever so lightly pulling at one of them it is a great disappointment to me not to see you again but i am kept here fast and shall not be in town till the end of june i give you my blessing and every good wish for a happy voyage i wish i could receive you over thereand assist at your arrival and impressionslittle as i want you to go back dont forget that you have produced a relation between england and the us which is really a gain to civilization and that you must come back to look after your work you cant look after it there that is the function of an englishmanand if you do it there they will call you one the only way you can be a good american is to return to our dear old stupid satisfactory london and to yours ever affectionately and faithfully  henry james     to william james       to prevent confusion of names it should be mentioned that the      alice referred to at the end of this letter is h js      sisterinlaw mrs william james his sister miss alice james      remained in england till her death six years later   13 de vere mansions w march 9th 1886  my dear william  long before getting your most excellent letter of feb 21st i had been pricked with shame and remorse at my long silence you may imagine then how this pang sharpened when three or four days ago that letter arrived there were all sorts of reasons for my silence which i wont take up time now with narratingfurther than to say that they were not reasons of misfortune or discomfortbut only of otherengagementandoccupation pressureconnected with arrears of writing consumption of time in furnishing and preparing my new habitation and the constant old story of london interruptions and distractions thank god i am out of them far more now than i have ever been beforein my chaste and secluded kensington quatrième i moved in here definitely only three days ago and am still rather upside down the place is excellent in every respect improves on acquaintance every hour and is in particular flooded with light like a photographers studio i commune with the unobstructed sky and have an immense birdseye view of housetops and streets my rooms are very pretty as well as very convenient and will be more so when little by little i have got more things when i have time i will make you a diagram and later when the drawingroom or library meantime i have a smaller sittingroom in order is furnished i have nothing for it yet i shall have the place photographed i shall do far better work here than i have ever done before  alice is going on the same very good way and receiving visits almost daily a great many people come to see her she is highly appreciated and might easily if she were to stay here getting sufficiently better to exert herself more c become a great success and queen of society her vigour of mind decision of character c wax daily and her conversation is brilliant and sémillant she could easily if she were to stay beat the british female all round she is also looking very well the weather continues bitterly cold and there will be no question of her going out for a long time to come  the two great public matters here have been the riot and the everlasting and most odious  scandal i mean of course putting the allovershadowing irish question aside i was at bournemouth seeing r l stevenson the day of the émeute and lost the spectacle to my infinite chagrin i should have seen it well from my balcony as i should have been at home when it passed and it smashed the windows in the houses three doors from mine on the corner of bolton st and piccadilly alice was all unconscious of it till the morrow and was not at all agitated the wreck and ruin in piccadilly and some other places i mean of windows was on my return from bournemouth sufficiently startling as was also the manner in which the carriages of a number of ladies were stopped and the occupants hustled rifled slapped or kissed as the case might be and turned out the real unemployed i believe had very little share in all this it was the work of the great army of roughs and thieves who seized owing to the very favourable nature of their opportunity a day of licence it is difficult to know whether the real want of work is now or not so very much greater than usualin face of positive affirmations and negations there is at any rate immense destitution every one here is growing poorerfrom causes which i fear will continue all the same what took place the other day is i feel pretty sure the worst that for a long time to come the british populace is likely to attempt i cant talk about the irish matterpartly because one is sick of itpartly because i know too little about it and one is still more sick of all the vain words on the subject without knowledge or thought that fill the air here i dont believe much in the irish and i believe still less in consider with less complacency the disruption of the british empire but i dont see how the management of their own affairs can be kept away from themor why it should i cant but think that as they are a poor lot with great intrinsic sources of weakness their power to injure and annoy england if they were to get their own parliament would be considerably less than is assumed  the bostonians must be out in america by this time i told them of course to send you a copy it appears to be having a goodish success there all your tidings about your own life bob c were of the deepest interest i wish i could assist at your researches and see the children and commune with aliceto whom i send much brotherly love  ever your henry     to charles eliot norton       professor norton had sent h j the first instalment of his edition      of carlyles correspondence   milan december 6th 1886  my dear charles  i ought long ago to have thanked you for your very substantial present of carlylebut i waited in the first place till i should have read the book which business was considerably delayed and then till i had wound up a variety of little matters mainly matters of writing which pressed upon me in anticipation of my leaving england for two or three months now when at last i seize the moment i have left england but you will be as glad of a letter from here as from out of the dense grey medium in which we had been living for a month before i quitted london i came hither straight from dover last night through the hideous but convenient hole in the dear old st gotthard and i have been strolling about milan all the morning drinking in the delicious italian sun which fortunately shines and giving myself up to the sweet sense of living once moreafter an interval of several yearsin the adorable country it illumines it is sunday and all the world is in the streets and squares and the italian type greets me in all its handsomeness and friendliness and also i fear i must add not a little in its vulgarity but its vulgarity is the exaggeration of a merit and not as in england and the us of a defect churches and galleries have such a fatal chill that being sorethroatish and neuralgic i have had to keep out of them but the duomo lifts all its pinnacles and statues into the far away light and looks across at the other white needles and spires of the alps in the same bewildering cluster i go to spend the remainder of this month in florence and afterwards toi hopetake a month between rome naples and venicebut it will be as it will turn out once i am in italy it is about the same to me to be in one place as in another  all this takes me away from carlyle and from the annandale view of life i read the two volumes with exceeding interest for my admiration of carlyle as a letter writer is boundless and it is curious to watch the first step and gradual amplification of his afterwards extraordinary style those addressed to his own family are most remarkable as dedicated to a household of peasants by one of themselves and in short for the amateur of carlyle the book has a high value but i doubt whether the general public will bite at it very eagerly i dont know why i allude to this thoughfor the general public has small sense and less taste and its likes and dislikes i think must mostly make the judicious grieve you seem to me a most perfect and ideal editorand it is a great pleasure to me that so excellent and faultless a piece of editorial work should proceed from our rough and ready countrybut at the same time your demolitions of the unspeakable froude dont persuade me that carlyle was amiable it seems to me he remains the most disagreeable in character of men of genius of equal magnificence in these youthful letters it appears to me even striking how his disagreeableness comes out more and more in proportion as his talent develops this doesnt prevent him however from being in my opinionand doubtless in yoursone of the very greatestperhaps the very greatest of letter writers only when one thinks of the other most distinguished masters of expression the image evoked has though sometimes it may be sad enough a serenity a general pleasantness when the vision of carlyle comes to us there comes with it the idea of harshness and discord the difference between the man and the genius seems to me in other words greater than in any other casefor if voltaire was a rascal he was eminently a social oneand rousseau to think of a great intellectual swell who must have been odious hadnt anything like carlyles parts all the same i shall devour the volumes i am delighted to see you are still to publish  i ought to have plenty of london news for youbut somehow i feel as if i had not brought it to italy with me much of it in these days is such as there must be little profit in carrying about with one the subject of the moment as i came away was the hideous  divorce case which will besmirch exceedingly the already very damaged prestige of the english upper class the condition of that body seems to me to be in many ways very much the same rotten and collapsible one as that of the french aristocracy before the revolutionminus cleverness and conversation or perhaps its more like the heavy congested and depraved roman world upon which the barbarians came down in england the huns and vandals will have to come upfrom the black depths of the in the people enormous misery though i dont think the attila is quite yet foundin the person of mr hyndman at all events much of english life is grossly materialistic and wants bloodletting i had not been absent from london for a year before thissave for two or three days at a time i remained in town all summer and autumnonly paying an occasional or indeed a rather frequent country visita business however which i endeavour more and more to keep if possible within the compass of hours the gilded bondage of the country house becomes onerous as one grows older and then the waste of time in vain sitting and strolling about is a gruesome thought in the face of what one still wants to do with ones remnant of existence i saw matt arnold the other night and he spoke very genially of you and of his visit to ashfieldvery affectionately too of george curtiswhich i loudly echoed m a said of stockbridge and the summer life thereabouts etc with his chin in the airyes yesits a proof that its attaching that one thinks of it againone thinks of it again this was amiably sublime and amiably characteristici see burnejones from time to time but not as often as i should like i am always so afraid of breaking in on his work whenever he is at home he is working and when he isnt working hes not at home when i do see him it is one of the best human pleasures that london has for me but i dont understand his lifethat is the manner and tenor of his productiona complete studio existence with doors and windows closed and no search for impressions outsideno open air no real daylight and no looking out for it the things he does in these conditions have exceeding beautybut they seem to me to grow colder and colderpictured abstractions less and less observed such as he is however he is certainly the most distinguished artistic figure among englishmen todaythe only one who has escaped vulgarization and on whom claptrap has no hold moreover he is as you know exquisite in mind and talkand we fraternize greatly     to miss grace norton   34 de vere gardens w july 23rd 1887  my dear grace  i am ashamed to find myself back in england without having fulfilled the inward vow i took when i received your last good and generous letterthat of writing to you before my long stay on the continent was over but i almost dont fail of that vowinasmuch as i returned only day before yesterday my eight months escape into the happy immunities of foreign life is over and the stern realities of london surround me in the shape of stuffy midsummer heat that of this metropolis has a truly british ponderosityits as dull as an article in a quarterly smoke circulars invitations bills the one sauce that talleyrand commemorated and reverberations of the grotesque jubilee on the other hand my small house seems most pleasant and peculiar in the sense of being my own and my servants are as punctual as they are primwhich is saying much but i enjoyed my absence and i shall endeavour to repeat it every year for the future on a smaller scale that is to leave london not at the beginning of the winter but at the end by the midapril and take the period of the insufferable season regularly in italy it was a great satisfaction to me to find that i am as fond of that dear country as i ever wasand that its infinite charm and interest are one of the things in life to be most relied upon i was afraid that the dryness of agewhich drains us of so many sentimentshad reduced my old tendresse to a mere memory but noit is really so much in my pocket as it were to feel that italy is always there it is rather rude my dear grace to say all this to youfor whom it is there to so little purpose but if i should observe this scruple about all the places that you dont go to or are not in when i write to you my writing would go very much on one leg i was back again in venicewhere i paid a second visit late in the season from the middle of may to july 1stwhen i got your last letter i was staying at the palazzo barbaro with the daniel curtisesthe happy owners today of that magnificent housea place of which the full charm only sinks into your spirit as you go on living there seeing it in all its hours and phases i went for ten days and they clinging to me i stayed five weeks the longest visit i ever paid a private family  in the interval between my two visits to venice i took again some rooms at the villa bricchieri at bellosguardothe one just below your old ombrellinowhere i had stayed for three december weeks on my arrival in florence the springtime there was enchanting and you know what a thing that incomparable view is to live with i really did live with it and rejoiced in it every minute holding it to be to my sensibilities positively the most beautiful and interesting in the world florence was given over to fêtes during most of those weeksthe fêtes of the completion of the façade of the duomowhich by the way the new façade isnt half bad it is of a very splendouriferous effect and there is doubtless too much of it but it does great honour to the contemporary as well as to the departed italianand i dont believe such work could have been produced elsewhere than in that country of the delicate hand and the insinuating chisel i stepped down into the fêtes from my hill topand even put on a crimson lucco and a beautiful black velvet headgear and disported myself at the great ballo storico that was given at the palazzo vecchio to the king and queen this had the defect of its classa profusion of magnificent costumes but a want of entrain and the success of the whole episode was much more a certain really splendid procession of the old time with all the strozzis guicciardinis rucellais etc mounted on magnificent horses and wearing admirable dresses with the childlike gallantry and glee with which only italians can wear them riding through the brown old streets and followed by an immense train of citizens all in the carefullest quattrocento garb this was really a noble picture and testified to the latent love of splendour which is still in those dear people and which only asks for a favouring chance to shine out even at the cost of ruining them before leaving italy i spent a week with mrs kemble at lago maggioreshe having dipped over there in spite of torrid heat she is a very or at least a partly extinct volcano today and very easy and delightful to dwell with in her aged resignation and adoucissements but she did suggest to me on seeing her again after so long an interval that it is rather a melancholy mistake in this uncertain life of ours to have founded oneself on so many rigidities and rulesso many siftings and sortings mrs kemble is toute dune pièce more than any one probably that ever lived she moves in a mass and if she does so little as to button her glove it is the whole of her personality that does it let us be flexible dear grace let us be flexible and even if we dont reach the sun we shall at least have been up in a ballooni left stresa on the 15th of this month had a glorious day on the simplon amid mountain streams and mountain flowers and came quickly home i shall be here for the rest of the summersave for little blotches of absenceand i look forward to some quiet months of work i am trying not without success to get out of societyas hard as some people try to get in i want to be dropped and cut and consummately ignored this only demands a little patience and i hope eventually to elbow my way down to the bottom of the waveto achieve an obscurity this would sound fatuous if i didnt add that success is easily within my grasp i know it allall that one sees by going outtoday as if i had made it but if i had i would have made it better i think of you on your porchamid all your creepers and tendrils and wherever you are dear grace i am your very faithful and much remembering friend  henry james     to edmund gosse       stevenson and his family sailed for america a few days after the      date of this letter mr gosse has described the episode in his      recollections of r l s critical kitkats stevensons life      in the south seas began in the following year and his friends in      england saw him no more   34 de vere gardens w august 17th 1887  dear gosse  i went today to r l ss ship which is at the albert dock about 20 minutes in the train from fenchurch street its sailing has been put off till monday forenoon so there is more time to do something i couldnt after all get on the shipas she stood off from the dock without a convenient approach and both the captain and the steward whom i wanted to see were not there as i was told by a man on the dock who was seeing some things being put on by a crane in which i couldnt be transferred the appearance of the vessel was the reverse of attractive though she is rather large than small i write tonight to mrs stevenson to ask if they are really coming up to sailthat is if nothing has interfered at the last moment if they are there is nothing to be done to deter them that i see i shall ask her to telegraph me an answer i shall feel that i must go again to the ship as i dont very well see how things are to be sent there i will telegraph you what she telegraphs me and what i decide to do  ever yours henry james     to robert louis stevenson       h js article on r l s appeared in the century magazine      april 1888 and was reprinted in partial portraits   34 de vere gardens w october 30th 1887  my dear louis  it is really a delight to get your charming letter from the undecipherable lake just this very blessed minute long alienation has made my american geography vague and not knowing what your lake is i know still less where it is nevertheless i roughly suspect it of being in the adirondacks if it isnt may it excuse the injury let me tell you quickly and crudely that i am quite exhilarated that you like the article i thoughtor rather i hopedthat you would and yet i feared you wouldntie

in the letters to his family and friends edited by sir      sidney colvin   34 de vere gardens w december 5th 1887  my dear louis  i could almost hate poor roderick h in whom at best as in all my past and shuffled off emanations and efforts my interest is of the slenderest for making you write so much more about him than about a still more fascinating hero if you had only given me a small instalment of that romantic serial the mundane situation of r l s my dear fellow you skip whole numbers at a time your correspondent wouldnt i am really delighted you can find something at this late day in that work in which my diminutive muse first tried to elongate her little legs it is a book of considerable good faith but i think of limited skill besides directly my productions are finished or at least thrust out to earn their living they seem to me dead they dwindle when weanedremoved from the parental breast and only flourish a little while imbibing the milk of my plastic care none the less am i touched by your excellent and friendly words perhaps i am touched even more by those you dedicate to the less favoured portrait my dear louis i dont think i follow you herewhy does that work move you to such scornsince you can put up with roderick or with any of the others as they are so it is and as it is so they are upon my word you are unfair to itand i scratch my head bewildered tis surely a graceful ingenious elaborate workwith too many pages but with i think an interesting subject and a good deal of life and style there all my works may be damnablebut i dont perceive the particular damnability of that one however i feel as if it were almost gross to defend myselffor even your censure pleases and your restrictions refresh i have this very day received from mr bain your memories and portraits and i lick my chops in advance it is very delectable i can see and it has the prettiest coat and face of any of your volumeslondon is settling to its winter pace and the cool rich fogs curtain us in i see colvin once in a while dans le monde which however i frequent less and less i miss you too sensibly my love to your wife and mothermy greeting to the brave lloyd  ever yours very faithfully h james  ps i am unspeakably vexed at the centurys long delay in printing my paper on youit is quite sickening but i am helplessand they tell me it wont come out till marchdn em all i am also sorryverynot to have any other prose specimens of my own genius to send you i have really written a good deal latelybut the beastly periodicals hold them back i cant make out why but i trust the dance will begin before long and that then you may glean some pleasure i pray you do write something yourself for one who knows and yet is famished for there isnt a morsel here that will keep one alive i wont question youtwere vainbut i wish i knew more about you i want to see youwhere you live and howand the complexion of your days but i dont know even the name of your habitat nor the date of your letter neither were on the page i bless you all the same     to w d howells   34 de vere gardens w january 2nd 1888  my dear howells  your pretty read book that is a misprint for red but it looks well better than it deserves so i let it stand the neat and attractive volume with its coquettish inscription over its mystifying date came in to me exactly as a new years gift i was delighted to get it for i had not perused it in the pages of harper for reasons that you will understandknowing as you must how little the habit of writing in the serial form encourages one to read in that odious way which so many simple folk thank heaven think the best i was on the point of getting april hopes to add to the brave array of its predecessors mine by purchase almost all of them when your graceful act saved me the almost equally graceful sacrifice i can make out why you are at buffalo almost as little as i believe that you believe that i have long forgotten you the intimation is worthy of the most tortuous feminine mind that you have representedsay this wondrous lady with the daughter in the very first pages of april hopes with whom i shall make immediate and marvelling acquaintance your literary prowess takes my breath awayyou write so much and so well i seem to myself a small brown snail crawling after a glossy antelope let me hope that you enjoy your work as much as you ought tothat the grind isnt greater than the inevitable from the moment one really tries to do anything certainly one would never guess it from your abounding page how much i wish i could keep this lovely new year by a long personal talk with you i am troubled about many things about many of which you could give me i think or rather i am sure advice and direction i have entered upon evil daysbut this is for your most private ear it sounds portentous but it only means that i am still staggering a good deal under the mysterious and to me inexplicable injury wroughtapparentlyupon my situation by my two last novels the bostonians and the princess from which i expected so much and derived so little they have reduced the desire and the demand for my productions to zeroas i judge from the fact that though i have for a good while past been writing a number of good short things i remain irremediably unpublished editors keep them back for months and years as if they were ashamed of them and i am condemned apparently to eternal silence you must be so widely versed in all the reasons of things of this sort today in the us that if i could discourse with you awhile by the fireside i should endeavour to draw from you some secret to break the spell however i dont despair for i think i am now really in better form than i have ever been in my life and i propose yet to do many things very likely too some day all my buried prose will kick off its various tombstones at once therefore dont betray me till i myself have given up that wont be for a long time yet if we could have that rich conversation i should speak to you too of your monthly polemics in harper and tell you i think i should go as far as that of certain parts of the business in which i am less with you than in others it seems to me that on occasions you mix things up that dont go together sometimes make mistakes of proportion and in general incline to insist more upon the restrictions and limitations the a priori formulas and interdictions of our common art than upon that priceless freedom which is to me the thing that makes it worth practising but at this distance my dear howells such things are too delicate and complicatedthey wont stand so long a journey therefore i wont attempt thembut only say how much i am struck with your energy ingenuity and courage and your delightful interest in the charming questions i dont care how much you dispute about them if you will only remember that a grain of example is worth a ton of precept and that with the imbecility of babyish critics the serious writer need absolutely not concern himself i am surprised sometimes at the things you notice and seem to care about one should move in a diviner air i even confess that since the bostonians i find myself holding the critical world at large in a singular contempt i go so far as to think that the literary sense is a distinctly waning quality i can speak of your wife and children only interrogativelywhich will tell you littleand me i fear less but let me at least be affirmative to the extent of wishing them all very affectionately and to mrs h in particular the happiest new year go on my dear howells and send me your books alwaysas i think i send you mine continue to write only as your admirable ability moves you and believe me  ever faithfully yours henry james     to robert louis stevenson       the novel just begun was the tragic muse   34 de vere gardens w july 31st 1888  my dear louis  you are too far awayyou are too absenttoo invisible inaudible inconceivable life is too short a business and friendship too delicate a matter for such tricksfor cutting great gory masses out of em by the year at a time therefore come back hang it allsink it all and come back a little more and i shall cease to believe in you i dont mean in the usual implied phrase in your veracity but literally and more fatally in your relevancyyour objective reality you have become a beautiful mytha kind of unnatural uncomfortable unburied mort you put forth a beautiful monthly voice with such happy notes in itbut it comes from too far away from the other side of the globe while i vaguely know that you are crawling like a fly on the nether surface of my chair your adventures no doubt are wonderful but i dont successfully evoke them understand them believe in them i do in those you write heaven knowsbut i dont in those you perform though the latter i know are to lead to new revelations of the former and your capacity for them is certainly wonderful enough this is a selfish personal cry i wish you back for literature is lonely and bournemouth is barren without you your place in my affection has not been usurped by anotherfor there is not the least little scrap of another to usurp it if there were i would perversely try to care for him but there isnti repeat and i literally care for nothing but your return i havent even your novel to stay my stomach withal the wan wet months elapse and i see no sign of it the beautiful portrait of your wife shimmers at me from my chimneypiecebrought some months ago by the natural mcclurebut seems to refer to one as dim and distant and delightful as a toast of the last century i wish i could make you homesicki wish i could spoil your fun it is a very featureless time the summer is rank with rheumatisma dark drowned unprecedented season the town is empty but i am not going away i have no money but i have a little work i have lately written several short fictionsbut you may not see them unless you come home i have just begun a novel which is to run through the atlantic from january 1st and which i aspire to finish by the end of this year in reality i suppose i shall not be fully delivered of it before the middle of next after that with gods help i propose for a longish period to do nothing but short lengths i want to leave a multitude of pictures of my time projecting my small circular frame upon as many different spots as possible and going in for number as well as quality so that the number may constitute a total having a certain value as observation and testimony but there isnt so much as a creature here even to whisper such an intention to nothing lifts its hand in these islands save blackguard party politics criticism is of an abject density and puerilityit doesnt existit writes the intellect of our race too low lang in the dn every morning and i believe in a hundred other places uses his beautiful thin facility to write everything down to the lowest level of philistine twaddlethe view of the old lady round the corner or the clever person at the dinner party the incorporated society of authors i belong to it and so do you i think but i dont know what it is gave a dinner the other night to american literati to thank them for praying for international copyright i carefully forbore to go thinking the gratulation premature and i see by this mornings times that the banquetted boon is further off than ever edmund gosse has sent me his clever little life of congreve just out and i have read itbut it isnt so good as his raleigh but no more was the insufferable subject come my dear louis grow not too thin i cant question youbecause as i say i dont conjure you up you have killed the imagination in methat part of it which formed your element and in which you sat vivid and near your wife and mother and mr lloyd suffer alsoi must confess itby this failure of breath of faith of course i have your letterfrom manasquan is that the idiotic name of theingenuous me to think there was a date it was terribly impersonalit did me little good a little more and i shant believe in you enough to bless you take this therefore as your last chance i follow all with an aching wing an inadequate geography and an ineradicable hope ever my dear louis yours to the last snub  henry james     to william james   hôtel de lecu geneva october 29th 1888  my dear william  your beautiful and delightful letter of the 14th from your country home descended upon me two days ago and after penetrating myself with it for 24 hours i sent it back to england to alice on whom it will confer equal beatitude not only because so copious but because so cheerful in tone and appearing to show that the essentials of health and happiness are with you i wish to delay no hour longer to write to you though i am at this moment rather exhausted with the effort of a long letter completed five minutes since to louis stevenson in answer to one i lately received from his wife from some undecipherable cannibalisland in the pacific they are such faraway fantastic bewildering people that there is a certain fatigue in the achievement of putting ones self in relation with them i may mention in this connection that i have had in my hands the earlier sheets of the master of ballantrae the new novel he is about to contribute to scribner and have been reading them with breathless admiration they are wonderfully fine and perfecthe is a rare delightful genius  i am sitting in our old family salon in this place and have sat here much of the time for the last fortnight in sociable converse with family ghostsfather and mother and aunt kate and our juvenile selves i became conscious suddenly about oct 10th that i wanted very much to get away from the stale dingy london which i had not quitted to speak of for 15 months and notably not all summera detestable summer in england of wet and cold alice whom i went to see on arriving at this conclusion assured me she could perfectly dispense for a few weeks with my presence on english soil so i came straight here where i have a sufficient though not importunate sense of being in a foreign country with a desired quietness for getting on with work i have had 16 days of extraordinarily beautiful weather full of autumn colour as vivid as yours at chocorua and with the mt blanc range perpetually visible literally hanging day after day over the blue lake i have treated myself as i say to the apartments or a portion of them in which we spent the winter of 5960 and in which nothing is changed save that the hotel seems to have gone down in the world a little before the multiplication of rivalsa descent however which has the agrément of unimpaired cleanliness and applies apparently to the prices as well it is very good and not at all dear geneva seems both duller and smartera good deal bigger yet emptier too the academy is now the universitya large winged building in the old public garden below the treille but all the old smells and tastes are here and the sensation is pleasant i expect in three or four days to go to paris for about three weeksand back to london after that i shall be very busy for the next three or four months with the long thing i am doing for the atlantic and which is to run no less than 15though in shorter instalments than my previous fictions so that i have no time for wanton travelling but i enjoy the easier lighter feeling of being out of england i suppose if one lived in one of these countries one would take its problems to ones self also or be oppressed and darkened by themeven as i am more or less by those which hang over me in london but as it is the continent gives one a refreshing sense of getting awayaway from whitechapel and parnell and a hundred other constantly thickening heavinesses it is always a great misfortune i think when one has reached a certain age that if one is living in a country not ones own and one is of anything of an ironic or critical disposition one mistakes the inevitable reflections and criticisms that one makes more and more as one grows older upon life and human nature etc for a judgment of that particular country its natives peculiarities etc to which really one has grown exceedingly accustomed for myself at any rate i am deadly weary of the whole international state of mindso that i ache at times with fatigue at the way it is constantly forced upon me as a sort of virtue or obligation i cant look at the englishamerican world or feel about them any more save as a big anglosaxon total destined to such an amount of melting together that an insistence on their differences becomes more and more idle and pedantic and that melting together will come the faster the more one takes it for granted and treats the life of the two countries as continuous or more or less convertible or at any rate as simply different chapters of the same general subject literature fiction in particular affords a magnificent arm for such taking for granted and one may so do an excellent work with it i have not the least hesitation in saying that i aspire to write in such a way that it would be impossible to an outsider to say whether i am at a given moment an american writing about england or an englishman writing about america dealing as i do with both countries and so far from being ashamed of such an ambiguity i should be exceedingly proud of it for it would be highly civilized you are right in surmising that it must often be a grief to me not to get more time for readingthough not in supposing that i am hollowed out inside by the limitations my existence has too obstinately attached to that exercise combined with the fact that i produce a great deal at times i do read almost as much as my wretched little stomach for it literally will allow and on the whole i get much more time for it as the months and years go by i touched bottom in the way of missing time during the first half of my long residence in londonand traversed then a sandy desert in that respectwhere however i took on board such an amount of human and social information that if the same necessary alternatives were presented to me again i should make the same choice one can read when one is middleaged or old but one can mingle in the world with fresh perceptions only when one is young the great thing is to be saturated with somethingthat is in one way or another with life and i chose the form of my saturation moreover you exaggerate the degree to which my writing takes it out of my mind for i try to spend only the interest of my capital  i havent told you how i found alice when i last saw her she is now in very good formstill going out i hear from her in the mild moments and feeling very easy and even jolly about her leamington winter my being away is a sign of her really good symptoms she was wüthend after the london police in connection with the whitechapel murders to a degree that almost constituted robust health i have seen a great many that is more than usual frenchmen in london this year they bring me notes of introductionand the other day the night before coming away i entertained at dinner at a club the french ambassador at madrid paul cambon xavier charmes of the french foreign office g du maurier and the wonderful little jusserand the chargé daffaires in london who is a great friend of mine and to oblige and relieve whom it was that i invited the two other diplomatists his friends whom he had rather helplessly on his hands there is the real differencea gulf from the english or the american to the frenchman and vice versâ still more and not from the englishman to the american the frenchmen i see all seem to me wonderful the first timebut not so much at all the secondbut i must finish this without having touched any of the sympathetic things i meant to say to you about your place your work on it alices prowesses as a country lady the childrens vie champêtre etc aunt kate after her visit to you praised all these things to us with profusion and evident sincerity i wish i could see thembut the day seems fari havent lain on the ground for so many years that i feel as if i had spent them up in a balloon next summer i shall come herei mean to switzerland for which my taste has revived i am full of gratulation on your enlarged classes chances of reading etc and on your prospect of keeping the invalid child this winter give my tender love to alice you are entering the period of keen suspense about cleveland and i share it even here i have lately begun to receive and read the nation after a long intervaland it seems to me very rough was it ever so ever your affectionate  henry james     iv  later london years  18891897   for the next five years when once the tragic muse was off his hands henry james gave himself up with persevering determination to the writing of plays he speaks very plainly in his letters of the time concerning the motives which urged him to the theatre and there is no doubt that the chief of them was the desire for a kind of success which his fiction failed to achieve he puts it simply that he wished to make money that his books did not sell and that he regarded the theatre solely as a muchneeded pecuniary resource but such belittling of his own motivesout of a feeling that was partly pride and partly shynesswas not unusual with him and it seems impossible to take this language quite literally for a man of letters with moderate tastes and no family henry jamess circumstances were more than easy even if his writings should earn him nothing at all and he had no reason to doubt that his future was sufficiently assured moreover though his work might have no great popular vogueit had had a measure of that too at the time of daisy millerit still never wanted its own attentive circle so that he had not to complain of the utter indifference that may wear upon the nerves of even the most disinterested artist the sense of solitude that began to weigh upon him was perhaps more a matter of temperament than of fact it never for a moment meant that he had lost faith in himself and his powers but there mingled with it his inveterate habit of forecasting the future in the most ominous light as he looked forward he saw the undoubted decline of his popularity carrying him further and further away from recognition and its rewards and the prospect once the thought of it had taken root in his imagination distressed and dismayed him all would be righted he felt by the successful conquest of the theatre there lay the way not only to solid gains but to the reassurance of vaguer less formulated anxieties with such a tangible gage of having made his impression he would be relieved for ever from the fear of working in vain and alone  but from the moment when he began to write plays instead of novels the task laid hold upon him with other attractions and it was these no doubt which kept him at it through so many troubles and disappointments the dramatic form itself in the first place delighted and tormented him with its difficulty the artistic riddle of lucidity in extreme compression what he once characteristically described as the passionate economy of the play as he wrote it appealed to him and drew him on to constantly renewed attempts he admits that but for this perpetual challenge to his ingenuity he could never have supported the annoyances and irritations entailed by practical commerce with the theatre and yet it is easy to see that these too had a certain fascination for him he could not have been so eloquent in his denunciation of all theatrical conditions the sawdust and orangepeel of the trade if he had not been enjoyably stimulated by them and indeed from his earliest youth his interest in the stage had been keenly professional the tragic muse herself outcome of innumerable sessions at the théâtre français shews how intently he had studied the art of actingnot as a spectacle only but as a business and a life the world behind the theatrical scene though in the end he broke away from it with relief closely occupied his mind during these few years and with his gift for turning all experience to imaginative account he could scarcely look back on it afterwards as time wasted little as his heavy expenditure of spirit and toil had to shew for it his hope of finding fame and fortune in this direction failed utterlyand failed which was much to the good with clearness and precision at a given moment so that he was able to make a clean cut and return at once to his right line but he took with him treasures of observation lodged in a memory that to the end of his life always dwelt upon the theatre with a curious mixture of exasperation and delight  of all the plays seven or eight in number that he wrote between 1889 and 1894 only two were actually seen upon the stage the first of these was a dramatic version of the american produced by edward compton who played the principal part at southport in january 1891 the piece had a fairly successful provincial life but it failed to make good its hold upon london where it was given for the first time on september 26 1891 at the opéra comique by the same company it ran for about two months after which it was seen no more in london though it continued for some while longer to figure in comptons provincial repertory in its later life it was played with a rewritten last act in which much against his will henry james conceded to popular taste a happy ending for his hero and heroine the other and much more elaborate production was that of guy domville at the st jamess theatre on january 5 1895 with george alexander and miss marion terry in the chief parts the story of this unfortunate venture is to be read in the letters that follow the play which has never been published was enthusiastically received by the few and roughly rejected by the many it ran for exactly a month and then disappeared for good it was the most ambitious and no doubt the best piece of dramatic work that henry james had produced and he immediately accepted its failure as the end for the present of his playwriting the first night of guy domville had been marked by an incident which wounded him so deeply that he could never afterwards bear the least reference to it after the fall of the curtain he had been exposed apparently by a misunderstanding to the hostility of the grosser part of the audience and the affront the shock to his sensitive taste was extreme and enduring there had been various plans and projects in connection with his other plays but by this time they had all come to nothing to the relief of those friends who knew what an intolerable strain the whole agitated time had thrown upon his nerves he went back to the work and the life which were so evidently the right scope for his genius but before doing so he published four of his plays in two volumes of theatricals 1894 1895 to the second of which he prefixed an introduction which sums up with great candour and dignity a part of the lesson he had learnt from his discouraging experience  outside the theatre his life proceeded as usual and his yearly visits to paris or italy are almost the only events to be recorded he was in paris in the autumn of 1889 and in italy chiefly at florence and venice for the following summer but both these centres of attraction were beginning to lose their hold on him a little though for different reasons paris for something in its artistic selfsufficiency that he found increasingly unsympatheticand italy as it became more and more a field of social claims english and american irresistible on the spot but destructive of quiet work he began to feel the need of some settled countryhome of his own in england though for some years yet he took no practical steps to find one he was in paris again early in 1891 at the end of the same year he was called to dresden by the sudden death in hospital there of a gifted young american friend with whom he had latterly been much associatedwolcott balestier whose short but remarkable career as a writer and still more as a literary agent for other writers including henry james has been commemorated by mr gosse in his portraits and sketches from this distressing excursion henry james returned home to face another and greater sorrow which had begun to threaten him for some time past for two years his sister had been growing steadily weaker she had moved to london and lived near her brother in kensington but her seclusion was so rigid that only those who knew him well understood how great a part she played in his life her vigour of mind and imagination was as keen as ever and though the number of people she was able to see and know in england was very small she lived ardently in the interest highly critical for the most part that she took in public affairs her death in march 1892 meant for henry james not only the end of a companionship that was very dear to him but the breaking of the only family tie that he had had or was ever to have in england so long as his sister was near him there was one person who shared his old memories and with whom he was in his own home and when it is recalled how intensely he always clung to his distant kindred and what a sense of support he drew from them even in his long separation it is possible to measure the loss that befell him nowexactly at a time when such familiar and natural sympathy was most precious to him  he spent the summer of 1892 again in italy avoiding the touriststream by settling at siena after it had subsided in the company of m and mme paul bourget by this time his intimate friends william james and his family were now in europe for a year of switzerland and italy and henry joined them at lausanne on his way home the next two years of london were given up almost without intermission to the hopes and anxieties of his theatrical affairs in which he was now completely immersedso much so indeed as to test his very remarkable powers of physical endurance which seem in middle life to have thrown off the early troubles of his health when this time of fevered agitation was over he was able to compose himself at once to happier work without apparently feeling even the need of a days holiday in 1893 he was in paris in the spring and again for a short while in switzerland with his brother but these excursions were never real holidayshe was quickly uneasy if he had not work of some kind on hand he projected another summer in italy for the following year and spent it chiefly in venice and rome this was the last of italy however for some time there were too many friends everywherethe most disastrous attempt i have ever made he writes to come abroad for privacy and quiet still the only alternative seemed to be seaside lodgings in england and for the summer of 1895 escaping from the london season as usual he went to torquay by this time guy domville had failed and he was free again he had the happiest winter of work in london that he had known for five years after finishing some short stories he began the spoils of poynton and with it the series of his works that belong definitely to his later manner at last in 1896 instead of his usual esplanade he settled for a while upon an english countryside making an accidental choice that was to prove momentous he took a small house for the summer on the hill of playden in sussex where for the first time in his life and after twenty years of england he enjoyed a solitude of his own among trees and fields from his terrace where he sat under an ashtree working at his novel he looked across a wide valley to the beautiful old redroofed town of rye climbing the opposite hill and crowned with its churchtower the charm and tranquillity of the place were perfect and when he had to give up the house at playden he moved for the autumn into the old rye vicarage exploring the steep cobbled streets round the church he came upon a singularly delightful old house of the early eighteenth century with a large walled garden behind it which attracted him to the point of enquiring whether he might hope to possess it there appeared to be no prospect of this but he went back to london with a vivid sense that lamb house was exactly the place he needed if it should ever fall to him  he had already finished the spoils of poynton and had immediately set to work on what maisie knew deeply reconciled now to the indifference of the general public which indeed became more and more confirmed the only question by this time was whether london was any longer the right place for the determined concentration upon fiction that he decided was to fill the rest of his life the country would hardly have drawn him thither for its own sake there could not have been such a lack of it in his existence for more than fifty years if it had strongly appealed to him in itself but london had long ago given him all it could and his great desire now was for peace and quiet and freedom from interruption in 1897 after a summer of the usual kind at bournemouth and dunwich he suddenly learned that a tenant was being sought for lamb house and he signed the lease within a few days it was the most punctual and appropriate stroke of fortune that could have been devised     to robert louis stevenson   34 de vere gardens w april 29th 1889  this is really dreadful news my dear louis odious news to one who had neatly arranged that his coming august should be spent gobbling down your yarnsby some gardenwindow of skerryvoreas the neapolitan lazzarone puts away the lubricating filaments of the vermicelli and yet with my hideous capacity to understand it i am strong enough superior enough to say anything for conversation later its in the light of unlimited conversation that i see the future years and my honoured chair by the ingleside will require a succession of new cushions i miss you shockinglyfor my dear fellow there is no oneliterally no one and i dont in the least follow youi cant go with you i mean in conceptive faculty and the realising sense and you are for the time absolutely as if you were dead to mei mean to my imagination of coursenot to my affection or my prayers and so i shall keep humble that you may pump into meand make me stare and sigh and look simple and be quite out of itfor ever and ever its the best thing that can happen to one to see it written in your very hand that you have been so uplifted in health and cheer and if another year will screw you up so tight that you wont come undone again i will try and hold on through the barren months i will go to mrs sitwell to hear what has made you blushit must be something very radical your chieftains are dim to mewhy shouldnt they be when you yourself are va for another yearbut dont stay away longer for we should really for selfdefence have to outlive  you i myself do little but sit at home and write little talesand even long onesyou shall see them when you come back nothing would induce me by sending them to you to expose myself to damaging polynesian comparisons for the rest there is nothing in this land but the eternal irish strifethe place is all gashed and gory with it i cant tell you of iti am too sick of itmore than to say that two or three of the most interesting days i ever passed were lately in the crowded throbbing thrilling little court of the special commission over the astounding drama of the forged times letters  i have a hope a dream that your mother may be coming home and that one may go and drink deep of her narrations but its idle and improbable a wonderful beautiful letter from your wife to colvin seemed a few months ago to make it clear that she has no quarrel with your wild and wayward life i hope it agrees with her a little tooi mean that it renews her youth and strength it is a woeful time to waitfor your prose as for your personespecially as the prose cant be better though the person may  your very faithful henry james     to william james   hôtel de hollande paris nov 28th 89  my dear william  i send you this from paris where i have been for the last five weeks toward the end i relented in regard to the exhibition and came over in time for the last fortnight of it it was despoiled of its freshness and invaded by hordes of furious franks and fiery hunsbut it was a great impression and im glad i sacrificed to it so ive remained on i go back dec 1st it happens that i have been working very hard all this monthalmost harder than ever in my life beforehaving on top of other pressing and unfinished tasks undertaken for the bribe of large lucre to translate daudets new tartarin novel for the harpers i had a talk of one hour and a half with him the other dayabout our work  and his own queer deplorable condition which he intensely converts into art profession success copy etctaking perpetual notes about his constant suffering terrible in degree which are to make a book called la douleur the most detailed and pessimistic notation of pain qui fut jamais he is doing in the midst of this his new gay lovely tartarin for the harpers en premier lieu that is they are to publish it serially with wonderfully processed drawings before it comes out as a book in franceand i am to represent him in english a difficult but with ingenuity a pleasant and amusing task while this serial period lasts i have seen a good deal of bourget and as i have breakfasted with coppée and twice dined in company with meilhac sarcey albert wolff goncourt ganderax blowitz etc you will judge that i am pretty well saturated and ought to have the last word about ces gensci that last word hasnt a grain of subjection or of mystery left in it it is simply chinese chinese chinese they are finished besotted mandarins and their paris is their celestial empire with that such a paris as it sometimes seems nevertheless ive enjoyed it and though i am very tired too tired to write to you properly i shall have been much refreshed by my stay here and have taken aboard some light and heat for the black london winter i hope that above house and college and life and everything you still hold up an undemented head and are not in a seedy way  ever your affectionate henry     to robert louis stevenson       stevenson was now beginning to break to his friends at home the      possibility that he might settle permanently in the south seas but      he still projected a preliminary visit to england or at least to      europe   34 de vere gardens w march 21st 1890  my dear louis and my dear mrs louis  it comes over me with horror and shame that within the next very few months your return to england may become such a reality that i shall before long stand face to face with you branded with the almost bloodguilt of my long silence let me break that silence then before the bliss of meeting you again heaven speed the day is qualified in prospect by the apprehension of your disdain i despatch these incoherent words to sydney in the hope they may catch you before you embark for our palpitating england my despicable dumbness has been a vile accidenti neednt assure you that it doesnt pretend to the smallest backbone of system or sense i have simply had the busiest year of my life and have been so drained of the fluid of expressionso tapped into the public pitcherthat my whole correspondence has dried up and died of thirst then somehow you had become inaccessible to the mind as well as to the body and i had the feeling that in the midst of such desperate larks any news of mine would be mere irrelevant drivel to you now however you must take it such as it is it wont of course be news to you at all that the idea of your return has become altogether the question of the day the other two questions the eternal irish and rudyard kipling arent in it well tell you all about rudyard kiplingyour nascent rival he has killed one immortalrider haggard the star of the hour aged 24 and author of remarkable angloindian and extraordinarily observed barrack lifetommy atkinstales what i am pledged to do at the present moment pledged to colvin is to plead with you passionately on the question of samoa and expatriation but somehow when it comes to the point i cant do itpartly because i cant really believe in anything so dreadful a long howl of horror has gone up from all your friends and partly because before any step so fatal is irretrievably taken we are to have a chance to see you and bind you with flowery chains when you tell me with your own melodious lips that youre committed ill see whats to be done but i wont take a single plank of the house or a single hour of the flight for granted colvin has given me instantly all your recent unspeakable newsi mean the voyage to samoa and everything preceding and your mother has kindly communicated to me her own wonderful documents therefore my silence has been filled with soundsound infinitely fearful sometimes but the joy of your health my dear louis has been to me as an imparted sensationmaking me far more glad than anything that i could originate with myself i shall never be as well as i am glad that you are well we are poor tame terrified products of the tailor and the parlourmaid but we have a fine sentiment or two all the same i thank god am in better form than when you first took ship i have lately finished the longest and most careful novel i have ever written it has gone 16 months in a periodical and the last in that form i shall ever doit will come out as a book in may also other things too flat to be bawled through an australasian tube but the intensest throb of my literary life as of that of many others has been the master of ballantraea pure hard crystal my boy a work of ineffable and exquisite art it makes us all as proud of you as you can possibly be of it lead him on blushing lead him back blooming by the hand dear mrs louis and we will talk over everything as we used to lang syne at skerryvore when we have talked over everything and when all your tales are told then you may paddle back to samoa but we shall call time my heartiest greeting to the young lloydgrizzled i fear before his day i have been very sorry to hear of your soninlaws bad case may all that tension be over now do receive this before you saildont sail till you get it but then bound straight across i send a volume of the rising star to goad you all hither with jealousy he has quite done for your neglected even though neglectful friend  henry james     to robert louis stevenson   34 de vere gardens w april 28th 90  my dear louis  i didnt for two reasons answer your delightful letter or rather exquisite note from the sydney club but i must thank you for it now before the gulfs have washed you down or at least have washed away from you all aftertastes of brineless thingsthe stayathome works of lubberly friends one of the reasons just mentioned was that i had written to you at sydney co the mystic towns only a few days before your note arrived the other is that until a few days ago i hugged the soft illusion that by the time anything else would reach you you would already have started for england this fondest of hopes of all of us has been shattered in a manner to which history furnishes a parallel only in the behaviour of its most famous coquettes and courtesans you are indeed the male cleopatra or buccaneering pompadour of the deepthe wandering wanton of the pacific you swim into our ken with every provocation and prospectand we have only time to open our arms to receive you when your immortal back is turned to us in the act of still more provoking flight the moral is that we have to be virtuous whether we like it or no seriously it was a real heartbreak to have september substituted for june but i have a general faith in the fascinated providence who watches over you to the neglect of all other human affairsi believe that even he has an idea that you know what you are about and even what he is though he by this time doesnt in the least know himself moreover i have selfish grounds of resignation in the fact that i shall be in england in september whereas to my almost intolerable torment i should probably not have been in june therefore when you come if you ever do which in my heart of hearts i doubt i shall see you in all your strange exotic bloom in all your paint and beads and feathers may you grow a magnificent extra crop of all such things as they will bring you a fortune here in this much grudged extra summer charming and delightful to me to see you with a palate for my plain domestic pudding after all the wild cannibal smacks that you have learned to know i think the better of the poor little study in the painfullyfamiliar since hearing that it could bear such voyages and resist such tests you have fed a presumption that vaguely stirs within methat of trying to get at you in june or july with a fearfully longwinded but very highlyfinished novel which i am putting forth in probably the last days of may if i were sure it would overtake you on some coral strand i shouldnt hesitate for seriously and selfishly speaking i cant spiritually afford not to put the book under the eye of the sole and single anglosaxon capable of perceivingthough he may care for little else in ithow well it is written so i shall probably cast it upon the waters and pray for it as i suppose you are coming back to sydney it may meet you there and you can read it on the voyage home in that box youll have to i dont say it to bribe you in advance to unnatural tolerancebut i have an impression that i didnt make copious or clear to you in my last what a grand literary life your master of b has been leading here somehow a miracle has been wrought for you for you they are and the fine old featherbed of english taste has thrilled with preternatural recognitions the most unlikely number of people have discerned that the master is well written it has had the highest success of honour that the englishreading public can now confer where it has failed the success save that it hasnt failed at all it has done so through the constitutional incapacity of the umpireinfected by vulgar intercourses as with some unnameable disease we have lost our statusnous navons plus qualitéto confer degrees nevertheless last year you woke us up at night for an hourand we scrambled down in our shirt and climbed a gardenwall and stole a laurel which we have been brandishing ever since over your absent head i tell you this because i think colvin at least it was probably hehe is visibly betteror else mrs sitwell mentioned to me the other day that you had asked in touching virginal ignorance for news of the fate of the book its fate my dear fellow has been glittering glorysimply and i weenthat is i hopeyou will find the glitter has chinked as well i sent you a new zola the other dayat a venture but i have no confidence that i gratified a curiosity i havent read the human beastone knows him without thatand i am told zolas account of him is dull and imperfect i would read anything new about himbut this is old old old i hope your pen this summer will cleave the deeps of art even as your prow or your keel or whatevers the knowing name for it furrows the pacific flood into what strange and wondrous dyes you must be now qualified to dip it roast yourself i beseech you on the sharp spit of perfection that you may give out your aromas and essences tell your wife please to read between the lines of this and between the words and the letters all that i miss the occasion to write directly to her i hope she has continued to distil to your mother the honey of those impressions of which a few months ago the latter lent me for a day or two a tasteon its long yellow foolscap combs they would make they will make of course a deliciously sweet book i hope lloyd whom i greet and bless is living up to the height of his young privilegeand secreting honey too according to the mild discipline of the hive there are lots of things more to tell you no doubt but if i go on they will all take the shape of questions and that wont be fair the supreme thing to say is dont oh dont simply ruin our nerves and our tempers for the rest of life by not throwing the rope in september to him who will for once in his life not muff his catch  hj     to william james       the project guardedly referred to in this letter was that of      writing a series of plays he had already finished the      dramatisation of the american   hôtel de la ville milan may 16th 1890  my dear william  i have been both very busy and very bent on getting away this year without fail for a miracle from the oppressive london season i have just accomplished it i passed the st gotthard day before yesterday and i hope to find it possible to remain absent till august 1st after that i am ready to pay cheerfully and cheaply for my journey by staying quietly in town for august and september in the conditions in which you saw me last year i shall take as much as possible of a holiday for i have been working carefully consecutively and unbrokenly for a very long time pastturning out one thing always highly finished after another however i like to work thank heaven and at the end of a months privation of it i sink into gloom and discomfortso that i shall probably not wholly neglect my pen i hope you will have received promptly a copy of the tragic muse though i am afraid i sent my list to the publishers a little late i dont in the least know however when the book is supposed to come out i have no opinion or feeling about it nowthough i took long and patient and careful trouble which no creature will recognise with it at the time too much no doubt for my mind is now a muddled wearied blank on the subject i have shed and ejected itits void and deadand my feeling as to what may become of it is reduced to the sordid hope it will make a little moneywhich it wont the matter you expressed a friendly hope about the success of and which for all sorts of reasons i desire to be extremely secret silent and mysterious abouti mean the enterprise i covertly mentioned to you as conceived by me with a religious and deliberate view of gain over a greater scale than the book my books at least can ever approach bringing in to me this matter is on a good and promising footing but it is too soon to say anything about it save that i am embarked in it seriously and with rather remarkably good omens by which i mean that it is not to depend on a single attempt but on half a dozen of the most resolute and scientific character which i find i am abundantly capable of making but which alas in the light of this discovery i become conscious that i ought to have made ten years ago i was then discouraged all round while a single word of encouragement would have made the difference now it is late but on the other hand the thing would have been then only an experiment more or less like anotherwhereas now its an absolute necessity imposing itself without choice if i wish a loaf on the shelf for my old age fortunately as far as its gone it announces itself wellbut i cant tell you yet how far that is the only thing is to do a great lot  by the time this reaches you i suppose your wife and children will have gone to recline under the greenwood tree i hope their gentle outlawry will be full of comfort for them its poor work to me writing about them without ever seeing them but my interest in them is deep and large and please never omit to give my great love to them to alice first in the lump to be broken up and distributed by her may you squeeze with a whole skin through the tight weeks of the last of the termmay you live to rest and may you rest to live i shall not i think soon again write to you so rarely as for the last year this will be partly because the tragic muse is to be my last long novel for the rest of my life i hope to do lots of short things with irresponsible spaces between i see even a great future ten years of such but they wont make money excuse you probably rather will esteem the sordid tone of your affectionate  henry james     to w d howells   hôtel de la ville milan may 17th 1890  my dear howells  i have been not writing to you at a tremendous an infamous rate for a long time past but i should indeed be sunk in baseness if i were to keep this pace after what has just happened for what has just happened is that i have been reading the hazard of new fortunes i confess i should have liked to change the name for you and that it has filled me with communicable rapture i remember that the last time i came to italy or almost i brought your lemuel barker which had just come out to read in the train and let it divert an intense professional eye from the most clamourous beauties of the waywriting to you afternoons from this very place i think all the good and all the wonder i thought of it so i have a decent precedent for insisting to you now under circumstances exactly similar save that the present book is a much bigger feat that to my charmed and gratified sense the hazard is simply prodigious i should think it would make you as happy as poor happiness will let us be to turn off from one year to the other and from a reservoir in daily domestic use such a free full rich flood in fact your reservoir deluges me altogether with surprise as well as other sorts of effusion by which i mean that though you do much to empty it you keep it remarkably full i seem to myself in comparison to fill mine with a teaspoon and obtain but a trickle however i dont mean to compare myself with you or to compare you in the particular case with anything but life when i do thatwith the life you see and representyour faculty for representing it seems to me extraordinary and to shave the truththe general truth you aim atseveral degrees closer than anyone else begins to do you are less big than zola but you are ever so much less clumsy and more really various and moreover you and he dont see the same thingsyou have a wholly different consciousnessyou see a totally different side of a different race man isnt at all one after allit takes so much of him to be american to be french c i wont even compare you with something i have a sort of dim stupid sense you might be and are notfor i dont in the least know that you might be it after all or whether if you were you wouldnt cease to be that something you are which makes me write to you thus we dont know what people might give us that they dontthe only thing is to take them on what they do and to allow them absolutely and utterly their conditions this alone for the tastes secures freedom of enjoyment i apply the rule to you and it represents a perfect triumph of appreciation because it makes me accept largely all your material from youan absolute gain when i consider that i should never take it from myself i note certain things which make me wonder at your form and your fortune egas i have told you beforethe fatal colour in which they let you because you live at homeis itpaint american life and the fact that theres a whole quarter of the heaven upon which in the matter of composition you seem consciouslyis it consciouslyto have turned your back but these things have no relevancy whatever as grounds of dislikesimply because you communicate so completely what you undertake to communicate the novelist is a particular window absolutelyand of worth in so far as he is one and its because you open so well and are hung so close over the street that i could hang out of it all day long your very value is that you choose your own streetheaven forbid i should have to choose it for you if i should say i mortally dislike the people who pass in it i should seem to be taking on myself that intolerable responsibility of selection which it is exactly such a luxury to be relieved of indeed im convinced that no readers above the rank of an idiotthis number is moderate i admitreally fail to take any view that is really shown themany gift of subject thats really given the usual imbecility of the novel is that the showing and giving simply dont come offthe reader never touches the subject and the subject never touches the reader the window is no window at allbut only childish finta like the ornaments of our beloved italy this is why as a triumph of communication i hold the hazard so rare and strong you communicate in touches so close so fine so true so droll so frequent i am writing too much you will think me demented with chatter so that i cant go into specifications of success  i continue to scribble though with relaxed continuity while abroad but i cant talk to you about it one thing only is clear that henceforth i must do or half do england in fictionas the place i see most today and in a sort of way know best i have at last more acquired notions of it on the whole than of any other world and it will serve as well as any other it has been growing distincter that america fades from me and as she never trusted me at best i can trust her for effect no longer besides i cant be doing de chic from here when you on the spot are doing so brilliantly the vécu     to miss alice james       the play which h j had given his sister to read was the dramatic      version of the american it had now been accepted for production      by edward compton who was to play the part of christopher newman      some intentional and humorous exaggeration it ought perhaps to be      mentioned enters into h js constant appeal for discreet silence      in these matters as for the projected excursion with mr and mrs      curtis he eventually went with them the whole way and saw the      passion play at oberammergau   palazzo barbaro venice june 6th 1890  dearest sister  i am ravished by your letter after reading the play keep it locked up safe and secret though there are three or four copies in existence which makes me feel as if there had been a triumphant première and i had received overtures from every managerial quarter and had only to count my gold at any rate i am delighted that you have been struck with it exactly as i have tried to strike and that the pure practical character of the effort has worked its calculated spell upon you for what encourages me in the whole business is that as the piece stands there is not in its felicitous form the ghost of a fluke or a mere chance it is all art and an absolute address of means to the endthe end viz of meeting exactly the immediate actual intense british conditions both subjective and objective and of acting in to a minute including entractes 2 hours and 34 ergo i can do a dozen more infinitely better and i am excited to think how much since the writing of this one piece has been an education to me a little further experience will do for me also i am sustained by the sense on the whole that though really superior acting would help it immensely yet mediocrity of handling which is all at the best i am pretty sure that it will get wont and cant kill it and that there may be even something sufficiently general and human about it to make it given its eminent actability keep the stage even after any first vogue it may have had has passed away that fatein the povertystricken condition of the english repertorywould mean profit indeed and an income to my descendants but one mustnt talk of this kind of thing yet however since you have been already so deeply initiated i think i will enclose keep it sacredly for me an admirable letter i have just received from the precious balestier in whose hands as i wrote you i placed the settlement of the moneyquestion the terms of the writing agreement with compton compton saw him on monday lastand i send the letter mainly to illustrate the capital intelligence and competence of balestier and show you in what good hands i am he will probably strike you as he strikes me as the perfection of an agentespecially when you consider that he has undertaken this particular job out of pure friendship everything evidently will be well settledon the basis of course which cant be helped of production in london only about the middle of next year but by that time i hope to have done a good bit more workand i shall be beguiled by beginning to follow in the autumn the rehearsals for the country production keep balestiers letter till i come backi shall get another one from him in a day or two with the agreement to sign these castles in spain are at least exhilarating in a certain sense i should like you very much to communicate to william your good impression of the dramabut on the whole i think you had better not for the simple reason that it is very important it shouldnt be talked about especially so long in advanceand it wouldnt be safe inasmuch as every whisper gets into the papersand in some fearfully vulgarized and perverted form you might hint to william that you have read the piece under seal of secresy to me and think soandso of itbut are so bound to me not to give a sign that he must bury what you tell him in tenfold mystery but i doubt if even this would be secureit would be in the transcript the next week  venice continues adorable and the curtises the soul of benevolence their upstairs apartment empty and still unofferedat forty pounds a yearto any one but me beckons me so as a footonthewater here that if my dramatic ship had begun to come in i should probably be tempted to take it at a venturefor all it would matter but for the present i resist perfectlyespecially as venice isnt all advantageous the great charm of such an idea is the having in italy a little cheap and private refuge independent of hotels etc which every year grow more disagreeable and german and tiresome to facenot to say dearer too but it wont be for this yearand the curtises wont let it what pen browning has done here  with the splendid palazzo rezzonico transcends description for the beauty and as ruskin would say wisdom and rightness of it it is altogether royal and imperialbut pen isnt kingly and the train de vie remains to be seen gondoliers ushering in friends from pensions wont fill it out i am thinking after all of joining the curtises in the evidently most beautiful drive of upwards of a week with rests they are starting upon on the 14th from a place called vittorio in the venetian alps two hours rail from here through cadore titians country the dolomites etc toward oberammergau they offer me pressingly the fourth seat in the carriage that awaits them when they leave the trainand also an extra ticket they have taken for the play at oberammergau if i choose to go so far this i shall scarcely do but i shall probably leave with them drive 4 or 5 days and come back via verona by railleaving my luggage here continue to address hereunless before that i give you one other address while i am gone i shall find all letters here on my return if i do go in the keeping of the excellent maestro di casathe venetian smith i should be back at the latest by the 25thprobably by the 20th in this case i shall presumably go back to florence to spend 4 or 5 days with baldwin going to siena or perugia after which i have a dream of going to vallombrosa nearly 4000 feet above the seabut of a softness for 2 or 3 weekstill i have to leave italy on my way home i am writing to edith peruzzi who has got a summerlodge there and is already there for information about the inn if i dont go there i shall perhaps try camaldoli or san marcelloall high in the violet apennines within 3 or 4 hours and mainly by a little carriage of florence but i want to compass vallombrosa which i have never seen and have always dreamed of and which i am assured is divineinfinitely salubrious and softly cool the idea of lingering in italy a few weeks longer on these terms is very delightful to meit does me as yet nothing but good but i shall see i put bs letter in another envelope i rejoiced in your eight gallops they may be the dozen now  ever your henry     to william james   paradisino vallombrosa tuscany july 23rd 1890  my dear brother  i had from you some ten days ago a most delightful letter written just after the heroic perusal of my interminable novelwhich according to your request i sent off almost too precipitately to alice so that i havent it here to refer to but i dont need to refer to it inasmuch as it has plunged me into a glow of satisfaction which is far as yet from having faded i can only thank you tenderly for seeing so much good in the clumsy thingas i thanked your alice who wrote me a most lovely letter a week or two ago i have no illusions of any kind about the book and least of all about its circulation and popularity from these things i am quite divorced and never was happier than since the dissolution has been consecrated by what seems to me the highest authorities one must go ones way and know what ones about and have a general plan and a private religionin short have made up ones mind as to ce qui en est with a public the draggling after which simply leads one in the gutter one has always a public enough if one has an audible vibrationeven if it should only come from ones self i shall never make my fortunenor anything like it buti know what i shall do and it wont be badi am lingering on late in italy as you see so as to keep away from london till august 1st or thereabouts i stay in this exquisite spot till that date i shall then returning to my normal occupations have had the best and clearest and pleasantest holiday of three months that i have had for many a day i have been accompanied on this occasion by a literary irresponsibility which has caused me to enjoy italy perhaps more than ever beforelet alone that i have never before been perched more than three thousand feet in the air in so perfect a paradise as this unspeakable vallombrosa it is miltons vallombrosa the original of his famous line the site of the old mountain monastery which he visited and which stands still a few hundred feet below me as i write suppressed and appropriated some time ago by the italian government who have converted it to the state school of forestry this little innthe paradisino as it is called on a pedestal of rock overhanging the violet abysses like the prow of a ship is the hermitage a very comfortable one of the old convent the place is extraordinarily beautiful and sympathetic the most romantic mountains and most admirable woodschestnut and beech and magnificent pineforests the densest coolest shade the freshest sweetest air and the most enchanting views it is full 20 years since i have done anything like so much wandering through dusky woods and lying with a book on warm breezy hillsides it has given me a sense of summer which i had lost in so many london julys given me almost the summer of ones childhood back again i shall certainly come back here for other julys and other augustsand i hate to go away now may you and all of you these weeks have as sweet or half as sweet an impression of the natural universe as yours affectionately  henry james     to edmund gosse       the ordeal was the first night of the american produced by      edward compton and his company at southport in anticipation of its      eventual appearance in london   prince of wales hotel southport  jan 3rd 1891  my dear gosse  i am touched by your petit mot de gros mots seem to me to be so much more applicable to my fallen state the only thing that can be said for it is that it is not so low as it may perhaps be tomorrowafter the vulgar ordeal of tonight let me therefore profit by the few remaining hours of a recognizable status to pretend to an affectionate reciprocity i am yours and your wifes while yet i may be after 11 oclock tonight i may be the worldsyou knowand i may be the undertakers i count upon you both to spend this evening in fasting silence and supplication i will send you a word in the morningwire you if i canif there is anything at all to boast of my hopes rest solely on intrinsic charmsthe adventitious graces of art are not in it i am so nervous that i miswrite and misspell pity your infatuated but not presumptuous friend  henry james  ps it would have been delightfuland terribleif you had been able to come i believe archer is to come  pps i dont return straight to londondont get there till tuesday or wednesday i shall have to wait and telegraph you which evening i can come in     to mrs hugh bell   34 de vere gardens w jan 8th 1891  dear mrs bell  your most kind gratulatory note deserved an answer more gratefully prompt than this but i extended my absence from town to a short visit at cheltenham and the whole thing was virtually till yesterday a complete extinction of leisure delightful of you to want details i think if i were to inflict them on you they would all be illustrative of the cheering and rewarding side of our feverish profession the passage from knockkneed nervousness the night of the première as one clings in the wing to the curtain rod as to the pied des autels to a simmering serenity is especially lifesaving in its effect i flung myself upon compton after the 1st act in heavens name is it going goingrather you could hear a pin drop then after that one felt itone heard itone blessed itand at the end of all one after a decent and discreet delay simpered and gave oneself up to courbettes before the curtain while the applausive house emitted agreeable sounds from a kind of gasflaring indistinguishable dimness and the gratified compton publicly pressed ones hand and one felt that really as far as southport could testify to the circumstance the stake was won of course its only southportbut i have larger hopes inasmuch as it was just the meagre provincial conditions and the limited provincial interpretation that deprived the performance of all adventitious aid and when my hero and heroine and another friend supped with me at the inn after the battle i felt that they were really as radiant as if we were carousing among the slain they seem indeed wondrous content the great feature of the evening was the way compton came out beyond what he had done or promised at rehearsal and acted really most interestingly and admirablyif not a revelation at any rate a very jolly surprise his part is one in which i surmise he really counts upon making a large successand though i say it who shouldnt it is one of incontestable opportunities however all this is to comeand we stumble in judgment amen voilà ma chère amie you have been through all this and more and will tolerate my ingenuities  all merriment to your full house  yours most truly henry james     to robert louis stevenson   34 de vere gardens w january 12th 1891  my dear louis  i have owed you a letter too shamefully longand now that i have taken my pen in hand as we used to say i feel how much i burn to communicate with you as your magnanimity will probably have forgotten how long ago it was that you addressed me from sydney the tragic statement of your permanent secession i wont remind you of so detested a date that statement indeed smote me to the silence i have so long preserved i couldnti didnt protest i even mechanically and grimly assented but i couldnt talk about iteven to you and your wife missing you is always a perpetual acheand aches are disqualifying for gymnastic feats in short we forgive you the muses and the soft passions forgive us but we cant quite treat you as if we did however all this while i have many things to thank you for in the first place for lloyd he was delightful we loved himnous nous larrachâmes he is a most sympathetic youth and we revelled in his rich conversation and exclaimed on his courtly manners how vulgar youll think us all when you come back there is malice in that when then for the beautiful strange things you sent me and which make for ever in my skyparlour a sort of dim rumble as of the pacific surf my heart beats over themmy imagination throbsmy eyes fill i have covered a blank wall of my bedroom with an acre of painted cloth and feel as if i lived in a samoan tentand i have placed the sad sepiadrawing just where 50 times a day it most transports and reminds me today what i am grateful for is your new balladbook which has just reached me by your command i have had time only to read the first few thingsbut i shall absorb the rest and give you my impression of them before i close this as i turn the pages i seem to see that they are full of charm and of your protean imaginative lifebut above all of your terrible faroffness my state of mind about that is of the strangesta sort of delight at having you poised there in the inconceivable and a miserable feeling at the same time that i am in too wretched a back seat to assist properly at the performance i dont want to lose any of your vibrations and as it is i feel that i only catch a few of themand that is a constant woe i read with unrestrictive relish the first chapters of your prose volume kindly vouchsafed me in the little copyrightcatching red volume and i loved em and blessed them quite but i did make one restrictioni missed the visible in themi mean as regards people things objects faces bodies costumes features gestures manners the introductory the personal paintertouch it struck me that you either didnt feelthrough some accidentyour responsibility on this article quite enough or on some theory of your own had declined it no theory is kind to us that cheats us of seeing however no doubt we shall rub our eyes for satiety before we have done of course the pictureslloyds blessed photographsy sont pour beaucoup but i wanted more the note of portraiture doubtless i am greedybut one is when one dines at the maison dor i have an idea you take but a qualified interest in beau austinor i should tell you how religiously i was present at that memorable première lloyd and your wonderful and delightful mother will have given you the agreeable facts of the occasion i found itnot the occasion so much but the workfull of quality and stamped with a charm but on the other hand seeming to shrug its shoulders a little too much at scenic precautions i have an idea however you dont care about the matter and i wont bore you with it further than to say that the piece has been repeatedly played that it has been the only honourable affair transacted dans notre sale tripot for many a dayand that wm archer en raffole periodically in the world dont despise me too much if i confess that anch io son pittore je fais aussi du théâtre moi and am doing it to begin with for reasons too numerous to burden you with but all excellent and practical in the provinces i had the other night at southport lancashire with the dramatization of an early novelthe americana success dont je rougis encore this thing is to be played in london only after several monthsand to make the tour of the british islands first dont be hard on mesimplifying and chastening necessity has laid its brutal hand on me and i have had to try to make somehow or other the money i dont make by literature my books dont sell and it looks as if my plays might therefore i am going with a brazen front to write half a dozen i have in fact already written two others than the one just performed and the success of the latter pronouncedreally pronouncedwill probably precipitate them i am glad for all this that you are not here literature is out of it i miss no occasion of talking of you colvin i tolerably often see i expect to do so for instance tonight at a decidedly too starched diningclub to which we both belong of which lord coleridge is president and too many persons of the type of sir theodore martin are members happy islanderswith no sir theodore martin on mrs sitwell i called the other day in a charming new habitat all clean paint and fresh chintz we always go on at a great rate about youcelebrate rites as faithful as the early christians in the catacombs  january 13thi met colvin last night after writing the abovein the company of sir james stephen sir theo martin sir douglas galton sir james paget sir alfred lyall canon ainger and george du maurier how this will make you lick your chops over ori and rahiro and tamatia and taheiaor whatever ces messieurs et ces dames your present visiting list are called he told me of a copious diaryletter he has just got from you bless you and we are discussing a day on which i shall soon come to meat or drink with him and listen to the same since yesterday i have also read the ballad bookwith the admiration that i always feel as a helplessly verseless creature its a sentiment worth nothing as a testimony for all performances in rhyme and metreespecially on the part of producers of fine prose  january 19thi stopped this more than a week ago and since then i have lacked time to go on with ithaving been out of town for several days on a base theatrical errandto see my tribute to the vulgarest of the muses a little further on its way over the provincial circuit and rerehearse two or three portions of it that want more effective playing thank heaven i shall have now no more direct contact with it till it is produced in london next octoberi broke off in the act of speaking to you about your balladbook the production of ringing and lilting verse by a superior proser always does bribe me a littleand i envy you in that degree yours but apart from this i grudge your writing the like of these ballads they show your cleverness but they dont show your genius i should say more if it were not odious to a man of my refinement to write to youso expectantly far awayin remonstrance i dont find either that the cannibalism the savagery se prête as it wereone wants either less of it on the ground of suggestionor more on the ground of statement and one wants more of the high impeccable as distinguished from the awfully jolly on the ground of poetry behold i am launching across the black seas a page that may turn nastybut my dear louis its only because i love so your divine prose and want the comfort of it things are various because we do em we mustnt do em because theyre various the only news in literature heresuch is the virtuous vacancy of our consciousnesscontinues to be the infant monster of a kipling i enclose in this for your entertainment a few pages i have lately written about him to serve as the preface to an of course authorized american recueil of some of his tales i may add that he has just put forth his longest story yeta thing in lippincott which i also send you herewithwhich cuts the ground somewhat from under my feet inasmuch as i find it the most youthfully infirm of his productions in spite of great life much wanting in composition and in narrative and explicative or even implicative art  please tell your wife with my love that all this is constantly addressed to her also i try to see you all in what i fear is your absence of habits as you live grouped around what i also fear is in no sense the domestic hearth where do you go when you want to be cosyor what at least do you do you think a little i hope of the faithful forsaken on whose powers of evocation as well as of attachment you impose such a strain i wish i could send a man from fortnum and masons out to you with a chunk of mortadella i am trying to do a series of short things and will send you the least bad i mean to write to lloyd please congratulate your heroic mother for me very cordially when she leaps upon your strand and believe that i hold you all in the tenderest remembrance of yours ever my dear louis  henry james     to william james   34 de vere gardens w feb 6th 1891  my dear william  bear with me that i havent written to you since my last in which i promised you a better immediate sequel till the receipt of your note of the 21st this am recalls me to decency bear with me indeed in this and other ways so long as i am in the fever of dramatic production with which i am very sanely and practically trying to make up for my late start and all the years during which i have not dramatically produced and further to get well ahead with the demand which iand others for mejudge still very sanely and sensibly to be certain to be made upon me from the moment i have a london as distinguished from a provincial success you can form no ideaoutsideof how a provincial success is confined to the provinces now that i have tasted blood cest une rage of determination to do and triumph on my part for i feel at last as if i had found my real form which i am capable of carrying far and for which the pale little art of fiction as i have practised it has been for me but a limited and restricted substitute the strange thing is that i always universally knew this was my more characteristic formbut was kept away from it by a halfmodest halfexaggerated sense of the difficulty that is i mean the practical odiousness of the conditions but now that i have accepted them and met them i see that one isnt at all needfully their victim but is from the moment one is anything ones self worth speaking of their master and may use them command them squeeze them lift them up and better them as for the form itself its honour and inspiration are à défaut dautres in its difficulty if it were easy to write a good play i couldnt and wouldnt think of it but it is in fact damnably hard to this truth the paucity of the articlein the englishspeaking worldtestifies and that constitutes a solid respectabilityguarantees ones intellectual selfrespect at any rate i am working hard and constantlyand am just attacking my 4th  no 4 has a destination which it would be premature to disclose and in general please breathe no word of these confidences as publicity blows on such matters in an injurious and deflowering way and interests too great to be hurt are at stake i make them the confidences because it isnt fair to myself not to let you know that i may be absorbed for some months to comeas long as my present fit of the rage laststo a degree which may be apparent in my correspondencei mean in its intermittence and in my apparent lapse of attention to or appreciation of other things for instance i blush to say that i havent had freedom of mind or cerebral freshness i find the drama much more obsédant than the novel to tacklemore than dipping in just here and thereyour mighty and magnificent book which requires a stretch of leisure and an absence of crisis in ones own egotistical little existence as this is essentially a year of crisis or of epochmaking for me i shall probably save up the great volumes till i can recline upon roses the fruits of my production fever and imbibe them like sips of sherbet giving meanwhile all my cerebration to the condensation of masterpieces  farewell dear william and bear with my sawdust and orangepeel phase till the returns begin to flow in the only hitch in the prospect is that it takes so long to realise the american in the country played only on friday nights with the very low country prices gives me nothing as yet to speak ofmy royalty making only about £500 for each performance later all this may be thoroughly counted upon to be different  ever your henry     to robert louis stevenson   34 de vere gardens w feb 18th 1891  my dear louis  your letter of december 29th is a most touching appeal i am glad my own last had been posted to you 2 or 3 weeks before it reached me whether mine hasor will have beenguided to your coral strand is a matter as to which your disclosures touching the state of the samoan post inspire me with the worst apprehensions at any rate i did despatch yousupposedly via san franciscoa really pretty long screed about a month ago i ought to write to you all the while but though i seem to myself to live with my pen in my hand i achieve nothing capable of connecting me so with glory i am going to paris tomorrow morning for a month but i have vowed that i will miss my train sooner than depart without scrawling you and your wife a few words tonight i shall probably see little or nothing there that will interest you much or even interest myself hugely but having neither a yacht an island an heroic nature a gallant wife mother and son nor a seastomach i have to seek adventure in the humblest forms in writing the other day i told you more or less what i was doingam doingin these elderly days and the same general description will serve i am doing what i can to launch myself in the dramatic directionand the strange part of the matter is that i am doing it more or less seriously as if we had the scène anglaise which we havent and i secretly dream of supplying the vile want pas mêmeand my zeal in the affair is only matched by my indifference what is serious in it is that having begun to work in this sense some months ago to give my little ones breadi find the form opens out before me as if there were a kingdom to conquera kingdom forsooth of ignorant brutes of managers and dense cabotins of actors all the same i feel as if i had at last found my formmy real onethat for which pale fiction is an ineffectual substitute god grant this unholy truth may not abide with me more than two or three yearstime to dig out eight or ten rounded masterpieces and make withal enough money to enable me to retire in peace and plenty for the unmolested business of a little supreme writing as distinguished from gougingwhich is the form abovementioned your loneliness and your foodlessness my dear louis bring tears to my eyes if there were only a parcels post to samoa i would set fortnum and mason to work at you at this end of the line but if they intercept the hieroglyphics at sydney what would they do to the sausage surely there is some cure for your emptiness if nothing else why not coming away dont eat up mrs louis whatever you do you are precious to literaturebut she is precious to the affections which are larger yet in a still worse way i shall certainly do my utmost to get to egypt to see you if as is hinted to me by dear colvin you turn up there after the fitful fever of samoa your being there would give me wingsespecially if plays should give me gold this is an exquisitely blissful dream dont fail to do your part of it i almost joy in your lack of the tragic muse as proving to me i mean that you are curious enough to have missed it nevertheless i have just posted to you registered the first copy i have received of the 1 vol edition but this moment out i wanted to send you the three volumes by lloyd but he seemed clear you would have received it and i didnt insist as i knew he was charged with innumerable parcels and bales i will presently send another muse and one at least must reach you colvin is really better i thinkif any one can be better who is so absolutely good i hope to god my last long letter will have reached you i promise to write soon again i enfold you all in my sympathy and am ever your faithfullest  henry james     to charles eliot norton   34 de vere gardens w aug 28th 1891  my dear charles  it is only the conspiracy of hindrances so perpetually characteristic of life in this place even when it is theoretically not alive as in the midaugust that has stayed my hand for days past when it has most longed to write to you dear lowells deaththe words are almost as difficult as they are odious to writehas made me think almost as much of you as of him i imagine that you are the person in the world to whom it makes the most complete and constant difference that he is no longer here just as you must have been the one most closely associated with the too vain watching of his last struggle with the monster it is a dim satisfaction to me therefore to say to you how fond i was of him and how i shall miss him and miss him and miss him during these last strange english years of his life it would take me long to tell you why i call them strange i had seen a great deal of him and all with the effect of confirming my affection for him london is bestrewn to my sense with reminders of his happy career here and his company and his talk he was kind and delightful and gratifying to me and all sorts of occasions in which he will ever be vivid swarm before me as i think of him strange was his double existencethe american and the english sides of his medal which had yet so much in common that is i dont know how english he was at home but he was conspicuously american here however i am not trying to characterize him to you least of all who had known him well so much longer and seen all or most of the chapters of his history but only letting you see how much i wish we might talk of him together some day we will though its a date that seems unfixable now i am taking for granted  that you inherit the greatest of literary responsibilities to his memory i think of this as a very high interest but also a very arduous labour its a blessing however to feel that such an office is in such hands as yours the posthumous vulgarities of our day add another grimness to death here again is another matter as to which i really miss not having the opportunity to talk with you this is a brief communication my dear charles for i am literally catching a train i go down to the isle of wight half an hour hence     to edmund gosse       this refers to the recent production of the american in london   34 de vere gardens w october 2nd 1891  my dear gosse  your good and charming letter should have been answered on the spotbut my days are abnormal and perspective and relation are blurred i shall come to see you the moment you return and then i shall be able to tell you more in five minutes than in fifteen of such hurried scrawls as this meanwhile many thanks for your sympathy and curiosity and suspenseall thanks indeedand in return all eagerness for your rentrée here my own suspense has been and still is greatthough the voices of the air rightly heard seem to whisper prosperity the papers have been on the whole quite awfulbut the audiences are altogether different the only thing is that these first three or four weeks must be uphill london is still empty the whole enterprise is wholly newthe elements must assemble the strain the anxiety the peculiar form and colour of such an ordeal not to be divined the least in advance have sickened me to deathbut i am getting better i forecast nothing howeveri only wait come back and wait with meit will be easier your picture of your existence and circumstance is like the flicker of the open door of heaven to those recumbent in the purgatory of yours not yet damnedah no  henry james     to mrs mahlon sands   hôtel de leurope dresden  dec 12th 1891  dear mrs sands  just a wordin answer to your note of sympathyto say that i am working through my dreary errand and service here as smoothly as three stricken womena mother and two sisterspermit they are however very temperate and discreetand one of the sisters a little person of extraordinary capacitywho will float them all successfully home wolcott balestier the young american friend beside whose grave i stood with but three or four others here on thursday was a very remarkable creature who had been living in london for some three yearshe had an intimate businessrelation with literature and was on the way to have a really artistic and creative one he had made himself a peculiar international placewhich it would take long to describe and was full of capacities possibilities and really big inventions and ideas he had rendered me admirable services become in a manner a part of my life and i was exceedingly attached to him and now at 30 he diesin a weekin a faraway german hospitalhis mother and sisters were in parisof a damnable vicious typhoid contracted in his london office the picturesqueness of which he loved as it was in deans yard westminster just under the abbey towers and in a corner like that of a peaceful cathedral close many things many enterprises interests visions originalities perish with him oh the ironies of fate the ugly tricks the hideous practical jokes of life i start for london some time next week and shall very soon come and see you i hope all is well with you  yours always henry james     to mrs humphry ward       the following was written a few days after the death of miss alice      james   34 de vere gardens w march 10th 1892  dear mrs ward  many many thanks for your friendly remembrance of methe flowers are full of spring and life and the universe as it were and besides this are very close and charming company to me as i sit scribblingwriting many notes among other thingsin still indoor days that are grateful to me you were one of the very few persons in england who had seen my sister even a littleand i am very glad of that she was a rare and remarkable being and her death makes a great difference in my existence but for her it is only blessed i hope you are happy in the good reasons you have for being soif one is happy strictly certainly one isnt the reverse for reasons  believe me yours

ditalie sent him by h j mr kipling did not as it      turned out pay his projected visit to samoa referred to in this      letter   34 de vere gardens w march 19th 1892  my dear louis  i send you today by bookpost registered a little volume of tales which i lately put forthmost of which however you may have seen in magazines please accept at any rate the modest offering accept too my thanks for your sweet and dateless letter which i received a month agothe one in which you speak with such charming appreciation and felicity of paul bourget i echo your admirationi think the italian book one of the most exquisite things of our time i am in only very occasional correspondence with himand have not written since i heard from you but i shall have an early chance now probably to repeat your words to him and they will touch him in a tender place he is living much now in italy and i may go there for may or junethough indeed i fear it is little probable colvin tells me of the volume of some of your inédites beauties that is on the point of appearing and the news is a bright spot in a vulgar world the vulgarity of literature in these islands at the present time is not to be said and i shall clutch at you as one turns ones ear to music in the clatter of the marketplace yet paradoxical as it may appear oh louis i have still had the refinement not to read the wrecker in the periodical page this is an enlightened and judicious heroism and i do as i would be done by trust me however to taste you in long draughts as soon as i can hold the book then will i write to you again you tell me nothing of yourselfso i have nothing to take up or take hold of save indeed the cherished superstition that you enjoy some measure of health and cheer you are however too far away for my imagination and were it not for dear colvins friendly magic which puts in a pin here and there i shouldnt be able to catch and arrest at all the opaline iridescence of your legend yet even when he speaks of intending wars and the clash of arms it all passes over me like an oldtime song you see how much i need you close at hand to stand successfully on the tiptoe of emulation you fatigue in short my credulity though not my affection we lately clubbed together all to despatch to you an eyewitness in the person of the genius or the genus in himself rudyard for the concussion of whose extraordinary personality with your own we are beginning soon to strain the listening ear we devoutly hope that this time he will really be washed upon your shore with him goes a new little wifewhose brotherwolcott balestier lately dead in much youthful promise and performance i dont allude in saying that especially to the literary part of it was a very valued young friend of mine the main thing that has lately happened to myself is the death of my dear sister a fortnight agoafter years of suffering which however had not made her any less rare and remarkable a person or diminished the effect of the event when it should occur in making an extreme difference in my life of my occupation what shall i tell you i have of late years left london less and lessbut i am thinking sooner or later in a near present of making a long foreign though not distant absence i am busy with the shorti have forsworn the long i hammer at the horrid little theatrical problem with delays and intermissions but horrible to relate no failure of purpose i shall soon publish another small storybook which i will incontinently send you i have done many brief fictions within the last year the good little thomas hardy has scored a great success with tess of the durbervilles which is chockfull of faults and falsity and yet has a singular beauty and charm  what we most talk of here however is the day when it may be believed that you will come to meet us on some attainable southern shore we will all go to the mediterranean for youlet that not nail you to samoa i send every greeting to your playfellowsyour fellowphantoms the wifephantom knows my sentiments the ghost of a mother has my heartiest regard the long lloydspectre laughs an eerie laugh doubtless at my word illegible embrace yet i feel my dear louis that i do hold you just long enough to press you to the heart of your very faithful old friend  henry james     to robert louis stevenson   34 de vere gardens w april 15th 1892  my dear louis  i send you by this post the magnificent mémoires de marbot which should have gone to you sooner by my hand if i had sooner read them and sooner thereby grasped the idea of how much they would probably beguile for you the shimmering tropical noon the three volumes go to you in three separate registered bookpost parcels and all my prayers for an escape from the queer perils of the way attend and hover about them some people i believe consider this fascinating warrior a bienconditionné munchausenbut perish the injurious thought me he not only charms but convinces i cant manage a letter my dear louis todayi wrote you a longish one via san francisco like this just about a month ago but i mustnt fail to tell you that i have just read the last page of the sweet collection of some of your happiest lucubrations put forth by the care of dear colvin they make a most desirable and moreover a very honourable volume it was indispensable to bring them together and they altogether justify it the first one and the lanternbearers and two last are of course the bestthese last are all made up of high and admirable pages and do you the greatest credit you have never felt thought said more finely and happily than in many a passage here and are in them altogether at your best i dont see reviews or meet newspapers now beside which the work is scarcely in the market so i dont know what fortune the book encountersbut it is enough for mei admit it can hardly be enough for youthat i love it i pant for the completion of the wreckerof which colvin unwove the other night to my rapturous ear the weird and wondrous tangle i hope i dont give him away if i tell you he even read me a very interesting letter from youthough studded with critical stardust in which i a little lost my waytelling of a project of a dashing roman de mœurs all about a wicked woman for this you may imagine how i yearnthough not to the point of wanting it before the sequel of kidnapped for gods sake let me have them both i marvel at the liberality of your production and rejoice in this high meridian of your genius i leave london presently for 3 or 4 monthsi wish it were with everything required for leaping on your strand sometimes i think i have got through the worst of missing you and then i find i havent i pine for you as i pen these words for i am more and more companionless in my old agemore and more shut up to the solitude inevitably the portion in these islands of him who would really try even in so small a way as mine to do it im often on the point of taking the train down to skerryvore to serenade your ghosts get them to throw a fellow a word consider this at any rate a plaintive invocation again again i greet your wife that lady of the closed lips and i am yours my dear louis and lloyds and your mothers undiscourageably  henry james     to the countess of jersey       the little story is the lesson of the master the opening      scenes of which take place at summersoft lord jersey was at this      time governor of new south wales   hôtel de sienne siena june 11th 1892  dear lady jersey  your kind letter finds me in a foreign landthe land in the world i suppose least like new south walesand gives me very great pleasure it is charming to hear your voice so distinctly round so many corners of the globe yes summersoft did venture in a timorous and hesitating manner to be an affectionate and yet respectful reminiscence of osterley the exquisiteof whose folded and deserted charms i cant bear to think but i beg you to believeas indeed you will have perceived if you were so good as to look at the little storythat the attempted resemblance was only a matter of the dear old cubic sofacushions and objects of the same delightful order and not of the human furniture of the house i take the liberty of being in your absence so homesick for osterley that i can scarcely conceive of the pangs by which you and your children and lord jerseywith your much greater right to indulge in themmust sometimes be visited i am delighted however to gather from your letter that you have occupations and interests which drop a kindly veil over that dreamland it must indeed i can imagine be a satisfaction to be really lending a hand in such a great young growing worlddoing something in it and with it and for it may the sense of all this make the years roll smoothlytill they roll you back into our ken please give my very friendliest remembrance to lord jerseyto whom i wishas to all of youand indeed to myself that you may serve your term with an appearance of rapidity and please believe dear lady jersey that when it is over no one will more heartily rejoice than yours most faithfully  henry james     to charles eliot norton   hôtel de sienne siena july 4th 1892  my dear charles  too long have i owed you a letter and too many times have your generosities made me blush for my silence i have received beautiful books from you and they have given me almost more pleasure as signs of your remembrance than as symbols of your wisdom and worth the purgatorio reached me just before i came abroador a short timeand i was delighted to know that you continue to find time and strength for labours so various and so arduous great glory is yoursfor making something else come out of america than railwaysmashes and young ladies for lords during a singularly charming month that i have been spending in this most loveable old city i have often thought of you and wished i had a small fraction of your power to put the soul of history into italian things but i believe i shouldnt love siena any better even if i knew it better i am very happy indeed to feel thatas i grow oldermany things come and go but italy remains i have been here many timesregularly every year or almost for many years now but the spell the charm the magic is still in the air i always try between may and august to give london a wide berth and i find these parts far and away most pleasant when the summer has begun and the barbarians have fled as one stays and stays on herei mean on this spotone feels how untouched siena really is by the modern hand yesterday was the palio of the ten contrade and though i believe it is not so intense a festival as the second oneof aug 15th you have probablyor certainlyseen them bothit was a most curious and characteristic of an uninterrupted tradition spectacle the marchese chigi asked me and a couple of friendsor rather asked them and me with themto see it from the balcony of his extraordinarily fine old palace where by the way he has a large collection of etruscan and tarentine treasuresa collection to break the heart of envy my friends were paul bourget the french essayist and novelist some of whose work you probably know and his very remarkably charming cultivated and interesting young wife they have been living in italy these two yearsever since their marriage and i have been living much with them here bourget is a very interesting mindand figure altogetherand the firsteasily to my senseof all the talkers i have ever encountered but it would take me much too far to begin to give you a portrait of such a complicated cosmopolitan frenchman as he but they departed alas this morning for the piedmontese alps and i take my way in a couple of hours to venice where i spend but a few dayswith perhaps a few more at asolobefore joining my brother william and his wife for a month in switzerland after that i expect to return to london for the last of the summer and the early autumnthe season i prefer there above all others but before i do this i wish i could talk to you more about this sweet old siena i have been talking for a month about it with bourgetbut how much better it would have been for both of us if you could have broken in and taken up the tale but you did sometimes very happilyfor mme paul knows you by heart she is the madonna of cosmopolitan culture and cites you with great effect have you read p bs sensations ditalie if you havent doit is one of the most exquisite of books have you read any of his novels if you havent dont though they have remarkable parts make an exception however for terre promise which is to appear a few months hence and which i have been reading in proof hereif on trial indeed you find you can stand so suffocating an analysis it is perhaps psychology gone madbut it is an extraordinary production a fortnight ago on a singularly lovely sunday we drove to san gimignano and back i had never been there before and the whole day was a delight there are of course four americans living at san gone of whom proved afterwards to have been an american ladynewspapercorrespondent furious at having missed two such birds as bourget and mewhom a single stone from that rugged old quarry would have brought down but she didnt know us until we had departed and we fortunately didnt suspect her till a suppliant card reached us two days later at siena we were in the hands of the good old canonicothe proposito as they call himand he put us gently through you remember well enough of coursethough to such a faraway world your siena summer must seem to belongthe rich loveliness at this moment of this exquisite old tuscany one cant say enough about it and the way the great sea of growing thingsthe corn and the vines and the olivesbreaks in green surges at the very foot of the old goldenbrown ramparts is one of the most enchanting features of siena there is still never a suburb to speak of save in the quarter of the railwaystation and everywhere you look out of backwindows and backdoors and off terraces and over parapets straight down into the golden grain and the tangled poderi every evening we have gone to walk in the lizza and hang over the bastions of the castello where the near views and the far and the late afternoons and the sunsets and the mountains have made us say again and again that we could never never go away but we are coming back and i greatly wish you were we went the other day to the archivio which i had never seen before and where i was amazed and fascinated it is a great luxury to be in italy with a french celebrityhe is so tremendously known and well treated as the likes of us can never be and one comes in for some of his privileges you of course probably know however what the fullness detail continuity and curiosity of the records of this place arefilling with their visible palpable medievalism the great upper chamber of pal piccolomini  bastai have my trunk to pack and my reckoning to pay i am very glad to have shaken hands with you before i go i saw dear burnejones tolerably often this springoften unwell but almost always stippling away he is the most loveable of men and the most disinterested of artists but sometimes i wish that he set himself a different order of tasks paintingas i feel it mostit is true i have ceased to feel it very muchis with him more and more out of it there remains however a beautiful poetry i want to ask you 20 questions about lowells papersbut i feel it isnt fairand i must wait and see i hope this workand your masses of other workdont take all your holiday i shall send this to ashfield and if you are there will you give for me a very cordial greeting to that mythical man george curtis i embrace all your house and am my dear charles very affectionately yours  henry james     to w d howells   34 de vere gardens w jan 29th 1893  my dear howells  two beneficent notes have i had from you since last i wrote you a word one in regard to looking effectively after some cosmopolitan business in the autumn the other a heavenly remark or two still further sublimated by mildreds lovely photograph in lately forwarding mewith a courtesy worthy of a better causea particularly shameless autographseekers letter for such and all of these good gifts i am more thankful than the hurrying days have left me much of a chance to tell you most especially am i grateful for the portrait of the beautiful beautiful maiden please thank her from me if not for sending it at least for so felicitously sitting for it it makes me jump the torrent of the years and reconstruct from her fine features the mythological pasta still tenderer youth than her present youth i ought to be able to mean my own but i cant manage ither profile wont help me to that i envy you and your wife her company and i rejoice for you in her presence i rejoice for myself my dear howells about your so delicate words to me in regard to a bit of recent work they go to my heartthey go perhaps still straighter to my head i am so utterly lonely hereon the literary planethat it is the strangest as well as the sweetest sensation to be conscious in the boundless voidthe dim desert sandsof any human approach at all or any kindly speech therefore please be very affectionately thankedall this while i never see anything that you yourself have lately flowered withi mean the volumes that you freehandedly scatter i console myself with believing that one or two of your last serial fictions are not volumes yet please hold them not back from soon becoming so i see you are drawing a longish bow in the cosmopolitanbut i only read you when i can sit down to a continuous feast and all the courses you asked me in your penultimatei am talking now of your earlyinthewinter letterif i should object to being made a feature of your composed reminiscences to which i reply that i only wish that i could enrich them better i wont pretend that i like being written aboutthe sight of my own name on a printed page makes me as ill and the sensibility increases strangely with time as that of one of my creations makes me well i have a morbid passion for personal privacy and a standing quarrel with the blundering publicities of the age i wince even at eulogy and i wither for exactly 2 minutes and 12 at any qualification of adulation but on the other hand i like i love to be remembered by you and i surrender myself to your discretion i hope your winter and mrs howells and the fairest of daughterss is rich and full and sane how you must miss the boy i go abroad soon and hope to see him in paris when do you do the same yours always my dear howells  henry james     to robert louis stevenson   34 de vere gardens w feb 17th 1893  my dear distant louis  the charmingest thing that had happened to me for a year was the advent of your reassuring note of dec 5th not 1891my dear timedeluded islander it is enviable to see you so luxuriously out when you indulge in the eccentricity of a date you make it eccentric indeed i call your good letter reassuring simply on the general ground of its making you credible for an hour you are otherwise wholly of the stuff that dreams are made of i think this is why i dont keep writing to you dont talk to you as it were in my sleep please dont think i forget you or am indifferent to anything that concerns you the mere thought of you is better company than almost any that is tangible to me here and london is more peopled to me by your living in samoa than by the residence of almost anybody else in kensington or chelsea i fix my curiosity on you all the while and try to understand your politics and your perils and your public life if in these efforts i make a poor figure it is only because you are so wantonly away then i think i envy you too muchyour climate your thrill of life your magnificent facility you judge well that i have far too little of this lastthough you cant judge how much more and more difficult i find it every day to write none the less i am presently putting forth almost with exact simultaneity three little distinct books2 volumes of penny fiction and one of little essays all material gathered no doubt from sources in which you may already have encountered some of it however this may be the matter shall again be dv deposited on your coral strand most refreshing even while not wholly convincing was the cool tradewind is the tradewind cool of your criticism of some of ces messieurs i grant you hardy with all my heart i am meek and ashamed where the public clatter is deafeningso i bowed my head and let tess of the ds pass but oh yes dear louis she is vile the pretence of sexuality is only equalled by the absence of it and the abomination of the language by the authors reputation for style there are indeed some pretty smells and sights and sounds but you have better ones in polynesia on the other hand i cant go with you three yards in your toleration either of  or of  let me add that i cant read them so i dont know anything about them all the same i make no bones to pronounce them shameless industriels and their works only glories of birmingham you will have gathered that i delight in your year of literary prowess none the less i havent read a word of you since the brave and beautiful wrecker i wont touch you till i can feel that i embrace you in the embracing cover so it is that i languish till the things now announced appear colvin makes me impatient for david balfourbut doesnt yet stay my stomach with the beach of falesà mrs sitwell me fait part of every savoury scrap she gets from you i know what you all magnificently eat and what dear mrs louis splendidly but not somewhat transparentlyno wears please assure that intenselyremembered lady of my dumb fidelity i am told your mother nears our shores and i promise myself joy on seeing her and pumping her i dont know however alas how long this ceremony may be delayed as i go to italy for all the blessed spring next week i have been in london without an hours absence since the middle of aug last i hear you utter some island objurgation and go splashing to banish the stuffy image into the sapphire sea is it all a fable that you will come some month to the mediterranean i would go to the pillars of hercules to greet you give my love to the lusty and literary lloyd i am very glad to observe him spreading his wings there is absolutely nothing to send you the muses are dumb and in france as well of bourgets big 7 franc cosmopolis i have alas purchased three copiesand given them away but even if i were to send you one you would find it too round and round the subjectwhich heaven knows it isfor your taste i will try and despatch you the charming little etui de nacre of anatole francea real master valeage yours my dear louis in a kind of hopeful despair and a clinging alienation  henry james     to mrs edmund gosse   hôtel westminster paris march 21st 1893  dear mrs gosse  many thanks for your better newsand especially for the good news that gosse is coming to paris i shall be very glad to see him and shall rejoice to take him gently by that injuredbut i trust soon to be reanimatedmember please express this to him with all my sympathy and impatience wont heor wont you though indeed i shall cull the precious date from harland give me a hint in advance of the particular moment at which one may look for him please tell him confidently to expect that paris will create within him afresh all the finest pulses of life it is mild sunny splendidblond and fair all in order for his approach i allude of course to the specious allurements of its exterior the state is odorously rottenbut everything else is charming and then its such a blessing after long grief and pain to find the arms of a climate around us once again hasten my dear edmund to be healed  thank heaven my allusion to my own manual distress was mainly a florid figure my hand is infirmbut i am not yet thinking of the knife mille choses to the terrace  yours and gosses always henry james     to edmund gosse       the seductive queen of the golconda and of the boulevard st      michel appears in

genial last which please attribute to the misery of my boulevardbaffled aspirations paris nest plus possiblefrom any point of viewand i leave it tomorrow or next day when my address will become hotel national lucerne i join my brother there for a short time this place continues to rengorger with sunshine and sauces not to mention other appeals to the senses and pitfalls to the pocket i am not alluding in particular to the queen of golconda i have read matelot more or less over again for the extreme penury of the idea in loti and the almost puerile thinness of this particular donnée wean me not a jot from the irresistible charm the rascals very limitations have for me i drink him down as he islike a philtre or a baiser and the coloration of his moindre mots has a peculiar magic for me read aloud to yourself the passage ending section xxxvthe upper part of page 165 and perhaps you will find in it something of the same strange eloquence of suggestion and rhythm as i do which is what literature gives when it is most exquisite and which constitutes its sovereign value and its resistance to devouring time and yet what niaiseries paris continues gorgeous and rainless but less torrid i have become inured to fear as careless of penalties there are no new books but old papiers de famille et darrièreboutique dished up poor harland came and spent 2 or 3 hours with me the other afternoonat a caféfront and on chairs in the champselysées he looked better than the time previous but not well and i am afraid things are not too well with him one would like to help himand i try toin talk but he is not too helpable for there is a chasm too deep to bridge i fear in the pitfall of his literary longings unaccompanied by the faculty apropos of such things i am very glad to see your faculty is reflowering i shall return to england for the volume are you writing about symonds valeespecially in the manual part and valeat your dame compagne  yours my dear gosse always henry james     to robert louis stevenson       stevenson writing to h j from vailima june 17 1893 announced      that he was sending a photograph of his wife it reminds me of a      friend of my grandmothers who used to say when talking to younger      women aweel when i was young i wasnae just exactly what ye wad      call bonny but i was pale penetratin and interestin      letters to his family and friends   34 de vere gardens w august 5th 1893  my dear louis  i have a most charming and interesting letter and a photographic representation of your fine head which i cannot so unrestrictedly commend to thank you for the portrait has its points as a memento but they are not fine points as a likeness i remember you i think of you i evoke you much more plastically but it was none the less liberal and faithful of you to include me in the list of fond recipients your letter contained all sorts of good things but best of all the happy news of your wifes better condition i rejoice in that almost obstreperously and beg you to tell her so with my love the sydney photograph that you kindly announce of her hasnt come but i impatiently desire it meanwhile its place is gracefully occupied by your delightful anecdote of your mothers retrospective scotch friendthe pale penetratin and interestin one perhaps you will permit me to say that it is exquisitely scotch at any rate it moves altogether in the highest walks of anecdote  i get habitually the sympathetic infection from colvin of so much general uneasiness and even alarm about you that it is reassuring to find you apparently incommoded by nothing worse than the privation of liquor and tobacco nothing worse i hear you echo while you ask to what more refined savagery of torture i can imagine you subjected you would rather perhapsand small blame to youperish by the sword than by famine but you wont perish my dear louis and i am here to tell you so i should have perishedlong agoif it were mortal no liquorto speak ofpasses my wasted lips and yet they are capable of the hypocrisy of the sigh of resignation i am very very sorry for youfor i remember the genial tray which in the faroff fabulous time used to be placed as the evening waxed under the social lamp at skerryvore the evenings wax at vailima but the tray i gather has waned may this heavy trial be lightened and as you missionaries say be even blessed to you it wounds i repeat but it doesnt killmores the pity the tobaccos another question i have smoked a cigaretteat skerryvore and i shall probably smoke one again but i dont look forward to it however you will think me objectionably destitute of temperament what depresses me much more is the sad sense that you receive scarcely anything i send you this however doesnt deter me from posting you today registered via san francisco it is postday a volume of thin trifles lately put forth by me and entitled essays in london and elsewhere it contains some pretty writingnot addressed to the fishes my last letter to you to which yours of june 17th was a replythe only dated one dear louis i ever got from youwas intended to accompany two other volumes of mine which were despatched to you registered via san f at the same moment the real thing and the private life yet neither of these works evidently had reached you when you ask me not to send you the former though my letter mentioned that it had started as you had ordered it it is all a mystery which the fishes only will have sounded i also post to you herewith paul bourgets last little tale un scruple as to which nothing will induce me to utter the faintest rudiments of an opinion it is full of talent i dont call that a rudiment but the french are passing strange i am very glad to be able to send you herewith enclosed a petit mot from the said paul bourget in response to your sense of outrage at his toocontinuous silence his intentions i can answer for it had been the best but he leads so migratory a life that i dont see how any intention can ever well fructify he has spent the winter in the holy land and jumps thence in three weeks from beyrout to his queer american expedition a year agomorehe earnestly asked me at siena for your address i as eagerly gave it to himpar écritbut the acknowledgment that he was then full of the desire to make to you succumbed to complex frustrations now that at last here it is i wish you to be able to read it but you wont my hand is the hand of apollo to it  i have been at the seaside for six weeks and am back in the empty town mainly because it is empty my seaside is the sordid sands of ramsgatei see your coralreefs blush pink at the vulgarity of the name the place has for me an unutterable advantage in the press of workingweeks which the beach of falesà would fortunately not havethat of being full of every one i dont know the beach of falesà would enthrall but sterilize mei mean the social muse would disjoint the classic nose of the other you will certainly think me barren enough as i am i am really less desiccated than i seem however for i am working with patient subterraneity at a trade which it is dishonour enough to practise without talking about it a trade supremely dangerous and heroically difficultthat credit at least belongs to it the case is simplified for me by the direst necessity the book as my limitations compel me to produce it doesnt bring me in a penny tell it not in samoaor at least not in tahiti but i dont sell ten copiesand neither editors nor publishers will have anything whatever to say to me but i never mention itnearer home politics dear politiciani rejoice that you are getting over them when you say that you always believed them beastly i am tempted to become superior and say that i always knew them so at least i dont see how one can have glanced however cursorily at the contemporary newspapers i mean the journal of ones whole time and had any doubt of it the morals the manners the materials of all those gentlemen are writ there more large than any record is elsewhere writ and the impudence of their airs and pretensions in the presence of it revolts even the meekness of a spirit as resigned to everything as mine the sordid fight in the house of commons the other night seemed to me only a momentary intermission of hypocrisy the hypocrisy comes back with the pretended confusion over it the lives of the stevensons with every respect to them isnt what i want you most to write but i would rather you should publish ten volumes of them than another letter to the times meanwhile i am languishing for catrionaand the weeks follow and i must live without you it isnt life but i am still amicably yours and your wifes and the insidious lloyds  henry james     to robert louis stevenson   34 de vere gardens w october 21st 1893  my dear louis  the postal guide tells me disobligingly that there is no mail to you via san francisco this month and that i must confide my few lines to the precarious and perfidious hamburg i do so then for the plain reason that i can no longer repress the enthusiasm that has surged within me ever since i read catriona i missed just after doing so last months post and i was infinitely vexed that it should not have conveyed to you the freshness of my rapture for the said catriona so reeks and hums with genius that there is no refuge for the desperate reader but in straightforward prostration im not sure that its magnanimous of you to succeed so inconsideratelythere is a modesty in easy triumph which your flushed muse perhaps a little neglectsbut forgive that lumbering imagei wont attempt to carry it out let me only say that i dont despatch these ineffectual words on their too watery way to do anything but thank you for an exquisite pleasure i hold that when a book has the high beauty of that one theres a poor indelicacy in what simple folk call criticism the work lives by so absolute a law that its grotesque to prattle about what might have been i shall express to you the one point in which my sense was conscious of an unsatisfied desire but only after saying first how rare an achievement i think the whole personality and tone of david and with how supremely happy a hand you have coloured the palpable women they are quite too lovely and everyone is running after them in david not an error not a false note ever he is all of an exasperating truth and rightness the one thing i miss in the book is the note of visibilityit subjects my visual sense my seeing imagination to an almost painful underfeeding the hearing imagination as it were is nourished like an alderman and the loud audibility seems a slight the more on the baffled lust of the eyesso that i seem to myself i am speaking of course only from the point of view of the way as i read my impression longs to complete itself in the presence of voices in the darknessvoices the more distinct and vivid the more brave and sonorous as voices always arebut also the more tormenting and confoundingby reason of these bandaged eyes i utter a pleading moan when you eg transport your characters toward the end in a line or two from leyden to dunkirk without the glint of a hint of all the ambient picture of the 18th century road however stick to your own system of evocation so long as what you positively achieve is so big life and letters and art all take joy in you  i am rejoiced to hear that your wife is less disturbed in health and that your anxieties are somewhat appeased i dont know how sufficiently to renew to both of you the assurance of all my friendliest sympathy you live in conditions so unimaginable and to the tune of experience so great and so strange that you must forgive me if i am altogether out of step with your events i know youre surrounded with the din of battle and yet the beauty you produce has the goethean calm even like the beauty distilled at weimar when the smoke was over jena let me touch you at least on your bookish side and the others may bristle with heroics i pray you be made accessible some day in a talkative armchair by the fire if it hadnt been for catriona we couldnt this year have held up our head it had been long before that since any decent sentence was turned in english we grow systematically vulgarer and baser the only blur of light is that your books are tasted i shall try to see colvin before i post thisotherwise i havent seen him for three months ive had a summer of the british seaside the bathing machine and the german band i met zola at luncheon the day before he left london and found him very sane and common and inexperienced nothing literally nothing has ever happened to him but to write the rougonmacquart it makes that series i admit still more curious your tour de force is of the opposite kind renew the miracle my dear louis and believe me yours already gaping  henry james  ps i have had to keep my poor note several daysfinding that after all there is thank heaven a near post by san francisco meanwhile i have seen colvin and made discreetly though so eagerly free of some of your projectsand gyrations trapezist in the pacific void  catriona is more and more beautiful theres the rub  hj     to william james       the incident referred to in the following letter was the unexpected      miscarriage of one of h js theatrical schemes meanwhile guy      domville had been accepted for future production at the st      jamess theatre   34 de vere gardens w dec 29th 1893  i rejoice greatly in alices announcement which you william coyly dont mention of the presidency of the society for psychical research i hope its all honour and kudos and pleasantness without a tax of botherations i wish i could give you some correspondingly good tidings of my own ascensory movement but i had a fallor rather took a jumpthe other day a month ago of which the direction was not vulgarlyi mean theatrically and financiallyupward you are so sympathetic about the whole sordid development that i make a point of mentioning the incident it was none the less for a while a lively disgust and disappointmenta waste of patient and ingenious labour and a sacrifice of coin much counted on but à la guerre comme à la guerre i mean to wage this war ferociously for one year more1894and then unless the victory and the spoils have by that become more proportionate than hitherto to the humiliations and vulgarities and disgusts all the dishonour and chronic insult incurred to chuck the whole intolerable experiment and return to more elevated and more independent courses the whole odiousness of the thing lies in the connection between the drama and the theatre the one is admirable in its interest and difficulty the other loathsome in its conditions if the drama could only be theoretically or hypothetically acted the fascination resident in its all but unconquerable circumspice form would be unimpaired and one would be able to have the exquisite exercise without the horrid sacrifice however alexanders preparations of my play are going on sedulously as to which situation and circumstances are all essentially different he will produce me at no distant date infallibly but meanwhile i am working heroically though it every month becomes more difficult to give time to things of which the pecuniary fruit is remote excuse these vulgar confidences i have come to hate the whole theatrical subject dont write to condole with me about the business i dont in the least require it may the new year not have too many twists and turns for you but lie straight and smooth before you  evermore your henry     to julian r sturgis   34 de vere gardens w sunday 1893  my dear julian  i wish i had your gift of facile and fascinating rhyme i would turn it to account to thank you for your note and your sympathy yes ibsen is ugly common hard prosaic bottomlessly bourgeoisand with his distinction so far in as it were so behind doors and beyond vestibules that one is excusable for not pushing ones way to it and yet of his art hes a masterand i feel in him to the pitch of almost intolerable boredom the presence and the insistence of life on the other hand his mastery so bare and lean as it is wouldnt count nearly as much in any medium in which the genus was otherwise represented in our sandy desert even this translated octopus excuse my confusion of habitats sits alone and isnt kept in his place by relativity thanks awfully for having retained an impression from the few tales my intentions are mostly good i hope to knock at your door this pm  yours always henry james   to george du maurier       an article by h j on george du maurier had appeared in harpers      weekly april 14 1894   casa biondetti san vio 715 venice  thursday may 1894  only see my dear kikaccio to what my thickandthin espousal of your genius exposes me at the hands of an unknown american female guileless stupid muddled distracted wellmeaning but slightly hypocritical american femaledont return of course the letter i havent seen the little cochonnerie i wrote about you bothered preoccupied with other work more and more incapable of writing that sort of thing gracefully and properlyin the muddle and confusion of my coming abroad and i hope you havent by the trop bons soins of mcilvaine seen it either but i bless it in that through arousing the american female my clumsy critique has given me the occasion to salutarvi tutti are you on the hill or in the vale i give it up only pressing you all to my bosom wherever you are trilby goes on with a life and charm and loveability that gild the whole day one reads her its most delightfully and vividly talked and then drawnno it isnt fair well im in venice and youre notso youve not got quite everything it has been cold and wet but italy is always italyand the only thing really to be depended on quand même i hope you have not returned to hampstead if you have returned without tying your legs somewhere or other to bayswater i hope that everything has been well with you allyou yourself most well it makes me homesick to write to youbut it is the only thing that does i trust fame and flattery and flowers flow in upon you with the revolving harpers write me a wordtell me you dont hate me i seem to remember rather disagreeably what i wrote about you  yours caro mio always henry james     to william james       h j had just received from his brother the diary which their      sister had kept during her last years in england   grand hotel rome may 28th 1894  my dear williammy dear alice  i wrote you a scrabbly note from ravenna a few days sincebut i must follow it up without delay with something better i came on here an hour afterwards and shall remain till june 1st or 2nd i find rome deliriously cool and empty and still very pleasing in spite of the ruining which has been going on so long and of which one has heard so much ie the redemption and cockneyfication of the ruins this changes immenselyas everyone says but i find myself i am afraid so much more changedsince i first knew and rhapsodized over it that i am bound in justice to hold rome the less criminal of the two i am thinking a little about going downif the coolness lastsfor three or four days to naples but i havent decided i feel rather hard and heartless to be prattling about these touristries to you with the sad picture i have had these last weeks of yourwilliamsstate of suffering but it is only a way of saying that that state makes one feel it to be the greater duty for me to be as well as i can absit omen your so interesting letter of the 6th dictated to alice speaks of the possibility of your abscess continuing not to healbut i trust the event has long ere this reassured comforted and liberated you meanwhile may alice have smoothed your pillow as even she has never smoothed it before as regards the life the power the temper the humour and beauty and expressiveness of the diary in itselfthese things were partly discounted to me in advance by so much of alices talk during her last yearsand my constant association with herwhich led me often to reflect about her extraordinary force of mind and character her whole way of taking lifeand deathin very much the manner in which the book does i find in its pages for instance many things i heard her say none the less i have been immensely impressed with the thing as a revelation of a moral and personal picture it is heroic in its individuality its independenceits facetoface with the universe for and by herselfand the beauty and eloquence with which she often expresses this let alone the rich irony and humour constitute i wholly agree with you a new claim for the family renown this last elementher style her power to writeare indeed to me a delightfor i have had many letters from her also it brings back to me all sorts of things i am glad to keepi mean things that happened hours occasions conversationsbrings them back with a strange living richness but it also puts before me what i was tremendously conscious of in her lifetimethat the extraordinary intensity of her will and personality really would have made the equal the reciprocal life of a well personin the usual worldalmost impossible to herso that her disastrous her tragic health was in a manner the only solution for her of the practical problem of lifeas it suppressed the element of equality reciprocity etc the violence of her reaction against her british ambiente against everything english engenders some of her most admirable and delightful passagesbut i feel in reading them as i always felt in talking with her that inevitably she simplified too much shut up in her sick room exercised her wondrous vigour of judgment on too small a scrap of what really surrounded her it would have been modified in many ways if she had lived with them the english moreseen more of the men etc but doubtless it is fortunate for the fun and humour of the thing that it wasnt modifiedas surely the critical emotion about them the essence of much of their nature was never more beautifully expressed as for her allusions to hthey fill me with tears and cover me with blushes i find an immense eloquence in her passionate radicalismher most distinguishing feature almostwhich in her was absolutely direct and original like everything that was in her unreflected uncaught from entourage or example it would really have made her had she lived in the world a feminine political force but had she lived in the world and seen things nearer she would have had disgusts and disillusions however what comes out in the bookas it came out to me in factis that she was really an irishwoman transplanted transfiguredyet none the less fundamentally nationalin spite of her so much larger and finer than irish intelligence she felt the home rule question absolutely as only an irishwoman not anglicised could it was a tremendous emotion with herinexplicable in any other waybut perfectly explicable by atavism what a pity she wasnt born thereand had her health for it she would have been if always she had not fallen a victim to disgusta large if a national glory but i am writing too much and my late hindrances have left me with tremendous arrears of correspondence i thank you dear alice caramente for your sweet letter received two or three weeks before williams i crudely hope you wont let your houseso as to have it to go to in the summer otherwise what will become of you i dig my nose into the fleshiest parts of the young francis tell peggy i cling to herand to harry too and billy not less i havent sent you the yellow bookon purpose and indeed i have been weeks and weeks receiving a copy of it myself i say on purpose because although my little tale which ushers it in the death of the lion appears to have had for a thing of mine an unusual success i hate too much the horrid aspect and company of the whole publication and yet i am again to be intimately conspicuously associated with the 2d number it is for gold and to oblige the worshipful harland the editor wait and read the two tales in a volumewith 2 or 3 others above all be debout and forgive the long reticence of your affectionate  henry     to edmund gosse       mr gosse and his family with mr a c benson were at this time      spending a holiday in switzerland apparently not without      mischance stevensons offending letter is to be found among his      published correspondence dated from vailima july 7 1894 h j      misrepresents the phrase he quotes i decline any longer to give      you examples of how not to write are stevensons words   tregenna castle hotel st ives  august 22nd 1894  my dear gosse  i should have been very glad to hear from you yesterday if only for the sweet opportunity it gives me of crying out that i told you so it gives me more than thisand i didnt tell you so but i wanted to awfullyand i only smothered my wisdom under my waistcoat tell arthur benson that i wanted to tell him so toothat guileless morning at victoria i knew so well both then and at delamere terrace with my half century of experience straight into what a purgatory you were all running the high swiss mountain inn the crowd the cold the heat the rain the germans the scramble the impossible rooms and the still more impossible everything elsethe hope deferred the money misspent the weather accurst these things i saw written on your azure brows even while i perfidiously prattled with your prattle the only thing was to let you do itfor one can no more come between a lady and her swiss hotel than between a gentleman and his wife meanwhile i sit here looking out at my nice domestic inexpensive english rain in my nice bad stuffy insular inn and thanking god that i am not as gosses and bensons are i am pretty bad i recognisebut i am not so bad as you i am so bad that i am fleeing in a day or twoas i hope you will have been doing if your ineluctable fate doesnt spare you i stopped on my way down here to spend three days with w e norris which were rendered charming by the urbanity of my host and the peerless beauty of torquay with which i fell quite in love here i go out for long walks on wet moors with the silent stephen the almost speechless leslie in the morning i improve the alas not shining hours in a little black sittingroom which looks out into the strange arealike unto that of the london milkmanwith which this cidevant castle is encompassed and which sends up strange scullery odours into my nose i am very sorry to hear of any friends of yours suffering by the saturday review but i know nothing whatever of the cataclysm its a journal which in spite of the lustre you add to it i havent so much as seen for 15 years and no echoes of its fortunes ever reach me  23rd i broke off yesterday to take a long walk over bogs and brambles and this morning my windows are lashed by a wet hurricane it makes me wish i could settle down to a luxurious irresponsible day with the lourdes of your appreciation which lies there on my table still uncut but my holiday is no holiday and i must drive the mechanic pen moreover i have vowed not to open lourdes till i shall have closed with a final furious bang the unspeakable lord ormont which i have been reading at the maximum rate of ten pagesten insufferable and unprofitable pages a day it fills me with a critical rage an artistic fury utterly blighting in me the indispensable principle of respect i have finished at this rate but the first volumewhereof i am moved to declare that i doubt if any equal quantity of extravagant verbiage of airs and graces of phrases and attitudes of obscurities and alembications ever started less their subject ever contributed less of a statementtold the reader less of what the reader needs to know all elaborate predicates of exposition without the ghost of a nominative to hook themselves to and not a difficulty met not a figure presented not a scene constitutednot a dim shadow condensing once either into audible or into visible realitymaking you hear for an instant the tap of its feet on the earth of course there are pretty things but for what they are they come so much too dear and so many of the profundities and tortuosities prove when threshed out to be only pretentious statements of the very simplest propositions enough and forgive me above all dont send this to the pmg there is another side of course which one will utter another day i have a dictated letter from r l s sent me through colvin who is at schwalbach with the horsey duchess of montrose a disappointing letter in which the too apt pupil of meredith tells me nothing that i want to knownothing save that his spirits are low which i would fain ignore and that he has been on an excursion on an english manofwar the devilish letter is wholly about the manofwar not a word else and at the end he says i decline to tell you any more about it as if i had prescribed the usurping subject you

prettiest and i should judge kindest sociopsychological book written about the us that is saying little it is very living and interesting prévosts fetid étude on the little girls represents a perfect bound from his earlier things in the way of hard firm knowing ability so cleverand so common no ability to imagine his queenly girl made to dominate the world do anything finally by way of

gosse  many thanks for the study of the roaring norseman which i read attentively last nightwithout having time claimed by more intimes perusals for reading his lusty fable björnson has always been i frankly confess an untended prejudicea hostile oneof mine and the effect of your lively and interesting monograph has been i fear to validate the hardly more than instinctive mistrust i dont think you justify him rank him enoughhardly quite enough for the attention you give him at any rate he sounds in your pictureto say nothing of looking in his ownlike the sort of literary fountain from which i am ever least eager to drink the big splashing blundering genius of the hitormiss the a peu près familywithout perfection or the effort toward it without the exquisite the love of selection a big superabundant and promiscuous democrat on the other hand the impossiblynamed novelle would perhaps win me over but the human subjectmatter in these fellows is so rebarbatifmrs bangtande what a romeo and juliet have you seen maurice barrèss last volumedu sang de la volupté et de la mort that is exquisite in its fearfully intelligent impertinence and its diabolical renanisation we will talk of these thingsall thanks meanwhile for the book  yours ever henry james     to edmund gosse       mr gosses study of walter pater is included in his critical      kitkats   34 de vere gardens w dec 13th 1894  my dear gosse  i return with much appreciation the vivid pages on pater they fill up substantially the void of ones ignorance of his personal history and they are of a manner graceful and luminous though i should perhaps have relished a little more insistence ona little more of an inside view ofthe nature of his mind itself much as they tell however how curiously negative and faintlygrey he after all telling remains i think he has hadwill have hadthe most exquisite literary fortune ie to have taken it out all wholly exclusively with the pen the style the genius and absolutely not at all with the person he is the mask without the face and there isnt in his total superficies a tiny point of vantage for the newspaper to flap his wings on you have been lively about himbut about whom wouldnt you be lively i think youd be lively about mewell faint pale embarrassed exquisite pater he reminds me in the disturbed midnight of our actual literature of one of those lucent matchboxes which you place on going to bed near the candle to show you in the darkness where you can strike a light he shines in the uneasy gloomvaguely and has a phosphorescence not a flame but i quite agree with you that he is not of the little daybut of the longer time  will you kindly ask tessa if i may still come on saturday my visit to the country has been put off by a deathand if there is a little corner for me ill appear if there isntso lateno matter i daresay i ought to write to miss wetton or will tessa amiably inquire  yours always henry james     to edmund gosse       the news of stevensons death in samoa reached london at this      moment when h j was deeply occupied with the rehearsals of guy      domville at the st jamess theatre jan 5th was to be the      first night of the play   34 de vere gardens w dec 17th 1894  my dear gosse  i meant to write you tonight on another matterbut of what can one think or utter or dream save of this ghastly extinction of the beloved rls it is too miserable for cold wordsits an absolute desolation it makes me cold and sickand with the absolute almost alarmed sense of the visible material quenching of an indispensable light that hes silent forever will be a fact hard for a long time to live with today at any rate its a cruel wringing emotion one feels how one cared for himwhat a place he took and as if suddenly into that place there had descended a great avalanche of ice im not sure that its not for him a great and happy fate but for us the loss of charm of suspense of fun is unutterable and how confusedly and pityingly ones thought turns to those faraway stricken women with their whole principle of existence suddenly quenched and yet all the monstrosity of the rest of their situation left on their hands i saw poor colvin todayhe is overwhelmed he is touching but i cant write of thiswe must talk of it yet these words have been a relief  and i cant write either of the matter i had intended toviz that you are to rest secure about the question of jan 5thi will do everything for you that business becomes for the hour tawdry and heartless to me  yours always henry james     to sidney colvin       h j unexpectedly found himself named by stevenson as one of his      executors but this charge he felt it impossible to undertake on      account of his complete inexperience in matters of business the      last paragraph of this letter refers to a suggestion that the      cabled news of stevensons death might prove to be mistaken   34 de vere gardens w dec 20th 94  my dear colvin  i didnt come as i threatened to see you this am because up to the time i was forced early to absent myself from home for several hours no sign had come from edinburgh on coming home at 4 oclock however i found both a telegram and a letter from mr mitchell the telegram asked for a telegraphic yea or nay that might instantly be cabled to baxter at port said i immediately wired a profoundly regretful but unconditional and insurmountable refusal the absolute necessity of doing this has gathered still more overwhelming force since i saw you yesterdayif indeed there could have been any still more when the maximum had been so promptly reached to ease still more at all events my consciencethough god knows it was and is easyi conferred last pm with a sage friend about the matter and if i had been in the smallest degree unsettled some words he dropped about the pecuniary liability of executors under certain new regulations in regard to the revenue c would sufficiently have fixed me but in truth the question was not even one to talk of at alleven to the extent of asking for confirmations i wish the thing could have been otherwise but that is idle so i have answered mr mitchells letter by this evenings post in a manner that leaves no doubt either of my decision or my sorrow there may be something legal for me to do to be exonerated i have inquired  and meanwhile comes the torture of such phenomena as dr balfours letter in todays pmga torture doubtless only meant by a perverse providence to deepen the final pain at any rate it is unsettling to the point of nervous anguishor à peu près but to whom do i say this i dont like to think of your horrible worryyour all but damnable suspense dont answer thisor write me unless you particularly want to i ache in sympathy under the letters telegrams complications of every sort you have to meet that you may find strength to bear which is the hearty wish of yours my dear colvin more than ever  henry james     to miss henrietta reubell   34 de vere gardens w december 31st 1894  dear miss etta  this is to wish you a brandnew year and to wish it very affectionatelyand to wish it of not more than usual length but of more than usual fulness i have had an unacknowledged letter from you longer than is decorous but i have shown you ere this that epistolary decorum is a virtue i have ceased to pretend to and during the last month i have not pretended to any other virtue eithersave an endless patience and an heroic resignation as i have been and still am alas in the sorry position of having in rehearsal a little play3 actswhich is to be produced on saturday next at the st jamess theatre as to which i beg you heartily to indulge for me about 830 oclock on that evening in very fervent prayer it is a little romantic play of which the action is laid in england in the middle of the last century and it will be exquisitely mounted dressed c and very creditably acted as things go here but rehearsal is an écœurment is the right spelling and ones need of heroic virtues infinite i have been in the breach daily for 4 weeks and am utterly exhausted tonight the theatre being closed for the week on purpose is the first dress rehearsalwhich is here of course not a public as in paris but an intensely private functionall for me me prélassant dans mon fauteuil alone like the king of bavaria at the opera there are to be three nights more of this to give them ease in the wearing of their clothes of a past time and that after the grind of the earlier work is rather amusingas amusing as anything can be for a man of taste and sensibility in the odious process of practical dramatic production i may have been meant for the dramagod knowsbut i certainly wasnt meant for the theatre cest pour vous dire that i am much pressed and am only sending you mes vœux trèssincères in a shabbily brief little letter there are a number of interesting things in your last to which i want to respond i send you also by post 3 or 4 miserable little old views of tunbridge wells which i have picked up in looking at rare leisure moments for one good one for you i havent alas found that but i think i am on the track of it and you shall have it as soon as it turns up accept these meanwhile as a little stopgap and a symbol of my new years greeting i hope you are in good case and good hope we are having here an excellent winter almost fogless and generally creditable write me a little word of hope and help for the 5th i shall regard it as a happy influence for yours forever  henry james     to william james   34 de vere gardens w jan 9th 1895  my dear william  i never cabled to you on sunday 6th about the first night of my play because as i daresay you will have gathered from some despatches or newspapers if there have been any and you have seen them the case was too complicated even now its a sore trial to me to have to write about itweary bruised sickened disgusted as one is left by the intense the cruel ordeal of a first night thatafter the immense labour of preparation and the unspeakable tension of suspensehas in a few brutal moments not gone well in three words the delicate picturesque extremely human and extremely artistic little play was taken profanely by a brutal and illdisposed gallery which had shown signs of malice prepense from the first and which held in hand till the end kicked up an infernal row at the fall of the curtain there followed an abominable quarter of an hour during which all the forces of civilization in the house waged a battle of the most gallant prolonged and sustained applause with the hoots and jeers and catcalls of the roughs whose roars like those of a cage of beasts at some infernal zoo were only exacerbated as it were by the conflict it was a cheering scene as you may imagine for a nervous sensitive exhausted author to faceand you must spare my going over again the horrid hour or those of disappointment and depression that have followed it from which last however i am rapidly and resolutely thank god emerging the papers have into the bargain been mainly illnatured and densely stupid and vulgar but the only two dramatic critics who count w archer and clement scott have done me more justice meanwhile all private opinion is apparently one of extreme admirationi have been flooded with letters of the warmest protest and assurance everyone who was there has either written to me or come to see mei mean every one i know and many people i dont obviously the little play which i strove to make as broad as simple as clear as british in a word as possible is over the heads of the usual vulgar theatregoing london publicand the chance of its going for a while which it is too early to measure will depend wholly on its holding on long enough to attract the unusual i was there the second night monday 7th when before a full housea remarkably good money house alexander told meit went singularly well but its soon to see or to say and im prepared for the worst the thing fills me with horror for the abysmal vulgarity and brutality of the theatre and its regular public which god knows i have had intensely even when working from motives as pure as pecuniary motives can be against it and i feel as if the simple freedom of mind thus begotten to return to ones legitimate form would be simply by itself a divine solace for everything dont worry about me im a rock if the play has no life on the stage i shall publish it its altogether the best thing ive done you would understand better the elements of the case if you had seen the thing it followed the masqueraders and the thing that is now succeeding at the haymarketthe thing of oscar wildes on the basis of their being plays or successes my thing is necessarily neither doubtless moreover the want of a roaring actuality simplified to a few big familiar effects in my subjectan episode in the history of an old english catholic family in the last centurymilitates against it with all usual theatrical people who dont want plays from variety and nimbleness of fancy of different kinds like books and stories but only of one kind which their stiff rudimentary clumsilyworking vision recognizes as the kind theyve had before and yet i had tried so to meet them but you cant make a sows ear out of a silk pursei cant write moreand dont ask for more details this week will probably determine the fate of the piece if there is increased advancebooking it will go on if there isnt it will be withdrawn and with it all my little hope of profit the time one has given to such an affair from the very first to the very last represents in allso inconceivably great to the uninitiated is the amounta pitiful tragic bankruptcy of hours that might have been rendered retroactively golden but i am not plangentone must take the thick with the thinand i have such possibilities of another and better sort before me i am only sorry for your and alices having to be so sorry for yours forever  henry     to george henschel       answering a suggestion that h j should write a libretto to be set      to music by sir george henschel   34 de vere gardens w january 22d 1895  my dear henschel  your flattering dream is beautifulbut i fear alas delusive when i say i fear it i mean i only too completely feel it it is a charming idea but the root of the libretto is not in me we will talk of ityes because i will talk with you with joy of anythingwill even play to myself that i have convictions i havent for that privilege but i am unlyrical unmusical unrhythmical unmanageable and i hate old new england storieswhich are lean and pale and poor and ugly but let us by all means talkand the more the better i am touched by your thinking so much good of meand i embrace you my dear henschel for such rich practical friendship and confidence i congratulate you afresh on your glorious wife i await you with impatience and i stretch out to you across the wintry wastes the very grateful hand of yours always  henry james     to w d howells   34 de vere gardens w january 22d 1895  my dear howells  i am indebted to you for your most benignant letter of december last it lies open before me and i read it again and am soothed and cheered and comforted again you put your finger sympathetically on the place and spoke of what i wanted you to speak of i have felt for a long time past that i have fallen upon evil daysevery sign or symbol of ones being in the least wanted anywhere or by any one having so utterly failed a new generation that i know not and mainly prize not has taken universal possession the sense of being utterly out of it weighed me down and i asked myself what the future would be all these melancholies were qualified indeed by one redeeming reflectionthe sense of how little for a good while past for reasons very logical but accidental and temporary i had been producing i did say to myself produce againproduce produce better than ever and all will yet be well and there was sustenance in that so far as it went but it has meant much more to me since you have said itfor it is practically what you admirably say it is exactly moreover what i meant to admirably doand have meant all along about this time to get into the motion of the whole thing however represents a great change in my life inasmuch as what is clear is that periodical publication is practically closed to meim the last hand that the magazines in this country or in the us seem to want i wont afflict you with the now accumulated during all these past years evidence on which this induction restsand i have spoken of it to no creature till at this late day i speak of it to you all this i neednt say is for your segretissimo ear what it means is that production for me as aforesaid means production of the little book pure and simpleindependent of any antecedent appearance and truth to tell now that i wholly see that and have at last accepted it i am incongruously not at all sorry i am indeed very serene i have always hated the magazine form magazine conditions and manners and much of the magazine company i hate the hurried little subordinate part that one plays in the catchpenny picturebookand the negation of all literature that the insolence of the picturebook imposes the moneydifference will be greatbut not so great after a bit as at first and the other differences will be so all to the good that even from the economic point of view they will tend to make up for that and perhaps finally even completely do so it is about the distinctness of ones bookposition that you have so substantially reassured me and i mean to do far better work than ever i have done before i have potentially improved immensely and am bursting with ideas and subjectsthough the act of composition is with me more and more slow painful and difficult i shall never again write a long novel but i hope to write six immortal short onesand some tales of the same quality forgive my dear howells the cynical egotism of these remarksthe fault of which is in your own sympathy dont fail me this summer i shall probably not as usual absent myself from these islandsnot be beyond the alps as i was when you were here last that way boston lies which is the deadliest form of madness i sent you only last night messages of affection by dear little ned abbey who presently sails for ny laden with the beautiful work he has been doing for the new boston public library i hope you will see himhe will speak of me competently and kindly i wish all power to your elbow let me hear as soon as there is a sound of packing tell mildred i rejoice in the memory of her give my love to your wife and believe me my dear howells yours in all constancy  henry james     to william james   34 de vere gardens w february 2nd 1895  the poor little play seems already thank god ancient history though i have lived through in its company the horridest four weeks of my life produce a play and you will know better than i can tell you how such an ordealodious in its essenceis only made tolerable and palatable by great success and in how many ways accordingly nonsuccess may be tormenting and tragic a bitterness of every hour ramifying into every throb of ones consciousness tonight the thing will have lived the whole of its troubled little life of 31 performances and will be taken off to be followed on feb 5th by a piece by oscar wilde that will have probably a very different fate on the night of the 5th too nervous to do anything else i had the ingenious thought of going to some other theatre and seeing some other play as a means of being coerced into quietness from 8 till 1045 i went accordingly to the haymarket to a new piece by the said ow that had just been producedan ideal husband i sat through it and saw it played with every appearance so far as the crowded house was an appearance of complete success and that gave me the most fearful apprehension the thing seemed to me so helpless so crude so bad so clumsy feeble and vulgar that as i walked away across st jamess square to learn my own fate the prosperity of what i had seen seemed to me to constitute a dreadful presumption of the shipwreck of gd and i stopped in the middle of the square paralyzed by the terror of this probabilityafraid to go on and learn more how can my piece do anything with a public with whom that is a success it couldntbut even then the full truth was mercifully not revealed to me the truth that in a short month my piece would be whisked away to make room for the triumphant oscar if as i say this episode has by this time become ancient history to me it is thank heaven because when a thing for me a piece of work is done its done i get quickly detached and away from it and am wholly given up to the better and fresher life of the next thing to come this is particularly the case now with my literary way blocked so long and my production smothered by these theatrical lures i have such arrears on hand and so many things seem to wait for methat i want far more and that it will be nobler to dothat i am looking in a very different direction than in that of the sacrificed little play partly for this reason this receiving from you all the retarded echo of my reverse and having to live over it with you you must excuse me if i dont do so much is the thing in the whole business that has been most of an anguish and that i dreaded most in advance as for the play in three words it has been i think i may say a rare and distinguished private success and scarcely anything at all of a public one by a private success i mean with the even moderately cultivated civilised and intelligent individual with people of taste in short of almost any kind as distinguished from the vast english philistine mobthe regular theatrical public of london which of all the vulgar publics london contains is the most brutishly and densely vulgar this congregation the things they do like sufficiently judge i no sooner found myself in the presence of those yelling barbarians of the first night and learned what could be the savagery of their disappointment that one wasnt perfectly the same as everything else they had ever seen than the dream and delusion of my having made a successful appeal to the cosy childlike naïf domestic british imagination which was what i had calculated dropped from me in the twinkling of an eye i saw they couldnt care one straw for a damned young lastcentury english catholic who lived in an oldtune catholic world and acted with every one else in the play from remote and romantic catholic motives the whole thing was for them remote and all the intensity of ones ingenuity couldnt make it anything else it has made it something else for the fewbut that is all such is the bare history of poor gdwhich i beg you to believe throws no light on my technical skill which isnt a light that that mystery ought to rejoice to have thrown the newspaper people muddle things up with the most foredoomed crudity and i am capable of analysing the whole thing far more scientifically and drawing from it lessons far more pertinent and practical than all of them put together it is perfectly true that the novelist has a fearful long row to hoe to get into any practical relation to the grovelling stage and his difficulty is precisely double it bears on one side upon the question of method and on the other upon the question of subject if he is really in earnest as i have been he surmounts the former difficulty before he surmounts the latter i have worked like a horsefar harder than any one will ever knowover the whole stiff mystery of techniquei have run it to earth and i dont in the least hesitate to say that for the comparatively poor and meagre the piteously simplified purposes of the english stage i have made it absolutely my own put it into my pocket the question of realising how different is the attitude of the theatregoer toward the quality of thing which might be a story in a book from his attitude toward the quality of thing that is given to him as a story in a play is another matter altogether that difficulty is portentous for any writer who doesnt approach it naïvely as only a very limited and simpleminded writer can one has to make ones self so limited and simple to conceive a subject see a subject simply enough and that in a nutshell is where i have stumbled and yet if you were to have seen my play i havent been near the theatre since the second night but i shall go down there late this evening to see it buried and bid goodbye to the actors i am very sorry for marion terry who has delighted in her part and made the great hit of her career i should suppose in it and who has to give it up thus untimely her charming acting has done much for the little run the money disappointment is of course keenas it was wholly for money i adventured but the poor four weeks have brought me 1100which shows what a tidy sum many times four weeks would have brought without my lifting as they say after the first performance a finger  i have written you so longwindedly on this matter that i have left neither time nor space for anything else i must catch the post and will write more sociably something by the next one ones time in the whole history has gone like water and still it pours out please dont send me anything out of newspapers  always your henry     to sidney colvin       the first of stevensons letters to be published it will be      remembered were the vailima letters to sir sidney colvin   34 de vere gardens w feb 19th 1895  my dear colvin  i shall send you all the vailima letters back tomorrow or next day by hand i have completely read them i cant say and i dont want to say anything of them but publish themthey make the man so loveable its on that i should take my stand i think your estimate of them as ranking high in their class epistolary is perhaps if i remember what you seemed to express of it a larger one than i should concur in but i think still more that that makes little difference for they will assuredly be likedimmensely and that is mainly what one is concerned to ask for him they are charming living touching absolutely natural and i think better toward the end than at the beginning what they suffer from is 1º want of interest and want of clearness as to the subjectmatter of much of themthe samoan personalities politics c all to me almost squalidand the irritating effect of ones sense of his clearing the very ground to be able to do his daily work want also to a certain extent of generalization about all these matters and some othersinto the dreary specifics of which the reader perhaps finds himself plunged too much 2º a certain tormenting effect in his literary confidences to you glimpses promises revelations c arising from his so seldom telling the subject the idea of the thingwhat he sees what he wants to do cas against his pouring forth titles chapters divisions names c in such magnificent abundanceon the other hand the personality shines out so beautiful and there are so many charming thingspassages pagesthat not to publish them would seem to me like the burial of something alive i see but little in what you have left in these copies to excise on grounds of discretion unless it be many of those reports of the state of public affairs and allusions to public personages which are primarily excisable by reason of obscurity failure to appeal to readers interest c but i should like to see you and talk about the matter with you better than thus and shall take the earliest occasion the hideous sadness of themto us to readers at largeno but i feel as though i had been sitting with him for hours  yours always henry james     to mrs john l gardner   royal hospital dublin march 23d 1895  dear isabella gardner  yes i have delayed hideously to write to you since receiving your note of many days ago but i always delay hideously and my shamelessness is rapidly becoming in the matter of letterwriting more disgraceful even than my procrastination i brought your letter with me to ireland more than a fortnight ago with every intention of answering it on the morrow of my arrival but i have been leading here a strange and monstrous life of demoralisation and frivolity and the fleeting hour has mocked till today at my languid effort to stay it to clutch it in its passage i have been paying three monstrous visits in a row and if i needed any further demonstration of the havoc such things make in my life i should find it in this sense of infidelity to a charming friendship of so many years  i return to england to enter a monastery for the rest of my daysand crave your forgiveness before i take this step i have been staying in this queer shabby sinister sordid place i mean dublin with the lord lieutenant poor young lord houghton for what is called a fragment that is of what is called the castle season and now i am domesticated with very kind and valued old friends the wolseleyslord w being commander of the forces here that is head of the little english army of occupation in irelanda fiveyears appointment and domiciled in this delightfully quaint and picturesque old structure of charles iis timea kind of irish invalides or chelsea hospitala retreat for superannuated veterans out of which a commodious and stately residence has been carved we live side by side with the 140 old redcoated cockedhatted pensionersbut with a splendid great rococo hall separating us in which lady wolseley gave the other night the most beautiful ball i have ever seena fancyball in which all the ladies were sir joshuas gainsboroughs or romneys and all the men in uniform court dress or evening hunt dress i went asguess whatalas nothing smarter than the one black coat in the room it is a world of generals aidedecamps and colonels of military colour and sentinelmounting which amuses for the moment and makes one reflect afresh that in england those who have a good time have it with a vengeance the episode at the tarnished and ghosthaunted castle was little to my taste and was a very queer episode indeedthanks to the incongruity of a viceregal court for thats what it considers itself utterly boycotted by irish landlord societythe present viceroy being the nominee of a homerule government and reduced to dreary importation from england to fill its gilded halls there was a ball every night etc but too much standing on ones hindlegstoo much pomp and statefor nothing and nobody on my return two days hence to my humble fireside i get away again as quickly as possible into the countryto a cot beside a rill the address of which no man knoweth there i remain for the next six months to come and nothing of any sort whatever is to happen to me this is all arranged save that you are to come down and stay a day or two with me when you come to england there is alas to be no abroad for me this year i rejoice with you in your romebut my rome is in the buried past i spent however last june there and was less excruciated than i feared have you seen my old friend giuseppe primolia great friend in particular of the bourgets i dare say you have breakfasted deep with him may this find you perched on new conquests its vain to ask you to write me or tell me

may 11th 1895  my dear arthur b  a quelque chose malheur est bon my very natural failure to find you brought me your engaging letter strike but hear me i knew but too well that it would not seem felicitous to you that i should leave a mere card at your ravishing bower but please believe that i had no alternative i weighed the question of notifying you in advanceweighed it anxiously but the scale against it was pressed down by overwhelming considerations daudet is so unwell and fatigable and unable to walk or to mount steps or stairs he could do windsor castle only from the carriage that i didnt know he would pull through the excursion at alland i thought it unfair to inflict on you the awkward problem of his getting or not getting into your houseof his getting over to eton at alland of the five other members of his family being hurled upon you we had in fact only just time to catch our return train still i had a sneaking romantic hope of you i should have liked them hungry for the great show to behold you as i turned sadly from your adorable cottage and got back into the carriage a d said to mehaving waited contemplatively during my conference with your domestic ah si vous

itfor you had been peculiarly present to me all these last days in connection with my alternations of writing to you or not writing to you about the projected thursday at windsor i wanted to confine

the result of all sorts of more or less domestic and internal conditionsand what is most indicated on the whole as coming out of it is a vast new split or cleavage in american national feelingpolitics and partiesa split almost roughly speaking between the west and the east there are really two civilisations there side by sidein one yoke or rather one civilisation and a barbarism all the expressions of feeling i have received from the us since this hideous row have been intensely of course from the former it is on the whole the stronger force but only on condition of its fighting hard but i think it will fight hard meanwhile the whole thing sickens me that unfortunately however is not a reason for its not being obviously there its there all the while but let it not be any more here i mean in this scribblement my admiration of smalley is boundless and my appreciation and comfort and gratitude he has really done somethingand will do morefor peace and decency  i went yesterday to leightons funerala wonderful and slightly curious public demonstrationthe streets all cleared and lined with police the day magnificent his characteristic good fortune to the end and st pauls very fine to the eye and crammed with the whole london world the music was fine and severe but i thought wanting in volume and forcethin and meagre for the vast space but what do i know  no my dear norris i dont go abroadi go on may 1st into the depths somewhere of old england a response to that proposal i spoke to you of from rome is utterly impossible to me now ive two novels to write before i can dream of anything else and to go abroad is to plunge into the fiery furnace of people so either devonshire or some other place will be my six months lot i must take a house this timea small and cheap oneand i must deride me not be somewhere where i can without disaster bicycle also i must be a little nearer town than last year im afraid these things rather menace torquay but its soon to sayi must wait i shall decide in aprilor by midmarchonly meanwhile things will clear up im intensely thank heaven busy i will i think send you the little magazine tale over which i mean over whose number of wordsinfinite and awful i struggled so in sept and oct last under your pitying eye and with your sane and helpful advice it comes in to me this am  i hope your daughter is laying up treasure corporeal in ireland i like your dinnerseven i mean in the houses of the other hillpeople and i beg you to feel yourself clung to for ever by yours irrepressibly  henry james     to william james   point hill playden rye  july 24th 1896  my dear william  i wrote you at some length not very long since and my life has been here so peaceful that nothing has happened to me since save an incident terminated this ama charming little visit of 24 hours from wendell holmes who was in admirable youth spirits health and form and whose presence i greatly enjoyed he isor has beenhaving his usual social triumphs in london was as vivid and beautiful as ever about themalso seems to enjoy much this humble but picturesque little place and sails for the us on aug 22nd save that he seems to see you rarely and precariously he will carry you good news of me i have only five days more of point hill alasbut i have solved the problem of not returning on aug 1st to the stifling london we are having a summer of transcendent droughts and heatlike last only more so and not on the other hand sacrificing precious days to hunting up another refugesolved it by taking for two months the vicarage at rye which is shabby fustya sad drop from ph but close at hand to this 15 minutes walk and has much of the same picturesque view from a small terrace garden behinda garden to sit in and more or less as here to eat in and almost the same very moderate loyer it has also more room and more tumblers and saucepans and above all at a moment when i am intensely busy saves me a wasteful research so i shall be there from the 29th of this month till the last week in september the vicarage rye sussex is my address the place unfortunately isnt quite up to the pretty suggestion of the name but this little corner of the land endears itself to meand the peace of the country is a balm it is all about here most mild and mellow and loveabletoo relaxing but that is partly the exceptional summer i have been able every evening for three months to dine at 8 on my little terrace so the climate of england is literally not always to be sneezed at but the absence of rain threatens a waterfamine and the tub is a short allowance with chocorua let i am at a loss to place you all and only hope you are succeeding better in placing yourselves it would delight me to hear that alice is boarding somewhere with peggy and the afflicted infant whom i refuse to denominate tweedy i hope at any rate she is getting rest and refreshment of some sort there would be room for two or three of you at my vicaragei wish you were here to feel the repose of it may your summer be merciful and your lectures on ne peut plus suivies i say nothing about the political beargardeni fear i pusillanimously keep out of it i am well absit omen and interested in what i am inand i embrace you all ever your affectionate  henry     to edmumd gosse       the spoils of poynton under the title of the old things had      begun to appear in the atlantic monthly in april 1896   the vicarage rye  august 28th 1896  my dear edmund  dont think me a finished brute or a heartless fiend or a soulless one or any other unhappy thing with a happy name i have pressed your letter to my bosom again and again and if ive not sooner expressed to you how ive prized it the reason has simply been that for the last month there has been no congruity between my nature and my mannersbetween my affections and my lame right hand a crisis overtook me some three weeks ago from which i emerge only to hurl myself on this sheet of paper and consecrate it to you i will reserve detailssuffice it that in an evil hour i began to pay the penalty of having arranged to let a current serial begin when i was too little ahead of it and when it proved a much slower and more difficult job than i expected the printers and illustrators overtook and denounced me the fear of breaking down paralysed me the combination of rheumatism and fatigue rendered my hand and arm a tortureand the total situation made my existence a nightmare in which i answered not a single note letting correspondence go to smash in order barely to save my honour ive finished day before yesterday but i fear my honourwith youlies buried in the ruin of all the rest you will soon be coming home and this will meet or reach you god only knows when let it take you the assurance that the most lurid thing in my dreams has been the glitter of your sarcastic spectacles it was charming of you to write to me from dear little old devastated veveyas to which indeed you make me feel in a few vivid touches a faint nostalgic pang i dont want to think of you as still in your horrid iceworld for it is cold even here and i scribble by a morning fire and yet its in my interest to suppose you still feeling so all abroad that these embarrassed lines will have for you some of the charm of the bloated english post that makes me at the same time doubly conscious that ive nothing to tell you that you will most languish fornews of the world and the devilno throbs nor thrills from the great beating heart of the thick of things i went to town for a week on the 15th to be nearer the devouring maw into which i had to pour belated copy but i spent the whole time shut up in de vere gardens with an inkpot and a charwoman the only thing that befell me was that i dined one night at the savoy with f ortmans and the p bourgetsand that the said bourgetsbut two days in londondined with me one night at the grosvenor club but these occasions were not as rich in incident and emotion as poetic justice demandedand your vealfed table dhôte will have nourished your intelligence quite as much the only other thing i did was to read in the revue de paris of the 15th aug the wonderful article of a daudet on goncourts deatha little miracle of art adroitness demoniac tact and skill and taste so abysmal judged by our fishlike sense that there is no getting alongside of it at all but i grieve to say i cant send you the magazinei saw it only at a club doubtless you will have come across it i have this ugly house till the end of september and dont expect to move from rye even for a day till then the date of your return is vague to mebut if it should be early in the month i wonder if you couldnt come down for another sunday i fear you will be too blasé much for comfort my vicarage is distinctly superior to my eagles nestbut alas beauty isnt in it the peace and prettiness of the whole land here however has been good to me and i stay on with unabated relish but i stay in solitude i dont see a creature that too dreadful to relate i like you will have been living in a crowd and i expect you to return all garlanded and odorous with anecdote and reminiscence mrs nellys will all bear i trust on miraculous healings and feelings i feel far from all access to the french volume you recommend are you crawling over the dorn or only standing at the bottom to catch philip and lady edmund as they drop pardon my poverty and my paucity it is your absence that makes them yours my dear edmund not inconstantly  henry james     to jonathan sturges   34 de vere gardens w thursday nov 5 1896  my dear jonathan  i spill over this am in a certain amount of jubilationall the more that i have your little letter of the other day to thank you for one breathes i supposethe alarmed anxious prudent part of one but i dont feel that mckinley is the end of anythingleast of all of big provincial iniquities and abuses and bloody billionaires however hes more decent than the alternativeand your fortune will flow in more regularly and mine will permit me to say im delighted you accept and shall see that the cold mutton is not too much snowed under before you come only give me a fewthree or four if possibledays notice then we will talk of many thingsand among them of rudyard kiplings seven seas which he has just sent me and which i will send you tomorrow or next day kindly guard it on the assumption that you wont have seen it i am laid low by the absolutely uncanny talentthe prodigious special faculty of it its all violent without a dream of a nuance or a hint of distinction all prose trumpets and castanets and suchwith never a touch of the fiddlestring or a note of the nightingale but its magnificent and masterly in its way and full of the most insidious art hes a rum unand one of the very few first talents of the time theres a vilely idiotic reference to his coarseness in this ams chronicle the coarseness of the the mary gloster is absolutely one of the most triumphant values of that triumphant thing how lovely in these sweet days your haslemere hermitage must be i hope youve still the society of your young friendit eases the mind of your old one what you said about howells most truehe is very touching and i feel so remote from him the little red book is extremely charming write to me tout à vous  henry james     to w e norris   34 de vere gardens w dec 23rd 1896  my dear norris  i respond with joy to your suggestion in your beautiful letter of two days agothat i shall enable you to find a word from me on your table on the darkest a m of the year in the first place because i am much touched by your attaching to any word of mine any power to comfort or charm and in the second because i can well measureby my ownyour sense of a melancholy from which you must appeal it is indeed a lugubrious feast and a miserable merriment but it is something to spend the evil season by ones own poor hearthstone save that yours is opulent crouching over the embers and chuckling low over all the dreadful places where one is not ive been literally pressed to go to two or threeone of them in northumberland the cheek of some people and the reflection that i might be there and yet by heavens mercy am not does give a faint blush as of the rose to my otherwise deep depression it is a mild gray rainless sunless inoffensive sort of xmas hereand the shop fronts look rather prettily pink and green and golden in the dear dirty old london streetsand i have ventured into three or fourbut i do it bless you for nine and sevenpence halfpenny all told no wonder you want epistolary balm if youre already in the fifties do you give them diamond necklaces and arab horses all roundbut torquay i too intensely felt has gorgeous ways of its own really it isnt bad here for almost every one has left town i have yet had nothing worse to suffer than a first night at the lyceumthe too great irvingism of whichmainly in ellen terrys boxhad been the same day pleasantly mitigated in advance by tessa gosse in sheridans critic tessa had a play and acted mr puff better than any of her blushing fellownymphs acted anything else and on new years eve i go to her parents for a carouse of some sort and until then thank god i dont dine out save on xmas day nor in 1897by all thats holy ever again i have been quite smothered with it these two monthsand its getting far beyond a joke i see no literary fry and languish in incorrigible obscurity i had a fevered dream that the other house might reach a second editionbut it declines to do anything of the sort and the paupers grave continues to yawn neverthelessas it is assured any wayi may go to italy on april 1st meanwhile my dear norris i think of you with a degree of envy which even the manners of topper scarce avail to diminishi mean because you have a beautiful home and are so many miles nearer than i am to nature you are also nearer to miss norris and that is another advantage even though it does make a hole in £50 i have nothing better to offer her on xmas am than the very friendly handshake of yours and hers my dear norris affectionately and always  henry james     to arthur christopher benson   34 de vere gardens w december 28th 1896  my dear arthur  your generous letter has this wild mild soft sombre morning made me feel as if i were standing beside you with my hand on your shoulder in an embrasure of one of the windowsat that fine old farnham castle that i have seen years agothat look out on the noble things you speak of and the communication in question is worthy exactly of the things in question and grave and handsome and interesting and touching even as they are burn it quothait wouldnt have burnt i would have you know it would have flown straight up the chimney and taken unscathed as marble its invulnerable way to the individual for whom it had just been so admirably winged you say to me exactly the right things and you say them to exactly the right person i cant tell you how glad i am for you that you have all that highest sanity and soundness though it isnt as if i doubted it of emotion full frank and deep if there be a wisdom in not feelingto the last throbthe great things that happen to us it is a wisdom i shall never either know or esteem let your soul liveits the only life that isnt on the whole a sell you have evidently been magnificent and as i have my hand on your shoulder i take the opportunity of patting you very tenderly on the back that back will evidently carry its load and be all the straighter for theas it seems to mereally quite massive experience i rejoice that the waters have held you upthey do always i think when they are only deep enough and all your missings and memories and contrasts and tendernesses are a partthe essenceof the very force that is in you to live and to feel againand yet again and again when at last to have so felt will be the thing in the world youll be gladdest to have done  i dont know in spite of your compliment whether i am much like gray save in the devil of a time it takes me to do a thing what keeps me incommunicative however is not indifference but almost a kind of suspense a fear to breakby speakingthe spell of some other spectacleother than that of my own fonctionnement but i respond to the lightest touch of a friendly hand i think i may say and i havent the slightest fear of breaking any spell in sayingto youthat i seem to myself just now absit omen to fonctionner pretty well i am as occupied and preoccupied with work as even my technical temper can desire and out of it something not irremediably nauseating will not improbably spring i never had more intentionswhat do i saymore ferocities i am sitting in my boat and my oars rhythmically creak in short i propose to win my little battleand even believe more than hitherto that i may annex my little province it will be as small as the grand duchy of pumpernickelbut there will be room to put up a friend therefore you must come and stay with me there in fact i give you rendezvous on the battlefield itself the moment the day is declared i mix my metaphorsbut it all means that its all a fight and that the only thing that changes is our fighting train let us then fight side by side never too far out of sight  how i congratulate you on the value of your friends i mean the particular davidsons i dont know them but i like them for liking you i think i have a strong sense too of the beauty and charm of many of the conditions in which you are engaged and which have a really decorative effectso that the aesthetic sense too is pleasedon everything that makes you minister to the confidence my dear arthur of yours very constantly  henry james     to the viscountess wolseley       the reference in the following letter is to a visit paid by h j      with lady wolseley to the elaborately beautiful old house of the      late c e kempe the wellknown artist of churchdecoration at      lindfield sussex   dictated  34 de vere gardens w 8th march 1897  dear lady wolseley  i was so deprived yesterday for all those beautiful hours of a word with you away from our host that i felt as if i didnt say to you a tenth of what i wanted which however will make it all the better for our next meetingwhen i shall overflow like a river fed by melting snows let these few words therefore not anticipate the delugelet them only express to you afresh my grateful sense of the interest and success of our excursion the whole wonder of it was the greater through my wholly unprepared state my antecedent inward blankwhich blank is now overscored with images and emotions as thick as any page of any of your hospitable housebooks ever was with visitors names the man himself made the place more wonderful and the place the man i was greatly affected by his courtesy and charm and i got afterwards in the evening a little of the light that i couldnt snatch from you under his nose what struck me most about the whole thing was the consummate cleverness that was the note it sounded for me more than any one of the notes more imposing more deep that an artistic creation may throw out dont for the worldand for my ruinever breathe to him i have said it but the whole thing and his taste are far too germanic too teutonic a business to make a medium in which i could ever sink down in final peace or take as the domestic and decorative last word the element of france and italy are too much out of itand they to me are the real secret of style but we will talk of these thingsheaven speed the day do have a little of france and a great deal of italy at south wraxall but do have also a great deal of the cunning kempe and of the candidtoo candidcompanion of your pilgrimage dont imagine the companion didnt have a most sweet and glorious dayfrom which the light even in london dusk again has not yet wholly faded i hope your security was complete to the end and i am in earnest hope also of a speedy reunion yours dear lady wolseley more gratefully if possible than ever  henry james     to miss frances r morse       h js admiration for st gaudenss memorial to col r g shaw      when he afterwards saw it at boston found expression it will be      remembered in the american scene   dictated  34 de vere gardens w june 7th 1897  my dear fanny  i have as usual endless unacknowledged benefits to thank you for after too many days the last is your letter of the end of march full of interesting substance as always and of things that no one else has the imagination or the inspiration to tell me my allusion to the imagination there is not believe me an imputation on your exactitude the light of truth of good solid vivid boston truth shines in each of your pages especially are you interesting and welcome as i have told you before i think on the young generations and fullblown though new existences that are in possession of a scene i knew as otherwise occupied all the old namesor most of themappear to be represented by the remote posterity of my old acquaintance in this remote posterity however i take an interestand scraps and specimens of it even here occasionally flash past me  i have stayed on in town later than for some years past and though i had at the end of march all my plans made to go to italy have put it off till so late that in a few days i shall have to be content with simply crossing to paris and seeing then what is to be further done london is given up to carpenters and seatmongersbeing prepared on an enormous scale and a rather unsightly way for the circus of the 22nd the circus is already amid the bare benches and the mere bousculade of the preparations a thing to fly fromin spite of the good young george vanderbilts having offered me an ample share of a beautiful balcony in pall mall to see it from i shall spend the next few weeks in some place or places north of the alps as yet utterly undefined and be back in england before the summer is over the voice of venice all this time has called very loud but it has been drowned a good deal in the click of the typewriter to which i dictate and which some months ago crept into my existence through the crevice of a lame hand and now occupies in it a place too big to be left vacant for long periods of hotel and railway life all this time i am not coming to the great point which is my hope that you may have been able to be present i believe with all my heart of course you were at the revelation of the shaw memorial in charity my dear fanny if this be the case do write me a frank word about it i heard from william and alice more or less on the eve but i fear they will have afterwardsjust now be havingtoo much to do to be able to send me many echoes i daresay that you will for that matter already have sent me one i receive as it happens only this morning a copy of harpers weekly with a big reproduction of st gaudenss basrelief which strikes me as extraordinarily beautiful and noble how i rejoice that something really fine is to stand there forever for r g sand for all the rest of them this thing of st gs strikes me as a real perfection and i have appealed to william to send me the finest and biggest photograph of it that can be foundfor such surely have been taken how your spiritual lungs must over it all have filled themselves with the air of the old wartime even herei mean simply in the depths of ones own beingi myself for an hour seem to breathe it again but the strange thing is that however much in memory and imagination it may live for one again with all its dim figures and ghosts and reverberations and emotions it appears to belong yet to some far away other world and state of being i talked of this the other day with sara darwin whose memories are so much identical with my own and it was a relief to do soin the absence of all other communications that absence produced by the upgrowth since of a whole generation which began after the end and for which the whole history is as alien as the battles of alexander but i am writing you a long letter when i only meant to wave you a hand of greeting and gratitude correspondence is rather heavy to me for i can tackle it only in the margin of time left over after the other matters that my machine has to grind i hope your summer promises and in the midst of a peculiar degree at the present moment of smoky london stuffiness i envy youfor i see you in the minds eye at beverlythe element of wide verandahs cut peachesi mean peaches and cream you knowwhite frocks and atlantic airs you make me my dear fanny in these high lights quite incredibly homesick yours very constantly  henry james     to mrs george hunter       instead of going abroad for the summer as he had proposed h j      went first to bournemouth and from there to join his cousin mrs      george hunter and her daughters at dunwich near saxmundham   bath hotel bournemouth saturday july 3 1897  dearest elly  it is an immense satisfaction to get your newsand no figure of speech to say that it has found me literally on the point of reaching out for it into the thick twilight of your whereabouts i have had my general silence much on my conscienceand especially my dumbness and darkness to rosina and bay for whom my movements must have been enveloped in a perfidious mystery that has caused me i fear to forfeit all their esteem but let me tell you first of all how i rejoice in your good conditions and in your having found your feet it was borne in upon me on general grounds that southwold would never do for long and it is charming that you have found so near and so nice a substitute i especially delight without wanting to sacrifice the rest of you in such a lettingdowneasy of the artdaughters please give them my tender love and tell them that preposterous as it sounds i have never all this time and in spite of the rosiest asseverations crossed the channel at all the nearest i have come to it is to have early last month come down here to the edge of the sea and collapsed into the peace and obscurity of this convenient corner long familiar to me which having a winter season is practically empty at present i will tell r and b when i see them just how it was that i happened to be so falseit is too long a story now suffice it that my reasons for continuing to hug this fat country were overwhelming and my regrets at not tasting of their brave bohemia of the sharpest moreover alls well that ends well if i had gone abroad i should be abroad now and the rest of the summer and therefore unable to join you on your suffolk shoreor at least alight upon you therewhich is what i shall be enchanted to do you describe a little paradisehouris and all and i beseech you to keep a divan for me there the only thing is that i fear i shant be able to come till toward the endor by the endof the month i have more or less engaged myself to a pair of friends who are coming down here next week for mystrange as it may seemsweet sake to remain on this spot till toward the 25th but i will come then and stay as long as you will let me if you can bespeak any quarters for me at the inn in advance i will take it very kindly of you can they give me a little sittingroom as well as a bedroom if you can achieve any effective word illegible at them to do so i shall be very grateful i always need some small literary bower other than the british bedroomand in this case i would of course meal there as that makes them always more zealous i dont know the east coast to speak of at alland i can imagine no more winsome introduction to it i quite yearn to commune with the young parisians bravo mcmonnies bravo everybodyespecially grenville how i shall joy to frolic with him in the sand have they seenthe artdaughtersthe image of the st gaudens shaw it is altogether great williams oration was a firstclass success i encircle you all and will write again  ever my dear elly so constantly yours  henry james  ps the oddest trio of coincidences yesterday afternoon i was reading the delightful letters of that peculiarly suffolk genius of woodbridge edward fitzgerald omar khayyam and just finishing a story in one of them about his relations with a boatman of saxmundham a nameseen for the first timethat struck meby its strangeness and handsomeness laid down the book and went a long walkfive miles along this coast to where in a very picturesque and lonely spot i met a seafaring man with whom i fraternised  do you belong to this place  oh no ive been here five years but i come from the suffolk coastsaxmundham  did you know mr fitzgerald  know him my brother was his boatmanand he tells me the story then i walk home and coming in find your letter on my table i tear it open and the first word i see in itin your dateis saxmundham tableau it never rains but it pours     to edward warren       on returning from dunwichit was there that he had been bicycling      with mr warrenh j heard that lamb house which he had seen and      admired at rye the year before was unexpectedly vacant he at once      appealed to mr warren for professional advice with regard to the      condition of the house and as this proved satisfactory secured it      without delay   dictated  34 de vere gardens w 15th september 1897  my dear edward  very kindly read for me the enclosedwhich throws an odd coincidental light on the very house we talked of day before yesterday or was it yesterday as we bumped and bounced and vainly shifted sides the place in question is none other than the mansion with the gardenhouse perched on the wall and though to be fairly confronted with the possibility and so brought to the point is a little like a blow in the stomach what i am minded to say to you is that perhaps you may have a chance to tell me on friday that you will be able to take some day next week to give me the pleasure of going down there with me for a look i feel as if i couldnt think on the subject at all without seeing itthe subjectagain and there would be no such seeing it as seeing it in your company perhaps i shall have speech of you long enough on friday to enable us to settle a day i should be capable of monday i hope you slid gently home and are fairly on all foursthat is on hands and feetagain what a day we should have had again alsoi mean this oneif we had kept it up but basta cosìit does beautifully for your journey a thousand friendships to margaret always yours  henry james     to arthur christopher benson       the following refers to a manuscript diary of mr bensons and to      the privately printed letters and journals of william cory      author of ionica   34 de vere gardens w september 25th 1897  my dear arthur  send me by all means the diary to which you so kindly alludenothing could give me greater pleasure than to feel i might freelyand yet so responsiblyhandle it i hope it contains a record of your hawarden talkof which you speak  i shall be very glad indeed of a talk with you about w corymy impression of whom on the book you deepenwhenever anything so utterly unlikely as articulate speech between us miraculously comes to passi am just drawing a long breath from having signeda few moments sincea most portentous parchment the lease of a smallish charming cheap old house in the countrydown at ryefor 21 years one would think i was your age but it is exactly what i want and secretly and hopelessly coveted since knowing it without dreaming it would ever fall but it has fallenand has a beautiful room for you the kings roomgeorge iiswho slept there together with every promise of yielding me an indispensable retreat from may to october i hope you are not more sorry to take up the load of life that awaits these days the hunch of ones shoulders than i am youll ask me what i mean by life come down to lamb house and ill tell you and open the private page my dear arthur to yours very eagerly  henry james     to mrs william james   dictated  34 de vere gardens w 1st december 1897  dearest alice  its too hideous and horrible this long time that i have not written you and that your last beautiful letter placed for reminder well within sight has converted all my emotion on the subject into a constant chronic blush the reason has been that i have been driving very hard for another purpose this inestimable aid to expression and that as i have a greater loathing than ever for the mere manual act i havent on the one side seen my way to inflict on you a written letter or on the other had the virtue to divert till i should have finished my little book to another stream any of the valued and expensive industry of my amanuensis i have at last finished my little bookthat is a little book and so have two or three mornings of breathingtime before i begin another le plus clair of this small interval i consecrate to thee  i am settled in london these several weeks and making the most of that part of the london yearthe mild quiet grey stretch from the midoctober to christmasthat i always find the pleasantest with the single defect of its only not being long enough we are having moreover a most creditable autumn no cold to speak of and almost no rain and a morningroom window at which this december 1st i sit with my scribe admitting a radiance as adequate as that in which you must be actually bathed and probably more mildly golden i have no positive plan save that of just ticking the winter swiftly away on this most secure basis there are however little doors ajar into a possible brief absence i fear i have just closed one of them rather ungraciously indeed in pleading a non possumus to a most genial invitation from john hay to accompany him and his family shortly after the new year upon a run to egypt and a month up the nile he having a boat for that samei mean for the nile partin which he offers me the said months entertainment it is a very charming opportunity and i almost blush at not coming up to the scratch especially as i shall probably never have the like again but it isnt so simple as it sounds one has on ones hands the journey to cairo and back with whatever seeing and doing by the way two or three irresistible other things to which one would feel one might never again be so near would amount to i mean of course then or never on the return athens corfu sicily the neverseen etc etc it would all amount to too much this year by reason of a particular little complicationmost pleasant in itself i hasten to addthat i havent all this time mentioned to you dont be scaredi havent accepted an offer i have only taken a couple of months ago a little old house in the countryfor the rest of my dayson which this winter though it is for such a commodity in exceptionally good condition i shall have to spend money enough to make me quite concentrate my resources the little old house you will at no distant day i hope see for yourself and inhabit and even i trust temporarily and gratuitously possessfor half the fun of it in the coming years will be occasionally to lend it to you i marked it for my own two years ago at ryeso perfectly did it the first instant i beheld it offer the solution of my longunassuaged desire for a calm retreat between may and november it is the very calmest and yet cheerfullest that i could have dreamedin the little old cobblestoned grassgrown redroofed town on the summit of its mildly pyramidal hill and close to its noble old churchthe chimes of which will sound sweet in my goodly old redwalled garden  the little place is so rural and tranquil and yet discreetly animated that its being within the town is for convenience and immediate accessibility purely to the good and the house itself though modest and unelaborate full of a charming little stamp and dignity of its period about 1705 without as well as within the next time i go down to see to its doing up i will try to have a photograph taken of the pleasant little oldworld townangle into which its nice old redbricked front its high old georgian doorway and a most delightful little old architectural gardenhouse perched alongside of it on its high brick gardenwallinto which all these pleasant features together so happily compose two years ago after i had lost my heart to itwalking over from point hill to make sheeps eyes at it the more so that it is called lamb housethere was no appearance whatever that one could ever have it either that its fond proprietor would give it up or that if he did it would come at all within ones means so i simply sighed and renounced tried to think no more about it till at last out of the blue a note from the good local ironmonger to whom i had whispered at the time my hopeless passion informed me that by the sudden death of the owner and the preference literal of his son for klondyke it might perhaps drop into my lap well to make a long story short it did immediately drop and more miraculous still to say on terms for a long lease well within ones meansterms quite deliciously moderate the result of these is naturally that they will do nothing to it but on the other hand it has been so well lived in and taken care of that the doingoff ones own batis reduced mainly to sanitation and furnishingwhich latter includes the peeling off of old papers from several roomfuls of pleasant old toptotoe wood panelling there are two rooms of complete old oakone of them a delightful little parlour opening by one side into the little vista churchward of the small oldworld street where not one of the halfdozen wheeled vehicles of rye ever passes and on the other straight into the garden and the approach from that quarter to the gardenhouse aforesaid which is simply the making of a most commodious and picturesque detached study and workroom ten days ago alfred parsons best of men as well as best of landscapepaintersandgardeners went down with me and revealed to me the most charming possibilities for the treatment of the tiny outofdoor partit amounts to about an acre of garden and lawn all shut in by the peaceful old red wall aforesaid on which the most flourishing old espaliers apricots pears plums and figs assiduously grow it appears that its a glorious little growing exposure air and soiland all the things that were still flourishing out of doors november 20th were a joy to behold there went with me also a good friend of mine edward warren a very distingué architect and loyal spirit who is taking charge of whatever is to be done so i hope to get in comfortably enough early in may in the meantime one must pick up a sufficient quantity of ancient mahoganyandbrass odds and endsa task really the more amusing here where the resources are great for having to be thriftily and cannily performed the house is really quite charming enough in its particular character and as to the stamp of its period not to do violence to by rash modernities and i am developing under its influence and its inspiration the most avid and gluttonous eye and most infernal watching patience in respect of lurking occasions in not toodelusive chippendale and sheraton the kings room will be especially treated with a preoccupation of the comfort and aesthetic sense of cherished sistersinlaw kings room socalled by reason of george second having passed a couple of nights there and so stamped it for ever he was forced ashore at rye on a progress somewhere with some of his ships by a tempest and accommodated at lamb house as at the place in the town then most consonant with his grandeur it would for that matter quite correspond to this description still likewise the mayors of rye have usually lived there or the persons usually living there have usually become mayors that was conspicuously the case with the late handsome old mr bellingham whose son is my landlord so you see the ineluctable dignity in store for me but enough of this swagger i have been copious to copiously amuse you  your beautiful letter which i have just read over again is full of interest about you all causing me special joy as to what it says of williams present and prospective easier conditions of work relinquishment of laboratory refusal of outside lectures etc and of the general fine performance and promise all round of the children what you say of each makes me want to see that particular one most i had a very great pleasure the other day in a visit far too shortonly six hoursfrom dear old howells who did me a lot of good in an illuminating professional ie commercial way and came in fact at quite a psychological moment i hope you may happen to see him soon enough to get from him also some echo of mesuch as it may be but my dear alice i must be less interminable please tell william that i have two syracuse advices as yet gracelessly unacknowledgedi mean to himto thank him for its a joy to find these particular months less barren than they used to be i embrace you tenderly all round and am yours very constantly  henry james     to miss grace norton   dictated  34 de vere gardens w christmas day 1897  my dear grace  is it really a year i have been acutely conscious of its getting to be a horrible time but it hadnt come home to me that it was taking on quite that insolence well you see what the yearssince years il y aare making of me i dont write to you for a hideous age and then when at last i do i take the romantic occasion of this particular day to write in this unsympathetic ink but that is exactly what as i say the horrid time has made of me the use of my hand always difficult has become impossible to me and since i am reduced to dictation this form of dictation is the best may its distinctness make up for its indirectness  i dare say that from time to time you hear something of me from william and you know by that flickering light that my life has had for a long time past a very jogtrot sort of rhythm i have ceased completely to travel it is going on into four years since i have crossed the channel and the day is not yet this will give you a ghastly sense of the insular object that i must have become however i shall break out yet perhaps and surprise you meanwhile none the less i was unable these last days to break the spell of immobility even to the extent of going over to paris to poor daudets funeral i felt that làbasby which i mean in the immediate housea certain expectation rested on me but i looked it straight in the face and cynically budged not i dislike more and more the terrific organized exploitation in paris on the occasion of death and burial of every kind of personal privacy and every kind of personal hysterics it is newspaperism and professionalism gone madin a way all its own and i felt as if i should go mad if i even once more let alone twenty times more heard daudet personally compared more especially facially compared eyeglass and all to jesus christ not a french notice of him that i have seen but has plumped it coquettishly out i had not seen him thanks to my extreme recalcitrance since the month he spent more than two years ago in london his death was not unhappywas indeed too long delayed for all his later time has been sadly by disease borne with wonderful patience and subtlety blighted and sterilized yet it is a wonderful proof of what a success his life had been that it had remained a success in spite of that it was the most worked thing that ever wasi mean his whole career his talent was so great that i feel as to his work that the best of it will quite intensely remain but he was a queer combination of a great talent with an absence of the greater mind as it werethe greater feeling  well my dear grace i cant tell you the comfort and charm it is to be talking with you even by this horrid machinery and to squeeze the little round golden orange of your note dry of every testimony to your honoured tranquillity that i can gouge out of it my metaphors are mixed but my fidelity is pure how is the mighty montaigne i dont read him a millionth part as much as i ought for of all the horrors of london almost the worst horror is the way it conspires against the evening book under the evening lamp i dont go outand yet far too much of the time i am out the main part of the rest i devote to wondering how i got there a propos of which as much as anything do you read maurice barrès if you do his last thing les déracinés is very curious and serious but a gruesome picture of young france if it didnt sound british and pharisaic i would almost risk saying that on all the more and more showing young and old france both seem to me to be in a strange state of moral and intellectual decomposition but this isnt worth saying without going into the detail of the evidenceand that would take me too far then there is leslie stephen and the little kiplings leslie seems to be outweathering his woes in the most extraordinary way his health is literally better than it was in his wifes lifetime and is perhaps more almost than anything else a proof of what a lifepreserver in even the wildest waves is the perfect possession of a métier his admirable habit and knowledge of work have saved him rudyard and his wife and offspring depart presently for south africa they have settled upon a small propriété at rottingdean near the burnejoness and the south africa is but a parenthetic family picnic it would do as well as anything else perhaps if one still felt as one used to that everything is grist to his mill i dont however think that everything is as the affair is turning out at all i mean as to the general complexity of life his ballad future may still be big but my view of his prose future has much shrunken in the light of ones increasingly observing how little of life he can make use of almost nothing civilised save steam and patriotismand the latter only in verse where i hate it so especially mixed up with god and goodness that that half spoils my enjoyment of his great talent almost nothing of the complicated soul or of the female form or of any question of shadeswhich latter constitute to my sense the real formative literary discipline in his earliest time i thought he perhaps contained the seeds of an english balzac but i have quite given that up in proportion as he has come steadily from the less simple in subject to the more simplefrom the angloindians to the natives from the natives to the tommies from the tommies to the quadrupeds from the quadrupeds to the fish and from the fish to the engines and screws  goodbye my dear grace believe that through all fallacious appearances of ebb and flow of sound and silence of presence and absence i am always constantly yours  henry james     v  rye  18981903   the first five years that henry james spent at rye were the least eventful and the most serenely occupied of his life even at the height of his london activities he had always clung fast to his daily work and now that his whole time was his own free from all interruptions save those invited by his own hospitality he lived in his writing with a greater concentration than ever before his letters shew indeed that he could still be haunted occasionally by the thought of the silence with which his books were received by the public at largean indifference it must be said which he was always inclined to exaggerate but these misgivings were superficial in comparison with the deep joy of surrender to his own genius now at the climax of its power he was satisfied at length with his mastery of his instrument he knew perfectly what he wished to do and knew that he could do it and the long mornings of summer in the pleasant old gardenroom of lamb house or of winter in his small southern study indoors were perhaps the best the most intimately contenting hours he had ever passed he was now confirmed in the habit of dictation and never again wrote his books with his own hand except under special stress at rye or in london his secretary would be installed at the typewriter by ten oclock in the morning and for three or four hours he would pace the room pausing hesitating gradually massing and controlling the stream of his imagination till at a favouring moment it rolled forward without a check so in these five years the most characteristic works of his later maturity were produced they began with the awkward age the sacred fount and many short stories presently collected in the soft side and the better sort and they culminated still within the limit of this short period with the great triad of novels that were to crown the long tale of his fictionthe ambassadors the wings of the dove the golden bowl  with his life at rye too his correspondence with his family and his friends began to spread out in an amplitude of which the following selection can give at the best a very imperfect idea the rich apologies for silence and backwardness that preface so many of his letters must be interpreted in the light partly indeed of his natural luxuriance of phraseology but much more of his generous conception of the humblest correspondents claim on him for response he could not answer a brief note of friendliness but with pages of abounding eloquence he never dealt in the mere small change of intercourse the postcard and the halfsheet did not exist for him a few lines of enquiry would bring from him a bulging packet of manuscript overwhelming in its disproportion no wonder that with this standard of the meaning of a letter he often groaned under his postal burden he discharged himself of it in general very late at night the mornings work left him too much exhausted for more composition until then at midnight he would sit down to his letterwriting and cover sheet after sheet sometimes for hours with his dashing and not very readable script occasionally he would give up a day to the working off of arrears by dictation seldom omitting to excuse himself to each correspondent in turn for the infliction of the fierce legibility of type the number of his letters was in fact enormous and even within the limits of the present selection they form a picture of his life at rye to which there is little to add  he had intended lamb house to be a retreat from the pressure of the world but it need hardly be said that from the first it was thrown open to his friends with hospitable freedom in the matter of entertainment his standard again was munificently high and the consequences it entailed were sometimes weightier than he found to his liking but once more it is necessary to read his laments over his violated hermitage with many reserves lonely as he was in his work he was not made for any other kind of solitude he needed companionship and soon missed it when it was withdrawn after a few experiments he discovered that the isolation of the winter at rye by no means agreed with him for the short days and long evenings he preferred pall mall where after letting his flat in kensington he engaged a permanent lodging at the reform club he could thus divide the year as he chose between london and rye and the arrangement was so much to his liking that in five years he made only one long absence from home in 1899 he returned again to italy for the summer paying a visit on the way to m and mme bourget at hyères at rome many associations were recalled for him by a suggestion that he should write the life of william wetmore story his friend and host of twenty years beforea suggestion carried out somewhat later in a book filled as he said with the old roman golddust of the seventies he brought back new impressions also from a visit to mrs humphry ward at castel gandolfowhere she and her family were spending some weeks at the villa barberini on the ridge between the roman campagna and the alban lakeand another to marion crawford at sorrento he stayed briefly at florence and venice and returned home to find a special reason awaiting him for renewed application to work he had taken lamb house on a lease but the death of its owner now made it necessary to decide whether he should purchase it outright he paid the price without hesitation he was by this time deeply attached to the place and he seized the chance of making it his own the earnings of his work would not go far towards paying for it but he felt it all the more urgent to concentrate upon production for some time to come he did not leave england again till four years later nor his own roof for more than a few days now and then  by far the greatest of all his interests outside his work was the opportunity he now had of seeing more than hitherto of his elder brother and his household in the autumn of 1899 professor and mrs william james came to europe for a visit of two years and during that time the brothers were together in london or at lamb house as often as possible unfortunately it was the state of his health that had made a long holiday desirable for william james and most of the time had to be spent by him in a southern climate in italy or on the riviera nevertheless it was a deep delight to the younger brother to feel able to share the life of the elder at nearer range they were curiously unlike in their whole cast of mind nothing could have been further from henry jamess massive and ruminatory imagination than his brothers quickfooted freelyranging experimental genius but their devotion to each other grew only the closer as their intellectual lives diverged and as they approached old age together there was still something protective in william jamess attitude and in henry something that appealed to his brother and to his brother only for moral support and reassurance the next generation moreover were by this time growing up and were beginning to take a place in henry jamess life that was a source of everincreasing pride and pleasure to him from now onward there was nothing he so welcomed as the recurring visits to lamb house of one or other of his elder brothers children william james was again in europe in 1902 delivering at edinburgh the lectures that presently appeared as the varieties of religious experience  it was now all but twenty years since henry had last seen america and the desire once more to visit his country began to stir obscurely in his mind the idea was long pondered and circuitously approached but it will be seen from one of the following letters that it had become definite in 1903 long absence had made a return seem a formidable adventure and it was not in his nature to undertake it without many scruples and debates in the midst of these his mind was gradually made up and the journey determined upon for 1904     to w d howells   34 de vere gardens w january 28th 1898  my dear howells  too long too long have i delayed to thank you for your last good letter yet if ive been thus guilty the faultas it were the deep responsibilityis largely your own it all comes from that wonderful and stillinmyears reverberating little talk we had that morning here in the soft lap and under the motherly apron of the dear old muffling fogwhich will have kept every one else from hearing everand only let me hear and have been heard i mean that the effect of your admirable counsel and comfort was from that moment to give me the sense of being somehow suddenly preposterously renewingly and refreshingly at a kind of practical high pressure which haswell which has simply my dear howells made all the difference there it is it is the absurd dizzy consciousness of this difference that has constituted failing other things an exciting absorbing feeling of occupation and preoccupationand thereby paralysed the mere personal activity of my pen  i hope you have by this time roaredand not wholly with rage and despairthrough the tunnel of your dark consciousness of return i dare say you are now quite out on the flowery meads of almost doubting of having been away this makes me fear your promise to come backright soonnext summermay even now have developed an element of base alloy i rushed off to see mrs harland the instant i heard she was back and got hold of youand of mildredfor five minutes and of all the handsomest parts of both of you in her talk she had left a dying mother however and her general situation has i fear its pressure and pinch what an interest indeed your boys outlook must be to you but as you sayseeing them commence well they never commenced before and the pain is all in usnot out of us the thing is to keep it in but this scrawlor sprawlis about all my poor hand can now sustainedly perpetrate if i continue i shall have to clamour for a mounta liftmy brave boy of the alphabetic hoofs but i spare you those caracoles i greet you each again affectionately and am yours my dear howells intensely  henry james     to arthur christopher benson       the origin of the turn of the screw in an anecdote told him by      archbishop benson is described in the preface that h j wrote for      it when it appeared in the collected edition of his works   34 de vere gardens w march 11th 1898  my dear arthur  i suppose that in the mysterious scheme of providence and fate such an inspiration as your charming noteout of the blueof a couple of days ago is intended somehow to make up to me for the terror with which my earlierin fact all my pastproductions inspire me and for the insurmountable aversion i feel to looking at them again or to considering them in any way this morbid state of mind is really a blessing in disguisefor it has for happy consequences that such an incident as your letter becomes thereby extravagantly pleasant and gives me a genial glow all thanks and benedictionsi shake your hand very hardor would do so if i could attribute to you anything so palpable personal and actual as a hand yet i shall never write a sequel to the p of an ladmire my euphonic indefinite article its all too faint and far awaytoo ghostly and ghastlyand i have bloodier things en tête i can do better than that  but à propos precisely of the ghostly and ghastly i have a little confession to make to you that has been on my conscience these three months and that i hope will excite in your generous breast nothing but tender memories and friendly sympathies  on one of those two memorablenever to be obliteratedwinter nights that i spent at the sweet addington your father in the drawingroom by the fire where we were talking a little in the spirit of recreation of such things repeated to me the few meagre elements of a small and gruesome spectral story that had been told him years before and that he could only give the dimmest account ofpartly because he had forgotten details and partlyand much morebecause there had been no details and no coherency in the tale as he received it from a person who also but half knew it the vaguest essence only was theresome dead servants and some children this essence struck me and i made a note of it of a most scrappy kind on going home there the note remained till this autumn when struck with it afresh i wrought it into a fantastic fiction which first intended to be of the briefest finally became a thing of some length and is now being serialised in an american periodical it will appear late in the spring chez heinemann in a volume with one other story and then i will send it to you in the meanwhile please think of the doing of the thing on my part as having sprung from that kind old evening at addingtonquite gruesomely as my unbridled imagination caused me to see the inevitable development of the subject it was all worth mentioning to you i am very busy and very decently fit and very much yours always my dear arthur  henry james     to william james       the following letter was written immediately before the outbreak of      war between spain and the united states   dictated  34 de vere gardens w 20 april 1898  my dear william  there are all sorts of intimes and confidential things i want to say to you in acknowledgment of your so deeply interesting letterof april 10threceived yesterday but i must break the back of my response at least with this mechanical energy not having much of any otherby which i mean simply too many odd momentsat my disposal just now i do answer you alas almost to the foul music of the cannon it is this morning precisely that one feels the fat to be at last fairly in the fire i confess that the blaze about to come leaves me woefully cold thrilling with no glorious thrill or holy bloodthirst whatever i see nothing but the madness the passion the hideous clumsiness of rage of mechanical reverberation and i echo with all my heart your denouncement of the foul criminality of the screeching newspapers they have long since become for me the danger that overtops all others that became clear to one even here two years ago in the venezuela time when one felt that with a week of simple enforced silence everything could be saved if things were then saved without it it is simply that they hadnt at that time got so bad as they are now in the us my sympathy with you all is intensethe whole horror must so mix itself with all your consciousness i am near enough to hate it without being as you are near enough in some degree perhaps to understand i am leading at present so quiet a life that i dont measure much the sentiment the general attitude around me much of it cant possibly help being spanishand from the european standpoint in general spain must appear savagely assaulted she is so quietpublicly and politicallyso decent and picturesque and harmless a member of the european family that i am bound to say it argues an extraordinary illumination and a very predetermined radicalism not to admire her pluck and pride but publicly of course england will do nothing whatever that is not more or lessnegativelyfor our benefit i scarcely know what the newspapers saybeyond the times which i look at all for smalleys cables so systematic is my moral and intellectual need of ignoring them one must save ones life if one can the next weeks will however in this particular probably not a little break me down i must at least read the bombardment of boston may you but scantly suffer from it  i rejoice with intense rejoicing in everything you tell me of your own situation plans arrangements honours prospectsinto all of which i enter with an intimacy of participation your election to the institut has for me a surpassing charmi simply revel and as it were wallow in it je my vautre but oh if it could only have come soon enough for poor alice to have known itsuch a happy little nip as it would have given her or for the dear old susceptible dad but things come as they canand i am in general lost in the daily miracle of their coming at all i mean so many of themfew as that many may be and i speak above all for myself i am lost moreover just now in the wonder of what effect on american affairs of every kind the shock of battle will have luckily its of my naturethough not of my pocketalways to be prepared for the worst and to expect the least like you with all my heart i have finance on the brain at least i try to have itwith a woeful lack of natural talent for the same it is none too soon but one arrives at dates periods corners of ones life great changes deep operations are begotten this has more portée than i can fully go into i shall certainly do my best to let my flat when i am ready to leave town the difficulty this year however will be that the time for season letting begins now and that i cant depart for at least another month things are not ready at rye and wont be till then with the limited local energy at work that i have very wisely contented myself with turning on there it has been the right and much the best way in the long run and for ones good little relations there only the run has been a little longer the remnant of the season here may be difficult to dispose ofto a sublessee and my booksonly a part of which i can house at ryeare a complication however i shall do what i can this year and for subsequent absences so long as my present lease of de vere gardens runs i shall have the matter on a smooth organised working basis i mean to arrange myself always to letbeing as such places go distinctly lettable and for my declining years i have already put my name down for one of the invaluable southlooking carltongardenssweeping bedrooms at the reform club which are let by the year and are of admirable and convenient with all the other resources of the place at ones elbow general habitability the only thing is they are so in demand that one has sometimes a long time to await ones turn on the other hand there are accidentsoccasions  i embrace you allalice longer than the restand amwith much actuality of emotion ever your

paddle again over to rye to minister to my anxieties you both assuage and encourage thembut with the right thing for each i am content enough with the bathroombut hopeless about the garden which i dont know what to do with and shall never never know i am densely ignorantonly just barely know dahlias from mignonetteand shall never be able to work it in any way so i shant trybut remain

castled steep with tender compassion i scarce flatter myself you will in the hereafter again haunt the neighbourhood but if you ever do i gloat over the idea of making up for the shame of your having gone forth tealess and toastless from any door of mine i wish that within itmy doorwe might discuss still weightier things of an ordinarya normalyear i hope always to be there in may  deeply

muir mackenzie most cordially  henry james     to gaillard t lapsley   dictated  34 de vere gardens w 17th june 1898  my dear g t l  i am very unhappy and humiliated at not having succeeded in again putting my hand on you and the fear that you may possibly have departed altogether is a fearful aggravation of my misery therefore i am verily strickenso stricken as to be incapable of holding a pen and to be reduced to this uglyby which i mean this thoroughly beautifulsubstitute if i wait for a pen god knows when or where i shall overtake you accordingly in my effort to catch up i let remington shamelessly loose i lash his sidesi damn his eyes be found by him my dear man somehow or somewherebefore the burden of my shame crushes me to the earth and i sink beneath it into a frequently desired grave the worst of it all is that i saw e fawcett yesterday and he told me he really believed you had gone i hammer away but i dont in the least know where to send this fawcett gave me a sort of a tipat which i think i shall clutch a day or two after i last saw you i went out of town till the following monday and then coming back had but the tuesday here crammed with a frenzy and fury of conflicting duties on wednesday i was obliged to dash away againto go down to rye where domestic complications of the gravest order held me fast the rest of the week or at least till the saturday when i rushed up to town only in time to rush off again and spend at cobham two days with the godkins to whose ensconcement there it had been for a long time before one of the features of a devouring activity that i had responsibly helped to contribute but now that i am at home again till as soon as possible i succeed in breaking away for the rest of the summer i have lost you beyond recall and my affliction is deep and true but we know what it is better to have done even as an accompaniment of losing than never to have done at all and i didnt do nothing at allon the contrary i did that that which is better this is but a flurried and feverish wordhurried off in the hope of keeping your inevitable hating me from becoming a settled habit i follow you with much sympathy and with still more interest attention and hope i follow you in short with a great many sentiments may the great globe whirl round before long some such holiday for you as will convertfor methe pursuit i so inadequately allude to into something in the nature of an encounter only write to me do write to me i mean when you begin to see your way i know you will have lots to do firstand i am very patient as befits one who is so constantly yours  henry james     to paul bourget   dictated  lamb house rye 19th august 1898  mon cher ami  i have hideously delayed to acknowledge your so interesting letter from paris and now the manner of my response does little to repair the missing grace of my silence i trust however to your general confidence not to exact of me the detail of the reasons why i am more and more asservi to this benevolent legibility which i so delight in on the part of others that i find it difficult to understand their occasional resentment of the same on my owna resentment that i know indeed from generous licence already given you do not share i have promised myself each day to attack you pen in hand but the overpowering heat which i grieve to say has reigned even on my balmy hilltop has by really sickening me taken the colour out of all my gallolatin leaving very blanched as well the paler idiom in which i at last perforce address you  i have been entering much more than my silly silence represents into the sequel of your return to london and not less into the sequel of that please believe in my affectionate participation as regards the bezly thorne consultation and whatever emotion it may have excited in either of you to that emotion i hope the healing waters have already applied the most cooling soothing softening doucheor administered a not less beneficent draught if the enjoyment of them has had in fact to be more inward i congratulate you on the decision you so speedily took and with your usual napoleonic celerity when the surface of the globe is in question so energetically acted upon i trust you are in short really settled for a while among rustling german woods and plashing german waters those are really for the most part my own main impressions of germanythe memory of ancient summers there at more or less bosky bäder or other kurorten involving a great deal of open air strolling in the shade and sitting under trees this particular dose of deutschland will i feel really have been more favourable to you than your having had to swallow the teutonelement in the form of the cookery or of any other of the manifold attributes of the robust fausse anglaise whom i here so confoundingly revealed to you let it console you also a little that you would have had to bear as well with that burden a temperature that the particular conditions of the house i showed you would not have done much to minimise i have been grilled but i have borne it better for not feeling that i had put you also on the stove rye goes on baking this amazing summer but though i suppose the heat is everywhere you have a more refreshing regimen i pray for the happiest and most marked results from it  i have received the duchesse bleue and also the land of cockaigne from madame paul whom i thank very kindly for her inscription i had just read the duchess but havent yet had leisure to attack the great matilda the duchess inspires me with lively admirationso close and firm and with an interest so nourished straight from the core of the subject have you succeeded in keeping her i never read you sans vouloir me colleter with you on what i cant help feeling to be the detrimental partipris unless it be wholly involuntary of some of your narrative and other technical processes these questions of art and form as well as of much else interest me deeplyreally much more than any other and so not less do they interest you yet though they frequently come up between us as it were when i read you i nowadays never seem to see you long enough at once to thresh them comfortably out with you moreover after all what does threshingout availthat conviction is doubtless at the bottom of my disposition half the time to let discussion go each of us from the moment we are worth our salt writes as he can and only as he can and his writing at all is conditioned upon the very things that from the standpoint of another method most lend themselves to criticism and we each know much better than anyone else can what the defect of our inevitable form may appear so though it does strike me that your excess of anticipatory analysis undermines too often the readers curiositywhich is a gross loose way of expressing one of the things i meanso probably i really understand better than anyone except yourself why to do the thing at all you must use your own and nobodys else trick of presentation no two men in the world have the same idea image and measure of presentation all the same i must some day read one of your books with you so interesting would it be to meif not to youto put from page to page and chapter to chapter your finger on certain places showing you just where and why selon moi you are too prophetic too exposedly constructive too disposed yourself to swim in the thick reflective element in which you set your figures afloat all this is a clumsy notation of what i mean and on the whole mal àpropos into the bargain inasmuch as i find in the duchess plenty of the art i most like and the realisation of an admirable subject beautifully done the whole episode of the actresss intervention in the rue nouvelle in which i noted no end of superior touches i doubt if any of your readers lose less than i doto the fiftieth part of an intention all this part of the book seems to me thoroughly handledexcept that i think i should have given molan a different behaviour after he gets into the cab with the girlnot have made him act so immediately in character he takes there no linei mean no deeper onewhich is what i think he would have done in fact i think i see myself positively what he would have done and in general he is to my imagination as you give him too much in character too little mysterious so is mme de bonnivetso too even is the actress your love of intellectual daylight absolutely your pursuit of complexities is an injury to the patches of ambiguity and the abysses of shadow which really are the clothingor much of itof the effects that constitute the material of our trade basta  i ordered my yearold maisie the other day to be sent to you and i trust she will by this time have safely arrivedin spite of some ambiguity in the literation of the name of your villa as with your letter in my hand i earnestly meditate upon it i have also despatched to madame paul myself a little volume just publisheda poor little potboiling study of nothing at all qui ne tire pas à conséquence it is but a monument to my fatal technical passion which prevents my ever giving up anything i have begun so that when something that i have supposed to be a subject turns out on trial really to be none je my acharne dautant plus for mere superstitionsuperstitious fear i mean of the consequences and omens of weakness the small book in question is really but an exercise in the art of not appearing to ones self to fail you will say it is rather cruel that for such exercises the public also should have to pay well madame paul and you get your exemplaire for nothing  i have not seen la femme et le pantini see nothing in the way of books here but what you tell me disposes me to send for itas well as my impression of the only other thing that i have read by the same hand only on the question of talent and of effect produced dont you forget too much with such people that talent and effect are comparatively easy things with the licence of such gros moyens they are a great shortcutthe extremities to which all these people proceed and anyone canno matter whobe more or less striking with them but i am writing you an interminable letter do let me knowsans men vouloir for the quantity and quality of ithow nauheim turns out and receive my heartiest wishes for all sorts of comfortable results yours both always constantly  henry james     to w d howells   dictated  lamb house rye 19th august 1898  my dear howells  i throw myself without hesitation into this familiar convenience for the simple reason that i can thus thank you today for your blessed letter from york harbour whereas if i were to wait to be merely romantic and illegible i should perhaps have thanks to many things to put off la douce affaire till week after next if i strike moreover while the iron is hot i strike also while the weather isso unprecedentedly hot for this lukewarm land that even the very moderate cerebral performance to which i am treating you requires sic no manual extension it has been delicious to hear from you and even though i be here domiciled in some gentility in a little old quasihistoric wainscotted house with a real lawn and a real mulberrytree of my own to kick my heels on and under i draw from the folds of your page a faint far sense of the old and remembered breath of new england woods and new england waterssuch as there is still somewhere on my jaded palate the power to taste and even a little overbuilt and overplanted as i at the best am to languish for  i cant speak to you of the war very much further than to admire the wit of your closing epigram about it which however at the rate you throw out these things you must long since have forgotten but my silence isnt in the least indifference it is a deep embarrassment of thoughtof imagination i have hated i have almost loathed it and yet i cant help plucking some food for fancy out of its resultssome vision of how much the bigger complexity we are landed in the bigger worldcontacts may help to educate us and force us to produce people of capacity greater than a less pressure demands capacity for what you will naturally askwhereupon i scramble out of our colloquy by saying that i should perhaps tell you beautifully if you were here and sitting with me on the darkening lawn of my quaint old garden at the end of this barely endurable august day i will make more things than that clear to you if you will only turn up there each of you mrs howells mildred and john all includedfor i have four spare rooms tell it not anywherehas been individually considered as to what you would most like in my domestic arrangements goodbye goodbye it is getting so dark that i cant see to dictatewhich represents to you sufficiently the skill of my secretary i am deeply impatient for your novel but i fear a painful wait yours my dear howells evermore  henry james     to madame paul bourget       the awkward age began to appear in harpers weekly on october      1 1898 madame bourget had sent h j her translation into french      of mathilde seraos paese di cuccagna   lamb house rye august 22nd 1898  dear madame paul  i rejoice in your charming letter and find it most kind i wrote to bourget four or five days ago so that you are not without my news unless my misconstruction of the name of your villa has deprived you and meanwhile it is an immense satisfaction to have something of the detail of yours it rather sounds indeed as if it were summed up in the one word con rispetto parlando perspirationbut i doubt if the difference between rye and nauheim has been other than that of the fryingpan and the fire here we have very sufficiently fried and i have been moved to see the finger of providence in the large fat dirty index of the bouncing dame who to your vision pointed away from watchbell st i have said to myself on the torrid afternoons les malheureuxboxed up with that staircase in that stuffinesscomment y eussentils survécu such reflections are what has principally happened to meexcept thank heaven to get on more or less with my novel the serial publication of which begins in new york on october 1st i hope with all my heart that in spite of everything you feel your cure to be deepbased and widestriking i am distressed that maisie hasnt yet reached you and will immediately write to london to see how my publishers have envisagé the address i sent them but i trust she may perhaps be in the act of arrivingnow it is a volume the merit of which is that the subjectand there is a subjectis i think exhaustively treatedovertreated i dare say but i feel itsuppose itto be probably what i have done in the way of meeting the artistic problem of best the elements however are none of the largest let me thank you more directly for the solid cadeau of your so accomplished translation i am only waiting for the first cool day to begin it i shrink a little otherwise under the dogstar from naples and the ardent matilda but you will neither of you lose by it my affectionate greeting to bourget believe me dear madame paul yours very constantly  henry james     to miss frances r morse   dictated  lamb house rye october 19th 1898  my dear fanny  i have received month after month the most touching and admirable signs of your remembrance and yet haventvisibly to yourselfso much as waved a hat at you in return a brutality which however is all on the surface only and no measure of the deep appreciation i have really felt your letters from the moment the war began were a real waft of the real thing penetrating all the more deeply on account of all the old memories stirred by the particular things the names and persons and kind of anxiety they were full ofso many echoes of the faraway time it makes one in the presence of the unknowing generation feel so horribly old to recall i can thank you affectionately for all these things now very much better than i can explain in detail why you have not heard from me sooner the best explanation is simply the general truth that ive had a summer in which my correspondence has very much gone to the wall i moved down here rather early but that operated not quiteor really not at allas a simplification you know for yourself what it means to start a new home on however humble a basisfrom the moment one has to do it mainly singlehanded and with a great deal else to do at the same tune here i am at last on somewhat quieter daysthough even this does happen to be a week of such small hospitalities as i am restricted to and i have if only from the still large arrears of my correspondence which reduce me to this ugly process the sense of the shining hour at best unimproved  i wont attempt to take up in detail your innumerable bits of news and all your evocations of the boston picture i move through that always as through a company of ghosts so completely have sound and sight of individuals and presences faded away from me still i have had some close reminders wendell holmes was here still beautiful and charming for a day or two and above all off and on for a couple of months my nephew harry whom you well know and in whom i took no end of comfort and pleasure his being here was a great satisfaction to meand doubled by the fact of my so getting more news of william and alice than i have had for many a year she sent to the boy all his fathers letters from california and elsewherethe consequence of which for me was a wonderful participation and interest william appears to have had a magnificent sort of summer and no end of success on the pacific slopebesides innumerable impressions by the way and an excellent series of weeks in the adirondacks before going forth but after all all these things have flashed by the very war now that its over seems merely to have flashedthe dreadful marks of the flash in so many a case being beyond my ken well i wont attempt to go into itits all beyond me it only im afraid makes me want to curl up more closely in this little oldworld corner where i can successfully beg such questions they become a spectacle merelya drama of great interest but as to which judgment and prophecy are withered in me or at all events absolutely checked  i am very sorry you and your mother have ceased coming out just at the time ive something to show you my little old house is really pretty enough for that and has given me all this wonderful hot rainless radiant summer a peace that would pass understanding if i had only got through the first botherations a little earlier in the season however ive done very wellhave only not been quite such an anchorite as i had planned the bump of luggage has been frequent on my stair and the conference with the cook proved a greater strain than in that particular way i have ever before had to meet but its doubtless my own fault i should have sought a drearier refuge i am staying here lateas far on into the autumn as wind and weather may permit i hope this will find you in the very heart of the american october crystal i congratulate you my dear fanny on all the warm personal local life that surrounds you and that you touch at so many points very much more the normal state for ones afternoon of existence after all than my expatriated one but we go on as we may i dont feel as if i had thanked you half enough for your so many beautiful bulletinsand can only ask you to believe that each in its order more or less brought tears to my eyes recall me please to your mothers kindest remembrance and believe me  yours evermore henry james     to dr louis waldstein   lamb house rye oct 21st 1898  dear sir  forgive my neglect under great pressure of occupation of your so interesting letter of the 12th i have since receiving it had complicated calls on my time that the turn of the screw has been suggestive and significant to youin any degreeit gives me great pleasure to hear and i can only thank you very kindly for the impulse of sympathy that made you write i am only afraid perhaps that my conscious intention strikes you as having been larger than i deserve it should be thought it is the intention so primarily with me always of the artist the painter that that is what i most myself feel in itand the lesson the ideaeverconveyed is only the one that deeply lurks in any vision prompted by life and as regards a presentation of things so fantastic as in that wanton little tale i can only rather blush to see real substance read into themi mean for the generosity of the reader but of course where there is life theres truth and the truth was at the back of my head the poet is always justified when he is not a humbug always grateful to the justifying commentator my bogeytale dealt with things so hideous that i felt that to save it at all it needed some infusion of beauty or prettiness and the beauty of the pathetic was the only attainablewas indeed inevitable but ah the exposure indeed the helpless plasticity of childhood that isnt dear or sacred to somebody that was my little tragedyover which you show a wisdom for which i thank you again believe me thus my dear sir yours most truly  henry james     to h g wells       the reference in the second paragraph of this letter is to      covering end the second story of the two magics mr wells was      at this time living near folkestone distant from rye by the      breadth of romney marsh   lamb house rye dec 9th 1898  my dear h g wells  your so liberal and graceful letter is to my head like coals of fireso repeatedly for all these weeks have i had feebly to suffer frustrations in the matter of trundling over the marsh to ask for your news and wish for your continued amendment the shortening days and the deepening mud have been at the bottom of this affair i never get out of the house till 3 oclock when night is quickly at ones heels i would have taken a regular dayi mean started in the ambut have been so ridden myself by the black care of an unfinished and running galloping leaping and bounding serial that parting with a day has been like parting with a pound of flesh i am still a neck ahead however and this week will see me through i accordingly hope very much to be able to turn up on one of the ensuing days i will sound a horn so that you yourself be not absent on the chase then i will express more articulately my appreciation of your various signs of critical interest as well as assure you of my sympathy in your own martyrdom what will you have its all a grind and a bloody battleas well as a considerable lark and the difficulty itself is the refuge from the vulgarity bless your heart i think i could easily say worse of the t of the s the young woman the spooks the style the everything than the worst any one else could manage one knows the most damning things about ones self of course i had about my young woman to take a very sharp line the grotesque business i had to make her picture and the childish psychology i had to make her trace and present were for me at least a very difficult job in which absolute lucidity and logic a singleness of effect were imperative therefore i had to rule out subjective complications of her ownplay of tone etc and keep her impersonal save for the most obvious and indispensable little note of neatness firmness and couragewithout which she wouldnt have had her data but the thing is essentially a potboiler and a jeu desprit  with the little play the absolute creature of its conditions i had simply to make up a deficit and take a small revanche for three mortal years had the actress for whom it was written utterly to try to fit persistently failed to produce it and i couldnt wholly waste my labour the bp wont read a play with the mere names of the speakersso i simply paraphrased these and added such indications as might be the equivalent of decent actinga history and an evolution that seem to me moreover explicatively and sufficiently smeared all over the thing the moral is of course dont write oneact plays but i didnt mean thus to sprawl i envy your hand your needlepointed fingers as you dont say that youre not better i prepare myself to be greatly struck with the same and with kind regards to your wife  believe me yours ever henry james  ps whats this about something in some newspaperi read least of allfrom long and deep experiencewhat my friends write about me and havent read the things you mention i suppose its because they know i dont that they dare     to f w h myers   lamb house rye dec 19 1898  my dear myers  i dont know what you will think of my unconscionable delay to acknowledge your letter of so many so very many days ago nor exactly how i can make vivid to you the nature of my hindrances and excuses i have in truth been until some few days since intensely and anxiously busy finishing under pressure a long job that had from almost the firsti mean from long before i had reached the endbegun to be loathsome name and fact serializedso that the printers were at my heels and i had to make a sacrifice of my correspondence utterlyto keep the sort of cerebral freshness required for not losing my head or otherwise collapsing but i wont expatiate please believe my silence has been wholly involuntary and yet now that i am writing i scarce know what to say to you on the subject on which you wrote especially as im afraid i dont quite understand the principal question you put to me about the turn of the screw however that scantily matters for in truth i am afraid i have on some former occasions rather awkwardly signified to you that i somehow cant pretend to give any coherent account of my small inventions after the fact there they arethe fruit at best of a very imperfect ingenuity and with all the imperfections thereof on their heads the one thing and another that are questionable and ambiguous in them i mostly take to be conditions of their having got themselves pushed through at all the t of the s is a very mechanical matter i honestly thinkan inferior a merely pictorial subject and rather a shameless potboiler the thing that as i recall it i most wanted not to fail of doing under penalty of extreme platitude was to give the impression of the communication to the children of the most infernal imaginable evil and dangerthe condition on their part of being as exposed as we can humanly conceive children to be this was my artistic knot to untie to put any sense or logic into the thing and if i had known any way of producing more the image of their contact and condition i should assuredly have been proportionately eager to resort to it i evoked the worst i could and only feel tempted to say as in french excusez du peu  i am living so much down here that i fear i am losing hold of some of my few chances of occasionally seeing you the charming old humbleminded quaintness and quietness of this little brown hilltop city lays a spell upon me i send you and your wife and all your house all the greetings of the season and am my dear myers yours very constantly  henry james     to mrs william james   dictated  lamb house rye 19th december 1898  dearest alice  i have gone on and on most abominably and inexorably owing you a letter since a date so distant that i associate the time intimately with the admirable summer here that we so long ago left behind and of which harry willat a period by this time quite prehistorichave given you something of the pleasant little story but the sense always abides with me that when i am for weeks and months together dumbas i know i more than once have beenyou and william are quite de force to read into it all the kindly extenuations i require i have in fact for many weeks down here been taking the general line of saving up all the cerebration not imperatively drained off from day to day for a long job that i have had to carry through under the nightmare of belatednessa belatedness so great produced by time lost originally in arranging this place moving down taking possession etc as to leave me no margin whatever for accident indisposition or languor my capacity for the distillation of prose of decent quality remains alas with all the amendments time has brought it still each day so limited that i get awfully nervous under a very continuous task unless i by certain flagrant sacrifices keep up to myself the fiction of freshnessof not getting simply sick in other words by adding any writing that i havent absolutely to do to the quantity that is each morning imposed so the sacrifices for a long time past have been as usual my correspondence and as the most tender morsels for the moloch you and william naturally en première ligne the moloch at last howeversince these four or five days has been temporarily appeased and i have instantly begun to transfer my attention from one form of belatement to another i am working off arrears of letters and if i take you dearest alice in the heap i at least pay you the sweet tribute of taking you first you have been without sign or sound of me so long that i daresay you may have even wild imaginings about my location and other conditions i am located only just where harry left me and where i have stuck fast since july last without the excision of twentyfour hours the autumn and the early winter have followed the ardent summer here only to multiply my points of contact with my environment and to saturate me more deeply with the grateful sense of it this contentment has defied all winds and weathersin plenty of which we have for the last two months rejoiced i like to send all our little news of such matters in the form of news to harry in particular whose mind is furnished with the proper little hooks for it to hold on by tell him then since i wont attempt to burden him individually with acknowledgements that will overload him that everything he fancied and fondled here only kept growing all the autumn long more adapted to such a relation and that in short both the little brown city and the so amiable countryside were not in july and august a patch for charm colour subtlety and every kind of daily grace to what they became in an uninterrupted crescendo all through october and november all the good that i hoped of the place has in fine profusely bloomed and flourished here it was really at about the end of september when the various summer supernumeraries had quite faded away that the special note of rye the feeling of the little hilltop community bound together like a very modest obscure and impecunious but virtuous and amiable family began most unmistakably to come out this is the present note of life here and it has floated me excuse mixture of metaphor very placidly along nothing would induce me now not to be here for christmas and nothing will induce me not to do my best at least to be here for the protrusion of the bulbsthe hyacinths and tulips and crocusesthat in return for expended shillings george gammon promises me for the earliest peep of spring as he has broken no word with me yet i trust him implicitly for this meantime too i have trusted him all the autumn for all sorts of other things as well we have committed to the earth together innumerable unsightly roots and sprigs that i am instructed to depend upon as the fixed foundation of a future herbaceous and perennial paradise little by little even with other cares the slowly but surely working poison of the gardenmania begins to stir in my longsluggish veins tell harry as an intimate instance that by a masterly inspiration i have at one bold stroke swept away all the complications in the quarter on which the studio looks down uprooting the wilderness of shrubs relaying paths extending borders etc and made arrangements to throw the lawn in one lordly sweep straight up into that anglea proceeding that greatly increases our apparent extent and dignity an improvement in short quite unspeakable but the great charm is the simply being here and in particular the beginning of the day no longer with the london blackness and foulness the curtain of fog and smoke that one has each morning muscularly to lift and fasten back but with the pleasant sunny garden outlook the grass all haunted with starlings and chaffinches and the inandout relation with it that in a manner gilds and refreshes the day this indeedwith work and a few a very few peopleis the all but that is just the beauty ive missed nothing that i havent been more than resigned to there have been a few individuals from saturday to monday and onejonathan sturges whose identity if it is too dim for you it would take me too long to explainever since midoctober he remains till over christmas but save as making against pure intensity of concentration he is altogether a boon i go to town the last of the month but only for two or three weeks and in a pure picnicking way i have a plan and a desire really to achieve this winter after an intermission of five years ten or twelve weeks in italy and it now seems probable i shall do so i shall not know with absolute definiteness till i go to london but the omens and portents are favourable on my return i shall come straight down here and i already foresee how the thought of the spring here will draw me from almost wherever i may at that time be i shall write you again however about this so that you shall definitely know what becomes of me you see this is a pure outpouring of the ego i am after all without fresh news of yourselves to rebound from the latest and best is williams kind dispatch to me of his immortality lecture for which i heartily thank him and which i have read with great appreciation of the art and interest of it i am afraid i dont very consciously come in to either of the classes it is designed to pacifyeither that of the yearners i mean or that of the objectors it isnt the difficulties that keep me from the yearningit is somehow the lack of the principle of the same however i go not now into this i only acknowledge till after the turn of the year i write to him williams communication of the book every illustration of his magnificent activityat the spectacle of which i am condemned to such a woefully back seatgives me more joy than i will now pretend to express for the rest dearest alice take from me all my hopes the inevitable vain ones about your household health and happiness and the complexion and outlook of the season for all of you i try to see you all as cheerfully and gregariouslyyet not for the dignity of each too much of the latterfirelighted and eke furnaceheated strange things contend with this imagewild newspaper blizzards and other public bewilderments are you individually expandingi mean even to the islands of the sea i myself have no policy i have no judgment i am too far and too unadvised and too out of it and too subtle also to see gospel truth in all the so genial encouragement that our swelling state finds naturally and very logically in this country that the two countries should swell together offers material convenienceand that is for much but i only meant to ask if william and you and the children are definitely in or out of the swell i will be myself wherever you are yours dearest alice always constantly  henry james     to charles eliot norton   dictated  lamb house rye 26th december 1898  my dear charles  let me say at once that a great part of the secret of my horrid prolonged dumbness has been just this ugly fact of my finding myself reduced in my declining years like a banker or a cabinet minister altogether to dictating my letters the effect of this in turn has been to give me a great shyness about themwhich has indeed stricken me with silence just in proportion as the help so rendered has seemed to myself really to minister to speech many people i find in these conservative climes take it extremely ill to be addressed in remingtonese forgive however this long descant on my delays my doubts and fears my final jump rendered thus clumsy by my nervousness  the worst of such predicaments is my dear charles that when one does write everything one has at a thousand scattered moments previously wanted to say seems to have dried up with desuetude and neglect oh all the things that should have been said on the spot if they were ever to be said at all this applies you will immediately recognisethough its a stern truth by which i suffer mostvery poignantly to all the utterance i feel myself to have so odiously failed of at the time of the death of dear burnejones i can only give you a very partially lucid account of why on that occasion at least no word from me reached you i saw myself heard myself felt myself not writeand yet even then knew perfectly both that i should be writing now and that i should now be sorrier than ever for not writing then it came the miserable event at the very moment i was achieving very singlehanded and unassisted a complicated transfer of residence from london to this place with all sorts of bewildering material detail consequent on renovation complete preparation of every kind of old house and garden adding its distraction to the acute sense of pressing work fatally retarded and blighted so that a postponement which has finally grown to this monstrous length began with being a thing only of moments and hours then moreover it was simply so wretched and odious to feel him by a turn of the wheel of fate that had taken but an instant gone for ever from sight and sound and touch i was tenderly attached to him with abundant reason for being and there was something that choked and angered me beyond what words could trust themselves to express in the mere blind bêtise of the business so the days and the weeks went i went up from here to town and thence to rottingdean for the committal of his ashes there to the earth of the little greytowered churchyard in sight of the sea that was at the moment all smothered in lovely spring flowers it was a day of extraordinary beauty and in every way a quite indescribably sincerei remember i could find at the time no other word for the impressionlittle funeral and demonstration the people from london were those almost all in whose presence there was a kind of harmony i had seen the dear man to my great joy only a few hours before his death meeting him at a kind of blighted and abortive weddingfeast that is a dinner before a marriage that was to take place on the morrow from which we were both glad to disembroil ourselves so that we drove together home intimately moralising and talking nonsense and he put me in the grey london midnight down at my corner to go on by himself to the grange it was the last time i saw him and as one always does i have taken ever since a pale comfort in the thought that our parting was explicitly affectionate and such almost as one would have wished it even had one known i miss him even here and now he was one of the most loveable of men and most charming of friendsaltogether and absolutely distinguished i think his career as an artistic one and speaking quite apart from the degree of ones sympathy with his work one of the greatest of boons to our most vulgar of ages there was no false note in him nothing to dilute the strain he knew his direction and held it hardwrought with passion and went as straight as he could he was for all this always to me a great comfort for the rest death came to him i think at none so bad a moment he had essentially to my vision really done and he was very tired and his cup was with all the mingled things about as full as it would hold it was so good a moment in short that i think his memory is already feeling the benefit of it in a sort of rounded finished way i was not at the sale of his pictures and drawings which took place after his deathi have not stirred from this spot since i came to it at the end of june but though i should immensely have cherished some small scrap everything went at pricesmagnificent for his estatethat made acquisition a vain dream i have hadand little wonderscant news of you i know youve renounced your professorship i know you felt strongly on public events but i am in a depressed twilightof discrimination i meanthat enables me to make less of these things than i should like to do so much has come and gone these six months that how can i talk about it its strange the consciousness possible to an american here today of being in a country in which the drift of desireso far as it concerns itself with the matteris that we shall swell and swell and acquire and require to the top of our opportunity my own feeling roughly stated is that we have not been good enough for our opportunityvulgar in a manner as that was and is but it may be the real message of the whole business to make us as much better as the great grabbedup british empire has unmistakeably made the english but over these abyssesinto them ratheri peer with averted eye i fear i am too lost in the mere spectacle for any decent morality goodbye my dear charles and forgive my mechanic volubility isnt it better to have ticked and shocked than never to have ticked at all i send my love to all your house  your ever my dear charles affectionate old friend  henry james     to henry james junior   lamb house rye feb 24 1899  dearest harry  i have a good letter from you too long unansweredbut you will easily condone my offence of not too soon loading you with the burdensome sense that it is inot your virtuous selfwho have last written and you must now let that sense sit on you very lightly dont trouble about me till all college pressure is completely overby which i mean till some as yet comparatively remote summerday weve had of late a good lot of wondrous sunny balmy daystoday is splendidin which i have kept saying to myself what a climatedear old muchabused thingafter all and feeling quite balmily and baskingly southern ive been sitting all the last month in the green upstairs southwest room whose manifest destiny is clearly to become a secondstory boudoir whenever my books arrive in their plenitude from de vere gardens it will be absolutely required to help to house them it has been at any rate constantly flooded with sun and has opened out its view toward winchelsea and down the valley in the most charming way the garden is beginning to smile and shimmer almost as if it were already may half the crocuses and hyacinths are up the primrose and the jonquil abound the tulips are daily expected and the lawn is of a rich and vivid green that covers with shame the state in which you saw it george gammon proves as regular as a set of false teeth and improves each shining hour in short the quite essential amiability of lh only deepens with experience therefore see what a house im keeping for you  but i am writing you a letter that will burden you i wont break ground on the greater questionsthough i think themthink it at least in the us the main one extraordinarily interesting to live in england is inevitably to feel the imperial question in a different way and take it at a different angle from what one might with the same mind even do in america expansion has so made the english what they arefor good or for ill but on the whole for goodthat one doesnt quite feel ones way to say for ones country noill have none of it it has educated the english will it only demoralize us i suppose the answer to that is that we can get at home a bigger education than theyin short as big a one as we require thank god however ive no opinionsnot even on the dreyfus case im more and more only aware of things as a more or less mad panorama phantasmagoria and dime museum it would take me longer than to finish this paper to send you all the fond incitement or solicitation that i have on hand for you or to work off my storedup messages to your eltern and brethren there is time to talk of it but i count on as many of you as possible for next summer i hope you are conscious of a little tethering string of attachment to the old mulberry in the garden and am ever your affectionate  henry james  ps am just up again from such a sweet sunny spacious afterluncheon stroll in the garden youll think it very vulgar of me but i continue to find it ravishing     to a f de navarro   lamb house rye  mondaysmall hours130 am feb 27 1899  my dear don tony  you cant say i overwhelm you with acknowledgments din my gratitude into your ear or make you curse the day you suffered a kindly impulse to an intensely susceptible friend to get the better of your appreciation of a quiet life noyou can do none of these things on the other hand you can perhaps complete your graceful generosity by remembering that your admirable little xmas memento was accompanied with a now hold your tongue almost as admirable in its distinguished consideration as the felicitous object itself it was clearly that you felt oh yes of course youre charmed à qui le ditesvous but for heavens sake thanked to satiety as i am on all sides dont set your ponderous machinery in motion to drop the last straw so ive put out the fires and stopped the wheels and paid off the stokers till now ive held my tongue like an angel but ive thought of youand of your matchless matelikewell if not a at least the devil and at last the whole shop insists on beginning again to hum i cherish your so periodical and so

literally my saviour the above row of stars represents midnight emotions and palpitations of no mean order as i finished the line just before the stars i became aware that a smell of smoke a sense of burning that had worried me for the previous hour had suddenly very much increased and that the room was full of it de fil en aiguille and in much anxiety i presently discovered that the said smoke was coming up through the floor between the painted darkgreen planks dark green of the marginoutside of matting and rugs and under a table near the fireplace to assure myself that there was no source of flame in the room below and then to go up and call my servant do you see he long since snoring in bedfor its now 215 am was the work of a moment with such tools as we could command we hacked and pried and sawed and tore up a couple of planksfrom which volumes of smoke issued do you see the midnight little flurry bref we got at ita charred smoulderinglongsmouldering i supposebeam under or almost under the hearthstone and in process of time kindledthat is heated to smokingpoint by its temperature that of the hearth which was very high we put him out we made him stop with soaked spongesand then the relief even while gazing at the hacked and smashed and disfigured floors now my man is gone to bed and i rather enlivened for immediate sleep sit and watch by the scene of the small scare and finish my letter to you really you know to grasp your hand to hang upon your neck in gratitude you being at the bottom of the whole thing i sat up late in the first instance to write to you because i knew i shouldnt have time tomorrow and it was because i did so that i was saved a much worse later alarm two or three hours hence the smoke would have penetrated to the rest of the house and we should have started up to fly round to a much livelier tune  bravo then again dear indispensable man how i feel with magnificent mrs tonyfor if youre such an a no 1 guardianangel to my house what are you to your own the only thing is that i was going to write to you of two or three other things and this stupid little accident has smoked them all out ive lent this really most amiable little old house to jonathan sturges while im awayand hes to come as soon as he can he has been wretched as you know with poisonous influenza but i went up to town to see him a few days since and he seemed really mending he was here a long time in the autumn and the early winter and our conversation hung and hovered about you good nightits 245 and alls well i must turn in i grovel before your wifeand take endless liberties with your sonand am yoursafter all thismore than evermuch as that was  henry james  ps tuesday night this my dear tony is a sorrier postscript than i expected i had

cant detail itbut ive got off wondrous easy we got the brave pumpers with creditable promptitudethey were thoroughly up to the markabove all without trop de zèleand the damage is limited wholly to one side of two roomsespecially the room i was writing to you in so blandly the pumpers were here till 5and i slept not till the following last night still more therefore i repeat it was you preserved me finishing my letter to you kept me on the spot and being on the spot was all if i had had my head under the bedclothes i wouldntcouldnt have sniffed till two or three hours later when headway would

letter of the 19th telling me of your views and prospects for next summer cof all of which i am now able to make the most intimate profit i enter fully into your reasons for wanting to put in the summer quietly and concentratedly in cambridgeso much that with work unfinished and a spacious house and library of your very own to contain you i ask myself how you can be expected to do anything less only it all seems to mean that i shall see you all but scantly and remotely however i shall wring from it when the time comes every concession that can be snatched and shall meanwhile watch your signs and symptoms with my biggest operaglass the beautiful one one of the treasures of my life que je vous dois  nothing you tell me gives me greater pleasure than what you say of the arrangements made for harry and billy in the forest primeval and the vision of their drawing therefrom experiences of a sort that i too miserably lacked poor father in my own too casual youth what i most of all feel and in the light of it conjure you to keep doing for them is their being à même to contract local saturations and attachments in respect to their own great and glorious country to learn and strike roots into its infinite beauty as i suppose and variety then they wont as i do now have to assimilate but halfheartedly the alien splendoursinferior ones too as i believeof the indigestible

first order its classicclaudevirgil  i expect to get to genoa on the 4th or 5th april and there to make up my mind as to how i can best spend the following eight weeks in italy in evasion and seclusion unhappily i must go to rome and rome is infernal but i shall make short work of it my nostalgia for lamb house is already such as to make me capable de tout never again will i leave it i dont take you up on the philippinesi admire you and agree with you too much you have an admirable eloquence but the age is all to the vulgar farewell with a wide embrace  ever your henry     to howard sturgis   hôtel de leurope rome may 19 1899  my dear howard  its a great pleasure to hear from you in this far countrythough i greatly wish it werent from the bed of anguishor at any rate of delicacy if delicacy may be connected that is with anything so indelicate as a bed but im very glad to gather that its the couch of convalescence only if you have a back for heavens sake take care of it when i was about your agein 1862i did a bad damage by a strain subsequentlythrough crazy juvenilityneglected to mine the consequence of which is that in spite of retarded attention and years really of recumbency later ive been saddled with it for life and that even now my dear howard i verily write you with it i even wrote the awkward age with it therefore look sharp i wanted especially to send you that volumeas an acknowledgment of princely hospitalities received and formed the intention of so doing even in the too scant moments we stood face to face among the rembrandts thats rightbe one of the few i greatly applaud the tact with which you tell me that scarce a human being will understand a word or an intention or an artistic element or glimmer of any sort of my book i tell myselfand the reviews tell mesuch truths in much cruder fashion but its an old old storyand if i minded now as much as i once did i should be well beneath the sod face to face i should be able to say a bit how i sawand why i so sawmy subject but that will keep  im here in a warmish quietish emptyish pleasantish but not maddeningly so altered and cockneyfied and scraped and all but annihilated rome i return to england some time next month to the countrylamb house ryenow my constant addressonly  however this is only to greet and warn youand to be my dear howard your affectionate old friend  henry james     to mrs humphry ward       the allusions at the end of this letter are to the visit paid by h      j to mr and mrs humphry ward at the villa barberini castel      gandolfo during his stay in italy mrs ward has described the      excursion to nemi the strawberries and aristodemo in a      writers recollections pp 3279   lamb house rye july 10th 1899  dear mrs ward  i have a very bad conscience and a very heavy heart about my failure to communicate with you again before you left romefor i heard afterwardsmuch afterwards that you had had final trouble and inconveniencethat miss gertrude brave being tempted providenceby her very braveryto renew its assaultsand that illness and complications encumbered your last steps on the subject of all this i ought long since to have condoled with you in default of having condoled at the timeyet lo i have shamefully waited for the ignoble facility of my own table and inkstand to which after too prolonged a separation i have but just been restored i got homefrom turinbut three days agoand very very cool and green and wholesome though only comparatively i admit does this little insular nook appear after i last saw you i too was caught up if not cast down by the fateswhirled by irresistible marion crawfordsoff to sorrento capri naplesall of which had not been in the least in my programmethence afterwards to live in heat and hurry and inconvenient submission and compromisetill florence in its turn made a long arm and pocketed me oh so stuffily till but a few days ago all this time ive been the slave of othersand i return to a perfect mountain of unforwarded by a rash and delusive policy postal matter but i bore through the mountain straight at stocksor even according to an intimation you gave me at grosvenor place i heartily hope all the crumples and stains of travel have by this time been washed and smoothed awayand that you have nothing but romantic recollections and regrets i pray miss ward be wholly at her ease again and that somehow or other you may have woven a big piece of your tapestry i should say frankly maynt i come down and seeor hear were it not that i return to fearful arrears myself and restored to this small temple of application from which ive so long been absent feel absolutely obliged to sit tight for several weeks to come later in the summer if youll let me i shall ask for an invitation if all this while ive not sent you the awkward age it has been because i thought it not fair to make any such appeal to your attention while you were preoccupied and worried perhapsabsolutely in facti wanted the book to reach you at a moment when the coast might be comparatively clear possibly it isnt clear even now at all events i am writing to heinemann today to despatch to you the volume but please dont look at it till all the elements of leisuremarginpeace of mindlend themselves and dont answer this you have far other business in hand  my four months in italy did more for me i imagine than i shall yet awhile know one must draw on them a little to find out doubtless you are drawing hard on yours for me i am clear about that the nemi lake and the walk down and up the latter perhaps most and the strawberries and aristodemo were the cream it will be a joy to have it all out again with you and to hear of your other adventures i hope miss dorothy and miss janet please tell them are finding london if you are still there come si deve yours and theirs and humphrys dear mrs ward very constantly  henry james     to mrs humphry ward       it will be understood that mrs ward had consulted h j on certain      details relating in particular to the american background of one      of the characters in her forthcoming novel eleanor the scene of      which was partly laid at castel gandolfo   lamb house rye sunday july 1899  dear mrs ward  i return the proofs of eleanor in a separate cover from this and as i think it wise to register them i must wait till tomorrow am to do that and this therefore will reach you first let me immediately say that i dont light and ive read carefully every word and many two or three times as mr bellasis would sayand is mr b by the way naturallyas it wereh j on any peccant particular spots in the aspect of lucy f that the american reader would challenge i do think he or she may be likely at first to think her more english than americanto say i mean why this isnt usits english dissent for its wellgenerallyto keep in mind how very different a thing that is socially aesthetically c from the american free and easy multitudinous churches that practically in any community are like so many almost clubs or philharmonics or amateur theatrical companies i dont quite think the however obscure american girl i gather you to conceive would have any shockability about rome the pope st peters kneeling or anything of that sortleast of all any girl whose concatenations could by any possibility of social handingon land her in the milieu you present at albano she would probably be either a unitarian or orthodox which is i believe congregational though in new england always called orthodox and in either case as emersonized hawthornized j a symondsized and as frantic to feel the papacy c as one could well represent her and this i mean even were she of any provincial new england circle whatever that one could conceive as ramifying however indirectly into villa barb this particularly were her father a college professor in that case i should say the bad clothes c oh yes as much as you like the beauty c scarcely the offishness to romeas a spectator calmost not at all all this roughly and hastily speaking but there is no false note of surface beyond this i think that you need be uneasy about at all had i looked over your shoulder i should have said specify localise a little moregive her a definite massachusetts or maine or whatever habitationimagine a countrycollegetowninvent if need be a name and stick to that this for smallish but appreciable reasons that i havent space to developbut after all not imperative for the rest the chapters you send me are as a beginning to my vision very charming and interesting and pleasingfull of promise of strong elementsas your beginnings always are  and may i say as i can read nothing if i read it at all save in the light of how one would ones self proceed in tackling the same data just two other things one is that i think your material suffers a little from the fact that the reader feels you approach your subject too immediately show him its elements the cards in your hand too bang off from the first pageso that a wait to begin to guess what and whom the thing is going to be about doesnt impose itself the antechamber or two and the crooked corridor before he is already in the presence the other is that you dont give him a positive sense of dealing with your subject from its logical centre this centre i gathered to be from what you told me in rome and one gathers it also from the title the consciousness of eleanorto which all the rest manisty lucy the whole phantasmagoria and drama is presented by life i should have urged you make that consciousness full rich universally prehensile and stick to itdont shiftand dont shift arbitrarilyhow otherwise do you get your unity of subject or keep up your readers sense of it to which if you say how then do i get lucys consciousness i impudently retort by that magnificent and masterly indirectness which means the only dramatic straightness and intensity you get it in other words by eleanor and how does eleanor get it by everything by lucy by manisty by every pulse of the action in which she is engaged and of which she is the fullestan exquisiteregister go behind hermiles and miles dont go behind the others or the subjectie the unity of impressiongoes to smash but i am going too farand this is more than you will have bargained for on these matters there is far too much to say this makes me all the more sorry that in answer to your kind invitation for the last of this month i greatly fear i cant leave home for several weeks to come i am in hideous backwardness with duties that after a long idleness six full months have awaited me hereand i am cultivating a unity of impression in october with joy  your history of your journey from vb your anxieties complications horrid tension and tribulation draws hot tears from my eyes i blush for the bleak inn at the bare simplon i only meant it for rude recovered health poor miss gertrudeheroine partout et toujoursand so privately modestly exquisitely give her please all my present benediction and forgive my horrid fatigued hieroglyphics do let me have more of eleanorto rewrite and believe me dear mrs ward ever constantly yours  henry james  ps ive on reflection determined that as a registered letter may not perhaps reach stocks till tuesday am and you wish to despatch for wednesdays steamer it is my higher duty to send the proofs off in ordinary form apart from this but tonight may it be for the best  h j     to mrs humphry ward   lamb house rye july 26th 1899  dear mrs ward  i beg you not to believe that if you elicit a reply from meto your so interesting letter just receivedyou do so at any cost to any extreme or uncomfortable pressure that im just now under i am always behind with everythingand its no worse than usual besides i shall be very briefa but i must say two or three wordsnot only because these are the noblest speculations that can engage the human mind but becauseto a degree that distresses meyou labour under two or three mistakes as to what the other day i at all wanted to express i dont myself for that matter recognise what you mean by any old difference between us on any scoreand least of all when you appear to glance at it as an opinion of mine if i understand you that is as to there being but one general hard and fast rule of presentation i protest that i have never had with you any differenceconsciouslyon any such point and rather resent frankly your attributing to me a judgment so imbecile i hold that there are five million such rules or as many as there are subjects in all the worldi fear the subjects are not 5000000 only each of them imposed artistically by the particular caseinvolved in the writers responsibility to it and each thenand then onlyhard and fast with an immitigable hardness and fastness i dont see without this latter condition where any work of art any artistic question is or any artistic probity of course a 1000 times there are as many magnificent and imperative cases as you like of presenting a thing by going behind as many forms of consciousness as you likeall dickens balzac thackeray tolstoi save when they use the autobiographic dodge are huge illustrations of it but they are illustrations of extreme and calculated selection or singleness too whenever that has been by the case imposed on them my own immortal works for that matter if i may make bold are recognizable instances of all the variation i go behind right and left in the princess casamassima the bostonians the tragic muse just as i do the same but singly in the american and maisie and just as i do it consistently never at all save for a false and limited appearance here and there of doing it a little which i havent time to explain in the awkward age so far from not seeing what you mean in pêcheur dislande i see it as a most beautiful examplea crystalclear one its a picture of a relation a single relation and that relation isnt given at all unless given on both sides because practically there are no other relations to make other feet for the situation to walk withal the logic jumps at the eyes therefore acquit me please please of anything so abject as putting forward anything at once specific and a priori then why i hear you ask do you pronounce for my book a priori only because of a mistake doubtless for which i do here humble penancethat of assuming too precipitately and with the freedom of an inevitably tooforeshortened letter that i was dealing with it a posterioriand that on the evidence of only those few pages and of a somewhat confused recollection of what in rome you told me of your elements or rathermore correctlyi was giving way to my irresistible need of wondering how given the subject one could best work ones self into the presence of it and lo and behold the subject isnt of course in so scant a show and brief a piece given at alli have doubtless simply with violence and mutilation stolen it it is of the nature of that violence that im a wretched person to read a noveli begin so quickly and concomitantly for myself to write it rathereven before i know clearly what its about the novel i can only read i cant read at all and i had to be just with me one attenuationi thought i gathered from the pages already absorbed that your parti pris as to your process with eleanor was already definedand defined as dramaticand that was a kind of lead the people all as it were phenomenal to a particular imagination hers and that imagination with all its contents phenomenal to the reader i in fine just rudely and egotistically thrust forward the beastly way i should have done it but there is too much to say about these thingsand i am writing too muchand yet havent said half i want toand above all there being so much it is doubtless better not to attempt to say pen in hand what one can say but so partially and yet i must still add one or two things more what i said above about the rule of presentation being in each case hard and fast that i will go to the stake and burn with slow fire forthe slowest that will burn at all i hold the artist must infinitely know how he is doing it or he is not doing it at all i hold he must have a perception of the interests of his subject that grasps him as in a vise and that the subject being of course formulated in his mind he sees as sharply the way that most presents it and presents most of it as against the ways that comparatively give it away and he must there choose and stick and be consistentand that is the hardandfastness and the vise i am afraid i do differ with you if you mean that the picture can get any objective unity from any other source than that can get it from eg the personality of the author from the personality of the author which however enchanting is a thing for the reader only and not for the author himself without humiliating abdications to my sense to count in at all it can get nothing but a unity of execution and of tone there is no short cut for the subject in other words out of the process which having made out most what it the subject is treats it most handles it in that relation with the most consistent economy may i say to exonerate myself a little that when eg i see you make lucy phenomenal to eleanor one has to express it briefly and somehow i find myself supposing completely that you know how youre doing it and enjoy as critic the sweet peace that comes with that sense but i havent the sense that you know how youre doing it when at the point youve reached i see you make lucy phenomenal even for one attempted stroke to the little secretary of embassy and the reason of this is that eleanor counts as presented and thereby is something to go behind the secretary doesnt count as presented and isnt he moreover engaged at the very momentyour momentin being phenomenal himself to lucy and is therefore practically nothing to go behind the promiscuous shiftings of standpoint and centre of tolstoi and balzac for instance which come to my eye from their being not so much big dramatists as big paintersas loti is a painter are the inevitable result of the quantity of presenting their genius launches them in with the complexity they pile up they can get no clearness without trying again and again for new centres and they dont always get it however i dont mean to say they dont get enough and i hasten to add that you havei wholly recogniseevery right to reply to me cease your intolerable chatter and dry up your preposterous deluge if you will have the decent civility to wait you will see that i present alsoanch ioenough for every freedom i use with itand with my full assent to that and my profuse prostration

a little tale   it was in the days of his golden dreams that he first saw her and she immediately became one of themmade them glow with a new rosy fire the first night on leaving the theatre in his breathless ecstasy he could scarce compose himself to go home he wandered over the town murmuring to himself i want oh i want to write something for her he went again and again to see herhe was always there and after each occasion and even as the months and years rolled by kept repeating to himself and even to others what he did want to now one of these others was his great friend who irritated and probably jealous coldly and cynically replied you may want to but you wont no you will never write anything  i will he vehemently insisted and he added in presumptuous confidence just wait till she asks me and so they kept it up and he said that too often for the gf who exasperated ended by retorting  she never will  well you see if she doesnt  you must think said the gf scathingly  well what  why that she thinks youre somebody  shell find out in time that i am then shell ask me  ask who you are  nowith majesty to write something  then i shall be sorry for her because you wont  why not

i before the letter arrived i have spent much of the last two days with thembeautifully and sadly enough i think you need have no doubt as to the impression the constituted book will makeit will be one of extraordinarily rare particular and individual beauty i want to write about it really critically if i canie intelligently and interpretativelybut i sigh before the difficulty still i shall

however see what you need be uneasy about the young flame of life and agitation of genius in them flickers and heaves only to make one regret whatever more is not there never to make one feel your discretion has anywhere been at fault im not sure i dont think it has erred a little on the side of oversuppression one has the vague sense of omissions and truncationsone smells the things unprinted however that doubtless had to be but i dont see any mistake you have made with less there would have been no historyand one wants what made what makes for his history it all doesand so would more but you have given nothing that valuably doesnt be at peace  h j     to edmund gosse       this refers to a suggestion that stevensons body should be removed      from his place of burial on the

noble restingplace of those illustrious and helpless ashes i find myself somehow unable to think of louis in these days much more to speak of him without an emotion akin to tears and such blatant busybody ineptitude causes the cup to overflow and sickens as well as enrages but nothing but cheap newspaperism will come of itit has in it the power fortunately to drop utterly and abysmally if not

henrietta reubell   lamb house rye sunday midnight  nov 12th 1899  dear miss reubell  i have had great pleasure of your last good letter and this is a word of fairly prompt reconnaissance your bewilderment over the awkward age doesnt on the whole surprise mefor that ingenious volume appears to have excited little but bewildermentexcept indeed here thickwitted denunciation a work of art that one has to explain fails in so far i suppose of its mission i suppose i must at any rate mention that i had in view a certain special social highly modern and actual london group and type and tone which seemed to me to se prêter à merveille to an ironiclightly and simply ironictreatment and that clever people at least would know who in general and what one meant but here at least it appears there are very few clever people one must point with fingerpostsone must label with pancartesone must explain with conférences the form doubtless of my picture is against ita form all dramatic and scenicof presented episodes architecturally combined and each making a piece of the building with no going behind no telling about the figures save by their own appearance and action and with explanations reduced to the explanation of everything by all the other things in the picture mais il parait quil ne faut pas faire comme ça personne ny comprend rien jen suis pour mes fraisqui avaient été considérables très considérables yet i seem to make out you were interestedand that consoles me i think mrs brook the best thing ive ever doneand nanda also much done voilà mitchy marries aggie by a calculationin consequence of a state of minddelicate and deep but that i meant to show on his part as highly conceivable its absolute to him that n will never have himand she appeals to him for another girl whom she sees him as saving from thingsrealities she sees if he does it and she shows how she values him by wanting it it is still a way of getting and keeping near herof making for her to him a tie of gratitude she becomes as it were to him responsible for his happinessthey cant especially if the marriage goes ill not begiven the girl that nanda ismore rather than less together and the finale of the picture justifies him it leaves nanda precisely with his case on her hands farfetched well i daresay but so are diamonds and pearls and the beautiful reubell turquoises so i scribble to you to be sociable by my loudticking clock in this sleeping little town at my usual more than midnight hour  well also im like youi like growing that is i like for many reasons being old 56 but i dont like growing older i quite love my present age and the compensations simplifications freedom independences memories advantages of it but i dont keep it long enoughit passes too quickly but it mustnt pass all good as that is in writing to you there is nothing i shall like more to dream of than to be convoyed by you to the expositionist kraals of the savages and the haunts of the cannibals i surrender myself to you de confiancein vision and hopefor that purpose jonathan sturges lives year in year out at longs hotel bond st and promises to come down here and see me but never does he knows

is a most noble grave and admirable thing but its already tomorrow and i am yours always  henry james     to h g wells   lamb house rye november 20th 1899  my dear h g wells  you reduce me to mere gelatinous grovel and the worst of it is that you know so well how you with a magnanimity already so marked as to be dazzling sent me last summer a beautiful and discouraging volume which i never mastered the right combination of minutes and terms to thank you for as it deservedand then perfectly aware that this shameful consciousness had practically converted me to quivering pulp you let fly the shaft that has finished me in the fashion to which i now so distressfully testify it is really most kind and charming of you and the incident will figure largely in all your eventual biographies yet it is almost more than i can bear seriously i am extremely touched by your great humanity in the face of my atrocious bad manners i think the reason why i didnt write to thank you for the magnificent romance of three or four months ago was that i simply dreaded a new occasion for still more purple perjury on the subject of coming over to see you i wasi amcoming and yet i couldntand i cantsay it without steeping myself afresh in apparent falsehood to the eyes it is a weird tale of the acharnement of fate against an innocent actioni mean the history of my now immemorial failure which i must not attempt to tell you thus and now but reserve for your convinced from the moment it isnt averted ear on the day and at the very hour and moment that failure is converted to victory i am coming i was lately extremely sorry to hear that you have been somewhat unwell againunless it be a gross exaggeration heaven send that same i am coming i thank you very cordially for the two beautiful books the new tales i have already absorbed and to the best of my powers assimilated you fill me with wonder and admiration i think you have too great an unawareness of difficultyand for instance that the four big towns and nice blue foods and belching newstrumpets etc will be the least of the differences in the days to comebut its unfair to say that without saying a deal more which i cant and which isnt worth itand is besides irrelevant and ungracious your spirit is huge your fascination irresistible your resources infinite that is much more to the point and i am coming i heartily hope that if you have been incommoded it is already over and for a corrigible cause i am coming recall me please kindly to mrs wells and believe me i am coming very truly and veraciously yours  henry james     to charles eliot norton   dictated  lamb house rye  please read postscript first 24 november 1899  my dear charles  i heartily welcomed your typed letter of a couple of months ago both for very obvious and for respectable subsidiary reasons i am almost altogether reducedi would much rather say promotedto type myself and to communicate with a friend who is in the same predicament only adds to the luxury of the business i was never intended by nature to writemuch less to be without anguish read and i have recognised that perfectly patent law late in the day only when i might so much better have recognised it early it would have made a great difference in my lifemade me a much more successful person but the new england conscience interposed suggesting that the sense of being so conveniently assisted could only proceed somehow from the abyss so i floundered and fumbled and failed through long years for the mere want of the small dose of cynical courage required for recognising frankly my congenital inaptitude another proof or presumption surely of the immortality of the soul it takes one whole lifefor some persons at least dont je suisto learn how to live at all which is absurd if there is not to be another in which to apply the lesson i feel that in my next career i shall start in this particular at least from the first straight thank heaven i dont write such a hand as you then where would my conscience be  you wrote me from ashfield and i can give you more than country for country as i am still thank heaven out of townwhich is more and more my predominant and natural state i am only reacting i suppose against many many long years of london which has ended by giving me a deep sense of the quantity of cry in all that life compared to the almost total absence of wool by which i mean simply that acquaintances and relations there have a way of seeming at last to end in smokewhile having consumed a great deal of fuel and taken a great deal of time i dare say i shall some day reestablish the balance and i have kept my habitation there though i let it whenever i can but at present i am as conscious of the advantage of the sussex winter as of that of the sussex summer but ive just returned from three days in london mainly taken up with seeing my brother william as to whom your letter contained an anxious inquiry to which i ought before this to have done justice the difficulty has been these three months that he has been working with the most approved medical and special aid for a change of condition which one hoped would have been apparent by nowso that one might have good news to give i am sorry to say the change remains as yet but imperfectly apparentthough i dare say it has within the last month really begun his german curenauheimwas a great disappointment but he is at present in the hands of the best london man who professes himself entirely content with results actually reached the misfortune is that the regimen and treatmentthe last new oneare superficially depressing and weakening even when they are doing the right work and from that now i take william to be suffering ci vuol pazienza he will probably spend the winter in england whatever happens only alas his edinburgh lectures are indefinitely postponedand other renouncements of an unenlivening sort have had as indispensable precautions and prudences to follow they have placed their little girl very happily at school near windsor they are in convenient occupation at present of my london apartment and luckily the autumn has been as london autumns go quite cheerfullydistinguishablycrepuscular i am two hours and a half from town which is far enough thank heaven not to be near and yet near enough from the point of view of shillings invasions and other complications not to be far they have been with me for a while and i am looking for them again for longer william is able fortunately more or less to read and strikes me as so richly prepared by an immense quantity of thisto speak of that feature alonefor the edinburgh lecturesthat the pity of the frustration comes home the more a truce however to this darksome picturewhich may very well yet improve  i went a month ago during a day or two in town down to rottingdean to lunch with the kiplings those brighton trains are wondrous but failed to my regret to see lady burnejones their immediate neighbor as of course you know who was perversely though most accidentally from home but they told meand it was the first i knewof her big project of publishing the dear beautiful mans correspondence copious it appears in a degree of which i had not a conception living in london near him though not seeing him thanks to the same odious london half so often as i desired i seldom heard from him on paper and hadnt at all in short the measure of his being as the ks assured me he proves to have been a great letterwriter   28th nov  i was interrupted my dear charles the other day difficulties then multiplied and i only now catch on again i see on reading over your letter that you are quite au courant of lady b js plan and i of course easily take in that she must have asked you as one of his closest correspondents for valuable material yet i dont know that i wholly echo your deprecation of these givings to the world the best letters seem to me the most delightful of all written thingsand those that are not the best the most negligible if a correspondence in other words has not the real charm i wouldnt have it published even privately if it has on the other hand i would give it all the glory of the greatest literature b js i should say must have it the real charmsince he did as appears surrender to it is this not so at all events we shall indubitably see as for b j i miss him not less but more as year adds itself to year and the hole he has left in the london horizon the eclipse of the west kensington oasis is a thing much to help one to turn ones back on town and this in spite of the fact that his work alas had long ceased to interest me with its element of painful niggling embroiderythe stitchbystitch process that had come at last to beg the painter question altogether even the poetrythe kind of itthat he tried for appeared to me to have wandered away from the real thing and yet the being himself grew only more loveable natural and wise too late too late i gather à propos of him that you have read mackails morris which seems to me quite beautifully and artistically donewonderful to say for a contemporary english biography it is really composed the effect really producedan effect not altogether i think happy or even endurable as regards morris himselffor whom the formula strikes me as beingbeing at least largelythat he was a boisterous boyish british man of action and practical faculty launched indeed by his imagination but really floundering and romping and roaring through the arts both literary and plastic very much as a bull through a chinashop i felt much moved after reading the book to try to write with the aid of some of my own recollections and impressions something possibly vivid about it but we are in a moment of such excruciating vulgarity that nothing worth doing about anything or anyone seems to be wanted or welcomed anywhere the great little rudyardà propos of rottingdeanstruck me as quite on his feet again and very sane and sound and happy yet i am afraid youll think me a very disgusted person if i show my reserves again over his recent incarnations i cant swallow his loud brazen patriotic versean exploitation of the patriotic idea for that matter which seems to me not really much other than the exploitation of the name of ones mother or ones wife two or three times a centuryyes but not every month he is however such an embodied little talent so economically constructed for all use and no waste that he will get again upon a good roadleading not into mere multitudinous noise his talent i think quite diabolically great and this in spitehere i am at it againof the misguided the unfortunate stalky stalky gives him away aesthetically as a man in his really now as regards our roaring race bardic condition should not have allowed himself to be given that is not a thing however that in our paradise of criticism appears to occur to so much as three persons and meanwhile the sale i believe is tremendous basta basta  we are living of course under the very black shadow of s africa where the nut is proving a terribly hard one to crack and where alas things will probably be worse before they are better one ranges ones self on the whole to the belief not only that they will be better but that they really had to be taken in hand to be made so they wouldnt and couldnt do at all as they were but the job is immense complicated as it is by distance transport and many preliminary illusions and stupidities friends moreover right and left have their young barbarians in the thick of it and are living so from day to day in suspense and darkness that in certain cases their images fairly haunt one it reminds me strangely of some of the faraway phases and feelings of our big dim war what tremendously ancient history that now seemsbut i am launching at you my dear charles a composition of magnitudewhen i meant only to encumber you with a good affectionate note i have presently to take on myself a care that may make you smile nothing less than to proceed a few moments hence to dover to meet our celebrated friend i think she cant not be yours mrs jack gardner who arrives from brussels charged with the spoils of the flemish school and kindly pays me a fleeting visit on her way up to town i must rush off help her to disembark see all her van eycks and rubenses through the customs and bring her hither where three watercolours and four photographs of the rye school will let her down easily my little backwater is just off the highway from london to the continent i am really quite near dover and its absurd how also quite near italy that makes me feel to get there without the interposition of the lumbering london or even if need be of the bristling paris seems so to simplify the matter to the mind and yet i grieve to say that in a residence here of a year and a half i have only been to patria nostra once goodbye my dear charlesi must catch my train fortunately i am but three minutes from the station fortunately also you are not to associate with this fact anything grimy or noisy or otherwise suggestive of fever and fret at rye even the railway is quaintor at least its neighbours are  yours always affectionately henry james   january 13 1900  ps this should be a prescript rather than a postscript my dear charles to prepare you properly for the monstrosity of my having dictated a letter to you so long ago and then kept it over unposted into the next centuryif next century it be they are fighting like cats and dogs here as to where in our speck of time we are there has been a method in my madnessmy delay has not quite been not wholly been an accident though there was at first that intervention what happened was that i had to dash off and catch a train before i had time to read this over and enclose it and that on the close of that adventure which lasted a couple of days and was full of distractions i had in a still more belated and precipitate way to rush up to london these sheets meanwhile languished in an unfrequented drawer into which after hurrying off i had at random thrust them and there they remained till my return from londonwhich was not for nearly a fortnight when i came back here i brought down william and his wife the former at the time so off his balance as to give me almost nothing but him to think about and it thereby befell that some days more elapsed before i rediscovered my letter reading it over then i had the feeling that it gave a somewhat unduly emphasised account of w whereupon i said to myself since it has waited so long i will keep it a while longer so as to be able to tell better things that is just then what i have done and i am very glad in consequence to be able to tell them only i am again it seems a fategiving you a strangely false impression of my normally quiet life on the point of catching a train i go with w and a a short time hence onagainto dovera very small and convenient journey from thisto see them so far on their way to the pursuit for the rest of the winter of southern sunshine they will cross the channel tomorrow or next day and proceed as they find convenient to hyèreswhich as he himself has written to you you doubtless already know i do at any rate feel much more at ease about him now the sight of the good he can get even by sitting for a chance hour or two all muffled and hotwatered in such sun pale and hindered sun as a poor little english garden can give him in midwinter quite makes me feel that a real climate the real thing will do much toward making him over he needs itthough differentlyeven as a consumptive does and moreover he has become these last weeks much more fit to go find it qed but this shall be posted yours more than ever before  h j     to edmund gosse   lamb house rye january 1st 1900  my dear gosse  i much welcome your note and feel the need of exonerationsas to my own notelessness it was very good of you staggering on this gruesome threshold and meeting only new burdens i fear of correspondence as its most immediate demonstration to find a moment to waggle me so much as a little finger i was painfully conscious of my long silenceafter a charming book from you never properly acknowledged etc but i have been living with very few odd moments or offhours of leisure and my neglect of every one and everything is now past reparation the presence with me of my brother sisterinlaw and little niece has with a particular pressure of work walled me in and condemned my communications my brother for whom this snug and secure little nook appears to have been soothing and sustaining is better than when he came and i am proportionately less depressed but i still go on tiptoe and live from day to day however that way one does go on they go probably by the middle of the month to the south of franceand a right climate a real one has presumably much to give him  i never thanked youen connaissance de causefor m hewletts italian novelle of so brilliant a cleverness and so much more developed a one than his former book they are wonderful for go and grace and general ability and would almost make me like the genre if anything could but i so hunger and thirst in this deluge of cheap romanticism and chromolithographic archaics babyish puppyish as evocation all it seems to me for a note a gleam of reflection of the life we live of artistic or plastic intelligence of it something one can say yes or no to as discrimination perception observation renderingthat i am really not a judge of the particular commodity at all i am out of patience with it and have it pardessus les oreilles what i dont doubt of is the agility with which hewlett does it but oh italythe italy of italy basta  may the glowering year clear its dark face for all of us before it has done with us vale goodnight  yours always henry james     to mrs everard cotes       this refers to mrs cotess novel his honor and a lady and to a      suggestion that its manner in some way resembled his own   lamb house rye january 26th 1900  dear mrs cotes  i grovel in the dustso ashamed am i to have made no response to your so generous bounty and to have left you unthanked and unhonoured and all the while i was at once so admiring your consummately clever book and so blushing to the heels and groaning to the skies over the daily paralysis of my daily intention to make you some at least if not adequate commonly courteous and approximately intelligible sign and i have absolutely no valid no sound excuse to make but that i am like thati mean i am an abandonedly bad writer of letters and acknowledger of kindnesses i throw myself simply on my confirmed in old age hatred of the unremunerated penfrom which one would think i have a remunerated one  your book is extraordinarily keen and delicate and able how can i tell if its like me i dont know what me is like i cant see my own tricks and arts my own effect from outside at all i can only say that if it is like me then im much more of a gros monsieur than i ever dreamed we are neither of us dying of simplicity or common addition thats all i can make out and we are both very intelligent and observant and conscious that a work of art must make some small effort to be one must sacrifice somehow and somewhere to the exquisite or be an asininity altogether so we open the door to the devil himselfwho is nothing but the sense of beauty of mystery of relations of appearances of abysses of the wholeand of expression thats all he is and if he is our common parent im delighted to welcome you as a sister and to be your brother one or two things my acute critical intelligence murmured to me as i read i think your drama lacks a little linebony structure and palpable as it were tense cordon which to string the pearls of detail its the frequent fault of womens workand i like a rope the rope of the direction and march of the subject the action pulled like a taut cable between a steamer and a tug from beginning to end it lapses and lapses along a trifle too liquidlyand is too much conceived i think in dialoguei mean considering that it isnt conceived like a play another reflection the western idiot makes is that he is a little tormented by the modern mixture maddening medley of our cosmopolite age of your india vast preconceived and absentlypresent and your subject not of indian essence the two thingselementsdont somehow illustrate each other and are juxtaposed only by the terrible globeshrinkage but thats not your faultits mine that i suffer from it go on and go onyou are full of talent of the sense of life and the instinct of presentation of wit and perception and resource voilà  it would be much more to the point to talk of these things with you and some day again this must indeed be but just now i am talking with fewwintering for many good reasons in the excessive tranquillity of this tiny inarticulate country town in which i have a house really adapted to but the balmier half of the year and there is nothing cheerful to talk of south africa darkens all our sky here and i gloom and brood and have craven questions of finis britanniae in solitude your indian vision at least keeps that abjectness away from you but goodnight its past midnight my little heavyheaded and heavyhearted city sleeps the stillness ministers to fresh flights of the morbid fancy and i am yours dear mrs cotes most constantly  henry james     to a f de navarro   lamb house rye april 1st 1900  my dear brave don tony and dear beautiful doña mary not that tony isnt beautiful too or that mary isnt brave you are awfully exclusive you wont be written to if you can help itor if i can but wonderful as you individually and conjoinedly are you must still taste of the common cupyou must recognise that after all you are humanly exposed well this is all at the worst you are exposed to to my only scribbling at you a little for the pride of the thought of you a fellow has feelings hang itand the feelings will overflow i am a very sentient and affectionate albeit outoftheway and outofthefashion person i like to add with my own clumsy fingers a small knot to the silken cord that for the starved romance of my life does by gods blessing happen to unite me to two or three of my really decorative contemporaries besides if you will write such enchanting letters the communication that a few days ago in london reached me from each of you makes up for many grey things many things are grey in a blafard english march and moist english clubchambers tell me not of the pains of provence without our gifted jon close at hand i should have parted forever with my sense of colour however i dont want simply to thank you for all the present the past and the futurei want also to say right distinctly that if you can conveniently send me a copy of laiglon youll stick the biggest feather yet in your cap of grace i believe the book isnt yet outso i shall be as patient as i am attached you couldnt do a more charming thingand nobody but you could do as charming a onei hold you both fast and am your fond and faithful old friend  henry james  ps i send this to cf as you may have shifted how delightful your picture of the little timebeating boy what a family     to w d howells       the sense of the past the first chapters of which were written      at this time was presently laid aside and not continued until the      autumn of 1914 the other projected tale of terror referred to      in this letter was never carried out there seems to be no      indication of its subject   lamb house rye 29th june 1900  my dear howells  i cant emulate your wonderful little cursive type on your delicate little sheetsthe combination of which seems to suggest that you dictate at so much an hour to an annisquam fairy but i will do what i can and make out to be intelligible to you even over the joy it is ever and always to hear from you you say that had you not been writing me the particular thing you were you fear you wouldnt have been writing at all but it is a compliment i can better i really believe that if i werent writing you this on my side i should be writing you something else for ive been of late reading you again as continuously as possiblethe worst i mean by which is as continuously as the booksellers consent and the result of ragged lady the silver journey the pursuit of the piano and two or three other things none wrested from your inexorable hand but paid for from scant earnings has been ever so many times over an impulse of reaction of an intensely cordial sort directly at youall alas spending itself for sad and sore want of you in the heavy air of this alien clime and the solitude here of my unlettered life i wrote to you to kittery pointi think it wassomething like a year ago and my chief occupation since then has been listening for the postmans knock but let me quickly add that i understand overwhelmingly well what you say of the impossibility for you at this time of day of letters god knows they are impossiblethe great fatal incurable unpumpable leak of ones poor sinking bark non ragioniam di lori understand all about it and it only adds to the pleasure with which even on its personal side i greet your present communication  this communication let me without a shred of coyness instantly declare much interests and engages meto the degree even that i think i find myself prepared to post you on the spot a round or a square rather i wont go through any simpering as to the goodness of your having thought of menor even through any frank gaping though there might be for my admiration and awe plenty of that over the wonder of your multiform activity and dauntlessly universal life basta that i will write anything in life that anyone asks me in decencyand a fortiori that you so gracefully ask i can only feel it to be enough for me that you have a hand in the affair that you are giving a book yourself and engaging yourself otherwise and that i am in short in your company what i understand is that my little novel shall be of fifty thousand 50000 words neither more i take it nor less and that i shall receive the sum mentioned in the prospectus down in advance of royalties on such delivery i shall probably in point of fact in my financial humility prefer when the time comes to avail myself of the alternative right mentioned in the prospectusthat of taking instead of a royalty for the two years lease the larger sum formed by the somuchaword aggregation but that i shall be clear about when the work is done i only glance at this now as probable it so happens that i can get at the book i think almost immediately and do it within the next three or four months you will therefore unless you hear from me a short time hence to the contrary probably receive it well before december as for the absoluteness of the order i am willing to take it as practically sufficiently absolute if you shouldnt like it there is something else definite enough that i can do with it what however concerns me more than anything else is to take care that you shall like it i tell myself that i am not afraid  i brood with mingled elation and depression on your ingenious your really inspired suggestion that i shall give you a ghost and that my ghost shall be international i say inspired because singularly enough i set to work some months ago at an international ghost and on just this scale 50000 words entertaining for a little the highest hopes of him he was to have been wonderful and beautiful he was to have been called perhaps too metaphysically the sense of the past and he was to have been supplied to a certain mr  who was then approaching mehad then approached me the outstretched arm however alas was drawn in again or lopped off or otherwise paralysed and negatived and i was left with my little projectintrinsically i hasten to add and most damnably difficulton my hands it is very possible however it is indeed most probable that i should have broken down in the attempt to do him this particular thing and this particular thing divine sublime if i could do it is not i think what i shall now attempt to nurse myself into a fallacious faith that i shall be able to pull off for howells and clarke the damnable difficulty is the reason i have rarely been beaten by a subject but i felt myself after upwards of a months work destined to be beaten by that one this will sufficiently hint to you how awfully good it is but it would take too long for me to tell you here more vividly just how and why it would as well to tell you still more subtly and irresistibly why its difficult there it lies and probably will always lie  im not even sure that the international ghost is what will most bear being worried outthough again in another particular the circumstances combining with your coincident thought seemed pointed by the finger of providence what  wanted was two talesboth tales of terror and making another duplex book like the two magics accordingly i had had dreadful deed to puzzle out more or less a second a different piece of impudence of the same general type but i had only when the project collapsed caught hold of the tip of the tail of this other monsterwhom i now mention because his tail seemed to show him as necessarily still more interesting than no 1 if i can at all recapture him or anything like him i will do my best to sit down to him and mount him with due neatness in short i will do what i can if i cant be terrible i shall nevertheless still try to be international the difficulties are that its difficult to be terrible save in the short piece and international save in the long but trust me i add little more this by itself will begin by alarming you as a precipitate instalment of my responsive fury i rejoice to think of you as basking on your indian shore this shore is as little indian as possible and we have hithertofor the seasonhad to combat every form of inclemency today however is so charming that frankly i wish you were all planted in a row in the little old garden into which i look as i write to you old as it is a couple of hundred years it wouldnt be too old even for mildred but these thoughts undermine the country scenes in your books make me homesick for new england smells and even sounds annisquam for instance is a smell as well as a sound may it continue sweet to you charles norton and sally were with me lately for a day or two and you were one of the first persons mentioned between us you were the person mentioned most tenderly it was strange and pleasant and sad and all sorts of other things to see charles again after so many years i found him utterly unchanged and remarkably young but i found myself with him methusalesque and alien i shall write you again when my subject condenses i embrace you all and am yours my dear howells always  henry james     to w d howells       the book already begun and now the greatest obsession of all is      evidently the ambassadors   dictated read ps aug 14th first  lamb house rye august 9 1900  my dear howells  i duly received and much pondered your second letter charming and vivid from annisquam the one i mean in reply to mine dispatched immediately on the receipt of your first if i havent since its arrival written to you this is because precisely i needed to work out my question somewhat further first my impulse was immediately to say that i wanted to do my little stuff at any rate and was willing therefore to take any attendant risk however measured as the little stuff would be at the worst a thing i should see my way to dispose of in another manner but the problem of the little stuff itself intrinsically worried meto the extent i mean of my not feeling thoroughly sure i might make of it what i wanted and above all what your conditions of space required the thing was therefore to try and satisfy myself practicallyby threshing out my subject to as near an approach to certainty as possible this i have been doing with much intensitybut with the result i am sorry to say of being still in the air let the present accordingly pass for a provisional communicationnot to leave your last encompassed with too much silence lending myself as much as possible to your suggestion of a little tale of terror that should be also international i took straight up again the idea i spoke to you of having already some months ago tackled and for various reasons laid aside i have been attacking it again with intensity and on the basis of a simplification that would make it easier and have done for it thus 110 pages of type the upshot of this alas however is that though this second start is if ior if youlike magnificent it seriously confronts me with the element of length showing me i fear but too vividly that do what i will for compression i shall not be able to squeeze my subject into 50000 words it will make even if it doesnt for difficulty still beat me 70000 or 80000dreadful to say and that faces me as an excessive addition to the ingredient of risk we speak of on the other hand i am not sure that i can hope to substitute for this particular affair another affair of terror which will be expressible in the 50000 and that for an especial reason this reason is that above all when one has done the thing already as i have rather repeatedly it is not easy to concoct a ghost of any freshness the want of ease is extremely marked moreover if the thing is to be done on a certain scale of length one might still toss off a spook or two more if it were a question only of the shortstory dimension but prolongation and extension constitute a strain which the merely apparitionaldiscounted also as by my past dealings with itdoesnt do enough to mitigate the beauty of this notion of the sense of the past of which i have again as i tell you been astride is precisely that it involves without the stale effect of the mere bloated bugaboo the presentation for folk both in and out of the book of such a sense of gruesome malaise as can onlysuccess being assumedmake the fortune in the literary world of every one concerned i havent in it really that is save in one very partial preliminary and expository connection to make anything or anybody appear to anyone what the case involves is awfully interestingly and thrillingly that the central figure the subject of the experience has the terror of a particular ground for feeling and fearing that he himself is or may at any moment become a producer an object of this for you and me state of panic on the part of others he lives in an air of malaise as to the malaise he may woefully more or less fatally find himself creatingand that roughly speaking is the essence of what i have seen it is less gross much less banal and exploded than the dear old familiar bugaboo produces i think for the reader an almost equal funkor at any rate an equal suspense and unrest and carries with it as i have fixed it a more truly curious and interesting dramaespecially a more human one but as i say there are the necessities of space as to which i have a dread of deluding myself only to find that by trying to blink them i shall be grossly sold or by giving way to them shall positively spoil my form for your purpose the hitch is that the thing involves a devil of a sort of prologue or preliminary actioninteresting itself and indispensable for luciditywhich impinges too considerably for brevity on the core of the subject my one chance is yet i admit to try to attack the same the subject from still another quarter at still another angle that i make out as a possible one and which may keep it squeezable and short if this experiment fails i fear i shall have to chuck the supernatural and the high fantastic i have just finished as it happens a fine flight of eighty thousand words into the high fantastic which has rather depleted me or at any rate affected me as discharging my obligations in that quarter but i believe i mentioned to you in my last the sacred fountthis has been sold to methuen here and by this time probably to somebody else in the usbut alas not to be serialized as to which indeed it is inaptas to the title of which kindly preserve silence the vraie vérité the fundamental truth lurking behind all the rest is furthermore no doubt that preoccupied with half a dozen things of the altogether human order now fermenting in my brain i dont care for terror terror that is without pity so much as i otherwise might this would seem to make it simple for me to say to you hang it if i cant pull off my monster on any terms ill just do for you a neat little humanand not the less internationalfiftythousander consummately addressed to your more cheerful department do for you in other words an admirable short novel of manners thrilling too in its degree but definitely ignoring the bugaboo well this i dont positively despair of still sufficiently overtaking myself to be able to think of that card one has always thank god up ones sleeve and the production of it is only a question of a little shake of the arm at the same time here to be frankand above all you will say in this communication to be interminablethat alternative is just a trifle compromised by the fact that ive two or three things begun ever so beautifully in such a key and only awaiting the rush of the avid biddereach affecting me with its particular obsession and one the most started affecting me with the greatest obsession for the time till i can do it work it off get it out of the way and fall with stillaccumulated intensity upon the others of all but alas if i dont say bang off that this is then the thing i will risk for you it is because this like its companions isnt any way i can fix it workable as a fiftythousander the scheme to which i am now alluding is lovelyhuman dramatic international exquisitely pure exquisitely everything only absolutely condemned from the germ up to be workable in not less than 100000 words if 100000 were what you had asked me for i would fall back upon it terror failing like a flash and even send you without delay a detailed scenario of it that i drew up a year ago beginning thena year agoto do the thingimmediately afterwards and then again pausing for reasons extraneous and economic it really constitutes at any rate the work i intimately want actually to be getting on with andif you are not overdone with the profusion of my confidencei dare say i best put my case by declaring that if you dont in another month or two hear from me either as a terrorist or as a cheerful internationalist it will be that intrinsic difficulties will in each case have mastered me the difficulty in the one having been to keep my terror down by any ingenuity to the 50000 and the difficulty in the other form of cheer than the abovementioned obsessive hundredthousander i only wish you wanted him but i have now in all probability a decent outlet for him  forgive my pouring into your lap this torrent of mingled uncertainties and superfluities the latter indeed they are properly not if only as showing you how our question does occupy me i shall write you againhowever vividly i see you wince at the prospect of it i have it at heart not to fail to let you know how my alternatives settle themselves please believe meanwhile in my very hearty thanks for your intimation of what you might perhaps your own quandary straightening out see your way to do for me it is a kind of intimation that i find i confess even at the worst dazzling all this however trips up my response to your charming picture of your whereabouts and present conditionsstill discernible in spite of the chill of years and absence to my eye and eke to my ear of memory we have had here a torrid but not a wholly horrid july but are making it up with a brave august so far as we have got of fires and floods and storms and overcoats through everything none the less my purpose holdsmy genius i may even say absolutely thrivesand i am unbrokenly yours  henry james   14th august  ps the hand of providence guided me after finishing the preceding to which the present is postscriptal to keep it over a few days instead of posting it directly so possible i thought it that i might have something more definite to addand i was a little nervous about the way i had left our question behold then i have then to add that i have just received your letter of august 4which so simplifies our situation that this accompanying stuff becomes almost superfluous but i have let it go for the sake of the interest the almost topheavy mass of response that it embodies let us put it then that all is for the moment for the best in this worst of possible worlds all the more that had i not just now been writing you exactly as i am i should probablyand thanks precisely to the lapse of daysbe stammering to you the ungraceful truth that after i wrote you my tale of terror did as i was so more than half fearing give way beneath me it has in short broken down for the present i am laying it away on the shelf for the sake of something that is in it but that i am now too embarrassed and preoccupied to devote more time to pulling out i really shouldnt wonder if it be not still in time and place to make the world sit up but the curtain is dropped for the present all thanks for your full and prompt statement of how the scene has shifted for you there is no harm done and i dont regard the three weeks spent on my renewed wrestle as wastedi have within three or four days rebounded from them with such relief vaulting into another saddle and counting dv on a straighter run i have two begun novels which will give me plenty to do for the presentthey being of the type of the serious which i am too delighted to see you speak of as lifting again  its downtrodden head i mean at any rate i assure you to lift mine your extremely touchingly kind offer to find moments of your precious time for handling something i might send you is altogether too momentous for me to let me fail of feeling almost ashamed that i havent somethingthe ghost or tother stuffin form already to enable me to respond to your generosity as meant but heaven only knows what may happen yet for the moment i must peg away at what i have in handbiggish stuff i fear in bulk and possible unserialisability to saddle you withal but thanks thanks thanks delighted to hear of one of your cold wavesthe newspapers here invidiously mentioning none but your hot we have them all moreover réchauffées as soon as you have done with them and we are just sitting down to one now i dictate you this in my shirtsleeves and in a draught which fails of strengthchilling none of the pulses of yours gratefully and affectionately  henry james     to w e norris   lamb house rye september 26th 1900  my dear norris  charming and gracious your letter and welcome sign of your restoration in more senses than one though i see you alas nowadays at such intervals i feel this extremely individual little island to be appreciably less its characteristic self when you are away from it and sensibly more so and breathing the breath of relief when it gets you back and plumps you down with a fond there on your high hilltop a beaconlike depository of traditions no one else so admirably embodies your invitation to come and share for a few days your paradise with you finds me i am very sorry to say in a hindered and helpless moment i am obliged to recognise the stern fact that i cant leave home just now i have had a complicated and quite overwhelmed summeragreeably interestingly anxiously and worriedly even but inevitably and logicallywaves of family history a real deluge having rolled over my bowed head and left me as to the question of work production time ease and other matters quite high and dry i went on saturday last to dover to see my sisterinlaw off to the continentand as she took a night boat had to stop there over sunday at the toofamiliar and too other things lord warden after which i came back to bury yes bury my precious my admirable little peter whom i think you had met he passed away on sunday at st leonards fondly attended by the local canine specialistafter three days of dreadful little dysentery thus is constituted the first moment of my being by myself for about four months it may last none too long and is already to be tempered by the palpable presence of gosse from saturday pm to monday next so with arrears untold in every direction with preoccupations but just temporarily arranged i feel that i absolutely must sit close for a good many weeks to come in fact till the new yearafter which i depart i dont quite know what becomes of me then but i dont distinctly for a third year hibernate here my london rooms are as probably as sordidly let for 1901 though not to a certainty and it will my wretched fatenot fatfate depend more or less upon that my brother ill but thank god better wants me to come to egypt with him and his wife for 12 weekshis health demanding it but he only going if i will accompany him so the pistol is at my head will it bring me down ive a positive terror of it the alternatives are rome of which ive a still greater terror than of egypt for its an equal complication and less reward or de vere gardens or a more squalid perch in town if de vg are closed to me the latter the lastnamed doom is what i really want if i should clingingly clutchingly stick to these shores i might then were it agreeable to you be able to put in three days of underbank which ive never seen in its tragic winter mood but these things are in the lap of the gods   later same night  i broke off this am to go over to lydd where ive had all summer a friend in camp and promised to pay him a visit my amanuensis who has been taking at the paris exhibition a week of joy refused to his employer and indeed wholly undesired by himdid your slow return from marienbad partly consist of the same comes back tomorrow and my friends battalion departs on saturdayso it was my one chance to redeem my perpetually falsified vow i went by train and bicycled backin the teeth of a gale now fully developed here and howling in my old chimneys which sounds the knell of this to do it justice incomparable september i dont quite know what drury lane military drama effects i had counted onbut i trundled home with the depressed sense of something that hadnt wholly come off in the way of a romantic appeal a dusty scrubby plain in which dirty baby soldiers pigged about with nothing particular to do however ive performed my promise and i sit down to a pile of correspondence that for many days past has refused visibly to shrink you excite with your scandinavian and austrian holidays and junketings the envious amaze of poor motionless and shillingless me ive been thinking of appealing to your suffrages but i more and more feel that i could never afford you my watering place is hastings and my round tour is rounded by the afternoon but goodnight my servant has just deposited by my side the glass of boiling water which constitutes his nightly admonition that its high time i went to bedand constitutes my own inexpensive emulation of marienbad and copenhagenwhere i am sure gosse drinks the most exotic things please say to miss effie that i doubly regret having to be deaf to any kind urgency of hers and that i hope she will find means to include me in some prayer for the conversion of the benighted but my hot water is cooling and it takes me so long to let it gouge its inward course that i will be first yours my dear norris alwaysthough im afraid you will say always impracticably  henry james     to a f de navarro        the place of the thirty peacocks was h js name for the old      moated house of groombridge place near tunbridge wells which he      had visited some years before with mr de navarro  lamb house rye november 13 1900  dear and exquisite tony  i would deal death or à peu près to the man who should have said that i would have delayed these too many days to acknowledge your beautiful little letter fromor aboutthe place of the thirty peacocks yet he low wretch would have been after all in the secrets of fate he would have foreseen me a good deal accablé with arrears interruptions a deluge of proofsheets a complexity of duties and distractions he would have heard in advance my ineffectual groans and even have pitied my baffled efforts these things have eventuated tonight in the irresistible desire to chat with you by the fire before turning in the fire burns low and the clock marks midnight everything but the quantity of combustion reminds me of those small nocturnal hours two years ago when i was communing with you thus and the fire didnt burn low you saved my life then and my house and all that was mine and for aught i know you are now saving us all againfrom some other deadly element tonight its wateror the absense of it i dont quite understand which something has happened to my water supply through a pullingup of the street though it doesnt yet quite appear whether im to perish by thirst or by submersion here i sit as usual at any rate holding on to youalso as usualwhile the clock ticks in the stillnessi cant tell you how happily inspired i feel it to have been of you to remember our erstwhile pilgrimage to the maeterlinck house and moat and peacocks and ladiesfor thats howas a moated maeterlinck matterthe whole impression of our old visit yours and mine and miss reubells comes back to me i rejoice that they are still en place and how glad they must have been to see you willingly would i too taste again the sweet old impressionwhich your letter charmingly expresses but i seem to travel to peregrinate less and lessand i am reduced to living on my past accumulations i wish they were larger but i make the most of them they include very closely you and mrs you to them i do seem reduced with you what with our so far separated country settlements and present absence of a london common centre save the bond st corner of which j s is the pivot memories and sighs echoes and ghosts are our terms of intercourse you oughtnt you know to have driven in stakes in your merciless midland this southern shore twinkling and twittering with a semiforeign light a kind of familiar wink in the air would have favoured your health your spirits and heaven knows your being here would have favoured mine i breakfast all these weeks mostly with my window open to the garden and a flood of sunshine pouring in its really meridional it wouldrye wouldremind you of granadamore or less but i hope after xmas to be in town for three or four months you will surely pass and repass there when i at intervals go up on some practical urgency for three or four hours i always see the abysmal jon he usually has some news of you to give and when he hasnt its not for want ofon my partsolemn invocation however i must now solemnly invoke slumber goodnightgoodmorning i bless your house its glorious mistress and its innocent heir  yours always and ever henry james     to w e norris   lamb house rye december 23rd 1900  my dear norris  i greatly desire that this shall not fail to convey you my sentiments on this solemn xmas morn so i sit here planning and plotting and making wellmeant pattes de mouche to that genial end a white seafog closes us in in which ive walked healthily with my young niece out to the linkswith the sense of being less of a golfist than ever the clock ticks and the fire crackles during the period between tea and dinner the young niece aforesaid my only companion this season of mirth with her parents abroad and a scant snatch of school holidays to spend with me sits near me immersed in redgauntlet so the moment seems to lend itself to my letting off this signal in such a manner as may even in these troublous times when my nerves are all gone and i feel as if anything shall easily happen catch your indulgent eye i feel as if i hadnt caught your eye for all its indulgence for a long and weary time and i daresay you wont gainsay my confession may the red glow of the yuletide log diffuse itself at underbank with plenty of fenders and fireguards and raking out at night in a good old jovial manner i think of you all on the lincombes c in these months as a very highfeeding champagnequaffing orchidarranging society and my gaze wanders a little wistfully toward youaway from my plain broth and barleywater i in fact some three weeks ago fled from that spartan diet up to town hoping to be in the mood to remain there till easter and the experience is still going on with this week here inserted as a picturesque parenthesis i asked my young niece in the glow of last august not to fail to spend her xmas with me as i then expected to be prometheanlike on my rock and ive returned to my rock not to leave her in the lurch and i find a niece does temper solitude  london at all events seems to me after long expatriation rather thrillingall the more that i have the thrill the quite anxious throb of a new little habitationwhich makes alas the third that i am actually master of ive taken with 34 de vere gardens still on my hands but blessedly let for another year to come and then to be wriggled out of with heavens help a permanent room at a club reform which seems to solve the problem of town on easy terms they are let by the year only and one waits ones turn longfor years but when mine the other day came round i went it blind instead of letting it pass one has to furnish and do all ones selfbut the results and conditions generally repay my cell is spacious southern looking over carlton gardens and tranquil utterly and singularly wellserviced and i find i can work therethere being ample margin for a typewriter and its priest or even priestess it all hung by thatbut i think i am not deceived so i bear up and the next time you come to perch at a neighbouring establishment i shall sweep down on you from my eyrie its astonishing how remote cumbrous and expensive it makes 34 de vere gardens seem worse luck that that millstone still dangles gracefully from my neck  ive now dined and reestablished my niece with the second volume of redgauntletbesides plying her at dessert with delicacies brought down à son intention from fortnum  mason and thus with a good conscience i prepare to close this and to sally forth into the seafog to post it with my own handif its to reach you at any congruous moment i yesterday dismissed a servant at an hours noticethe house of the lamb scarce knew itself and felt like that of the wolfso that with reduced resources i make myself generally useful besides at little huddled neighbourly rye even a white december seafog is a cosy and convenient thing  so good night and all blessings on your tropic home may your table groan with the memorials of friendship and may miss effies midnight masses not make her late for breakfast and her share of themwhich is a little even in these poor words from yours my dear norris always  henry james     to a f de navarro   lamb house rye december 29th 1900  dear and splendid tony  they are all admirable and exquisitefor i seem to have received so much from you that all is the only indication comprehensive enough i came down from ten days in town the other day to find laiglon and within three or four the beautiful little pocketdiary has added itself to that obligation dear and splendid tony let me not even scarcely speak of my obligations that way lies prostration the sense of deep unworthyness wrongly spelledto show how unworthi i am the memory and vision of a little library of bond st booklets that collectors toward the end of 1901 will cut each others throats for and what do i know besides i am more touched than i can say in short by your fidelity in every particular laiglon now that we at last have the glittering text has been a joy to me of the finest kind here by the xmas fireside i havent seen the thing doneand i dont hugely want to i so represent it to myself as i go the talent the effect the art the mastery the brilliancy are all prodigious the man really has talent like an attack of smallpoxi mean it rages with as purple an intensity and might almost one vainly feels as one reads be contagious you have given me by your admirable consideration an exquisite pleasure i wish we could talk of these things but we are like the buckets in the well make me a preliminary sign the first time you pass for the present goodnight my xmas letters are still mainly unwritten and they are many and much i greet you and mrs tony very constantly i wish you a big slice of the new century and i am yours ever so gratefully  henry james     to the viscountess wolseley   lamb house rye dec 29 1900  dearest lady wolseley  this is a very faint and meagre little word addressed to you late of a terrifically windy winters night by an old friend who doesnt happenb to be in very good physical case only for the moment thank goodness probably and yet who doesnt want the new year to edge an hour nearer before he has made you bothmade you all threea sign of affectionate remembrance amounting to tenderness pure and simple i wish there were a benediction i could call down on your house and your associated life in sufficiently immediate and visible form you would then see it flutter into your midst and perch upon your table even while you read these lines i have thought of you constantly these past weeks and have only not written to you from the fear of appearing to assume that your retirement has been to you woeful or in any degree heartbreaking i couldnt congratulate you positively on the event and yet i hated to condole in the case of people so gallant and distinguished so i have been hovering about you in thought like an anxious mother armed in the evening air with a shawl or extra wrap for a pair of belated but highspirited children liable to feel a chill but not quite venturing to approach the young people and clap the article on their shoulders i have remained in short with my warm shawl on my hands but if i were near you i should clap it straight on your shoulders at the first symptom of a shiver and wrap it close round and tuck it thoroughly in forgive this feeble image of the confirmed devotion i hold at your service to see you will be a joy and a reliefthe next time i go up to town i mean if it so befalls that you are then in residence at the palace i do go up on the 31stmonday nextto stay till easter where my address is 105 pall mall s w and if you should be at hampton court the least sign from you would bring me begging for a cup of tea i hope meanwhile with all my heart that these weeks spent in looking after so many years comparative leisure in the face have had somewhat the effect of mitigating the austerity of that countenance there are opportunities always lurking in itthe opportunity heavensent in lord wolseleys caseas i venture to think of itof sitting down again to the engaging marlborough but here i am talking as if you wouldnt know what to do whatever you do or dont please believe both of you in the great personal affection that prompts this and that calls toward you to the threshold of the new year every pleasant possibility and all ease and honour and so far as you will consent to it rest  yours dear lady wolseley always and ever and more than ever  henry james  b this to attenuate his feebleness of hand     to william james        the news had just arrived of the death of f w h myers at rome      where william james was spending the winter  reform club pall mall s w jan 24 1901  my dear william  a laggard in response you and alice will indeed feel that i have become ive had for three or four days your so interesting and relieving letter dictated to alice at the hour of poor myerss death and though it greatly eased me off as to my fears that the whole thing would have worn you out yet till this moment my hand has been stayed i wrote you very briefly moreover as soon as the papers here gave the news blessed seems it to have been that everything round about myers was so sane and comfortable the reasonableness and serenity of his wife and children etc not to speak of his own high philosophy which it must have been fine to see in operation but i hope the sequel hasnt been prolonged and have been supposing that by the necessary quick departure of his party you will have been left independent again and not too exhausted we here on our side have been gathering close round the poor old dying and dead queen and are plunged in universal mourning tokenswhich accounts for my blackedged paper it has really been the event most moving interesting and picturesque i have felt more moved much than i should have expected such is community of sentiment and one has realized all sorts of things about the brave old womans beneficent duration and holdingtogether virtue the thing has been journalistically overdone of coursegreatly but the people have appeared to advantageserious and sincere and decentreally caring meanwhile the drama of the accession new reign c has its lively spectacular interesteven with the p of w for hero i dined last night in company with some privy councillors who had met him ceremonially in the am and they said john morley in particular said that he made a very good impression speriamo  i find london answering very well but with so much more crowdedness on ones hours and minutes than in the country that i shall be glad indeed when the end comes meanwhile however work proceeds the war has doubled the income tax here it is

and is addressed accordingly  lamb house rye june 15th 1901  dear grand governess  you are grand indeed and no mistake and we are bathed in gratitude for what you have done for us and in general for all your comfort support and illumination we cling to you we will walk but by your wisdom and live in your light we cherish and inscribe on our precious records every word that drops from you and we have begun by taking up your delightful tobaccoleaves with pious and reverent hands and consigning them to the lap of earth in the big vague blank unimaginative border with the lupines etc exactly in the manner you prescribe where they have already done wonders toward peopling its desolation it is really most kind and beneficent of you to have taken this charming trouble for us we acted further instantaneously on your hint in respect to the poor formal fuchsiassitting up in their hot stuffy drawingroom with never so much as a curtain to draw over their windows we haled them forth on the spot everyone and we clapped them in thoughtful clusters straight into the same capacious refuge or omnium gatherum then while the fury and the frenzy were upon us we did the same by the senseless stores of geranium my poor little 22aweekgardeners idée fixewe enriched the boundless receptacle with them as wellin consequence of which it looks now quite sociable and civilised your touch is magical in short and your influence infinite the little basket went immediately to its address and george gammon  my 22shillinger permitted himself much appreciation of your humour on the little tin soldiers that regiment i see will be more sparingly recruited in future the total effect of all this and of your discreet and benevolent glance at my ineffective economy is to make me feel it fifty times a pity a shame a crime that as john gilpin said to his wife you should dine at edmonton and i should dine at warethat you should bloom at effingham and i should fade at rye your real place is herewhere i would instantly ask your leave to farm myself out to you i want to be farmed i am utterly unfit to farm myself and i do it all round for seeing alas what it is not nearly little enough money therefore you ought to be over the wall and march with me as you say in scotland however even as it is your mere look round makes for salvation i am i rejoice to say clothed and in my right mindcompared with what i was when you left me and so shall go on i trust for a year and a day i have been alonebut next week bristles with possibilitiestwo men at the beginning two women postponedthe americans in the middleand madness possibly at the end i shall have to move over to winchelsea but while my reason abides i shall not cease to thank you for your truly generous and ministering visit and for everything that is yours which i am very faithfully and gratefully  henry james     to w d howells        strethers outburst to little bilham in book v of the      ambassadors during their colloquy in the parisian garden      represents the germ from which the novel sprang and which h j      owed as he here tells to mr howells the development of the      subject from this origin is described in the preface afterwards      written for the book  lamb house rye august 10th 1901  my dear howells  ever since receiving and reading your elegant volume of short talesthe arrival of which from you was affecting and delightful to meive meant to write to you but the wish has struggled in vain with the daily distractions of a tolerably busy summer i should blush however if the season were to melt away without my greeting and thanking you i read your book with joy and found in it recalls from far far awaystray echoes and scents as from another the american the prehistoric existence the thing that most took me was that entitled a difficult case which i found beautiful and admirable ever so true and ever so done but i fear i more almost than anything else lost myself in mere envy of your freedom to do and speaking vulgarly to place things of that particular and so agreeable dimensioni mean the dimension of most of the stories in the volume it is sternly enjoined upon one here where an agentman does what he can for me that everythingevery hundredabove 6 or 7 thousand words is fatal to placing so that i do them of that length with great care art and time much reboiling and then even then can scarcely get them worked offpublished even when theyve been accepted so that though i dont know why i inflict on you these sordid groansexcept that i havent any one else to inflict them onand the mere affrontof being unused so inordinately longis almost intolerable i dont feel incited in that direction fortunately however i am otherwise immersed i lately finished a tolerably long novel and ive written a third of anotherwith still another begun and two or three more subjects awaiting me thereafter like carriages drawn up at the door and horses champing their bits and àpropos of the first named of these which is in the hands of the harpers i have it on my conscience to let you know that the idea of the fiction in question had its earliest origin in a circumstance mentioned to meyears agoin respect to no less a person than yourself at torquay once our young friend jon sturges came down to spend some days near me and lately from paris repeated to me five words you had said to him one day on his meeting you during a call at whistlers i thought the words charmingyou have probably quite forgotten them and the whole incident suggestiveso far as it was an incident and more than this they presently caused me to see in them the faint vague germ the mere point of the start of a subject i noted them to that end as i note everything and years afterwards that is three or four the subject sprang at me one day out of my notebook i dont know if it be good at any rate it has been treated now for whatever it is and my point is that it had long beforeit had in the very act of striking me as a germgot away from you or from anything like you had become impersonal and independent nevertheless your initials figure in my little note and if you hadnt said the five words to jonathan he wouldnt have had them most sympathetically and interestingly to relate and i shouldnt have had them to work in my imagination the moral is that you are responsible for the whole business but ive had it since the book was finished much at heart to tell you so may you carry the burden bravelyi hope you are on some thymy promontory and that the winds of heaven blow upon you allperhaps in that simplified scene that you wrote to me from with so gleaming a new england evocation last year the summer has been wondrous again in these islandsfour or five months from april 1st of almost merciless fine weathera rainlessness absolute and without precedent it has made my hermitage as a retreat a blessing and i have been able thank goodness to work without breaksother than those of prospective readers heartsit almost broke mine the other day by the way to go down into the new forest where he has taken a house to see godkin dear old stricken friend he gave me in a manner news of youtold me he had seen you lately i am lone here just now with my sweet niece peggy but my brother and his wife are presently to be with me again for fifteen days before sailing 31st for the us he is immensely better in health but he must take in sail hand over hand at home to remain so stia bene caro amico anche lei my lei is my joke tell mrs howells and mildred that i yearn toward them tenderly  yours always and ever henry james     to edmund gosse   lamb house rye sept 16th 1901  my dear gosse  i hurl this after you there for good luck like the outworn shoe of ancient usage even a very very old shoe will take you properly over venice i wrote a week ago to mrs curtis about you and you will doubtless hear from her beckoningly in respect to the eversoamiable barbaro an impression well worth your having for the rest i commit you both paternally to brown to whose friendly memory i beg you to recall me i wish i could assist at some of your raptures go to see the tintoretto crucifixion at san cossianoor never more be officer of mine and àpropos of masterpieces read a thing called venice in a thing called portraits of places by a thing called h j if you can get the book im not sure if its in tauchnitz but mrs curtis may have the same brown certainly wont though j a symonds in the only communication i ever got from him told me he thought it the best image of v he had ever seen made this is the first time in my life i believe by the way i ever indulged in any suchin any fatuous reference to a fruit of my pen so there may be something in it drink deep both of you

assassination of      president mckinley on which mr roosevelt succeeded to the      presidency the heavenly mansion was the palazzo barbaro      referred to in the preceding letter to mr gosse where h j had      stayed in company with miss allen  lamb house rye september 19th 1901  dear bountiful and beautiful lady  it is equally impossible to respond to you adequately and not to respond to you somehow you flash your manycoloured lantern over my small grey surface from every corner of these islands and i sit blinking gaping clapping my hands at the purple and orange tints to such a tune that ive scarce presence of mind left for an articulate thank you how you keep it up and how exactly you lead the life that long years ago when i was young i used to believe a very very few fantastically happy mortals on earth could lead and could survive the bliss of leadingthe waltzlike rhythmic rotation from great countryhouse to great countryhouse to the sound of perpetual music and the acclamation of the houseparties that gather to await you you are the dream come trueyou really do it and i get the sidewind of the fairytalewhich is more than i can really quite believe of myselfsuch a livingalmostnear the rose you make me feel near at any rate when you write me so kindly about the hideous american episodealmost the worst feature of which is that i dont either like or trust the new president a dangerous and ominous jingoof whom the most hopeful thing to say is that he may be rationalized by this sudden real responsibility speriamo as we used to say in the golden age in the heavenly mansion along with the ministering angel long long ago and all thanks meanwhile for your sympathetic thought it must indeedthe base success of the actcause a sinking of the heart among the potentates in circulation one wonders for instance just now who is most nervous the poor little tsar for himself or m loubet for him let us thank our stars that we are not travelling stars i not even a loubet nor you a loubette and that though we have many annoyances we are probably not marked for the dagger of the assassin  20th pm i had to break off last night and i resumeperhaps a trifle precariously at this midnight hour of what is just no longer friday but about to be saturday i have seen as it were my two guests and my tardy servants to bed and i put in again this illegible little talk with poor you it has been a more convivial 24 hours than my general scheme of life often permits such are the modest annals of lamb houseor rather its daily and nightly chronicle but dont let it depress youfor everything passes and i bow my head to the whirlwind but i hate the care of even a tiny and twopenny house and wish i could farm out the same if some one would only undertake itand the backgardenat so much a year i would close with the offer and ask no questions i may still have to try whiteley but i shall try a winter in town first i blush for my meagreness of response to all your

to mrs w k clifford   lamb house rye wednesday night oct 3 1901  dearest lucy c  i have waited to welcome you to thank you for your dear and brilliant vienna letter because you stayed my hand therein from writingfor want of an address and because ive believed that not till now if even now would you be disengaged from the tangled skein of your adventures and even at this hour of loudticking midnight stillness i dont pretend to do more than greet you affectionately on the threshold of home promise you a better equivalent for your so interesting so envysqueezing so vivid record of adventure at some very near date and above all renew my jubilation at your having made so good and brave a thing of it allespecially as full and unstinted a one as you desired never mind the money i handsomely sayyou will get it all back and much morein the refreshment and renewal and general intellectual ventilation your six weeks will have been to you im sure the effect will go fari want details so much that i wish i were to see you soonbut alas i dont quite see when im just emerging from a domestic cyclone that has in one way and another cost me so much time that pressed as i am with a woefully backward book i can only for the present hug my writingtable with convulsive knees the figure doesnt fitbut the postponement of all joy alas does my two old manandwife servants who had been with me sixteen years were a few days ago shot into space thank heaven at last by a whirlwind of but 48 hours duration and though the absolute rupture came and went in that time the horrid accompaniments and upheaved neighbourhoods have represented a woeful interruption but its over and i have plunged again and am living blissfully for the present with a housemaid and a charwoman and immensely enjoying my simplified state and my relief from what i see now was a long nightmare  i read your play in the nineteenth century as you invited me but i cant write of it now beyond saying that i was greatly struck by the care and finish you had given it if i must tell you categorically however i dont think it a scenic subject at all i think it bears all the mark of a subject selected for a tale and done as a play as an afterthought i dont see that is what the scenic form does or can do for it that the narrative couldnt do betteror what it in turn does for the scenic form the inwardness is a kind of inwardness that doesnt become an outwardnesseffectivelytheatrically and the part played in the whole by the painting of the portrait seems to me the kind of thing for which the play is a nonconductor and here i am douching you on your doorstep with cold water we must talk we must colloquise and compare and renew the first moment we can and i am all the while and ever your affectionate old friend  henry james     to miss muir mackenzie   lamb house rye wednesday night oct 17 1901  dear miss muir mackenzie  one almost infallibly beginsat least the perpetually criminal i dowith the assurance that one has from long since been on the point and it remains eternally true which makes no difference however in your being bored to hear it besides if i had been writing a month ago i shouldnt perhaps be writing now and that i am writing now is a present joy to mewhich i would barter for none other no mere luxury of conscience i havent for weeks strolled through my now blighted and stricken jardinet without reverting gratefully in thought to you as its titular directress without wishing at once that it were more worthy of you and recognising recalling your hand and mind in most of its least humiliating features your kind visit so scantly honoured so meagrely recorded i mean by commemorative tablet or other permanent demonstration lives again in some of the faded phenomena of the sceneand the blush revives which the sense of how poor a host i was caused even then to visit my cheek i want you in particular to know what a joy and pride your great proud and pink tobaccopresent has proved it has overlorded the confused and miscellaneous border in which your masterly eye recognised its imperativenot to say imperialplace and it has reduced by its mere personal success all the incoherence around it to comparative insignificance what a bliss what a daily excitement all summer to see it grow by leaps and bounds and to feel it happy and heartyas much as it could be in its strange exile and inferior company it has all prosperedthough some a little smothered by more vulgar neighbours and the tallest of the brotherhood are still as handsome as ever with a particular shade of watered winecolour in the flower that i much delight in and yetniny that i ami dont know what to do with them for next year my gardener opines that we leave them as your perennial monument just as they are but i have vague glimmerings of conviction that we cut them down to a mere small protrusion above groundand we probably both are fully wrong or do we extract precious seed and plant afresh forgive my feeble i repeat flounderings i feel as the dunce of an infant school trying to babble greek to professor jebb or suchlike i am none the less hoping that the garden will be less dreadful and casual next year weve ordered 105 rosesalso divers liliesand made other vague dashes oh you should be in controlling permanence actually we are painfully preparing to become bulbous and particoloured one must occupy the gardener the grapes have been bad bless their preposterous little pretensions but the figs unprecedently numerous and so on and so on and it has been for me a rather feverish and accidenté summer i mean through the constant presence of family till a month ago and through a prolonged domestic upheaval ever since i sit amid the ruins of a once happy household clutching a charwoman with one hand and a knifeboyfrom lilliputwith the other a man and his wife who had lived with me for long long years and were in spite of growing infirmities and the darker and darker shadow of approaching doom the mainstay of my existence were sacrificed to the just gods three or four weeks ago and ive picnicked for very relief ever sincemaking futile attempts at reconstruction for which i have had no time and yet which have consumed so much of it that none has been left as i began by hinting for correspondence ive been up to london over it and haunted hastings and wired to friends and almost appealed to the grand governessonly deterred by the fear of hearing from her that it isnt her province yet i did wonder if i couldnt lawfully work it in under kitchengarden no matter my fate closes round me again and the first thing i think of now when i wake up in the morning is that a cookhousekeeper in a gorringe  costume  is to arrive next week i tremble at her if the worst comes to the worst i shall make you responsible i walked over to winchelsea this afternoon and returned in darkness and wet by the faroff station and the merciful trainalways reweaving the legend of your wet exile there it blows it rains it rages tonightfor the first time here for six months i hope you havent had again to eat overmuch the bread of banishment i havent asked you for your newshave only jabbered my own but i believe you not unaware that this is but a subtler art for extracting from you the whole of your herbaceous and other history may it have been mild and merciful goodnightor as usual goodmorningi am going to bed but it has been for some time tomorrow yours dear miss muir mackenzie very gratefully and faithfully  henry james     to edmund gosse        the reference in the following is to w e henleys provocative      article in the pall mall magazine on mr graham balfours      recently published life of robert louis stevenson  lamb house rye november 20th 1901  my dear gosse  i have been very sorry to hear from you of renewed upsets on quitting these wallsthe same fate having i remember overtaken you most of the other times youve been here i trust it isnt the infection of the walls themselves nor of the refection so scant last time enjoyed within them is it some baleful effluence of your host he will try and exercise next time some potent countercharmand meanwhile he rejoices that your devil is cast out  all thanks for your so vivid news of the overflow of henleys gall Ça ne pouvait manquerça devait venir i have sent for the article and will write you when ive read it i gather from you that its really rather a striking and luridand so far interesting caseof long discomfortable jealousy and ranklement turned at last to posthumous as it were malignity and making the man do coram publico his ugly act risking the dishonour for the assuagement that is on the part of a favourite of the press etc a remarkable psychologic incidentor perhaps im talking in the air from not having read the thing i dare say moreover at all events that h did very seriouslyi mean sincerelydeplore all the graces that had crept into louiss writingall the more that they had helped it so to be loved he honestly thinks that l should have written likewell like who but henleys self but the whole business illustrates how life takes upon itself to give us more true and consistent examples of human unpleasantness than expectation could suggestmakes a given man i mean live up to his ugliness this ones whole attitude in respect to these recent amiable commemorations of louisthe having i selfconscious and alone nothing to do with them contained singularly the promise of some positive aggression i have however this am a letter from graham balfour in answer to one i had written him on reading his book in which speaking of henleys paper he says its less bad than he expected he apparently feared more its since you were here by the way that ive read his record in which as to its second volume i found a good deal of fresh interest and charm it seems to me the whole thing very neatly and tactfully done for an amateur a nonexpert but i see now that a really curious thing has happened a case occurred much more interesting than the cas henley insistent publicity so to speak has done its work i only knew it was doing it but g bs books a settler and louis qua artist is now definitely the victim thereof that is he has superseded personally his books and this last replacement of himself so en scène so largely by his own aid too has killed the literary baggage out of no mystery now do they issue the creations in questionand they couldnt afford to lose it louis himself never understood that he too publicly caressed and accounted for thembut i neednt insist on what i mean as i see it at all events its a strange little evolution and all taking place here quite compactly under ones nose  i dont come up to town alas for more than a few necessary hours till ive finished my book and that will be when god pleases i pray for early in january but then i shall stay as long as ever i can all thanks for your news of norris to whom i shall write i envy your venetian newsesbut i myself have written for some i rain good wishes on your house and am yours always  henry james     to h g wells   lamb house rye january 20th 1902  my dear wells  dont i beseech you measure the interest ive taken in your brilliant book that is in the prior of the recent pair of them and dont measure any other decency or humanity of mine in relation to anything that is yours by my late abominable and aggravated silence you most handsomely sent me anticipations when the volume appeared and i was not able immediately to read it i was bothered and preoccupied with many things wished for a free mind and an attuned ear for it so let it wait till the right hour knowing that neither you nor i would lose by the process the right hour came and i gave myself uputterly admirably upto the charm but the charm on its side left me so spent as it were with saturation that i had scarce pulled myself round before the complications of xmas set in and the new years floodin respect to correspondencewas upon me which ive been till now buffeting and breasting and then i was ashamedand im ashamed still that is the penalty of viceones shame disqualifies one for the company of virtue yet all this latter time ive taken the greatest pleasure in my still throbbing and responding sense of the book  i found it then i assure you extraordinarily and unceasingly interesting its not that i haventhadntreserves and reactions but that the great source of interest never failed which great source was simply h g w himself you really come beautifully out of your adventure come out of it immensely augmented and extended like a belligerent who has annexed halfakingdom with drums and trumpets and banners all sounding and flying and this is because the thing in our deadly day is such a charming exhibition of complete freedom of mind thats what i enjoyed in ityour intellectual disencumberedness very interesting to behold as the direct fruit of training and observation a gallant show altogetherand a gallant temper and a gallant tone for the rest you will be tired of hearing that for vaticination you to excess simplify besides the phrophet see how i recklessly spell him to do him the greater honour musti cant imagine a subtilizing prophet at any rate i dont make you a reproach of simplifying for if you hadnt i shouldnt have been able to understand you but on the other hand i think your reader asks himself too much where is life in all this life as i feel it and know it subject of your speculations as it is it is nevertheless too much left out that comes partly from your fortunate youthits a more limited mystery for you than for the methuselah who now addresses you theres less of it with you to provide for and its less a perturber of your reckoning there are for instance more kinds of people i think in the worldmore irreducible kindsthan your categories meet however your categories do you none the less great honour the greatest worked out as they are and i quite agree that as before hinted if one wants more life there is mr lewisham himself of spade house exhaling it from every pore and in the centre of the picture that is the great thing he makes mr lewisham does your heroic redcovered romance it had to have a heroand it has an irresistible one such is my criticism i cant go further i cant take you up in detail i am under the charm my world is somehow other but i cant produce it besides i dont want to you can and do produce yoursso youve a right to talk finally moreover your book is full of truth and wit and sanitythats where i mean you come out so well i go to london next week for three months but on my return in may i should like well to see you what a season you must have had with philosophy poetry and the banker i had a saddish letter from gissingbut rumours of better things for him i mean reviving powers have come to me i dont quite know how since conrad haunts winchelsea and winchelsea in discretion haunts rye so foot it up and accept at near one oclock in the morning the cordial goodnight and general benediction of yours my dear wells more than ever  henry james     to percy lubbock   lamb house rye march 9th 1902  my dear percy lubbock  ive been very uncivilly silent but ive also been still more dismally hinderedi mean ever since receiving your good note of feb 22d it found me wearily drearily ill in bed such had been my state ever since jan 29th and it ceased to be my state only ten days agosince when i have sat feebly staring at a mountain of unanswered letters i did go to london jan 27th but was immediately stricken and scrambled back here to be more commodiously prostrate ive had to stay and recuperate but i am infinitely betteronly universally behind still it isnt too late i hope to tell you it would have given me extreme pleasure to see you in town had everything been different also that i congratulate you with all my heart on the great event of your young your first your never to be surpassed or effaced prime italiänische reise its a great event the revelation at any time of life but its altogether immeasurable at your lucky one yet there are things to be said too as that there would be no use whatever in my having told you what to do there wouldnt be the remotest chance of your doing it the place the time the aspect the colour of the light and the inclination of percy lubbock will already be making for you their own law or better still causing you to live generally lawless and promiscuous be promiscuous and incoherent and intelligent absorbent happy its your great chance be further glad of every italian vocable you take to your heart and help me to hope that our meeting over it all is only moderately put offwhen youll have ever so interesting things to tell to yours most truly  henry james     to gaillard t lapsley   lamb house rye june 22nd 1902  my dear dear boy  the penalty of shameful turpitude is that even reparation and contrition are made almost impossible by the dimensions of the abyss that separates the criminal from virtue or more simply the amount of explanation of my baseness that i have felt myself saddled with toward you has long operated as a further and a fatal deterrent in respect to writing to you at all the burden of my shame has in short piled up my silence and to break that hideous spell i must now cast explanations to the windsere they crush me altogether ive had a rather blighted and broken wintera good deal of somewhat ominous unwellness now happily dv overpast under the effect of it all my correspondence has gone to pieces and though ive managed to write two books ive done so mainly by an economy of moyens that has forbidden my answering even a note or two ive thought of you dreamed of you followed you admired you in fine tenderly loved you done everything accordingly but treat you decently but im all right in the long the very long run and your admirably interesting and charming letter of ever so many months ago has never ceased to be a joy and pride to me those emotions have just been immeasureably quickened by something told me by my brave little cousin bay emmet the paintressviz her having lately met you in new york and heard on your lips words à mon adresse not of resentment or scorn but of divine magnanimity and gentleness you appear to have spoken to her as if you still liked me and i like you so much for that that the vibration has started these stammering accents i really write you these words not from my peaceful hermitage by the southern sea but from the depths of the meretricious metropolis which ive never known so detestable as at this most tawdry of crises and from which i hope to escape in a day or two utterly dodging the insane crush of the coronation the place is vilely disfigured by leaguelong hoardings for spectators at £10 0 0 a head and cheap and awful decorations and the dear old abbey in particular smothered into the likeness of the earls court exhibitionnot to be distinguished from the westminster aquarium in fact opposite and then the crowds the gregarious gaping millions are appalling and i fly in fine back to the southern seaon the shore of which ive spent almost all my time for almost a year past ive lately been dabbling a little for compensation in town but i find small doses of london now go further for my organisation than they used  b emmet tells me that you still sit aloft in california and i permit myself to rejoice in it in spite of some of the lurid lights projected by your so vivid letter over the composition of that milieu you tell me things of awful suggestionand in respect to which i would give anything for more talk with you and more chance for question and answer  june 26th the foregoing my dear boy though dated here was written in londonwhich means that in the confusion and distraction the present chaotic crash of things there it was also interrupted i had been there for a snatch of but three or four days and i rushed back here in horror and dismay 24 hours since just before the poor kings collapse set the seal on the general gregarious madness i had chucked the coronation thank heaven before the coronation chucked me and this little russet and green corner as so often before has been breathing balm and peace to me after the huge beargarden the latter beggars description at the present momentand must now do so doubly while reeling under the smash of everything i feel like a man who has jumped safe from an expresstrain before a collisionand to make really sure of my not having broken my neck i take up again this distempered scrawl to you but i wont talk of all this dreary pandemonium heredreary whatever the issue of the poor kings illness inasmuch as either way it can only mean more gregarious madness more leaguelong hoarding more blocks of traffic and deluges of dust and tons of newspaper verbiage amen  what i didnt begin to say to you the other day was how interesting and awful i found your picture of your seat of learning i rejoice with all my heart that it has attached you for just the likes of you are what must make a difference by influence by example by civilization by revelation in the strange mixtureor absence of mixtureof its elements i gather from you that its air is all female so to speak and that in this buoyant medium you triumphantly float it must be very wonderful and fearful and indescribable all of it lifelike indeed though your sketch appears to me i wish immensely i could see you so that we could get nearer together to everything you come out most summersis there no chance of your doing so this year i seem to infer the sad contrary from my little cousins not having told me that you mentioned anything of the sort to her i have the sense of having seen you odiously little last yeara blighted and distracted season as i read over at present your generous letter i feel a special horror and dismay at having failed so long and so abominably to give you the promised word of introduction to fanny stevenson i enclose one herewithbut i must tell you that i feel myself to be launching it rather into the dark that is i have a fear that she is rather changedor rather exaggeratedwith time illness etcand that you may find her somewhat aged queer eccentric etc and im not sure im possessed of her address only remember thisthat she with all deference to her was never the person to have seen it was r l s himself but goodnight i havent half responded to you nor met youin your charming details yet i am none the less my dear lapsley very affectionately yours  henry james     to mrs cadwalader jones        mrs jones it will be understood had sent him two of the books of      her sisterinlaw mrs wharton  lamb house rye august 20th 1902  dictated  dear and bountiful lady  my failure during these few days to thank you for everything has not come from a want of appreciation of anythingor from a want of gratitude or lively remembrance or fond hope or in short from anything but a quite calculating and canny view that i shall perhaps come in during your present episode with a slightly greater effect of direct support and encouragement than if i had come during the fever of your late short interval in london it seems to be borne in to me that you may be feelinglà où vous êtesa little lone and lorn a little alien and exotic so that the voice of the compatriot counsellor and moderator may fall upon your ears with an approach to sweetness i am sure all the same that you are in a situation of great and refreshing novelty and of general picturesque interest at your leisure you will give me news of it and i wish you meanwhile as the best advice to drain it to the dregs and leave no element of it untasted  my situation has en attendant been made picturesque by the successive arrivals of your different mementoes each one of which has done its little part to assuage my solitude and relieve my gloom putting them in their order mrs wharton comes in an easy first the unspeakable postum follows handsomely and protoplasmby which i mean plasmonpants far behind how shall i thank you properly for these prompt and valued missives postum does taste like a ferociously mild coffeea coffee reduced to second childhood the prattle of senility i hasten to add however that it accords thereby but the better with my enfeebled powers of assimilation and that i am taking it regular and blessing your name for it it interposes a little ease after the long and unattenuated grimness of cocoa since jackson was able to provide it with so little delay i feel i may count on him for blessed renewals but i shall never count on any one again for plasmon which is gruesome and medicinal or at all events an acquired taste which the rest of my life will not be long enough to acquire  mrs wharton is another affair and i take to her very kindly as regards her diabolical little cleverness the quantity of intention and intelligence in her style and her sharp eye for an interesting kind of subject i had read neither of these two volumes and though the valley is for significance of ability several pegs above either i have extracted food for criticism from both as criticism in the nobler sense of the word is for me enjoyment ive in other words much liked them only theyve made me again as i hinted to you other things had want to get hold of the little lady and pump the pure essence of my wisdom and experience into her she must be tethered in native pastures even if it reduces her to a backyard in new york if a work of imagination of fiction interests me at all and very few alas do i always want to write it over in my own way handle the subject from my own sense of it that i always find a pleasure in and i found it extremely in the vanished handover which i should have liked at several points to contend with her but i cant speak more highly for any book or at least for my interest in any i take liberties with the greatest  but you will say that in ticking out this amount of remingtonese at you i am taking a great liberty with you or rather of course i know you wont since you gave me kind leavefor which i shamelessly bless you goodbye with innumerable good wishes please tell miss beatrix that these are addressed equally to her as in fact my whole letter is and that my liveliest interest attends her on her path  yours and hers always affectionately henry james     to w d howells   lamb house rye sept 12th 1902  dictated  my dear howells  an inscrutable and untoward fate condemns me to strange delinquenciesthough it is no doubt the weakness of my nature as well as the strength of the said treacherous principle that the undone vast in my existence lords it chronically and shamelessly over the petty done it strikes me indeed both as vast and yet in a monstrous way as petty too that i should have joyed so in the kentons which you sent me ever so kindly more weeks ago than it would be decent in me to countshould have eaten and drunk and dreamed and thought of them as i did should have sunk into them in short so that they closed over my head like living waters and kept me down down in subaqueous prostration and all the while should have remained so far as you are concerned brutishly and ungratefully dumb i havent been otherwise dumb i assure youthat is so far as they themselves are concerned there was a time when i talked of nothing and nobody else and i have scarcely even now come to the end of it i think in fact it is because i have been so busy vaunting and proclaiming them up and down the more or less populated avenues of my life that i have had no time left for anything else the avenue on which you live worse luck is perversely out of my beat why however do i talk thus i know too well how you know too well that letters in the writing life are the last things that get themselves written you see the way that this one tries to manage itwhich at least is better than no way all the while at any rate the impression of the book remains and i have infinitely pleased myself even in my shame with thinking of the pleasure that must have come to yourself from so acclaimed and attested a demonstration of the freshness within you still of the spirit of evocation delightful in ones golden afternoon and after many days and many parturitions to put forth thus a young strong living flower you have done nothing more true and complete more thoroughly homogeneous and hangingtogether without the faintest ghost of a false note or a weak touchall as sharply cipheredup and tappedout as the proof of a prize scholars sum on a slate it is in short miraculously felt and beautifully done and the agedby which i mean the richlymaturedsposi as done as if sposi were a new and fresh idea to you of all your sposi they are i think the most penetrated and most penetrating i took in short true comfort in the whole manifestation the only bitterness in the cup being that it made me feel old i shall never again so renew myself but i want to hear from you that it has reallythe sense and the cheer of having done itset you spinning again with a quickened hum when you mentioned to me i think in your last letter that you had done the kentons you mentioned at the same time the quasicompletion of something else it is this thing i now wantwont it soon be coming dueand if you will magnanimously send it to me i promise you to have for it better manners meanwhile let me add i have directed the scribners to send you a thing of my own too longwinded and minute a thing but wellmeaning just put forth under the name of the wings of the dove  i hope the summers end finds you still out of the streets and that it has all been a comfortable chapter i hear of it from my brother as the great cool time which makes for me a pleasant image since i generally seem to sear my eyeballs from june to september when i steal a glance across the sea at the bright american picture here of course we have been as grey and cold as braced and rheumatic and uncomfortable as you please but that has little charm of noveltythough not to blaspheme we have since ive been living here occasionally perspired i live here as you see still and am by this time like the dyers hand subdued to what i work in or at least try to economise in it is pleasant enough for five or six months of the year for me to wish immensely that some crowning stroke of fortune may still take the form of driving you over to see me before i fall to pieces apropos of which i am forgetting what has been half my reasonno not halffor writing to you many weeks ago there began to be blown about the worldfrom what fountain of lies proceeding i know nota rumour that you were staying with me here a rumour flaunting its little hour as large as life in some of the london papers it brought me many notes of inquiry invitations to you and other tributes to your glorydamn it i dont mean damn your glory but damn the wanton and worrying rumour among other things it brought me a fattish letter addressed to you and which i have been so beastly procrastinating as not to forward you till now when i post it with this its aspect somehow denotes insignificance and impertinence and i havent wanted to do it as a part of the so grossly newspaperistic impudence too much honour besides verily the intention day after day of writing you at the same time well there it all is you will think my letter as long as my book so i add only my benediction as ever on your house beginning with mrs howells going straight through and ramifying as far as you permit me  yours my dear howells always and ever henry james     to h g wells   lamb house rye september 23rd 1902  my dear wells  alls well that ends well and everything is to hand i thank you heartily for the same and i have read the two men dangling breathlessly at the tail of their tub while in the air and plying them with indiscreet questions while out of it it is the whole thing stupendous but do you know what the main effect of it was on my cheeky consciousness to make me sigh on some such occasion to collaborate with you to intervene in the interest ofwell i scarce know what to call it i must wait to find the right name when we meet you can so easily avenge yourself by collaborating with me our mixture would i think be effective i hope you are thinking of doing marsin some detail let me in there at the right momentor in other words at an early stage i really shall opportunity serving venture to try to say two or three things to you about the two menor rather not so much about them as about the cave of conceptions whence they issue all i can say now however is that the volume goes like a bounding ball that it is 1230 am and that i am goodnightfully yours  henry james     to mrs cadwalader jones   dictated  lamb house rye october 23d 1902  dear mrs cadwalader  both your liberal letters have reached me and have given me as the missives of retreating friends never fail to do an almost sinister sense of the rate at which the rest of the world goes moves rushes voyages railroads passing from me through a hundred emotions and adventures and pulling up in strange habitats while i sit in this grassy corner artlessly thinking that the days are few and the opportunities small quite big enough for the likes of me though the latter be even here all of which means of course simply that you take away my breath but that was on the cards and its not worth mentioning your best news for me is of your being for complete convalescence in the superlative hands you describeto which i hope you are already doing infinite credit i kind of make you out down there i mean in the pretty very pretty as it used to be new york autumn and in the washington squareish region trodden by the steps of my childhood and i wonder if you ever kick the october leaves as you walk in fifth avenue as i can to this hour feel myself hear myself positively smell myself doing but perhaps there are no leaves and no trees now in fifth avenuenothing but patriotic arches astor hotels and vanderbilt palaces my secretary was on the point of writing the great name asterwhich i think the most delightful irony of fate they are so flowerlike a race the october leaves are at any rate gathering about me hereand that i have watched them fall and lighted my fire and trimmed my lamp is about the only thing that has happened to methough i should count in a visit from a delightful nephew who has just been with me for a fortnight and left me for geneva where he spends the winter  i assisted dimly through your discreet page at your visit to mrs wharton whose lenox house must be a love and i wish i could have been less remotely concerned in the way of those i know i hope you have by this time on your own side gathered in john la farge and are not allowing him to feel anything but that he is well and happyexcept also that i very affectionately remember him  but i am not thanking you all this time for the interesting remarks about the book i had last placed in your hands the wings of the dove which you so heroically flung upon paper even on the heaving deepa feat to me very prodigious i wont say your criticism was eminent for the time and placeill say frankly that it was eminent in itself and all full of suggestion the fact is however that one is so aware ones self even to satiety of the rights and wrongs of these mattersespecially of the wrongsthat freshness of mind almost fails for discriminations however benevolent of others such is the price of having written many books and lived many years the thing in question is by a complicated accident which it would take too long to describe to you too inordinately drawn out and too inordinately rubbed in the centre moreover isnt in the middle or the middle rather isnt in the centre but ever so much too near the end so that what was to come after it is truncated the book in fine has too big a head for its body i am trying all the while to write one with the opposite disproportionthe body too big for its head so i shall perhaps do if i live to 150 dont therefore undermine me by general remarks and dictating please has moreover nothing to do with it the value of that process for me is in its help to do over and over for which it is extremely adapted and which is the only way i can do at all it soon enough accordingly becomes intellectually absolutely identical with the act of writingor has become so after five years now with me so that the difference is only material and illusoryonly the difference that is that i walk up and down which is so much to the goodbut i must stop walking now i stand quite still to send my hearty benediction to miss beatrix and i am yours and hers very constantly  henry james     to h g wells        the only two effusions of the kind described in this letter      that have survived are the preliminary schemes for the unfinished      novels the ivory tower and the sense of the past published      with them in 1917  lamb house rye november 15th 1902  my dear wells  it is too horribly long that i have neglected an interesting for i cant say an interested inquiry of yoursin your last note and neglected it precisely because the acknowledgment involved had to be an explanation i have somehow for the last month not felt capable of explanations it being my infirmity that when finishing a book and that seems my chronic condition my poor enfeebled cerebration becomes incapable of the least extra effort however slight and simple my correspondence then shrinks and shrinksonly the least explicit of my letters get themselves approximately written and somehow it has seemed highly explicit to tell you that in reply to your suggestive last those wondrous and copious preliminary statements of my fictions that are to be dont really exist in any form in which they can be imparted i think i know to whom you allude as having seen their semblanceand indeed their very substance but in two exceptional as it were cases in these cases what was seen was the statement drawn up on the basis of the serialization of the workdrawn up in one case with extreme detail and at extreme length in 20000 words pinker saw that it referred to a long novel afterwards this more than a year written and finished but not yet to my great inconvenience published but it went more than two years ago to america to the harpers and there remained and has probably been destroyed were it here i would with pleasure transmit it to you for though i say it who should not it was the statement full and vivid i think as a statement could be of a subject as worked out then conrad saw a shorter one of the wings of the dalso well enough in its way but only half as long and proportionately less developed that had been prepared so that the book might be serialized in another american periodical but this wholly failed what secrets and shames i reveal to you and the thing the book was then written the subject treated on a more free and independent scale but that synopsis too has been destroyed it was returned from the us but i had then no occasion to preserve it and evidently no fiction of mine can or will now be serialized certainly i shall not again draw up detailed and explicit plans for unconvinced and ungracious editors so that i fear i shall have nothing of that sort to show a plan for myself as copious and developed as possible i always do draw upthat is the two documents i speak of were based upon and extracted from such a preliminary private outpouring but this latter voluminous effusion is ever so extremely familiar confidential and intimatein the form of an interminable garrulous letter addressed to my own fond fancythat though i always for easy reference have it carefully typed it isnt a thing i would willingly expose to any eye but my own and even then sometimes i shrink so there it is i am greatly touched by your respectful curiosity but i havent you see anything coherent to produce let me promise however that if i ever do within any calculable time address a manifesto to the dim editorial mind you shall certainly have the benefit of a copy candour compels me to add that that consummation has now become unlikely it is too wantonly expensive a treat to them in the first place they will none of me and in the second the relief and greater intellectual dignity so to speak of working on ones own scale ones own line of continuity and in ones own absolutely independent tone is too precious to me to be again forfeited pardon my too many words i only add that i hope the domestic heaven bends blue above you  yours my dear wells always henry james     to mrs frank mathews   lamb house rye november 18th 1902  my dear mary  you have made me a most beautiful and interesting present and i thank you heartily for the lavish liberality and trouble of the same it arrived this am swathed like a mummy of the pharaohs and is a monument to the care and skill of every one concerned the photographer has retouched the impression rather too freely especially the eyes if one could but keep their hands off but the image has a pleasing ghostliness as out of the far past and affects me pathetically as if it were of the deadof one who died young and innocent well so he did and i can speak of him or admire him poor charming slightly mawkish youth quite as i would another i remember it now all comes back to me when and where i was so taken at the age of 20 though i look younger and at a time when i had had an accident an injury to my back and was rather sick and sorry i look rather as if i wanted propping up but you have propped me up now handsomely for all time and i feel that i shall go down so to the remotest posterity there is a great titian you know at the louvrelhomme au gant but i in my gloved gentleness shall run him close all thanks again then you have renewed my youth for me and diverted my antiquity and i really as they say fancy myself and am yours my dear mary very constantly  henry james     to w d howells   lamb house rye december 11th 1902  my dear howells  nothing more delightful or that has touched me more closely even to the spring of tears has befallen me for years literally than to receive your beautiful letter of nov 30th so largely and liberally anent the w of the d every word of it goes to my heart and to thank you for it seems a mere grimace the same post brought me a letter from dear john hay so that my measure has been full i havent known anything about the american notices heaven save the mark any more than about those here which i am told however have been remarkably genial so that i have not had the sense of confrontation with a public more than usually childishi mean had it in any special way i confess however that that is my chronic sensethe more than usual childishness of publics and it is has been in my mind long since discounted and my work definitely insists upon being independent of such phantasms and on unfolding itself wholly from its own innards of course in our conditions doing anything decent is pure disinterested unsupported unrewarded heroism but thats in the days work the faculty of attention has utterly vanished from the general anglosaxon mind extinguished at its source by the big blatant bayadère of journalism of the newspaper and the picture above all magazine who keeps screaming look at me i am the thing and i only the thing that will keep you in relation with me all the time without your having to attend one minute of the time if you are moved to write anything anywhere about the w of the d do say something of thatit so awfully wants saying but we live in a lovely age for literature or for any art but the mere visual illustrations loud simplifications and grossissements the big building good for john the mounted play the prose that is careful to be in the tone of and with the distinction of a newspaper or billposter advertisementthese and these only meseems stand a chance but why do i talk of such chances i am melted at your reading en famille the sacred fount which you will i fear have found chaff in the mouth and which is one of several things of mine in these last years that have paid the penalty of having been conceived only as the short story that alone apparently i could hope to work off somewhere which i mainly failed of and then grew by a rank force of its own into something of which the idea had modestly never been to be a book that is essentially the case with the s f planned like the spoils of poynton what maisie knew the turn of the screw and various others as a story of the 8 to 10 thousand words and then having accepted its bookish necessity or destiny in consequence of becoming already at the start 20000 accepted it ruefully and blushingly moreover since given the tenuity of the idea the larger quantity of treatment hadnt been aimed at i remember how i would have chucked the sacred fount at the 15th thousand word if in the first place i could have afforded to waste 15000 and if in the second i were not always ridden by a superstitious terror of not finishing for finishings and for the precedents sake what i have begun i am a fair coward about dropping and the book in question i fear is more than anything else a monument to that superstition when if it meets my eye i say to myself you know you might not have finished it i make the remark not in natural reproach but i confess in craven relief  but why am i thus grossly expatiative on the airy carpet of the bridal altar i spread it beneath pillas feet with affectionate jubilation and gratification and stretch it out further in the same spirit beneath yours and her mothers i wish her and you and the florallyminded young man he must be a good un all joy in the connection if he stops short of gathering samphire its a beautiful trade and i trust he will soon come back to claim the redemption of the maidens vows please say to her from me that i bless herhard  your visit to cambridge makes me yearn a little and your watching over it with c n and your sitting in it with grace did the ghost of other walks im told fresh pond is no longer a pond or no longer fresh only stale or something ever brush you with the hem of its soft shroud havent you lately published some volume of literary essays or portraits since the heroines of fiction and wont you munificently send me either that or the heroinesneither of which have sprung up in my here so rustic path i will send you in partial payment another book of mine to be published on february 27th  goodnight with renewed benedictions on your house and your spirit  yours always and ever henry james     to madame paul bourget   lamb house rye january 5th 1903  dear madame paul  very welcome very delightful to me your kind new years message and meeting a solicitude for news of you both which was as a shadow across my not very glowing indeed christmas hearth your note finds me still incorrigibly rustic i have been spending here the most solitary christmastide of my life absolutely solitary and i have not for long months been further from home than for an occasional day or two in london i go there on the 10th to remain till may but i am sorry to say i see little hope of my being able to peregrinate to far provenceall benignant though your invitation be we must meetsome timeagain in the loved italy but i blush almost to say it when i have to say at the same time that my present prospect of that bliss is of the smallest i long unspeakably to go back therebefore i descend into the dark deep tombfor a long visit of upwards of a year yet it proves more difficult for me than it ought or than it looks and in short i oughtnt to speak of it again save to announce it as definite unfortunately i also want to return for a succession of months to the land of my birthalso in anticipation of the tomb and the one doesnt help the other europe has ceased to be romantic to me and my own country in the evening of my days has become so but this senile passion too is perhaps condemned to remain platonicbourgets benevolence continues to shine on me his generosity to descend in the form of heavenlyblue volumes the grave smile of my dull library shelves for which i blush that i make so meagre returns i shall send you a volume in february but it will have no such grande allure though the best thing in it will be a little story of which you gave me long ago at torquay the motive and which i will mark i congratulate you on not being absentees from your highwalledor muchwallededen and i hope it means a happy distillation for bourget and much health and peace for both of you may you have a mild and merciful year deserve it by continuing to have patience tous les deux with your very faithful and very inky old friend  henry james     to mrs waldo story        the book to which the following refers is of course william      wetmore story and his friends published in 1903  dictated  lamb house rye jan 6th 1903  dear mrs waldo  let my first word be to ask you to pardon this vulgar machinery and this portentous legibility the fruit of dictation in the first place now made absolutely necessary to me and the fruit in the second place of the fact that pegging away as i am at present in your interest and waldos and with the end of our business now i am happy to say well in sight i so live as it were from day to day and from hour to hour by the aid of this mechanism that it is an effort to me to break with it even for my correspondence i had promised myself to write you so that you should receive my letter on the very capo danno and if i had then overcome my scruple as to launching at you a dictated thing you would some time ere this have been in possession of my news i have delayed till now because i was every day hoping to catch the right moment to address you a page or two of my own proper hieroglyphics but ones christmastide burden of writing here is heavy i didnt snatch the moment and this is a brave precaution lest it should again elude me which in the interest of lucidity please again forgive  so much as that about a minor matter the more important one is that as you will both be glad to know i have in spite of a most damnable interruption of several weeks this autumn a detested compulsion to attend for the time to something else got on so straight with the book that three quarters of it are practically written and four or five weeks more will see me i calculate at the end of the matter all the material i received from you has been of course highly usefulindispensable yet none the less all of it put together was not material for a biography pure and simple the subject itself didnt lend itself to that in the strict sense of the word and i had to make out for myself what my material did lend itself to i have i think made out successfully and happily if i havent at any rate it has not been for want of a great expenditure of zeal pains taste though i say it who shouldnt and talent but the book will without doubt be an agreeable and in a literary sense really artistic and honourable one i shall not have made you all so patiently amiably admirably wait so long for nothing i have looked at the picture as it were given me by all your material as a picturethe image or evocation charming heterogeneous and a little ghostly of a great cluster of people a society practically extinct with mr and mrs story naturally all along the centre the pretext so to speak and the point dappui this course was the only one open to meit was imposed with absolute logic the book was not makeable at all unless i used the letters of other people and the letters of other people were useable with effect only so far as i could more or less evoke and present the other people  but i am writing you at hideous lengthand crowding out all space for matters more personal to ourselves when once the book is out i shall want i shall need exceedingly to see you all and i dont think that unless some morbid madness settles on me i shall fear to but that is arrangeable and shall be arranged my blessing on all of you  yours dear mrs waldo most faithfully henry james     to w d howells        the ambassadors began at length to appear in the north american      review january 1903 where it ran throughout the year  dictated  lamb house rye jan 8th 1903  my dear howells  let me beg you first of all not to be disconcerted by this chill legibility i want to write to you today immediately your delightful letter of dec 29th having arrived this morning and i can only manage it by dictation as i am in consequence of some obscure indiscretion of diet yesterday temporarily sick sorry and seedy so that i can only loll rather listless but already better of my poison in an armchair my feelings dont permit me to wait to tell you that the communication i have just had from you surpasses for pure unadulterated charm any communication i have ever received i am really quite overcome and weakened by your recital of the generous way in which you threw yourself into the scale of the arrangement touching my so long unserialized serial which is manifestly so excellent a thing for me i had begun to despair of anything when abruptly this brightens the view for i like extremely the place the nar makes for my novel it meets quite my ideal in respect to that isolation and relief one has always fondly conceived as the proper due of ones productions and yet never amid the promiscuous petticoats and other low company of the usual magazine tableofcontents seen them in the remotest degree attended with one had dreamed in private fatuity that one would really be the better for standing out a little but one had to ones own sense never really stood at all but simply lain very flat for the petticoats and all the foolish feet aforesaid to trample over with the best conscience in the world charming to me also is the idea of your own beneficent paper in the same quarterthe complete detachment of which however from the current fiction itself i equally apprehend and applaud just as i see how the nottobequalified editorial mind would indulge one of its most characteristic impulses by suggesting a connection never mind suggestionsand how you echo one of the most sacred laws of my own effort toward wisdom in not caring to know the source of that one i care to know nothing but that your relation to my stuff as it stands gives me clear joy within a couple of days moreover your three glorious volumes of illustrated prose have arrived to enrich my existence adorn my house and inflame my expectations with many things pressing upon me at this moment as preliminary to windingup here and betaking myself till early in the summer to london my more penetrative attention has not yet been free for them but i am gathering for the swoop please meanwhile be tenderly thanked for the massive and magnificent character of the gift what a glorious quantity of work it brings home to me that you do i feel like a hurdygurdy man listening outside a cathedral to the volume of sound poured forth there by the enthroned organist but goodnight my dear howells with every feeblybreathed but forciblyfelt good wish of yours always and ever  henry james     to william james        the special business that h j hints at in connexion with his      projected visit to america was to be the arrangement for a      collected edition of his works a scheme that was now beginning to      take shape with regard to another allusion in this letter it may      be said that the threatened destruction of the old cottages a few      yards from lamb house was averted  dictated  lamb house rye may 24th 1903  dearest william  how much i feel in arrears with you let this gross machinery testifywhich i shamelessly use to help to haul myself into line however you have most beneficently from of old given me free licence for it other benefits unacknowledged as yet have i continued to receive from you i think ive been silent even since before your so cheering about yourself letter from ashville followed a few days before i left town which i did five days ago by your still more interesting and important one of may 3d in answer to mine dealing so tentatively with the question of my making plans so far as complicatedly and remotely possible for going over to you for 6 or 8 months there isand there was when i wroteno conceivability of my doing this for a year at least to comebefore august 1904 at nearest but it kind of eases my mind to thresh the idea out sufficiently to have a direction to tend to meanwhile and an aim to work at it is in fact a practical necessity for me dès maintenant to know whether or no i absolutely want to go if and when i can such a difference in many ways more than i need undertake to explain do the prospect of going and the prospect of not going make luckily for myself i do already as i feel quite adequately remain convinced that i shall want to whenever i can that is if i dont put it off for much more than a yearafter which period i certainly shall lose the impulse to return to my birthplace under the mere blight of incipient senile decay if i go at all i must go before im too old and above all before i mind being older you are very dissuasiveeven more than i expected but i think it comes from your understanding even less than i expected the motives considerations advisabilities etc that have gradually cumulatively and under much study of the question much carefully invoked light on it been acting upon me i wont undertake just now to tell you what all these reasons are and how they show to mefor there is still plenty of time to do that only i may even at present say that i dont despair of bringing you round in the interval if what is beyond the interval can realise itself to a better perception of my situation it is roughlyand you will perhaps think too crypticallyspeaking a situation for which 6 or 8 months in my native land shine before me as a very possible and profitable remedy and i dont speak not by book simply and supinely to shrinkon mere grounds of general fear and encouraged shockabilityhas to me all the air of giving up chucking away without a struggle the one chance that remains to me in life of anything that can be called a movement my one little ewelamb of possible exotic experience such experience as may convert itself through the senses through observation imagination and reflection now at their maturity into vivid and solid material into a general renovation of ones too monotonised grabbag you speak of the whole matter rather it seems to me à votre aise you make comparatively and have always made so many movements you have travelled and gone to and froalways comparativelyso often and so much i have practically never travelled at allhaving never been economically able to ive only gone for short periods a few timesso much fewer than ive wantedto italy never anywhere else that ive seen every one about me here who is or was anyone perpetually making for these visions ive had one by one all to give upspain greece sicily any glimpse of the east or in fact of anything even to the extent of rummaging about in france even to the extent of trudging about a little in switzerland counting out my few dips into italy there has been no time at which any abroad was financially convenient or possible and now more and more all such adventures present themselves in the light of mere agreeable luxuries expensive and supererogatory inasmuch as not resolving themselves into new material or assimilating with my little acquired stock my accumulated capital of for convenience international items and properties theres nothing to be done by me any more in the way of writing de chic little worthless superficial poncif articles about spain greece or egypt they are the sort of thing that doesnt work in at all to what now most interests me which is human anglosaxonism with the american extension or opportunity for it so far as it may be given me still to work the same if i shouldnt in other words bring off going to the us it would simply mean giving up for the remainder of my days all chance of such experience as is represented by interesting traveland which in this special case of my own would be much more than so represented granting the travel to be american i should settle down to a mere mean oscillation from here to london and from london herewith nothing to speak of left more to happen to me in life in the way of the poetry of motion that spreads before me as for mind imagination special professional labour a thin starved lonely defeated beaten prospect in comparison with which your own circumgyrations have been as the adventures of marco polo or hm stanley i should like to think of going once or twice more again for a sufficient number of months to italy where i know my ground sufficiently to be able to plan for such quiet work there as might be needfully involved but the day is past when i can write stories about italy with a mind otherwise preoccupied my native land which time absence and change have in a funny sort of way made almost as romantic to me as europe in dreams or in my earlier time here used to bethe actual bristling as fearfully bristling as you like usa have the merit and the precious property that they meet and fit into my creative preoccupations and that the period there which should represent the poetry of motion the one big taste of travel not supremely missed would carry with it also possibilities of the prose of production that is of the production of prose such as no other mere bought paid for sceptically and halfheartedly worriedthrough adventure by land or sea would be able to give me my primary idea in the matter is absolutely economicand on a basis that i cant make clear to you now though i probably shall be able to later on if you demand it that is if you also are accessible to the impression of my having any professional standing làbas big enough to be improved on i am not thinking im sure vaguely or blindly but recognising direct intimations when i take for granted some such chance as my personal presence there would conduce to improve i dont mean by its beauty or brilliancy but simply by the benefit of my managing for once in my life not to fail to be on the spot your allusion to an american agent as all sufficient for any purpose i could entertain doesnt for me begin to cover the groundwhich is antecedent to that altogether it isnt in the least a question of my trying to make old copyrights pay better or look into arrangements actually existing its a questionwell of too much more than i can go into the detail of now or much rather into the general and comprehensive truth of or even than i can ever do so long as i only have from you doubt what you say of the eggs  of the vocalisation of the shocks in general and of everything else is utterly beside the markit being absolutely for all that class of phenomena and every other class that i nurse my infatuation i want to see them i want to see everything i want to see the country scarcely a bit new york and boston but intensely the middle and far west and california and the southin cadres as complete and immeasurably more mature than those of the celebrated taine when he went early in the sixties to italy for six weeks in order to write his big book moreover besides the general professional i have thus a conception of have really in definite view there hangs before me a very special other probabilitywhich however i must ask you to take on trust if you can as it would be a mistake for me to bruit it at all abroad as yet to make anything of this lastmentioned business i must be on the spoti mean not only to carry the business out of course but to arrange in advance its indispensable basis it would be the last of follies for me to attempt to do that from herei should simply spoil my chance so you see what it all comes to roughly statedthat the 6 or 8 months in question are all i have to look to unless i give up the prospect of ever stirring again they are the only stir i shall ever be able to afford because though they will cost something cost even a good bit they will bring in a great deal more in proportion than they will cost anything else other than a mere repeated and too aridly angloamerican winter in florence perhaps say would almost only cost but enough of all thisi am saying have said much more than i meant to say at the present date let it at any rate simmer in your mind if your mind has any room for it and take time above all if there is any danger of your still replying adversely let me add this word more however that i mention august 1904 very advisedly if i want and its half the battle to go to the west and south and even dreamably to mexico i could not do these things during that part of the summer during which besides feeling i fear very ill from the heat i should simply have to sit still on the other hand i should like immensely not to fail of coming in for the whole american autumn and like hugely in especial to arrive in time for the last three or four weeks of your stay in chocoruawhich i suppose i should do if i quitted this by about midaugust then i should have the music of toute la lyre coming away after say three or four spring weeks at washington the next april or may but i must stop these castles in spain all hang by the thread of my finding myself in fact economically able 14 months hence to face the music if i am not the whole thing must drop all i can do meanwhile is to try and arrange that i shall be i am scared ratherwell in advanceby the vision of american expenses but the special possibility that shines before me has the virtue of covering potentially all that one thing is very certaini shall not be able to hoard by staying with people this will be impossible to me though i will assuredly by a rich and rare exception dedicate to you and alice as many days as you will take me in for whether in country or town basta  i talk of your having room in mind but you must be having at the present moment little enough for anything save your emerson speech which you are perhaps now for all i know in the very act of delivering this mornings times has in its american despatch an account of the beginning either imminent or actual of the commemorationand i suppose your speech is to be uttered at concord would to god i could sit there entranced by your accentsside by side i suppose with the genial bob may you be floated grandly over your cataractby which i dont mean have any manner of fall but only be a niagara of eloquence all continuously whether above or below the rapids you will send me i devoutly hope some report of the whole thing it affects me much even at this distance and in this so grossly alien airthis overt dedication of dear old emerson to his immortality i hope all the attendant circumstances will be graceful and beautiful i came back hither as i believe i have mentioned some six days ago after some 18 weeks in london which went this time very well and were very easy on my present extremely convenient basis to manage the spring here till within a week has been backward and blighted but summer has arrived at last with a beautiful jump and rye is quite adorable in its outbreak of greenery and blossom i never saw it more lovely than yesterday a supreme summer early summer sunday the dear little charm of the place at such times consoles me for the sordid vandalisms that are rapidly disfiguring and that i fear will soon quite destroy it another scare for me just now is the threatened destruction of the two little charminglyantique silvergrey cottages on the right of the little vista that stretches from my door to the churchthe two that you may remember just beyond my garden wall and in one of which my gardener has lately been living they will be replaced if destroyed by a pair of hideous cheap modern workingmans cottagesa horrid inhuman stab at the very heart of old rye there is a chance it may be still avertedbut only just a bare chance one would buy them in a moment to save them and to save ones little prospect but one is naturally quite helpless for that and the price asked is impudently outrageous quite of the blackmailing order on the other hand let me add im gradually consoling myself now for having been blackmailed in respect to purchase of the neighbouring garden i wrote you of now that i have got it and feel the value of the protection my greater peace seems almost worth the imposition this however is all my newsexcept that i have just acquired by purchase a very beautiful and valuable little dachshund pup of the red species who has been promising to be the joy of my life up to a few hours sincewhen he began to develop a mysterious and increasing tumification of one side of his face about which i must immediately have advice the things my dogs have and the worries i have in consequence i already see this one settled beneath monumental alabaster in the little cemetery in the angle of my garden where he will make the fifth i have heard most happily from billy at marburg he seems to fall everywhere blessedly on his feet but you will know as much and more about him than i i am already notching off the days till i hope to have him here in august i count on his then staying through september but goodbye with every fond vœu i delight in the news of alecks free wild lifeand also of peggys which the accounts of her festivities feathers and frills in a manner reproduce for me tender love to alice i embrace you all and am always yours  henry james     to miss violet hunt   dictated  lamb house rye aug 26th 1903  dear violet hunt  i am very backward with you being in receipt of more than one unanswered communication please set this down to many things not least my having ever since you were here been carrying on uninterruptedly a small but crowded hotel i have still all the same to thank you for the photographs of the admirable little niece one of which the one with the hat i retain sending the other back to you if not by this very post then at least by the very next both are very pleasing but no photograph does much more than rather civilly extinguish the life and bloom so exquisite a thing in a happy childs face also came the shakespearebook back with your accompanying letterfor which also thanks but to which i cant now pretend to reply you rebound lightly i judge from any pressure exerted on you by the authorbut i dont rebound i am a sort of haunted by the conviction that the divine william is the biggest and most successful fraud ever practised on a patient world the more i turn him round and round the more he so affects me but that is alli am not pretending to treat the question or to carry it any further it bristles with difficulties and i can only express my general sense by saying that i find it almost as impossible to conceive that bacon wrote the plays as to conceive that the man from stratford as we know the man from stratford did  for the rest i have been trying to sit tight and get on with work that has been much retarded these two months and much interrupted and blighted i hope you will be able to give me when we next meet as good an account of your adventures and emotions i have taken again the liberty of this machinery with you for having broken in your great amiability i dont want to waste my advantage wherever you are buon divertimento i really hope for you that you are in town which has resources and defences against this execrable august that the bare bosom of nature as we mainly know it here sadly lacks  believe me yours always henry james     to w e norris   lamb house rye september 17th 1903  my dear norris  your letter from the unpronounceable japanese steamer is magnificentso magnificent so appreciated and so felt that it really almost has an effect contrary to the case it incidentally urgesthe effect of undermining my due disposition to write to you your adventures by land and sea your commerce with the great globe your grand imperial and cosmic life hover before me on your admirable page to make me ask what you can possibly want of the small beer of any chronicle of mine my beer always to my sense of the smallest sinks to positively ignoble dregs in the presence of your splendid recordof which i think also i am even moved to a certain humiliated jealousy all this and heaven tooall this and letters from lamb house rye into the bargain that slightly sore sense has in fact been at the bottom of my failure to write to you altogetherthat and a wholly blank mind as to where to address catch or otherwise waylay you frankly really i seemed to imagine you out of tune very naturally and inevitably with our dull lives and only saying to yourself that you would have quite enough of them on getting back to them and finding them creep along as tamely as ever let me hasten to add that i now rejoice to learn that you have actually missed the sound of my voice the scratch of my poor pen and i sit down as promptly almost as you enjoin to prepare a message which shall overtake you or meet you somewhere may it not have failed of this before we you sternly i guiltily are confronted your appeal scented with all the spices of the east and the airs of the antipodes arrived in fact four or five days ago and would have had my more instant attention if the world in these days the small world of my tiny point on the globe were not inconveniently and oppressively with me making great holes in my all too precious my all too hoarded and shrunken treasure of time we have had an execrable an infamous summer of rainendless rain and wild wintry tempest the very worst of my long lifetime but it has not in the least stayed the circulation of my countrypeople in particular and i have been running a small crammed and wholly unlucrative hotel for their benefit without interruption ever since i returned here from london the middle of may as i have to run it socially and personally speaking all unaided and alone i am always in the breach and my fond dream of this place as a little sheltered hermitage is exposed to rude shocks i am just now in short receiving a fresh shock every day and the end is so far from being in sight that the rest of this month and the replete form of october loom before me as truly formidable this once comparatively quiet corner has it is impossible to doubt quite changed its convenient little character since i first knew and adopted it and has become for the portion of the year for which i most so prized it a vulgarly bustling rendezvous of indiscreet and inferior people i dont so qualify my own visitors poor dearsbut the total effect of these harried and haunted months whereof the former golden air has been turned to tinkling brass it all makes me glad i am old and thereby soon to take leave of a world in which one is driven unoffending from pillar to post you see i dont pretend to take up your wondrous tale or to treat you to responsive echoes and ejaculations it will be delightful to do so when we meet again and i can ask you face to face the thousand questions that your story calls to my lips let me even now and thus however congratulate you with all my heart on such a fine bellyful of raw and other material as your so varied and populated experience must have provided you withal you have had to ingurgitate a bigger dose of salt water than i should personally care for and i dont directly wish that any of your opportunities should have been mineso wholly with the lack of means to move has the appetite for movement abandoned my aged carcass but i applaud and enjoy the sight of these high energies in those who are capable and worthy of them and distinctly like to think that there are quasicontemporaries of longer wind and purse and of stouter heart than minethough i am planning at last to go to the us for the first time for 21 years next summer and remain there some 6 or 8 months but there is time to talk of this your letter is full of interesting things that i can however send back to you no echo ofsince if i do i shall still be writing it when you get back and you will come and look at it over my shoulder interesting above all your hints of your convictions or impressions or whatever about the great colonial question and the great josephs probable misadventureas to which i find it utterly impossible to have a competent opinion i have nothing but an obscure and superstitious sense that this countrys fiscal attitude and faith has for the last half century been superior and distinguished and that the change proposed to her reeks probably with political and economical vulgarity but that way just now madness liesyou will find plenty of it when you get back as to the probable date of that event you give me no hint but i look forward to your return with an eager appetite for your high exotic flavour which please do everything further possible meanwhile to intensify unless indeed the final effort of everything shall have been as i shrewdly suspect to make you more brutally british you will even then anyway be an exceedingly welcome reappearance to yours always and ever  henry james     to howard sturgis        the proofsheets in question were those of mr sturgiss      forthcoming novel belchamber  lamb house rye november 8th 1903  my dear howard  i send you back the blooming proofs with my thanks and with no marks or comments at all in the first place there are none of the marginal kind to make and in the second place it is too late to make them if there were the thing goes on very solidly and smoothly interesting and amusing as it moves very well written well felt well composed well written perhaps in particular i am a bad person really to expose fictitious work toi as a battered producer and technician myself have long since inevitably ceased to read with naïveté i can only read critically constructively reconstructively writing the thing over if i can swallow it at all my way and looking at it so to speak from within but even thus i pass your book verytenderly there is only one thing that as a matter of detail i am moved to saywhich is that i feel you have a great deal increased your difficulty by screwing up the social position of all your people so very high when a man is an english marquis even a lame one there are whole masses of marquisate things and items a multitude of inherent detail in his existence which it isnt open to the painter de gaieté de cœur not to make some picture of and yet if i mention this because it is the place where people will challenge you and to suggest to you therefore to expect itif i do so i am probably after all quite wrong no one notices or understands anything and no one will make a single intelligent or intelligible observation about your work they will make plenty of others what i applaud is your sticking to the real line and centre of your themethe consciousness and view of sainty himself and your dealing with things with the whole fantasmagoria as presented to him only not otherwise going behind them  and also i applaud dearest howard your expression of attachment to him who holds this pen and passes it at this moment over very dirty paper for he is extremely accessible to such demonstrations and touched by themmore than ever in his lonely more than maturity keep it up as hard as possible continue to pass your hand into my arm and believe that i always like greatly to feel it we are two who can communicate freely  i send you back also temple bar in which i have found your paper a moving and charming thing waking up the pathetic ghost only too effectually the ancient years and images that i too more or less remember swarm up and vaguely moan round about one like banshees or other mystic and melancholy presences its all a little mystic and melancholy to me here when i am quite alone as i more particularly am after grand company has come and gone you are essentially grand company and felt as suchand the subsidence is proportionally flat but i took a long walk with max this grey still sabbath afternoonhave indeed taken one each day and am possessed of means thank goodness to make the desert of being quite to myself blossom like the rose  goodnightits 1230 the clock ticks loud and max snoozes audibly in the armchair i lately vacated yours my dear howard always and ever  henry james     to henry adams        henry adams the wellknown american historian was a friend of      long standing the following refers to h js recently published      w w story and his friends  lamb house rye november 19 1903  my dear adams  i am so happy at hearing from you at all that the sense of the particular occasion of my doing so is almost submerged and smothered you did bravely well to writemake a note of the act for your future career as belonging to a class of impulses to be precipitately obeyed and if possible even tenderly nursed yet it has been interesting exceedingly in the narrower sense as well as delightful in the larger to have your letter with its ingenious expression of the effects on you of poor w w swith whom and the whole business of whom there is yes i can see a kind of inevitableness in my having made you squirmor whatever is the proper name for the sensation engendered in you very curious and even rather terrible this so farreaching action of a little biographical vividnesswhich did indeed in a manner begin with me myself even as i put the stuff togetherthough putting me to conclusions less grim as i may call them than in your case the truth is that any retraced story of bourgeois lives lives other than great lives of actionet encore throws a chill upon the scene the time the subject the small mappedout facts and if you find great men thin it isnt really so much their fault and least of all yours as that the art of the biographerdevilish artis somehow practically thinning it simplifies even while seeking to enrichand even the immortal are so helpless and passive in death the proof is that i wanted to invest dull old boston with a mellow a golden glowand that for those who know like yourself i only make it bleakand weak luckily those who know are indeed but three or fourand they wont i hope too promiscuously tell  yours my dear adams always and ever henry james     to sir george o trevelyan        the second part of sir george trevelyans american revolution had      just appeared at this time  lamb house rye nov 25th 1903  dear sir george  i should be a poor creature if i had read your two last volumes without feeling the liveliest desire to write to you that is the desire you must have kindled indeed in more quarters than you will care to reckon with but even this reflection doesnt stay my pen save to make me parenthise that i should be absolutely distressed to receive from you any acknowledgment of these few lines  this new instalment of your admirable book has held me so tight from chapter to chapter that it is as if i were hanging back from mere force of appreciation and yet i found myself as i read vibrating responsively in so many different ways that my emotions carried me at the same time all over the place you of course know far better than i how you have dealt with your material but i doubt whether you know what a work of civilization you are perpetrating internationally by the very fact of your producing so exquisite a work of art the american the englishman the artist and the critic in meto say nothing of the friendall drink you down in a deep draught each in turn feeling that he is more deeply concerned but it is of course as with the other volume the books being so richly and authoritatively english so validly true and yet so projected as it were into the american consciousness that will help to build the bridge across the atlantic and i think it is the mystery of this large fusion carried out in so many ways that makes the thing so distinguished a work of art yet who shall say so familiarlywhen a thing is such a work of arti mean who shall say how it has by a thousand roads got itself made so  it is this literary temperament of your work this beautiful quality of composition and feeling of the presentation grasping reality all the while and controlling and playing with the detail it is this in our chattering and slobbering day that gives me the sense of the ampler tread and deeper voice of the manin fact of his speaking in his own voice at all or moving with his own step you will make my own country people touch as with reverence the hem of his garment but i think that i most envy you your having such a method at allyour being able to see so many facts and yet to see them each imaged and related and lighted as a painter sees the objects together that are before his canvas they become i mean so amusingly concrete and individual for you but that is just the inscrutable luxury of your book and you bring home further to me at least who had never so fully felt it what a difficult and precarious and even mightnothave been revolution it was altogether as a revolution wasnt it as nearly as possible not being that whatever else it might have been the tail might in time have taken to wagging the dog if the tail could only as seemed so easy have been left on but i didnt mean to embark on these reflections i only wanted really to make you feel a little responsible for my being through living with you this succession of placid country evenings far from the london ravage extravagantly agitated but take your responsibility philosophically recall me to the kind consideration of lady trevelyan and believe me very constantly yours  henry james
