27675250	miles wallingford  sequel to afloat and ashore  by j fenimore cooper  1863    preface   the conclusion of this tale requires but little preface many persons may think that there is too much of an old mans despondency in a few of the opinions of this portion of the work but after sixty it is seldom we view the things of this world en beau there are certain political allusions very few in number but pretty strong in language that the signs of the times fully justify in the editors judgment though he does not profess to give his own sentiments in this work so much as those of the subject of the narrative himself the antirent combination for instance will prove according to the editors conjectures to be one of two things in this communitythe commencement of a dire revolution or the commencement of a return to the sounder notions and juster principles that prevailed among us thirty years since than certainly prevail today there is one favourable symptom discoverable in the deepseated disease that pervades the social system men dare and do deal more honestly and frankly with the condition of society in this country than was done a few years since this right one that ought to be most dear to every freeman has been recovered only by painful sacrifices and a stern resolution but recovered it has been in some measure and were the pens of the country true to their owners privileges we should soon come to a just view of the sacred nature of private character as well as the targetlike vulnerability of public follies and public vice it is certain that for a series of dangerous years notions just the reverse of this have prevailed among us gradually rendering the american press equally the vehicle of the most atrocious personal calumny and the most flatulent national selfadulation it is under such a state of things that the few evils alluded to in this work have had their rise bodies of men however ignorant or small have come to consider themselves as integral portions of a community that never errs and consequently entitled to esteem themselves infallible when in debt they have fancied it political liberty to pay their debts by the strong hand a very easy transition for those who believe themselves able to effect all their objects the disease has already passed out of new york into pennsylvania it will spread like any other epidemic throughout the country and there will soon be a severe struggle among us between the knave and the honest man let the class of the latter look to it it is to be hoped it is still sufficiently powerful to conquer  these few remarks are made in explanation of certain opinions of mr wallingford that have been extorted from him by the events of the day as he was preparing this work for the press remarks that might seem out of place were it not a part of his original plan which contemplated enlarging far more than he has indeed on some of the prominent peculiarities of the state of society in which he has passed the greater part of his days      miles wallingford    chapter i      but ill not chide thee   let shame come when it will i do not call it   i do not bid the thunderbearer shoot   nor tell tales of thee to highjudging jove   mend when thou canst    lear   it is almost as impossible to describe minutely what occurred on the boats reaching the wallingford as to describe all the terrific incidents of the struggle between drewett and myself in the water i had sufficient perception however to see as i was assisted on board by mr hardinge and neb that lucy was not on deck she had probably gone to join grace with a view to be in readiness for meeting the dire intelligence that was expected i afterwards learned that she was long on her knees in the aftercabin engaged in that convulsive prayer which is apt to accompany sudden and extreme distress in those who appeal to god in their agony  during the brief moments and they were but mere particles of time if one can use such an expression in which my senses could catch anything beyond the horrid scene in which i was so closely engaged i had heard shrill screams from the lungs of chloe but lucys voice had not mingled in the outcry even now as we were raised or aided to the deck the former stood with her face glistening with tears half convulsed with terror and half expanding with delight uncertain whether to laugh or to weep looking first at her master and then at her own admirer until her feelings found a vent in the old exclamation of der feller  it was fortunate for andrew drewett that a man of posts experience and steadiness was with us no sooner was the seemingly lifeless body on board than mr hardinge ordered the watercask to be got out and he and marble would have soon been rolling the poor fellow with all their might or holding him up by the heels under the notion that the water he had swallowed must be got out of him before he could again breathe but the authority of one so high in the profession soon put a stop to this drewetts wet clothes were immediately removed blankets were warmed at the galley and the most judicious means were resorted to in order to restore the circulation the physician soon detected signs of life and ordering all but one or two assistants to leave the spot in ten minutes drewett was placed in a warm bed and might be considered out of danger  the terrific scene enacted so directly before his eyes produced an effect on the albonny man who consented to haul aft his mainsheet lower his studdingsail and topsail come by the wind stand across to the wallingford heaveto and lower a boat this occurred just as drewett was taken below and a minute later old mrs drewett and her two daughters helen and caroline were brought alongside of us the fears of these tender relatives were allayed by my report for by this time i could both talk and walk and post raised no objection to their being permitted to go below i seized that opportunity to jump down into the sloops hold where neb brought me some dry clothes and i was soon in a warm delightful glow that contributed in no small degree to my comfort so desperate had been my struggles however that it took a good nights rest completely to restore the tone of my nerves and all my strength my arrangements were barely completed when i was summoned to the cabin  grace met me with extended arms she wept on my bosom for many minutes she was dreadfully agitated as it was though happily she knew nothing of the cause of chloes screams and of the confusion on deck until i was known to be safe then lucy communicated all the facts to her in as considerate a manner as her own kind and gentle nature could dictate i was sent for as just stated and caressed like any other precious thing that its owner had supposed itself about to lose we were still in an agitated state when mr hardinge appeared at the door of the cabin with a prayerbook in his hand he demanded our attention all kneeling in both cabins while the good simpleminded old man read some of the collects the lords prayer and concluded with the thanksgiving for a safe return from sea he would have given us the marriage ceremony itself before he would have gone out of the prayerbook for any united worship whatever  it was impossible not to smile at this last act of pious simplicity while it was equally impossible not to be touched with such an evidence of sincere devotion the offering had a soothing influence on all our feelings and most especially on those of the excited females as i came out into the maincabin after this act of devotion the excellent divine took me in his arms kissed me just as he had been used to do when a boy and blessed me aloud i confess i was obliged to rush on deck to conceal my emotion  in a few minutes i became sufficiently composed to order sail made on our course when we followed the orpheus up the river soon passing her and taking care to give her a wide berth a precaution i long regretted not having used at first as mrs drewett and her two daughters refused to quit andrew we had the whole family added to our party as it might be per force i confess to having been sufficiently selfish to complain a little to myself only however at always finding these people in my way during the brief intervals i now enjoyed of being near lucy as there was no help after seeing all the canvass spread i took a seat in one of the chairs that stood on the maindeck and began for the first time coolly to ponder on all that had just passed while thus occupied marble drew a chair to my side gave me a cordial squeeze of the hand and began to converse at this moment neatly tricked out in dry clothes stood neb on the forecastle with his arms folded sailorfashion as calm as if he had never felt the wind blow occasionally giving in however under the influence of chloes smiles and unsophisticated admiration in these moments of weakness the black would bow his head give vent to a short laugh when suddenly recovering himself he would endeavour to appear dignified while this pantomime was in the course of exhibition forward the discourse aft did not flag  providence intends you for something remarkable miles my mate continued after one or two brief expressions of his satisfaction at my safety something uncommonly remarkable depend on it first you were spared in the boat off the isle of bourbon then in another boat off delaware bay next you got rid of the frenchman so dexterously in the british channel after that there was the turnup with the bloody smudge and his companions next comes the recapture of the crisis sixthly as one might say you picked me up at sea a runaway hermit and now here this very day seventhly and lastly are you sitting safe and sound after carrying as regular a lubber as ever fell overboard on your head and shoulders down to the bottom of the hudson no less than three times i consider you to be the only man living who ever sank his three times and came up to tell of it with his own tongue  i am not at all conscious of having said one word about it moses i retorted a little drily  every motion every glance of your eye boy tells the story no providence intends you for something remarkable you may rely on that one of these days you may go to congresswho knows  by the same rule you are to be included then for in most of my adventures you have been a sharer besides having quantities that are exclusively your own remember you have even been a hermit  hushnot a syllable about it or the children would run after me as a sight you must have generalized in a remarkable way miles after you sunk the last time without much hope of coming up again  indeed my friend you are quite right in your conjecture so near a view of death is apt to make us all take rapid and wide views of the past i believe it even crossed my mind that you would miss me sadly  ay returned marble with feeling them are the moments to bring out the truth not a juster idee passed your brain than that master miles i can assure you missed you i would have bought a boat and started for marble land never again to quit it the day after the funeral but there stands your cook fidgeting and looking this way as if she had a word to put in on the occasion this explite of nebs will set the niggers up in the world and it wouldnt surprise me if it cost you a suit of finery all round  a price i will cheerfully pay for my life it is as you saydido certainly wishes to speak to me and i must give her an invitation to come nearer  dido clawbonny was the cook of the family and the mother of chloe whatever hypercriticism might object to her colour which was a black out of which all the gloss had fairly glistened itself over the fire no one could deny her being full blown her weight was exactly two hundred and her countenance a strange medley of the lightheartedness of her race and the habitual and necessary severity of a cook she often protested that she was weighed down by responserbility the whole of the discredit of overdone beef or underdone fish together with those which attach themselves to heavy bread leadlike buckwheatcakes and a hundred other similar cases belonging exclusively to her office she had been twice married the last connection having been formed only a twelvemonth before in obedience to a sign this important lady now approached  welcome back masser mile dido began with a curtsey meaning welcome back from being halfdrowned ebberybody so grad you isnt hurt  thank you didothank you with all my heart if i have gained nothing else by the ducking i have gained a knowledge of the manner in which my servants love me  lor bless us all how we help it masser mile as if a body can posserbly help how lub come and go lub jest like religion masser milesome get him and some dont but lub for a young masser and a young missus sahdat jest as natral as lub for ole masser and ole missus i tink nutin of neider  luckily i was too well acquainted with the clawbonny dialect to need a vocabulary in order to understand the meaning of dido all she wished to express was the idea that it was so much a matter of course for the dependants of the family to love its heads that she did not think the mere circumstance in itself worthy of a second thought  well dido i said how does matrimony agree with you in your old age i hear you took a second partner to yourself while i was last at sea  dido let her eyes fall on the deck according to the custom of all brides let their colour be what it may manifested a proper degree of confusion then curtsied turned her full moonface so as to resemble a halfmoon and answered with a very suspicious sort of a sigh  yes masser mile dat jest so i did tink to wait and ask e young massers consent but cupid saynot the god of love but an old negro of that name didos second partnerbut cupid say what odd he make to masser mile he long way off and he wont care and so sah rader than be tormented so by cupid one had altogedder better be married at oncedat all sah  and that is quite enough my good woman that everything may be in rule i give my consent now and most cheerfully  tankee sah dropping a curtsey and showing her teeth  of course the ceremony was performed by our excellent rector good mr hardinge  sartain sahno clawbonny nigger tink he marry at all less masser hardinge bless him and say amen ebberybody say e marriage is as good as ole masser and missusses dis make two time dido got married and both time good lawful ceremunny as ebber was oh yes sah  and i hope your

deny ah masser mile em ere stephusband after all nebber jest like a body own husband cupid berry honest and berry sober but he only stephusband and dat i tell him twenty time already i do tink if trut was said  perhaps you have now said it often enoughtwenty times are quite sufficient to tell a man such a fact  yes sah dropping another curtsey if masser mile please  i do please and think you have told him that often enough if a man wont learn a thing in twenty lessons he is not worth the trouble of teaching so tell him hes a stephusband no more but try something else i hope he makes chloe a good father  lor sah he no chloes fadder at allher fadder dead and gone and nebber come back i want to say a word to young masser bout chloe and dat ere fellow nebyes sah  well what is it dido i see they like each other and suppose they wish to get married too is that the object of your visit if so i consent without waiting to be asked neb will make no stephusband i can promise you  dont be in a hurry masser mile said dido with an eagerness that showed this ready consent was anything but what she wanted dere many jection to neb when he ask to marry a young gal in chloe sitiation you know sah chloe now miss graces own waitinmaid nobody else help her dress or do anything in e young missuss room dan chloe sheselfmy darter chloe clawbonny  here was a new turn given to the affair it was like master like man nebs love or lub for that was just the word and just the idea too was no more fated to run smooth than my own and the same objection lay against us both viz want of gentility i determined to say a good word for the poor fellow however while it would have been exceeding the usage of the family to interfere in any other manner than by advice in an affair of the heart  if chloe is my sisters favourite servant dido i remarked you are to remember that neb is mine  dat true sah and so chloe say but dere great difference masser mile atween clawbonny and a ship neb own himself young masser he doesnt even lib in cabin where you lib sah  all that is true dido but there is a difference of another sort between a ship and a house the houseservant may be more liked and trusted than the outdoor servant but we think at sea it is more honourable to be a foremasthand than to be in the cabin unless as an officer i was a foremast jack some time myself and neb is only in such a berth as his master once filled  dat a great dealquite wonerful sahberry great deal and more dan chloe can say or i can wish her to say but sah dey say now neb has save e young massers life young masser must gib him freepaper and no gal of mine shall ebber be free niggers wife no sah scuse me from dat disgrace which too much for faitful ole servant to bear  i am afraid dido neb is the same way of thinking i offered him his freedom the other day and he refused to receive it times are changing in this country and it will be thought soon it is more creditable for a black to be free than to be any mans slave the law means to free all hands of you one of these days  nebber tell me dat masser miledat day nebber come for me or mine even ole cupid know better dan dat now sah misser van blarcums brom want to have chloe dreadful but i nebber consent to sich a unerdido meant unionnebber our family sah altogedder too good to marry in among the van blarcums nebber has been and never shall be uner atween em  i was not aware dido that the clawbonny slaves were so particular about their connections  wonerful particular sah and ebber hab been and ebber will be dont tink masser mile i marry ole cupid myself if anoder propr connection offer in e family but i prefar him to marry into any oder family hereabout  neb is clawbonny and my great friend so i hope you will think better of his suit some day chloe may like to be free and neb will always have it in his power to make his wife free as well as himself  sah i tink as you say masser miles sahwhen i hab done tinkin sah hope young masser and young missus hear what ole cook got to say afore ey gives consent  certainly chloe is your daughter and she shall pay you all due respectfor that i will answer for my sister as well as for myself we will never encourage disrespect for parents  dido renewed and redoubled her thanks made another profound curtsey and withdrew with a dignity that i dare say in nebs and chloes eyes boded little good as for myself i now mused on the character of the things of this world here were people of the very humblest class known in a nationnay of a class sealed by nature itself and doomed to inferiorityjust as tenacious of the very distinctions that were making me so miserable and against which certain persons who are wiser than the rest of the world declaim without understanding them and even go so far sometimes as to deny their existence my cook reasoned in her sphere much as i knew that rupert reasoned as the drewetts reasoned as the world reasoned and as i feared even lucy reasoned in my own case the return of marble who had left my side as soon as dido opened her budget prevented my dwelling long on this strangei had almost said uncouthcoincidence and brought my mind back to present things  as the old woman has spun her yarn miles the mate resumed we will go on with matters and things i have been talking with the mother of the youngster that fell overboard and giving her some advice for the benefit of her son in time to come and what do you think she gives as the reason for the silly thing he did  it is quite out of my power to saythat he was a silly fellow naturally perhaps  love it seems the poor boy is in love with this sweet friend of yours ruperts sister and it was nothing more nor less than love which made him undertake to play ropedancer on our mainboom  did mrs drewett tell you this with her own mouth marble  that did she captain wallingford for while you were discussing neb and chloe with old dido we that is the doctor the mother and myself were discussing andrew and lucy between ourselves the good old lady gave me to understand it was a settled thing and that she looked on miss hardinge already as a third daughter  this was a strange subject for mrs drewett to discuss with a man like marble or even with post but some allowances were to be made for marbles manner of viewing his own connection with the dialogue and more for the excited condition of the mothers feelings she was scarcely yet in possession of all her faculties and might very well commit an indiscretion of this nature more especially in her conversation with a man in posts position overlooking or disregarding the presence of the mate the effect of all that had passed was to leave a strong impression on my mind that i was too late lucy must be engaged and waited only to become of age in order to make the settlements she intended in favour of her brother ere she was married her manner to myself was merely the result of habit and sincere friendship a little increased in interest and gentleness perhaps on account of the grievous wrong she felt we had received from rupert what right had i to complain admitting all this to be true i had scarcely been aware of my own passion for the dear girl for years and had certainly never attempted to make her acquainted with it she had made me no pledges plighted no faith received no assurances of attachment was under no obligation to wait my pleasure so sincere was my affection for lucy that i rejoiced even in my misery when i remembered that not the slightest imputation could be laid on her deportment truth or frankness on the whole it was perhaps the more natural that she should love andrew drewett one she met for the first time after she became of an age to submit to such impressions than to love me whom she had been educated to treat with the familiarity and confidence of a brother yes i was even just enough to admit this  the scene of the morning and the presence of mrs drewett and her daughters produced an entire change in the spirits and intercourse of our party the ladies remained below most of the time and as for drewett himself he was advised by post not to quit his berth until he found his strength restored mr hardinge passed much time by andrew drewetts side offering such attentions as might be proper from a father to a son at least it so seemed to me this left marble and myself in possession of the quarterdeck though we had occasional visits from all belowgrace lucy and old mrs drewett excepted  in the mean time the wallingford continued to ascend the river favoured until evening by a light southerly breeze she outsailed everything and just as the sun was sinking behind the fine termination of the cattskill range of mountains we were some miles above the outlet of the stream that has lent it its name  a lovelier landscape can scarce be imagined than that which presented itself from the deck of the sloop it was the first time i had ascended the river or indeed that any of the clawbonny party had been up it so high mr hardinge excepted and everybody was called on deck to look at the beauties of the hour the sloop was about a mile above hudson and the view was to be gazed at towards the south this is perhaps the finest reach of this very beautiful stream though it is not the fashion to think so the highlands being the part usually preferred it is easy enough for me who have since lived among the sublimity of the swiss and italian lakes to understand that there is nothing of a very sublime character relatively considered in any of the reaches of the hudson but it would be difficult to find a river that has so much which is exquisitely beautiful and this too of a beauty which borders on the grand lucy was the first person to create any doubts in my mind concerning the perfection of the highlands just as the cockney declaims about richmond hillthe inland view from montmartre of a clouded day is worth twenty of itbut just as the provincial london cockney declaims about richmond hill so has the provincial american been in the habit of singing the praises of the highlands of the hudson the last are sufficiently striking i will allow but they are surpassed in their own kind by a hundred known mountain landscapes while the softer parts of the river have scarcely a rival lucy i repeat was the first person to teach me this distinctionlucy who then had never seen either alps or apennines but her eye was as true as her principles her tongue or her character all was truth about this dear girltruth unadulterated and unalloyed  certainly my dear mrs drewett the dear girl said as she stood supporting the old lady who leaned on her arm gazing at the glorious sunset the highlands have nothing to equal this to me this seems all that art could achieve while i confess the views in the mountains have ever appeared to want something that the mind can imagine  mrs drewett though a respectable was a commonplace woman she belonged to the vast class that do most of their thinking by proxy and it was a sort of heresy in her eyes to fancy anything could surpass the highlands poor mrs drewett she was exceedingly cockney without having the slightest suspicion of it her best ought to be everybody elses best she combated lucys notion warmly therefore protesting that the highlands could not have a superior this is a sort of argument it is not easy to overcome and her companion was content to admire the scene before her in silence after urging one or two reasons in support of her opinion in her own quiet unpretending manner  i overheard this little argument and was a close observer of the manner of the parlies mrs drewett was extremely indulgent even while warmest seeming to me to resist lucys opinion as an affectionate mother would contend with the mistaken notions of a very favourite child on the other hand lucy appeared confiding and spoke as the young of her sex are most apt to do when they utter their thoughts to ears they feel must be indulgent  a sunset cannot last for ever and even this sweet as it had been soon became tame and tasteless to me as the ladies now disappeared i determined to anchor the wind failing and the tide coming ahead marble and myself had a sort of stateroom fitted up for us in the hold and thither i was glad to retire standing really in need of rest after the terrible exertions of that day what passed in the cabins that evening i had no opportunity of knowing though i heard laughing and happy female voices through the bulkheads hours after my own head was on its pillow when marble came down to turn in he told me the cabin party had revived and that there had been much pleasant discourse among the young people and this in a way to cause even him to derive great satisfaction as a listener  neb gave us a call at daylight the wind was fresh at westnorthwest but the tide was just beginning to run on the flood i was so impatient to be rid of my guests that all hands were called immediately and we got the sloop underway the pilot professed himself willing to beat up through the narrow passages above and the wallingfords greatest performance being on the wind i was determined to achieve my deliverance that very tide the sloop drew more water than was usual for the upriver craft it is true but she was light and just at the moment could go wherever the loaded albany vessels went those were not the days of vast public works and as for seagoing craft none had ever crossed the overslaugh so far as had come to my knowledge times have changed greatly since but the reader will remember i am writing of that remote period in american history the year of our lord 1803  the anchor was no sooner aweigh than the deck became a scene of activity the breeze was stiff and it enabled me to show the wallingford off to advantage among the dull flatbottomed craft of that day there were reaches in which the wind favoured us too and by the time the ladies reappeared we were up among the islands worming our way through the narrow channels with rapidity and skill to me and to marble also the scene was entirely novel and between the activity that our evolutions required and the constant change of scene we had little leisure to attend to those in the cabin just as breakfast was announced indeed the vessel was approaching the more difficult part of the river and all we got of that meal we took on deck at snatches between the many tacks we made as goodluck would have it however the wind backed more to the westward about eight oclock and we were enabled to stem the ebb that began to make at the same time this gave us the hope of reaching the end of our passage without again anchoring  at length we reached the overslaugh which as was apt to be the case was well sprinkled with vessels aground the pilot carried us through them all however if not literally with flying colours which would have been regarded as an insult by the less fortunate at least with complete success then albany came into view leaning against its sharp acclivity and spreading over its extensive bottomland it was not the town it is today by quite threefourths less in dwellings and people but it was then as now one of the most picturesquelooking places in america there is no better proof in its way how much more influence the talking and writing part of mankind have than the mere actors than is to be found in the relative consideration of albany on the scale of appearance and position as compared with those enjoyed by a hundred other towns more especially in the eastern states almost without a competitor as to beauty of situation or at least on a level with richmond and burlington among the inland towns it was usually esteemed a dutch place that every pretender was at liberty to deride in my younger days we are a people by no means addicted to placing our candle under the bushel and yet i cannot recall a single civil expression in any native writer touching the beauties of albany it may have been owing to the circumstance that so much of the town was under the hill at the beginning of the century and that strangers had few opportunities of seeing it to advantage but i rather think its want of the anglosaxon origin was the principal reason it was so little in favour  glad enough was i to reach the wharves with their line of storehouses that then literally spouted wheat into the sloops that crowded the quays on its way to feed the contending armies of europe late as it was in the season wheat was still pouring outward through all the channels of the country enriching the farmers with prices that frequently rose as high as two dollars and a half the bushel and sometimes as high as three yet no one was so poor in america as to want bread the dearer the grain the higher the wages of the labourer and the better he lived  it was not at all late when the wallingford was slowly approaching the wharf where it was intended to bringup there was a sloop ahead of us which we had been gradually approaching for the last two hours but which was enabled to keep in advance in consequence of the lightness of the wind this dying away of the breeze rendered the approaching noontide calm and pleasant and everybody inboard even to grace came on deck as we moved slowly past the dwellings on the eastern bank in order to get a view of the town i proposed that the clawbonny party should land contrary to our original intention and profit by the opportunity to see the political capital of the state at our leisure both grace and lucy were inclined to listen favourably and the drewetts andrew and his sisters were delighted at this prospect of our remaining together a little longer just at this moment the wallingford true to her character was coming up with the sloop ahead and was already doubling on her quarter i was giving some orders when lucy and chloe supporting grace passed me on their way to the cabin my poor sister was pale as death and i could see that she trembled so much she could hardly walk a significant glance from lucy bade me not to interfere and i hid sufficient selfcommand to obey i turned to look at the neighbouring sloop and found at once an explanation of my sisters agitation the mertons and rupert were on her quarterdeck and so near as to render it impossible to avoid speaking at least to the former at this embarrassing instant lucy returned to my side with a view as i afterwards learned to urge me to carry the wallingford to some place so distant as to remove the danger of any intercourse this accident rendered the precaution useless the whole party in the other vessel catching sight of my companion at the same moment  this is an agreeable surprise called out emily in whose eyes ruperts sister could not be an object of indifference by your brothers and mrs drewetts account we had supposed you at clawbonny by the bedside of miss wallingford  miss wallingford is here as are my father and mrs drewett and  lucy never let it be known who that other and was intended to include  well this is altogether surprising put in rupert with a steadiness of voice that really astounded me at the very moment we were giving you lots of credit for your constancy in friendship and all that sort of thing here you are mademoiselle lucie trotting off to the springs like all the rest of us bent on pleasure  no rupert answered lucy in a tone which i thought could not fail to bring the heartless coxcomb to some sense of the feeling he ought to manifest i am going to no springs dr post has advised a change of scene and air for grace and miles has brought us all up in his sloop that we may endeavour to contribute to the dear sufferers comfort in one united family we shall not land in albany  i took my cue from these last words and understood that i was not even to bring the sloop alongside the wharf  upon my word it is just as she says colonel cried rupert i can see my father on the forecastle with post and divers others of my acquaintance ayand theres drewett as i live wallingford too how fare you noble captain up in this freshwater stream you must be strangely out of your latitude  how do you do mr hardinge i coldly returned the salutation and then i was obliged to speak to the major and his daughter but neb was at the helm and i had given him a sign to sheer further from our companion this soon reduced the intercourse to a few wavings of handkerchiefs and kissings of the hand in which all the drewetts came in for a share as for lucy she walked aside and i seized the occasion to get a word in private  what am i to do with the sloop i asked it will soon be necessary to come to some decision  by no means go to the wharf oh this has been most cruel the cabinwindows are open and grace must have heard every syllable not even a question as to her health i dread to go below and witness the effect  i wished not to speak of rupert to his sister and avoided the subject the question therefore was simply repeated lucy inquired if it were not possible to land our passengers without bringingup and hearing the truth on the subject she renewed her entreaties not to land room was taken accordingly and the sloop as soon as high enough was roundedto and the boat lowered the portmanteau of post was placed in it and the drewetts were told that everything was ready to put them ashore  surely we are not to part thus exclaimed the old lady you intend to land lucy if not to accompany us to ballston the waters might prove of service to miss wallingford  dr post thinks not but advises us to return tranquilly down the river we may yet go as far as sandy hook or even into the sound it all depends on dear graces strength and inclinations  protestations of regret and disappointment followed for everybody appeared to think much of lucy and very little of my poor sister some attempts were even made at persuasion but the quiet firmness of lucy soon convinced her friends that she was not to be diverted from her purpose mr hardinge too had a word to say in confirmation of his daughters decision and the travellers reluctantly prepared to enter the boat after he had assisted his mother over the sloops side andrew drewett turned to me and in fair gentlemanlike manly language expressed his sense of the service i had rendered him after this acknowledgment the first he had made i could do no less than shake his hand and we parted in the manner of those who have conferred and received a favour  i could perceive that lucys colour heightened and that she looked exceedingly gratified while this little scene was in the course of being acted though i was unable to comprehend the precise feeling that was predominant in her honest and truthful heart did that increased colour proceed from pleasure at the handsome manner in which drewett acquitted himself of one of the most embarrassing of all our dutiesthe admission of a deep obligation or was it in any manner connected with her interest in me i could not ask and of course did not learn this scene however terminated our intercourse with the drewetts for the moment the boat pulling away immediately after    chapter ii            misplaced in life   i know not what i could have been but feel   i am not what i should belet it end    sardanapalus   glad enough was i to find the quiet and domestic character of my vessel restored lucy had vanished as soon as it was proper but agreeably to her request i got the sloops head downstream and began our returnpassage without even thinking of putting a foot on the then unknown land of albany marble was too much accustomed to submit without inquiry to the movements of the vessel he was in to raise any objections and the wallingford her boat in tow was soon turning down with the tide aided by a light westerly wind on her homeward course this change kept all on deck so busy that it was some little time ere i saw lucy again when we did meet however i found her sad and full of apprehension grace had evidently been deeply hurt by ruperts deportment the effect on her frame was such that it was desirable to let her be as little disturbed as possible lucy hoped she might fall asleep for like an infant her exhausted physical powers sought relief in this resource almost as often as the state of her mind would permit her existence although i did not then know it was like that of the flame which flickers in the air and which is endangered by the slightest increase of the current to which the lamp may be exposed  we succeeded in getting across the overslaugh without touching and had got down among the islands below coejimans1 when we were met by the new flood the wind dying away to a calm we were compelled to select a berth and anchor as soon as we were snug i sought an interview with lucy but the dear girl sent me word by chloe that grace was dozing and that she could not see me just at that moment as her presence in the cabin was necessary in order to maintain silence on receiving this message i ordered the boat hauled up alongside marble myself and neb got in when the black sculled us ashorechloe grinning at the latters dexterity as with one hand and a mere play of the wrist he caused the water to foam under the bows of our little bark    footnote 1 queemans as pronounced this is a dutch not an indian   name and belongs to a respectable new york family  the spot where we landed was a small but lovely gravelly cove that was shaded by three or four enormous weepingwillows and presented the very picture of peace and repose it was altogether a retired and rural bit there being near it no regular landing no reels for seines nor any of those signs that denote a place of resort a single cottage stood on a small natural terrace elevated some ten or twelve feet above the rich bottom that sustained the willows this cottage was the very beau idéal of rustic neatness and home comfort it was of stone one story in height with a high pointed roof and had a dutchlooking gable that faced the river and which contained the porch and outer door the stones were white as the driven snow having been washed a few weeks before the windows had the charm of irregularity and everything about the dwelling proclaimed a former century and a regime different from that under which we were then living in fact the figures 1698 let in as iron braces to the wall of the gable announced that the house was quite as old as the second structure at clawbonny  the garden of this cottage was not large but it was in admirable order it lay entirely in the rear of the dwelling and behind it again a small orchard containing about a hundred trees on which the fruit began to show itself in abundance lay against the sort of amphitheatre that almost enclosed this little nook against the intrusion and sight of the rest of the world there were also half a dozen huge cherry trees from which the fruit had not yet altogether disappeared near the house to which they served the double purpose of ornament and shade the outhouses seemed to be as old as the dwelling and were in quite as good order  as we drew near the shore i directed neb to cease sculling and sat gazing at this picture of retirement and apparently of content while the boat drew towards the gravelly beach under the impetus already received  this is a hermitage i think i could stand miles said marble whose look had not been off the spot since the moment we left the sloops side this is what i should call a human hermitage and none of your out and out solitudes room for pigs and poultry a nice gravelly beach for your boat good fishing in the offing ill answer for it a snug shoulderofmutton sort of a house trees as big as a twodeckers lower masts and company within hail should a fellow happen to take it into his head that he was getting melancholy this is just the spot i would like to fetchup in when it became time to go into dock what a place to smoke a segar in is that bench up yonder under the cherry tree and grog must have a double flavour alongside of that spring of fresh water  you could become the owner of this very place moses and then we should be neighbours and might visit each other by water it cannot be much more than fifty miles from this spot to clawbonny  i dare say now that they would think of asking for a place like this as much money as would buy a good wholesome shipa regular a no 1  no such thing a thousand or twelve hundred dollars would purchase the house and all the land we can seesome twelve or fifteen acres at the most you have more than two thousand salted away i know moses between prizemoney wages adventures and other matters  i could hold my head up under two thousand of a sartainty i wish the place was a little nearer clawbonny say eight or ten miles off and then i do think i should talk to the people about a trade  its quite unnecessary after all i have quite as snug a cove near the creek bluff at clawbonny and will build a house for you there you shall not tell from a ships cabin that would be more to your fancy  ive thought of that too miles and at one time fancied it would be a prettyish sort of an idee but it wont stand logarithms at all you may build a room that shall have its cabin look but you cant build one thatll have a cabin natur you may get carlins and transoms and lockers and bulkheads all right but where are you to get your motion whats a cabin without motion it would soon be like the sea in the calm latitudes offensive to the senses no none of your bloody motionless cabins for me if im afloat let me be afloat if im ashore let me be ashore  ashore we were by this time the boats keel grinding gently on the pebbles of the beach we landed and walked towards the cottage there being nothing about the place to forbid our taking this liberty i told marble we would ask for a drink of milk two cows being in sight cropping the rich herbage of a beautiful little pasture this expedient at first seemed unnecessary no one appearing about the place to question our motives or to oppose our progress when we reached the door of the cottage we found it open and could look within without violating any of the laws of civilization there was no vestibule or entry but the door communicated directly with a room of some size and which occupied the whole front of the building i dare say this single room was twenty feet square besides being of a height a little greater than was then customary in buildings of that class this apartment was neatness itself it had a homemade but really pretty carpet on the floor contained a dozen oldfashioned highback chairs in some dark wood two or three tables in which one might see his face a couple of mirrors of no great size but of quaint gilded ornaments a beaufet with some real china in it and the other usual articles of a country residence that was somewhat above the ordinary farmhouses of the region and yet as much below the more modest of the abodes of the higher class i supposed the cottage to be the residence of some small family that had seen more of life than was customary with the mere husbandman and yet not enough to raise it much above the level of the husbandmans homely habits  we were looking in from the porch on this scene of rural peace and faultless neatness when an inner door opened in the deliberate manner that betokens age and the mistress of the cottageappeared she was a woman approaching seventy of middle size a quiet but firm step and an air of health her dress was of the fashion of the previous century plain but as neat as everything around hera spotless white apron seeming to bid defiance to the approach of anything that could soil its purity the countenance of this old woman certainly did not betoken any of the refinement which is the result of education and good company but it denoted benevolence a kind nature and feeling we were saluted without surprise and invited in to be seated  it isnt often that sloops anchor here said the old womanlady it would be a stretch of politeness to call hertheir favouryte places being higher up and lower down the river  and how do you account for that mother asked marble who seated himself and addressed the mistress of the cottage with a seamans frankness to my fancy this is the best anchorage i ve seen in many a day one altogether to be coveted one might be as much alone as he liked in a spot like this without absolutely turning your bloody hermit  the old woman gazed at marble like one who scarce know what to make of such an animal and yet her look was mild and indulgent  i account for the boatmens preferring other places to this she said by the circumstance that there is no tavern here while there is one two miles above and another two miles below us  your remark that there is no tavern here reminds me of the necessity of apologizing for coming so boldly to your door i answered but we sailors mean no impertinence though we are so often guilty of it in landing  you are heartily welcome i am glad to see them that understand how to treat an old woman kindly and know how to pity and pardon them that do not at my time of life we get to learn the value of fair words and good treatment for its only a short time it will be in our power to show either to our fellowcreatures  your favourable disposition to your fellows comes from living all your days in a spot as sweet as this  i would much rather think that it comes from god he alone is the source of all that is good within us  yet a spot like this must have its influence on a character i dare say you have lived long in this very house which old us you profess to be seems to be much older than yourself it has probably been your abode ever since your marriage  and long before sir i was born in this house as was my father before me you are right in saying that i have dwelt in it ever since my marriage for i dwelt in it long before  this is not very encouraging for my friend here who took such a fancy to your cottage as we came ashore as to wish to own it but i scarce think he will venture to purchase now he knows how dear it must be to you  and has your friend no homeno place in which to put his family  neither home nor family my good mother answered marble for himself and so much the greater reason you will think why i ought to begin to think of getting both as soon as possible i never had father or mother to my knowledge nor house nor home of any sort but a ship i forgot i was a hermit once and set myself up in that trade with a whole island to myself but i soon gave up all to natur and got out of that scrape as fast as i could the business didnt suit me  the old woman looked at marble intently i could see by her countenance that the offhand sincere earnest manner of the mate had taken some unusual hold of her feelings  hermit the good woman repeated with curiosity i have often heard and read of such people but you are not at all like them i have fancied to be hermits  another proof i undertook a business for which i was not fit i suppose a man before he sets up for a hermit ought to know something of his ancestors as one looks to the pedigree of a horse in order to find out whether he is fit for a racer now as i happen to know nothing of mine it is no wonder i fell into a mistake its an awkward thing old lady for a man to be born without a name  the eye of our hostess was still bright and full of animation and i never saw a keener look than she fastened on the mate as he delivered himself in this one of his usual fits of misanthropical feeling  and were you born without a name she asked after gazing intently at the other  sartain everybody is born with only one name but i happened to be born without any name at all  this is so extrornary sir added our old hostess more interested than i could have supposed possible for a stranger to become in marbles rough bitterness that i should like to hear how such a thing could be  i am quite ready to tell you all about it mother but as one good turn deserves another i shall ask you first to answer me a few questions about the ownership of this house and cove and orchard when you have told your story i am ready to tell mine  i see how it is said the old woman in alarm you are sent here by mr van tassel to inquire about the money due on the mortgage and to learn whether it is likely to be paid or not  we are not sent here at all my good old lady i now thought it time to interpose for the poor woman was very obviously much alarmed and in a distress that even her aged and wrinkled countenance could not entirely conceal we are just what you seepeople belonging to that sloop who have come ashore to stretch their legs and have never heard of any mr van tassel or any money or any mortgage  thank heaven for that exclaimed the old woman seeming to relieve her mind as well as body by a heavy sigh squire van tassel is a hard man and a widow woman with no relative at hand but a granddarter that is just sixteen is scarce able to meet him my poor old husband always maintained that the money had been paid but now he is dead and gone squire van tassel brings forth the bond and mortgage and says if you can prove that these are paid im willing to give them up  this is so strange an occurrence my dear old lady i observed that you have only to make us acquainted with the facts to get another supporter in addition to your granddaughter it is true i am a stranger and have come here purely by accident but providence sometimes appears to work in this mysterious manner and i have a strong presentiment we may be of use to you relate your difficulties then and you shall have the best legal advice in the state should your case require it  the old woman seemed embarrassed but at the same time she seemed touched we were utter strangers to her it is true yet there is a language in sympathy which goes beyond that of the tongue and which coming from the heart goes to the heart i was quite sincere in my offers and this sincerity appears to have produced its customary fruits i was believed and after wiping away a tear or two that forced themselves into her eyes our hostess answered me as frankly as i had offered my aid  you do not look like squire van tassels men for they seem to me to think the place is theirs already such craving covetous creaturs i never before laid eyes on i hope i may trust you  depend on us mother cried marble giving the old woman a cordial squeeze of the hand my heart is in this business for my mind was half made up at first sight to own this spot myselfby honest purchase youll understand me and not by any of your landshark tricksand such being the case you can easily think im not inclined to let this mr tassel have it  it would be almost as sorrowful a thing to sell this place the good woman answered her countenance confirming all she said in words as to have it torn from me by knaves i have told you that even my father was born in this very house i was his only child and when god called him away which he did about twelve years after my marriage the little farm came to me of course mine it would have been at this moment without let or hindrance of any sort but for a fault committed in early youth ah my friends it is hopeless to do evil and expect to escape the consequences  the evil you have done my good mother returned marble endeavouring to console the poor creature down whose cheeks the tears now fairly began to run the evil you have done my good mother can be no great matter if it was a question about a rough tar like myself or even of miles there whos a sort of seasaint something might be made of it i make no doubt but your account must be pretty much all credit and no debtor  that is a state that befalls none of earth my young friendmarble was young compared to his companion though a plump fiftymy sin was no less than to break one of gods commandments  i could see that my mate was a good deal confounded at this ingenuous admission for in his eyes breaking the commandments was either killing stealing or blaspheming the other sins of the decalogue he had come by habit to regard as peccadilloes  i think this must be a mistake mother he said in a sort of consoling tone you may have fallen into some oversights or mistakes but this breaking of the commandments is rather serious sort of work  yet i broke the fifth i forgot to honour my father and mother nevertheless the lord has been gracious for my days have already reached threescoreandten but this is his goodnessnot any merit of my own  is it not a proof that the error has been forgiven i ventured to remark if penitence can purchase peace i feel certain you have earned that relief  one never knows i think this calamity of the mortgage and the danger i run of dying without a roof to cover my head may be all traced up to that one act of disobedience i have been a mother myselfmay say i am a mother now for my granddaughter is as dear to me as was her blessed motherand it is when we look down rather than when we look up as it might be that we get to understand the true virtue of this commandment  if it were impertinent curiosity that instigates the question my old friend i added it would not be in my power to look you in the face as i do now while begging you to let me know your difficulties tell them in your own manner but tell them with confidence for i repeat we have the power to assist you and can command the best legal advice of the country  again the old woman looked at me intently through her spectacles then as if her mind was made up to confide in our honesty she disburthened it of its secrets  it would be wrong to tell you a part of my story without telling you all she began for you might think van tassel and his set are alone to blame while my conscience tells me that little has happened that is not a just punishment for my great sin youll have patience therefore with an old woman and hear her whole tale for mine is not a time of life to mislead any the days of whiteheads are numbered and was it not for kitty the blow would not be quite so hard on me you must know we are dutch by origincome of the ancient hollanders of the colonyand were van duzers by name its like friends added the good woman hesitating that you are yankees by birth  i cannot say i am i answered though of english extraction my family is long of new york but it does not mount back quite as far as the time of the hollanders  and your friend he is silent perhaps he is of new england i would not wish to hurt his feelings for my story will bear a little hard perhaps on his love of home  never mind me mother but rowse it all up like entered cargo said marble in his usual bitter way when alluding to his own birth theres not the man breathing that one can speak more freely before on such matters than moses marble  marblethats a hard name returned the woman slightly smiling but a name is not a heart my parents were dutch and you may have heard how it was before the revolution between the dutch and the yankees near neighbours they did not love each other the yankees said the dutch were fools and the dutch said the yankees were knaves now as you may easily suppose i was born before the revolution when king george ii was on the throne and ruled the country and though it was long after the english got to be our masters it was before our people had forgotten their language and their traditions my father himself was born after the english governors came among us as ive heard him say but it mattered nothe loved holland to the last and the customs of his fathers  all quite right mother said marble a little impatiently but what of all that its as natral for a dutchman to love holland as it is for an englishman to love hollands ive been in the low countries and must say its a muskrat sort of a life the people lead neither afloat nor ashore  the old woman regarded marble with more respect after this declaration for in that day a travelled man was highly esteemed among us in her eyes it was a greater exploit to have seen amsterdam than it would now be to visit jerusalem indeed it is getting rather discreditable to a man of the world not to have seen the pyramids the red sea and the jordan  my father loved it not the less though he never saw the land of his ancestors resumed the old woman notwithstanding the jealousy of the yankees among us dutch and the mutual dislike many of the former came among us to seek their fortunes they are not a homestaying people it would seem and i cannot deny that cases have happened in which they have been known to get away the farms of some of the netherlands stock in a way that it would have been better not to have happened  you speak considerately my dear woman i remarked and like one that has charity for all human failing  i ought to do so for my own sins and i ought to do so to them of new england for my own husband was of that race  ay now the story is coming round regularly miles said marble nodding his head in approbation it will touch on love next and if trouble do not follow set me down as an illnatred old bachelor love in a mans heart is like getting heated cotton or shifting ballast into a ships hold  i must confess to it continued our hostess smiling in spite of her real sorrowssorrows that were revived by thus recalling the events of her early lifea young man of yankee birth came among us as a schoolmaster when i was only fifteen our people were anxious enough to have us all taught to read english for many had found the disadvantage of being ignorant of the language of their rulers and of the laws i was sent to george wetmores school like most of the other young people of the neighbourhood and remained his scholar for three years if you were on the hill above the orchard yonder you might see the schoolhouse at this moment for it is only a short walk from our place and a walk that i made four times a day for just three years  one can see how the land lies now cried marble lighting a segar for he thought no apology necessary for smoking under a dutch roof the master taught his scholar something more than he found in the spellingbook or the catechism well take your word about the schoolhouse seeing it is out of view  it was out of sight truly and that may have been the reason my parents took it so hard when george wetmore asked their leave to marry me this was not done until he had walked home with me or as near home as the brow on yon hill for a whole twelvemonth and had served a servitude almost as long and as patient as that of jacob for rachel  well mother how did the old people receive the question like goodnatured parents i hope for georges sake  rather say like the children of holland judging of the children of new england they would not hear of it but wished me to marry my own cousin petrus storm who was not greatly beloved even in his own family  of course you down anchor and said you never would quit the moorings of home  if i rightly understand you sir i did something very different i got privately married to george and he kept school near a twelvemonth longer up behind the hill though most of the young women were taken away from his teaching  ay the old way the door was locked after the horse was stolen well you were married mother  after a time it was necessary for me to visit a kinswoman who lived a little down the river there my first child was born unknown to my parents and george gave it in charge to a poor woman who had lost her own babe for we were still afraid to let our secret be known to my parents now commenced the punishment for breaking the fifth commandment  hows that miles demanded moses is it agin the commandments for a married woman to have a son  certainly not my friend though it is a breach of the commandments not to honour our parents this good woman alludes to her marrying contrary to the wishes of her father and mother  indeed i do sir and dearly have i been punished for it in a few weeks i returned home and was followed by the sad news of the death of my firstborn the grief of these tidings drew the secret from me and nature spoke so loud in the hearts of my poor parents that they forgave all took george home and ever afterwards treated him as if he also had been their own child but it was too late had it happened a few weeks earlier my own precious babe might have been saved to me  you cannot know that mother we all die when our time comes  his time had not come the miserable wretch to whom george trusted the boy exposed him among strangers to save herself trouble and to obtain twenty dollars at as cheap a rate as possible  hold i interrupted in the name of heaven my good woman in what year did this occur  marble looked at me in astonishment though he clearly had glimpses of the object of my question  it was in the month of june 17 for thirty long long years i supposed my child had actually died and then the mere force of conscience told me the truth the wretched woman could not carry the secret with her into the grave and she sent for me to hear the sad revelation  which was to say that she left the child in a basket on a tombstone in a marbleworkers yard in town in the yard of a man whose name was durfee i said as rapidly as i could speak  she did indeed though it is a marvel to me that a stranger should know this what will be gods pleasure next  marble groaned he hid his face in his hands while the poor woman looked from one of us to the other in bewildered expectation of what was to follow i could not leave her long in doubt but preparing her for what was to follow by little and little i gave her to understand that the man she saw before her was her son after half a century of separation the mother and child had thus been thrown together by the agency of an inscrutable providence the reader will readily anticipate the character of the explanations that succeeded of the truth of the circumstances there could not be a shadow of doubt when everything was related and compared mrs wetmore had ascertained from her unfaithful nurse the history of her child as far as the almshouse but thirty years had left a gap in the information she received and it was impossible for her to obtain the name under which he had left that institution the revolution was just over when she made her application and it was thought that some of the books had been taken away by a refugee still there were a plenty of persons to supply traditions and conjecture and so anxious were she and her husband to trace these groundless reports to their confirmation or refutation that much money and time were thrown away in the fruitless attempts at length one of the old attendants of the childrens department was discovered who professed to know the whole history of the child brought from the stonecutters yard this woman doubtless was honest but her memory had deceived her she said that the boy had been called stone instead of marble a mistake that was natural enough in itself but which was probably owing to the fact that another child of the first name had really left the institution a few months before moses took his leave this aaron stone had been traced first as an apprentice to a tradesman thence into a regiment of foot in the british army which regiment had accompanied the rest of the forces at the evacuation november 25th 1783  the wetmores fancied they were now on the track of their child he was traced down to a period within a twelvemonth of that of the search and was probably to be found in england still wearing the livery of the king after a long consultation between the disconsolate parents it was determined that george wetmore should sail for england in the hope of recovering their son but by this time money was scarce these worthy people were enabled to live in comfort on their little farm but they were not rich in cash all the loose coin was gone in the previous search and even a small debt had been contracted to enable them to proceed as far as they had no alternative remained but to mortgage their home this was done with great reluctance but what will not a parent do for his child a country lawyer of the name of van tassel was ready enough to advance five hundred on a place that was worth quite three thousand dollars this man was one of the odious class of country usurers a set of cormorants that is so much worse than their town counterparts because their victims are usually objects of real and not speculative distress and as ignorant and unpractised as they are necessitous it is wonderful with what farsighted patience one of these wretches will bide his time in order to effect a favourite acquisition mrs wetmores little farm was very desirable to this squire van tassel for reasons in addition to its intrinsic value and for years nothing could be kinder and more neighbourly than his indulgence interest was allowed to accumulate until the whole debt amounted to the sum of a thousand dollars in the mean time the father went to england found the soldier after much trouble and expense ascertained that stone knew his parents one of whom had died in the almshouse and spent all his money  years of debt and anxiety succeeded until the father sunk under his misfortunes an only daughter also died leaving kitty a legacy to her widowed mother the other parent having died even before her birth thus was katharine van duzer our old hostess left to struggle on nearly alone at the decline of life with a poverty that was daily increasing years and this infant granddaughter just before his death however george wetmore had succeeded in selling a portion of his farm that which was least valuable to himself and with the money he paid off van tassels mortgage this was his own account of the matter and he showed to his wife van tassels receipt the money having been paid at the county town where the bond and mortgage could not be then produced this was shortly before wetmores last illness a twelvemonth after his death the widow was advised to demand the bond and to take the mortgage off record but the receipt was not to be found with a womans ignorance of such matters the widow let this fact leak out and her subsequent demand for the release was met with a counter one for evidence of payment this was the commencement of van tassels hostile attitude and things had gone as far as a foreclosure and an advertisement for a sale when the good woman thus opportunely discovered her son    chapter iii                    i charge you by the law   whereof you are a welldeserving pillar   proceed to judgment by my soul i swear   there is no power in the tongue of man   to alter me i stay here on my bond    shylock   it is not easy to describe the immediate effect of this discovery on either of the parties most concerned not a doubt remained on the mind of either after the facts were explained of the reality of the relationship for that was so simply proved as to place the circumstance beyond all dispute mrs wetmore thought of her lost son as of an innocent smiling babe and here she found him a redfaced hardfeatured weatherbeaten tar already verging towards age and a man of manners that were rough if not rude she could not at first possess any knowledge of the better points in his character and was compelled to receive this boon from providence as it was offered nevertheless a mothers love is not easily dissatisfied or smothered and ere i left the house i could see the old womans eyes fixed on marble with an expression of interest and tenderness they had not manifested previously to the revelations  as for the mate himself now that the fondest wish of his life was so unexpectedly gratified he was taken so much by surprise that he appeared to think something was wanting he found his mother the reputable widow of a reputable man of a class in life quite equal to his own living on a property that was small certainly and involved but property that had been long in her family the truth was marble felt so much at this unlookedfor appeal to his gentler feelings that one of his stern nature did not know how to answer it on the emergency and the obstinacy of his temperament rather induced him to resist than to yield to such unwonted sentiments i could see he was satisfied with his mother while he was scarcely satisfied with himself and with a view to place both parties in truer positions i desired moses to walk down and look at the boat while i remained alone with his newfound parent this was not done however until all the explanations had been made and the mother had both blessed and wept over her child it was done indeed principally to relieve marble from the oppression of feeling created by this very scene  as soon as alone with mrs wetmore i explained to her my own connection with marble and gave her a sort of apologetic account of his life and character keeping down the weak points and dwelling on the strong i set her mind at ease at once on the subject of the farm for should the worst happen her son had double the amount of money that would be necessary to discharge the mortgage  the debt was incurred my dear mrs wetmore in his behalf and he will be happy to discharge it on the spot i would advise you to pay the money at once should the receipt ever be found this van tassel will be obliged to refund for though the law winks at many wrongs it will not wink at one so atrocious as this provided you can satisfy it with proof i shall leave moses  his name is oloff or oliver interrupted the old woman easerly i named him after my own father and had him duly christened before he was entrusted to the nurse in the hope it might soften his grandfathers heart when he came to know of my marriage oloff van duzer wetmore is his real name  i smiled to think of marbles sailing under such an appellation and was about to suggest a compromise when the subject of our discourse returned the mate had regained his composure during the halfhour he had been absent and i saw by the kind glance he threw on his mother whose look answered his own more naturally than i could have hoped that things were getting right and by way of removing the awkwardness of excessive sensibility i pursued the discourse  we were talking of your true name moses as you came in i said it will never do for you to hail by one name while your mother hails by another youll have to cut adrift from moses marble altogether  if i do may i be  hush hushyou forget where you are and in whose presence you stand  i hope my son will soon learn that he is always in the presence of his god observed the mother plaintively  ay aythats all right mother and you shall do with me just what you please in any of them matters but as for not being moses marble you might as well ask me not to be myself i should be another man to change my name a fellow might as well go without clothes as go without a name and mine came so hard i dont like to part with it no nohad it come to pass now that my parents had been a king and a queen and that i was to succeed em on the throne i should reign as king moses marble or not reign at all  youll think better of this and take out a new register under your lawful designation  ill tell you what ill do mother and that will satisfy all parties ill bend on the old name to the new one and sail under both  i care not how you are called my son so long as no one has need to blush for the name you bear this gentleman tells me you are an honest and truehearted man and those are blessings for which i shall never cease to thank god  miles has been singing my praises has he i can tell you mother you had need look out for miless tongue natur intended him for a lawyer and its mere accident his being a sailor though a capital one he is but what may be my name according to law  oloff van duser wetmore moses marble according to your own expedient of sailing under all your titles you can ring the changes however and call yourself moses oloff marble van duser wetmore if you like that better  moses laughed and as i saw that both he and his newfound mother were in a fit state to be left together and that the sun now wanted but an hour or two of setting i rose to take my leave  you will remain with your mother tonight marble i observed i will keep the sloop at an anchor until i can see you in the morning when we will settle the future a little more deliberately  i should not like to lose my son so soon after finding him the old woman anxiously remarked  no fear of me motheri berth under your roof tonight and so many more in the bargain that youll be glad enough to be rid of me in the end  i then left the house followed by marble towards the boat as we reached the little piece of bottomland i heard a sort of suppressed sob from the mate and turning round was surprised to see the tears running down his sunburned cheeks his wroughtup feelings had at last obtained the mastery and this rude but honest creature had fairly given in under the excitement of this strange admixture of joy wonder shame and natural emotion i took his hand gave it a hearty squeeze but said nothing though i stopped unwilling to go nearer to neb until my companion had regained his composure this he did sufficiently to speak in the course of a minute or two  its all like a dreamto me miles moses at length mutteredmore out of natur like than setting up for a hermit  youll soon get accustomed to the change marble then everything will seem in the ordinary way and natural  to think of my being a son and having a real living mother  you must have known that you had parents once though you are fortunate in finding one of them alive at your time of life  and she an honest woman a mother the president of the united states or the first commodore in the navy neednt be ashamed of  all that is fortunate certainly especially the first  shes a bloody goodlooking old woman in the bargain ill have her dressed up and carry her down to town the first opportunity  what would you give an old woman that trouble for youll think better of these matters in the long run  better yes ill take her to philadelphia and perhaps to baltimore theres the gardens and the theatres and the museums and lots of things that i dare say the dear old soul never laid eyes on  im mistaken in your mother if she would not prefer a church to all of them put together  well theres churches in all of them towns put it on a religious footing if you will and i ought to take my mother as soon as possible down to york shes old you see and cannot live for ever just to oblige me and here has she been tied down to one church all her days giving her no chice nor opportunity i dare say now variety is just as agreeable in religion as in anything else  you are nearer right there moses than you think yourself possibly but we can talk of all these things tomorrow a good nights rest will give us cooler heads in the morning  i shall not sleep a wink for thinking of it no noill make the old lady pack up before breakfast and well sail in the sloop ill take her aboard the dawn with me in town and a comfortable time well have of it in her cabins she has as good staterooms as a yacht  there were no liners in those days but a ship with two cabins was a miracle of convenience  your mother will hardly suit a ship moses and a ship will hardly suit your mother  how can any of us know that till we try if im a chip of the old block theyll take to each other like rum and water if im to go out in the ship im far from certain ill not take the old woman to sea with me  youll probably remain at home now that you have a home and a mother and other duties to attend to i and my concerns will be but secondary objects with you hereafter mr wetmore  wetmore be dd dye mean miles that im to give up my calling give up the sea give up you  you wished to be a hermit once and found it a little too solitary had you a companion or two you would have been satisfied you said well here is everything you can wish a mother a niece a house a farm barns outhouses garden and orchard and seated on that porch you can smoke segars take your grog look at the craft going up and down the hudson  nothing but so many bloody sloops growled the mate such inandin foreandafters that their booms wont stay guyedout even after youve been at the pains to use a hawser  well a sloop is a pleasant object to a sailor when he can set nothing better then there is this mr van tassel to settle withyou may have a ten years lawsuit on your hands to amuse you  ill make short work with that scamp when i fall in with him youre right enough miles that affair must be settled before i can lift an anchor my mother tells me he lives hard by and can be seen at any moment in a quarter of an hour ill pay him a visit this very night  this declaration caused me to pause i knew marble too well not to foresee trouble if he were left to himself in a matter of this nature and thought it might be well to inquire further into the affair sailors do everything offhand mrs wetmore telling me that her sons statement was true on my going back to the house to question her in the matter and offering us the use of an oldfashioned onehorse chaise that the only farmlabourer she employed was just then getting ready to go in in quest of kitty i availed myself of the opportunity took the printed advertisement of the sale to read as we went along obtained our directions and off marble and i went in quest of the usurer  there would be sufficient time for all our purposes it is true that the horse like the house its owner the labourer the chaise and all we had yet seen about willow cove as we had learned the place was called was old but he was the more safe and sure the road led up the ascent by a ravine through which it wound its way very prettily the labourer walking by our side to point out the route after we should reach the elevation of the country that stretched inland  the view from the height as it might be termed in reference to the river though it was merely on the level of the whole region in that portion of the state was both extensive and pretty willow grove as marble called his mothers place three or four times while our horse was working his way up the ascent looked more invitingly than ever with its verdant declivities rich orchards neat cottage all ensconced behind the sheltering cover of the river heights inland we saw a hundred farms groves without number divers roads a hamlet within a mile of us an oldfashioned extinguisherlooking churchspire and various houses of wood painted white with here and there a piece of rustic antiquity in bricks or stone washed with lime or some livelier paint for the dutch of new york had brought the habits of holland with them delighting in colours this relief may be desirable in a part of the world where the eternal green of the meadows in a manner fatigues the eye but certainly the grey of nature has no just competitor in the tints of the more artificial portions of the ordinary landscape white may make a scene look gay but it can never lend it dignity or the solemn hues that so often render the loveliness of a view impressive as well as sweet when this glaring colour reaches the fences it gives the prettiest landscape the air of a bleachingyard or of a great laundry with the clothes hung out to dry  the guide pointed out to us the house of van tassel and another at which we should find kitty who was to be brought home by us on our return understanding the course and distance we put to sea without any misgivings the horse was no flyer and marble and i had plenty of leisure to arrange preliminaries before reaching the door to which we were bound after some consultation and a good of discussion i succeeded in persuading my companion it would not be wisest to break ground by flogging the attorneya procedure to which he was strongly inclined it was settled however he was at once to declare himself to be mrs wetmores son and to demand his explanations in that character one that would clearly give him every claim to be heard  i know what these usurers as you call em miles must be said the mate they are a sort of inshore pawnbrokers and the lord have mercy on them for ill have none ive had occasion to pawn a watch or a quadrant in my time and bloody poor prices does a fellow get for his goods and chattels yes yes ill let the old gentleman know at once im van duzer oloff marble wetmore moses or whatevers my name and will stand up for the right in a fashion that will surprise him but what are you to do in the mean time  it struck me if i could get marble to attempt practising a sort of ruse it would have the effect to prevent his resorting to clublaw towards which i knew he had a strong natural disposition and of which i was still a little afraid with this object then i conceived the following scheme  you shall simply introduce me as mr miles wallingford i said but in a formal manner that may induce this mr van tassel toimagine im a sort of lawyer and this may have the effect to awe him and bring him to terms the easier do not say i am a lawyer for that will not be true and it will also be awkward falling back when the truth comes to be known  marble took the idea and seemed pleased with it though he affirmed that there could be no such thing as acting lawyer without lying a little and that the truth was too good for one of your bloody usurers i got him trained however by the time we reached the door and we alighted as well prepared for our task as could be expected  there was nothing about the residence of squire van tassel to denote the grasping moneydealer unless a certain negligence of the exterior might be supposed to betray the abode of such a man his friends wished to ascribe this to an indifference to appearances but the multitude more accurately imputed it to parsimony when the very soul gets to be absorbed in the process of rolling gold over and over in order to make it accumulate the spirit grudges the withdrawal of the smallest fraction from the gainful pursuit and here lies the secret of the disdain of appearances that is so generally to be met with in this description of persons beyond this air of negligence however the dwelling of van tassel was not to be distinguished from those of most of the better houses of that part of the country our application for admission was favourably received and in a minute we were shown into the attorneys office  squire van tassel as this man was universally termed eyed us keenly as we entered no doubt with a view to ascertain if we were borrowers i might possibly have passed for one of that character for i aimed at looking serious and thoughtful but i would defy any man to mistake moses for one who came on such an errand he looked more like a messenger sent by the father of sin to demand the payment of a certain bond that had been signed in blood and of which the fatal payday had at length arrived i had to give the skirt of his coat a pull in order to recall him to our agreement else i do think the first salutation received by the attorney would have been a broadside in anything but words the hint succeeded and marble permitted our host to open the communications  squire van tassel had a very miserly exterior he even looked ill fed though doubtless this appearance was more a consequence of habit of body than of shortfeeding he wore spectacles with black rims and had the common practice of looking over them at objects at a distance which gave him an air still more watchful than that which he imbibed from character his stature was small and his years about sixty an age when the accumulation of money begins to bring as much pain as pleasure for it is a period of life when men cannot fail to see the termination of their earthly schemes of all the passions however avarice is notoriously that which the latest loosens its hold on the human heart  your servant gentlemen commenced the attorney in a manner that was civil enough your servant i beg you to help yourselves to chairs we all three took seats at this invitation a pleasant evening eyeing us still more keenly over his glasses and weather that is good for the crops if the wars continue much longer in europe another look over the glasses we shall sell all the substance out of our lands in order to send the belligerents wheat i begin to look on real estate security as considerably less valuable than it was when hostilities commenced in 1793 and as daily growing less and less so  ay you may say that marble bluntly answered particularly the farms of widows and orphans  the squire was a little startled at this unexpected reply he looked intently at each of us again over the spectacles and then asked in a manner divided between courtesy and authority  may i inquire your names and the object of this visit  sartain said marble thats reasonable and your right we are not ashamed of our names nor of our errand as for the last mr van tassell youll know it sooner than you will wish to know it but to begin at the right end this gentleman with me is mr miles wallingford a particlar friend of old mrs wetmore who lives a bit down the road yonder at a farm called willow grove squire wallingford sir is her friend and my friend and ive great pleasure in making you acquainted with him  i am happy to see the gentleman answered van tassel taking another look while at the same time he glanced his eye at an alphabetical list of the attorneys and counsellors to see what place i occupied among them very happy to see the gentleman who has quite lately commenced practice i should think by his age and my not remembering the name  there must be a beginning to all things mr van tassel i replied with a calmness that i could see the old usurer did not like  very true sir and i hope your future success will be in proportion to the lateness of your appearance at the bar your companion has much more the air of a sailor than of a lawyerthis was true enough there being no mistaking marbles character though i had put on a bodycoat to come ashore ini presume he is not in the practice  that remains to be seen sir answered marble having told you my friends name mr van tassel i will now tell you my own i am called moses marble wetmore van duser oloff sir or some such bloody thing and youre welcome to take your pick out of the whole list ill answer to either of them aliases  this is so extraordinary and unusual gentlemen i scarce know what to make of it has this visit any connection with mrs wetmore or her farm or the mortgage i have been foreclosing on the last  it has sir and i am that mrs wetmores sonyes sir the only child of that dear good old soul  the son of mrs wetmore exclaimed van tassel both surprised and uneasy i knew there was a son but i have been always told it was impossible to find him i see no resemblance sir in you to either george wetmore or kitty van duser  now this was not altogether true as for george wetmore they who had known him in middle age afterwards declared that moses did resemble him greatly while i myself could trace in the mouth and milder expression of the mates features a strong likeness to the subdued character of his aged mothers face this resemblance would not have been observed in all probability without a knowledge of the affinity that existed between the parties but with that knowledge it was not easy to overlook  resemblance repeated marble much in the tone of one who is ready to quarrel on the slightest provocation how should there be any resemblance after the life ive led in the first place i was carried out of my mothers sight in less than ten days after i was born then i was placed on a tombstone by way of encouragement after which they sent me to live among paupers i ran away at ten years old and went to sea where ive played the part of manofwarsman privateersman smuggler mate master and all hands everything in short but a pirate and mutineer ive been a bloody hermit mr van tassel and if that wont take the resemblance to anything human out of a fellow his face is as unchangeable as that on a gold coin  all this mr wallingford is so unintelligible to me that i shall have to ask you to explain it  i can only add to it sir my belief that every word you hear is true i am satisfied that this is in a legal sense oloff van duser wetmore the only surviving child of george wetmore and catharine van duser he has come to see you in relation to a claim you are said to hold against the farm his mother inherited from her parents  said to holdi certainly do hold george wetmores bond secured by a mortgage signed by his wife balance due including interest and costs 96342 and i am proceeding to sell under the statute one sale has been postponed to oblige the widow for a merciful man would not wish to press a single and aged woman though ive lain out of my money a very long time you are aware sir that i lose all my interest on interest and must take up with just what the law will give hardship enough in active times like these when not a day passes that something good does not offer in the way of purchasing the best of securities at liberal discounts trade is so lively now mr wallingford that men will almost sell their souls for money  i rather think sir that some men will do this at all times nay do it hourly daily but i am instructedi could not help acting the counsel a little on the occasioni am instructed that the bond of george wetmore is paid in full  how can that be sir while i still hold bond and mortgage as a business man you must understand the value to be attached to the idle tales of women and can see the danger of taking their gossip for authority george wetmore had some knowledge of business and would not be likely to pay his bond without taking it up or at least of obtaining a receipt much less leave the mortgage on record  i am informed he did take your receipt though he presumes he must have lost it with a missing pocketbook which his widow supposes to have been dropped from his coat the very day he returned from the court where he met you and where he says he paid you the money being anxious to stop interest as soon as possible  a very idle story and one you do not suppose the chancellor will believe confirmed by the hearsay of the party interested in preserving the property you are aware sir that the sale can be stopped only by an injunction from the court of chancery  now i was certainly no lawyer but like almost every american i knew something of that branch of the jurisprudence of the country which touched my own interests as a landholder i had a little knowledge of the law of real estate and was not absolutely ignorant of the manner in which matters were managed in that most searching of all tribunals the court of chancery a lucky thought suggested itself to my mind on the instant and i made use of it on the spur of the moment  it is quite true sir i answered that any prudent judge might hesitate about entering a decree on authority no better than the oath of mrs wetmore that she had heard her husband say he had paid the money but you will remember that the party replying has to swear to his answer all of us might be better satisfied in this affair were you to make oath that the money was never paid  this hit told and from that moment i did not entertain a doubt that wetmore had paid the money and that van tassel retained a perfect recollection of the whole affair this much i could read in the mans altered countenance and averted eye though my impressions certainly were not proof if not proof however for a court of justice they served to enlist me earnestly in the pursuit of the affair into which i entered warmly from that moment in the meantime i waited for van tassels answer watching his countenance the whole time with a vigilance that i could easily see caused him great embarrassment  kitty wetmore and i were born neighbours children he said and this mortgage has given me more trouble than all the rest of my little possessions that i have been in no hurry to foreclose is plain by the length of time ive suffered to go by without claiming my dues i could wait no longer without endangering my rights as there would be a presumption of payment after twenty years and a presumption that would tell harder against me than old kittys oath we are neighbours children as ive said nevertheless and rather than push matters to extremities i will consent to some sort of a compromise  and what sort of a compromise will be agreeable to your notions of justice mr van tassel  why sir as kitty is old it would be a sad thing to drive her from the roof under which she was born this ive said and thought from the first and say now still i cannot part with my property without a compensation though im willing to wait i told mrs wetmore before advertising that if she would give a new bond making all clear and giving me interest on the whole sum now due i should be willing to grant her time i now propose however as the simplest way of settling the affair to accept from her a release of the equity of redemption and to grant her a lease for her own life on a nominal rent  even marble knew enough to see the rank injustice of such an offer in addition to conceding the nonpayment of the debt it was securing to van tassel at no distant day the quiet possession of the farm for somewhat less than onethird its value i detected symptoms of an outbreak in the mate and was obliged to repress it by a sign while i kept the discussion in my own hands  under such an arrangement sir i answered my friend here would be literally selling his birthright for a mess of porridge  you will remember mr wallingford that a mortgage sale legally made is a ticklish thing and the courts do not like to disturb one this sale will take place this day week and the title once passed it will not be so easy a matter to get it repassed mr wetmore here does not look like a man ready to pay down a thousand dollars  we shall not run the risk of letting the title pass i will buy the property myself if necessary and should it afterwards appear that the money has been actually paid we believe you are sufficiently secure for principal interest and costs  you are young in the profession mr wallingford and will come to learn the folly of advancing money for your clients  i am not in the profession at all sir as you have erroneously supposed but am a shipmaster and mr wetmore or marble as he has hitherto been called is my mate still we are none the worse provided with the means of paying a thousand dollarsor twenty of them should it be necessary  no lawyer cried van tassel smiling grimly a couple of sailors about to dispute the foreclosure of a mortgage famous justice we should get at your hands gentlemen well well i now see how it is and that this has only been an attempt to work on my sympathies for an old woman who has been living on my money these twenty years i rather think your 96342 will prove to be of the same quality as your law  and yet it struck me mr van tassel that you rather disliked the idea of swearing to the truth of an answer to a certain bill in chancery which if i cannot draw one abraham van vechten of albany can  abraham van vechten is skilful counsel and an honest man and is riot likely to be employed in a cause that rests only on an old womans hearsaysand all to save her own farm  marble could keep silence no longer he told me afterwards that during the dialogue he had been taking the measure of the old usurers foot and felt it would be a disgrace to strike so feeble a creature but to sit and hear his newlyfound mother sneered at and her just rights derided was more than his patience could endure rising abruptly therefore he broke out at once in one of the plainest philippics of the sea i shall not repeat all he said for to render it justly might be to render it offensive but in addition to calling old van tassel by a great many names that were as unusual as they were quaint he called him by several that would be familiar to the ears of most of my readers besides being perfectly well merited i allowed his humour to find vent and giving the attorney to understand he should hear further from us i succeeded in getting my companion to the wagon without coming to blows i could see that van tassel was very far from being at his ease and that he would still gladly keep us if he could in the hope of bringing about some sort of a compromise if possible but i thought it wisest to let matters rest awhile after the decided demonstration we had already made  it was not an easy matter to get marble into the vehicle but this was no sooner effected than i trotted him off down the road taking the direction of the house where we had been told to seek kitty huguenin old mrs wetmores granddaughter who would be waiting the appearance of the chaise in order to return home  you must put on a more amicable look said i to the mate as we went on our way or youll frighten your niece with whom you will remember you are about to make an acquaintance  the cheating vagabond to take advantage of a poor lonely old woman whose only husband was in the grave and only son at sea the mate continued to mutter talk about the commandments i should like to know what commandment this was breaking the whole six in a batch  the tenth i am inclined to think my friend and that is a commandment broken all day and every day  the denunciations of the mate continued for some time longer and then went off like the rumbling of distant thunder in the heavens after the passage of the gust    chapter iv      no moorish maid might hope to vie   with lailas cheek or lailas eye   no maiden loved with purer truth   or ever loved a lovelier youth    southey   miles said moses suddenly after riding a short distance in silence i must quit the old lady this very night and go down with you to town we must have that money up at the place of sale in readiness for the vagabond for as to letting him have the smallest chance at willow grove that is out of the question  as you please marble but now get yourself in trim to meet another relation the second you have laid eyes on in this world  think of that miles think of my having two relations a mother and a niece well it is a true saying that it never rains but it pours  you probably have many more uncles aunts and cousins in scores the dutch are famous for counting cousins and no doubt youll have calls on you from half the county  i saw that marble was perplexed and did not know at first but he was getting to be embarrassed by this affluence of kindred the mate however was not the man long to conceal his thoughts from me and in the strength of his feelings he soon let his trouble be known  i say miles he rejoined a fellow may be bothered with felicity i find now here in ten minutes perhaps i shall have to meet my sisters dartermy own born blood niece a fullgrown and i dare say a comely young woman and hang me if i know exactly what a man ought to say in such a state of the facts generalizing wont do with these near relations and i suppose a sisters darter is pretty much the same to a chap as his own darter would be provided he had one  exactly had you reasoned a month you could not have hit upon a better solution of the difficulty than this treat this kitty huguenin just as you would treat kitty marble  ay ay all this is easy enough aforehand and to such scholars as you but it comes hard on a fellow like myself to heave his idees out of him as it might be with a windlass i managed the old woman right well and could get along with a dozen mothers better than with one sisters darter suppose she should turn out a girl with black eyes and red cheeks and all that sort of thing i dare say she would expect me to kiss her  certainly she will expect that should her eyes even be white and her cheeks black natural affection expects this much even among the least enlightened of the human race  i am disposed to do everything according to usage returned marble quite innocently and more discomposed by the situation in which he so unexpectedly found himself than he might have been willing to own while at the same time i do not wish to do anything that is not expected from a son and an uncle if these relations had only come one at a time  poh poh mosesdo not be quarrelling with your good luck just as its at its height here is the house and ill engage one of those four girls is your niecethat with the bonnet for a dollar she being ready to go home and the whole having come to the door in consequence of seeing the chaise driving down the road they are puzzled at finding us in it however instead of the usual driver  marble hemmed attempted to clear his throat pulled down both sleeves of his jacket settled his black handkerchief to his mind slily got rid of his quid and otherwise cleared ship for action as he would have been very apt to describe his own preparations after all his heart failed him at the pinch and just as i was pulling up the horse he said to me in a voice so small and delicate that it sounded odd to one who had heard the mans thunder as he hailed yards and tops in gales of wind  miles my dear boy i do not half like this business suppose you get out and open the matter to the ladies theres four of them you see and thats three too many go now miles thats a good fellow and ill do the same for you another time i cant have four nieces here youll own yourself  and while i am telling your story to your niece your own sisters daughter what will you be doing here pray  doingwhy anything my dear miles that can be usefuli say boy do you think she looks anything like me when you get nearer if you should think so just hold up a hand as a signal that i may not be taken by surprise yes yes you go first and ill follow and as for doing why you know i can hold this bloody horse  i laughed threw the reins to marble who seized them with both hands as if the beast required holding while i alighted and walked to the cluster of girls who awaited my movements in surprise and silence since that day i have seen more of the world than might have been expected in one of my early career and often have i had occasion to remark the tendency there exists to extremes in most things in manners as well as in every other matter connected with human feelings as we become sophisticated acting takes the place of nature and men and women often affect the greatest indifference in cases in which they feel the liveliest interest this is the source of the ultra sang froid of what is termed high breeding which would have caused the four young women who then stood in the dooryard of the respectable farmhouse at which i had alighted to assume an air as cold and as marblelike at the sudden appearance of mrs wetmores chaise containing two strange faces as if they had been long expecting our arrival and were a little displeased it had not occurred an hour sooner such however was not my reception though the four girls were all youthful blooming pretty delicate in appearance according to the fashion of american women and tolerably well attired they had none of the calm exterior of conventional manner one would speak quick to another looks of surprise were often exchanged there were not a few downright giggles and then each put on as dignified an air to meet the stranger as under the circumstances she could assume  i presume miss kitty huguenin is among you young ladies i commenced bowing as civilly as was necessary for this appears to be the house to which we were directed  a girl of about sixteen of decidedly pleasing appearance and one who bore a sufficient resemblance to old mrs wetmore to be recognised advanced a step out of the group a little eagerly and then as suddenly checked herself with the timidity of her years and sex as if afraid of going too far  i am kitty she said changing colour once or twice now flushing and now growing paleis any thing the matter sirhas grandmother sent for me  nothing is the matter unless you can call good news something the matter we have just left your grandmothers on business having been up to squire van tassels on her affairs rather than let us go on foot she lent us her chaise on condition that we should stop on our return and bring you home with us the chaise is the evidence that we act under orders  in most countries such a proposition would have excited distrust in america and in that day more especially among girls of the class of kitty huguenin it produced none then i flatter myself i was not a very frightful object to a girl of that age and that my countenance was not of such a cast as absolutely to alarm her kitty accordingly wished her companions hasty adieus and in a minute she was placed between marble and myself the old vehicle being sufficiently spacious to accommodate three i made my bows and away we trotted or ambled would be a better word for a brief space there was silence in the chaise though i could detect marble stealing sidelong glances at his pretty little niece his eyes were moist and he hemmed violently once and actually blew his nose taking occasion at the same time to pass his handkerchief over his forehead no less than three times in as many minutes the furtive manner in which he indulged in these feelings provoked me to say  you appear to have a bad cold this evening mr wetmore for i thought the opportunity might also be improved in the way of breaking ground with our secret  ay you know how it is in these matters milessomehow i scarce know why myself but somehow i feel bloody womanish this evening  i felt little kitty pressing closer to my side as if she had certain misgivings touching her other neighbour  i suppose you are surprised miss kitty i resumed at finding two strangers in your grandmothers chaise  i did not expect itbutyou said you had been to mr van tassels and that there was good news for medoes squire van tassel allow that grandfather paid him the money  not that exactly but you have friends who will see that no wrong shall be done you i suppose you have been afraid your grandmother and yourself might be turned away from the old place  squire van tassels daughters have boasted as muchanswered kitty in a very subdued tonea voice indeed that grew lower and more tremulous as she proceededbut i dont much mind them for they think their father is to own the whole country one of these days this was uttered with spirit but the old house was built by grandmothers grandfather they say and grandmother was born in it and mother was born in it and so was i it is hard to leave a place like that sir and for a debt too that grandmother says she is sure has once been paid  ay bloody hard growled marble  kitty again pressed nearer to me or to speak more properly farther from the mate whose countenance was particularity grim just at that moment  all that you say is very true kitty i replied but providence has sent you friends to take care that no wrong shall be done your grandmother or yourself  youre right enough in that miles put in the mate god bless the old lady she shall never sleep out of the house with my consent unless it is when she sails down the river to go to the theatre and the museum the ten or fifteen dutch churches there are in town and all them ere sort o thingumerees  kitty gazed at her lefthand neighbour with surprise but i could feel that maiden bashfulness induced her to press less closely to my side than she had done the minute before  i dont understand you kitty answered after a short pause during which she was doubtless endeavouring to comprehend what she had heard grandmother has no wish to go to town she only wants to pass the rest of her days quietly at the old place and one church is enough for anybody  had the little girl lived a few years later she would have ascertained that some persons require halfadozen  and you kitty do you suppose your grandmother has no thought for you when she shall be called away herself  oh yesi know she thinks a good deal of that but i try to set her heart at ease poor dear old grandmother for its of no use to be distressing herself about me i can take care of myself well enough and have plenty of friends who will never see me want fathers sisters say theyll take care of me  you have one friend kitty of whom you little think just now and he will provide for you  i dont know whom you mean sirunlessand yet you cant suppose i never think of god sir  i mean a friend on earthhave you no friend on earth whom you have not mentioned yet  i am not sureperhapsyou do not mean horace bright do you sir  this was said with a bright blush and a look in which the dawning consciousness of maiden shame was so singuarly blended with almost childish innocence as both to delight me and yet cause me to smile  and who is horace bright i asked assuming as grave an air as possible  oh horace is nobodyonly the son of one of our neighbours there dont you see the old stone house that stands among the apple and cherry trees on the banks of the river just here in a line with this barn  quite plainly and a very pretty place it is we were admiring it as we drove up the road  well that is horace brights fathers and one of the best farms in the neighbourhood but you mustnt mind what he says grandmother always tells me boys love to talk grandly and all the folks about here feel for us though most of them are afraid of squire van tassel too  i place no reliance at all on horaces talknot i it is just as your grandmother tells you boys are fond of making a parade and often utter things they dont mean  well i dont think that is horaces way in the least though i wouldnt have you suppose i ever think the least in the world about what horace says concerning my never being left to want my own aunts will take care of that  and should they fail you my dear cried marble with strong feeling your own uncle would step into their places without waiting to have his memory jogged  again kitty looked surprised a very little startled and again she pressed to my side  i have no uncle she answered timidly father never had a brother and grandmothers son is dead  no kitty i said giving a look at marble to keep him quiet in the last you are mistaken this is the good news of which we spoke your grandmothers son is not dead but living and in good health he is found acknowledged has passed the afternoon with your grandmother has money more than enough to satisfy even the unjust demand of the miserly van tassel and will be a father to you  oh dear mecan this be true exclaimed kitty pressing still closer than ever to my side and are you uncle after all and will it all come out as you say poor poor grandmother and i not at home to hear it all and to help her under such a great trial  your grandmother was a little distressed of course at first but she bore it all remarkably well and is as happy at this moment as you yourself could wish her to be you are under a mistake however in supposing i am your uncledo i look old enough to be your mothers brother  dear me noi might have seen that hadnt i been so sillycan it be this other gentleman  here marble took his hint from nature and clasping the pretty young creature in his arms he kissed her with an affection and warmth that were truly paternal poor kitty was frightened at first and i dare say like her grandmother in a slight degree disappointed but there was so much heartiness in the mates manner that it reassured her in degree  im a bloody poor uncle i know kitty for a young woman like you to own marble got out though sorely tempted to blubber but theres worse in the world as youll discover no doubt in time such as i am you must take me and from this time henceforth do not care a strap for old van tassel or any other griping vagabond like him in york state  uncle is a sailor kitty answered after being fairly released from the mates rough embrace grandmother heard once that he was a soldier  ay that comes of lying i dont think they could have made a soldier of me had two wicked nurses run away with me and had they placed me on fifty tombstones by way of commencing life my natur would revolt at carrying a musket for sartain while the seas have always been a sort of home to me  kitty made no answer to this being a little in doubt i believe as to the manner in which she was to regard this new acquisition of an uncle  your grandparents did suppose your uncle a soldier i remarked but after the man was seen the mistake was discovered and now the truth has come out in a way that will admit of no dispute  how is uncle named demanded the niece in a low voice and a hesitating manner mothers brother was christened oloff i have heard grandmother say  very true dear weve been all over that the old lady and i they tell me too i was christened by the name of mosesi suppose you know who moses was child  to be sure uncle said kitty with a little laugh of surprise he was the great lawmaker of the jews  ha miles is that so  i nodded assent  and do you know about his being found in the bulrushes and the story of the king of ethiopias daughter  the king of egypt you mean do you not uncle oloff cried kitty with another little laugh  well ethiopia or egypt its all pretty much the samethis girl has been wonderfully edicated miles and will turn out famous company for me in the long winter evenings some twenty years hence or when ive worked my way up into the latitude of the dear good old soul under the hill yonder  a slight exclamation from kitty was followed by a blush and a change of expression that showed she was thinking just at that moment of anything but uncle oloff i asked an explanation  its only horace bright out yonder in the orchard looking at us he will be puzzled to know who is with me here in the old chaise horace thinks he can drive a horse better than any one about here so you must be careful how you hold the reins or use the whiphorace  this boded no good to marbles plans for passing the evenings of his old age with kitty to amuse him but as we were now on the brow of the hill with the cottage in sight horace bright was soon lost to view to do the girl justice she appeared now to think only of her grandmother and of the effects the recent discovery of her son would be likely to produce on one of her years and infirmities as for myself i was surprised to see mr hardinge in earnest conversation with old mrs wetmore both seated on the stoop of the cottage in the mild summers evening and lucy walking to and fro on the short grass of the willow bottom with an impatience and restlessness of manner it was very unusual for her to exhibit no sooner was kitty alighted than she ran to her grandmother marble following while i hastened to the point where was to be found the great object of my interest lucys face was full of feeling and concern and she received me with an extended hand that gracious as was the act itself and most grateful as it would have proved to me under other circumstances i now feared boded no good  miles you have been absent an age lucy commenced i should be disposed to reproach you had not the extraordinary story of this good old woman explained it all i feel the want of air and exercise give me your arm and we will walk a short distance up the road my dear father will not be inclined to quit that happy family so long as any light is left  i gave lucy my arm and we did walk up the road together actually ascending the hill i had just descended but all this did not induce me to overlook the fact that lucys manner was hurried and excited the whole seemed so inexplicable that i thought i would wait her own pleasure in the matter  your friend marble she continuedi do not know why i ought not to say our friend marble must be a very happy man at having at length discovered who his parents are and to have discovered them to be so respectable and worthy of his affection  as yet he seems to be more bewildered than happy as indeed does the whole family the thing has come on them so unexpectedly that there has not been time to bring their feelings in harmony with the facts  family affection is a blessed thing miles lucy resumed after a short pause speaking in her thoughtful manner there is little in this world that can compensate for its loss it must have been sad sad to the poor fellow to have lived so long without father mother sister brother or any other known relative  i believe marble found it so yet i think he felt the supposed disgrace of his birth more than his solitary condition the man has warm affections at the bottom though he has a most uncouth manner of making it known  i am surprised one so circumstanced never thought of marrying he might at least have lived in the bosom of his own family though he never knew that of a father  these are the suggestions of a tender and devoted female heart dear lucy but what has a sailor to do with a wife i have heard it said sir john jervisthe present lord st vincentalways declared a married seaman a seaman spoiled and i believe marble loves a ship so well he would hardly know how to love a woman  lucy made no answer to this indiscreet and foolish speech why it was made i scarce knew myself but the heart has its bitter moods when it prompts sentiments and declarations that are very little in accordance with its real impulses i was so much ashamed of what i had just said and in truth so much frightened that instead of attempting to laugh it off as a silly unmeaning opinion or endeavouring to explain that this was not my own way of thinking i walked on some distance in silence myself and suffered my companion to imitate me in this particular i have since had reason to think that lucy was not pleased at my manner of treating the subject though blessed creature she had another matter to communicate that lay too heavy on her heart to allow one of her generous disinterested nature to think much of anything else  miles lucy at length broke the silence by sayingi wish i do wish we had not met that other sloop this morning  i stopped short in the highway dropped my beautiful companions arm and stood gazing intently in her face as if i would read her most inmost thoughts through those windows of the soul her serene mild tender blue eyes i saw that the face was colourless and that the beautiful lips out of which the words that had alarmed me more by their accents than their direct signification were quivering in a way that their lovely mistress could not control tears as large as heavy drops of rain too were trembling on the long silken eyelashes while the very attitude of the precious girl denoted hopelessness and grief  this relates to grace i exclaimed though my throat was so parched as almost to choke my utterance  whom or what else can now occupy our minds miles i can scarce think of anything but grace when i do it is to remember that my own brother has killed her  what answer could i have made to such a speech had my mind been sufficiently at ease as respects my sister to think of anything else as it was i did not even attempt the vain office of saying anything in the way of alleviating my companions keen sense of the misconduct of rupert  grace is then worse in consequence of this unhappy rencontre i observed rather than asked  oh miles what a conversation i have had with her this afternoon she speaks already more like a being that belongs to the regions of the blessed than like one of earth there is no longer any secret between us she would gladly have avoided telling me her precise situation with rupert but we had already gone so far i would know more i thought it might relieve her mind and there was the chance however slight of its enabling us to suggest some expedient to produce still further good i think it has had some of the first effect for she is now sleeping  did grace say anything of your communicating the miserable tale to me  it is indeed a miserable tale miles they were engaged from the time grace was fifteen engaged distinctly and in terms i mean not by any of the implied understandings by which those who were so intimate generally might believe themselves bound to each other  and in what manner did so early and longcontinued an engagement cease  it came from rupert who should have died first before he was so untrue to himself to my poor father to me to all of us miles as well as to his own manhood it has been as we supposed he has been deluded by the éclât that attaches to these mertons in our provincial society and emily is rather a showy girl you knowat least for those who are accustomed only to our simple habits  alas little did lucy then knowshe has learned better sincethat showy girls belong much more to our simple state of society than to the state of those which are commonly conceived to be more advanced but emily merton was in a slight degree more artificial in manner than it was usual for a manhattanese female of that day to be and this was what lucy meant lucy who always thought so humbly of herself and was ever so ready to concede to her rivals all that could plausibly be asked in their behalf  i am well aware how much importance the leading set among ourselves attaches to english connection and english rank i answered but it does not strike me emily merton is of a class so elevated that rupert hardinge need break his faith in order to reap the advantage of belonging to her or her family  it cannot be altogether that miles lucy added in an appealing but touchingly confidential manner you and i have known each other from children and whatever may be the weaknesses of one who is so dear to me and who i hope has not altogether lost his hold on your own affections we can still rely on each other i shall speak to you with the utmost dependence on your friendship and a reliance on your heart that is not second to that which i place on my dear fathers for this is a subject on which there ought to be no concealment between us it is impossible that one as manly as upright as honest i will say as yourself can have lived so long in close intimacy with rupert and not be aware that he has marked defects of character  i have long known that he is capricious i answered unwilling to be severe on the faults of lucys brother to lucys own ear perhaps i might add that i have known he pays too much attention to fashion and the opinions of fashionable people  nay as we cannot deceive ourselves let us not attempt the ungrateful task of endeavouring to deceive each other that truehearted girl replied though she said this with so great an effort that i was compelled to listen attentively to catch all she uttered rupert has failings worse than these he is mercenary nor is he always a man of truth heaven knows how i have wept over these defects of character and the pain they have given me from childhood but my dear dear father overlooks them allor rather seeing them he hopes all things it is hard for a parent to believe a child irreclaimable  i was unwilling to let lucy say any more on this subject for her voice her countenance i might almost say her whole figure showed how much it cost her to say even this much of rupert i had long known that lucy did not respect her brother as much as she could wish but this was never before betrayed to me in words nor in any other manner indeed that would not have eluded the observation of one who knew the parties less thoroughly than myself i could perceive that she felt the awful consequences she foresaw from her brothers conduct gave me a claim on her sincerity and that she was suffering martyrdom in order to do all that lay in her own power to lessen the force of the blow that unworthy relative had inflicted it would have been ungenerous in me to suffer such a sacrifice to continue a moment longer than was necessary  spare yourself and me dearest lucy i eagerly said all explanations but those which are necessary to let me know the exact state of my sisters case i confess i could wish to understand however the manner in which rupert has contrived to explain away an engagement that has lasted four years and which must have been the source of so much innocent confidence between grace and himself  i was coming to that miles and when you know it you will know all grace has felt his attentions to emily merton for a long time but there never was a verbal explanation between them until just before she left town then she felt it due to herself to know the truth and after a conversation which was not very particular your sister offered to release rupert from his engagement did he in the least desire it  and what answer did he make to a proposal that was as generous as it was frank  i must do grace the justice to say miles that in all she said she used the utmost tenderness towards my brother still i could not but gather the substance of what passed rupert at first affected to believe that grace herself wished to break the engagement but in this you well know her ingenuous simplicity would not permit him to succeed she did not attempt to conceal how deeply she should feel the change in her situation and how much it might influence her future happiness  ay that was like both of themlike rupert and like grace i muttered huskily  lucy continued silent an instant apparently to allow me to regain my selfcommand then she continued  when rupert found that the responsibility of the rupture must rest on him he spoke more sincerely he owned to grace that his views had changed said they were both too young to contract themselves when they did and that he had made an engagement to marry at a time when he was unfit to bind himself to so solemn a contractsaid something about minors and concluded by speaking of his poverty and total inability to support a wife now that mrs bradfort had left me the whole of her property  and this is the man who wishes to make the world believe that he is the true heirnay who told me himself that he considers you as only a sort of trustee to hold half or twothirds of the estate until he has had leisure to sow his wild oats  i know he has encouraged such notions miles lucy answered in a low voice how gladly would i realize his hopes if things could be placed where we once thought they were every dollar of mrs bradforts fortune would i relinquish with joy to see grace happy or rupert honest  i am afraid we shall never see the first lucy in this evil world at least  i have never wished for this engagement since i have been old enough to judge of my brothers true character he would ever have been too fickle and of principles too light to satisfy graces heart or her judgment there may have been some truth in his plea that the engagement was too early and inconsiderately made persons so young can hardly know what will or what will not be necessary to their own characters a few years later as it is even grace would now refuse to marry rupert she owned to me that the heaviest part of the blow was being undeceived in relation to his character i spoke to her with greater freedom than a sister ought to have used perhaps but i wished to arouse her pride as the means of saving her alas grace is all affections and those once withered i fear miles the rest of her being will go with them  i made no answer to this prophetic remark lucys visit to the shore her manner and all that she had said convincing me that she had in a great degree taken leave of hope we conversed some time longer returning toward the cottage but there was nothing further to communicate that it is necessary to record neither of us thought of self and i would as soon have attempted to desecrate a church as attempt to obtain any influence over lucy in my own behalf at such a moment all my feelings reverted to my poor sister again and i was dying with impatience to return to the sloop whither indeed it was time to repair the sun having some time before disappeared while even the twilight was drawing to a close    chapter v      the serpent of the field by art   and spells is won from harming   but that which coils around the heart   oh who hath power of charming    hebrew melodies   it was not easy to make mr hardinge a sharer in my impatience he had taken a fancy to marble and was as much rejoiced at this accidental discovery of the mates parentage as if he had been one of the family himself with such feelings therefore i had a good deal of difficulty in getting him away i asked marble to go off with me it being understood that he was to be landed again in order to pass the first night of his recognition under his mothers roof to this scheme however he raised an objection as soon as told it was my intention to go down the river as far as new york in quest of further medical advice insisting on accompanying me in order to obtain the thousand dollars with which to face squire van tassel or at least his mortgage sale accordingly there were leavetakings and about eight we were all on board the sloop  i did not see nor did i ask to see my sister again that night i had not seen her indeed since the moment rupert was discovered in company with the mertons and to own the truth i felt afraid to see her knowing as i did how much her frame was apt to be affected by her mind it appeared to me there remained but the single duty to perform that of getting below as fast as possible in order to obtain the needed medical aid it is true we possessed posts written instructions and knew his opinion that the chief thing was to divert graces thoughts from dwelling on the great cause of her malady but now he had left us it seemed as if i should neglect a most sacred duty did i delay obtaining some other competent physician  the tide turned at nine and we got immediately under way with a light southwest wind as for marble ignorant as mr hardinge himself of the true condition of my sister he determined to celebrate his recent discoveries by a supper i was about to object to the project on account of grace but lucy begged me to let him have his way such convives as my late guardian and my own mate were not likely to be very boisterous and she fancied that the conversation or such parts of it as should be heard through the bulkhead might serve to divert the invalids mind from dwelling too intently on the accidental rencontre of the morning the scheme was consequently carried out and in the course of an hour the cabins of the wallingford presented a singular spectacle in her berth was grace patiently and sweetly lending herself to her friends wish to seem to listen to her own account of the reason of the mates festa and to be amused by his sallies lucy all care and attention for her patient as i could discover through the open door of the aftercabin while she endeavoured to appear to enter into the business that was going on at the table actually taking wine with the mate and drinking to the happiness of his newlyfound relatives mr hardinge overflowing with philanthropy and so much engrossed with his companions good fortune as not to think of aught else at the moment marble himself becoming gradually more under the influence of his new situation as his feelings had time to gather force and take their natural direction while i was compelled to wear the semblance of joining in his festivities at an instant when my whole soul was engrossed with anxiety on behalf of grace  this milk is just the richest and best that ever came on board a vessel exclaimed the mate as he was about to wind up his own share of the repast with a cup of coffeeand as for butter i can say i never tasted the article before little kitty brought both down to the boat with her own hands and that makes them so much the sweeter too for if anything can add to the excellence of eatables it is to have them pass through the hands of ones own relations i dare say mr hardinge now you have verified this time and again in your own experience  in feeling my friend in feeling often though little in practice in the sense that you mean my family has been my congregation unless indeed miles here and his beloved sister can be added to my own children in fact as they certainly are in affection but i can understand how butter made by the hands of ones own mother or by those of such a pretty niece as your kitty would taste all the sweeter  its such a providential thing as you call it to find such a mother in the bargain now i might have discovered a slattern or a scold or a woman of bad character or one that never went to church or even one that swore and drank for begging your pardon miss lucy just such creaturs are to be met with whereas instead of any of these disagreeable recommendations ive fallen in with an a no 1 mother ay and such an old lady as the king of england himself need not be ashamed to owna i felt a strong desire mr hardinge to get down on my knees and to ask the dear good old soul just to say god bless you my dear son moses van duzer or oloff whatever your name may be2    footnote 2 in that day all allusions to royalty were confined to the   majesty of great britain it being no uncommon thing at the   commencement of this century to hear the king toasted at many of   the best tables of the country  and if you had mr marble you would not have been any the worse for it such feelings do you honour and no man need be ashamed of desiring to receive a parents blessing  i suppose now my dear sir added marble innocently that is what is called having a religious turn ive often foreseen that religion would fetch me up in the long run and now that i am altogether relieved from bitterness of heart on the subject of belonging to none and no ones belonging to me my sentiments have undergone a great alteration and i feel a wish to be at peace with the whole human familyno not with the whole i except that rascally old van tassel  you must except no onewe are told to love those that hate us to bless those that curse us and to pray for those that despitefully use us  marble stared at mr hardinge for to own the truth it would have been difficult in a christian land to meet with one of his years who had less religious instruction than himself it is quite probable that these familiar mandates had never been heard by him before but i could see that he was a little struck with the profound morality that pervaded them a morality to which no human heart appears to be so insensible as not in secret to acknowledge its sublimity still he doubted  where are we told to do this my dear sir demanded marble after looking intently at the rector for a moment  where why where we get all our divine precept and inspired morality the bible you must come to wish this mr van tassel good instead of evil try to love instead of hating him  is that religion demanded the mate in his most dogmatical and determined manner  it is christianityits spirit its very essence without which the heart cannot be right let the tongue proclaim what delusion it may  marble had imbibed a sincere respect for my late guardian equally from what he had heard me say in his favour and what he had seen himself of his benevolent feelings kindhearted morality and excellent sense nevertheless it was not an easy matter to teach a being like marble the lesson that he was to do good to those who used him despitefully and just at that moment he was in a frame of mind to do almost anything else sooner than pardon van tassel all this i could see understanding the man so well and in order to prevent a useless discussion that might disturb my sister i managed to change the discourse before it was too late i say too late because it is not easy to shake off two moralists who sustain their doctrines as strongly as mr hardinge and my mate  i am glad the name of this mr van tassel has been mentioned i observed as it may be well to have your advice sir concerning our best mode of proceeding in his affair  i then related to mr hardinge the history of the mortgage and the necessity there was for promptitude inasmuch as the sale was advertised for the ensuing week my late guardian was better acquainted with the country up the river than i was myself and it was fortunate the subject was broached as he soon convinced me the only course to be pursued was to put marble ashore at hudson where if too late for the regular stage he might obtain some other conveyance and proceed to town by land this would barely leave him time to transact all the necessary business and to be back in season to prevent the title to the willow cove from passing into the usurers grasp as was usual with mr hardinge he entered into this as into every good work heart and hand and immediately set about writing directions for marbles government when he got ashore this put in end to the banquet and glad was i to see the table removed and the other signs of a tranquil night reappear  it was twelve before the sloop was as low as hudson and i saw by our rate of sailing that indeed there was little prospect of her reaching new york in time for marbles necessities he was landed therefore and mr hardinge and myself accompanied him to the stagehouse where we ascertained that the next morning after breakfast he would be enabled to get into the stage which would reach town in the evening of the succeeding day but this was altogether too slow for marbles impatience he insisted on procuring a private conveyance and we saw him drive out of the long street that then composed most of the city of hudson at a slapping pace about one oclock in the morning this important duty discharged mr hardinge and i returned to the sloop in which neb had been standing off and on in waiting for us and again made sail down the river when i turned in the wallingford was getting along at the rate of about five miles the hour the wind having freshened and come out at the westward a quarter that just enabled her to lay her course  the reader will easily imagine i did not oversleep myself the following morning my uneasiness was so great indeed that i dreamed of the dreadful accident which had produced my fathers death and then fancied that i saw him my mother and grace all interred at the same time and in the same grave fortunately the wind stood at the west and the sloop was already within twenty miles of the creek at clawbonny when i got on deck all was quiet in the aftercabin and mr hardinge still continuing in his berth i went out to breathe the fresh morning air without speaking to any below there was no one on the quarterdeck but the pilot who was at the helm though i saw a pair of legs beneath the boom close in with the mast that i knew to be nebs and a neat dark petticoat that i felt certain must belong to chloe i approached the spot in tending to question the former on the subject of the weather during his watch but just as about to hail him i heard the young lady say in a more animated tone than was discreet for the character of the conversation  no nebber sahnebber widout de apperbation of my modder and de whole famerly mattermony a berry differ ting neb from what you surposes now many a young nigger gentleman imagine dat he has only to coax his gal to say yes and den dey goes to de clergy and stands up for de blessin and imagines all right for de futur and for de present time all which is just a derlusion and a derception no sah mattermony a berry differ ting from dat as any old lady can tell you de fuss ting in mattermony is to hab a consent  well chloe and habnt i had

about it  as chloe now spoke naturally for the first time neb was evidently startled and i had sufficient amusement and sufficient curiosity to remain stationary in order to hear what this new obstacle might be the voice of the negress was music itself almost as sweet as lucys and i was struck with a slight tremor that pervaded it as she so suddenly put an end to all her own affectation of sentiment and nipped her airs and graces as it might be in the bud  nebber talk to me of mattermony neb chloe continued almost sobbing as she spoke while miss grace be in dis berry bad way it hard enough to see her look so pale and melercholy widout tinking of becomin a wife  miss grace will grow better now masser mile carry her on de water if he only take her to sea she get so fat and hearty no libbin wid her  chloe did not acquiesce in this opinion she rather insisted that miss grace was altogether too delicate and refined a person to live in a ship but the circumstance that struck me with the greatest force in this characteristic dialogue was the fact that chloe betrayed to me the consciousness of the cause of my sisters indisposition while true to her sexs instincts and faithful to her duty the girl completely concealed it from her lover i was also oppressively struck with the melancholy forebodings that appeared in chloes manner rather than in her words and which made it apparent that she doubted of her young mistresss recovery she concluded the conversation by saying  no no nebdont talk to me of mattermony while miss grace so ill and if any ting should happen you need nebber talk to me of it at all i could nebber tink of any uner union should anyting happen to miss grace lub love will die forebber in de family when miss grace die  i turned away at this speech the tears starting to my eyes and saw lucy standing in the companionway she was waiting to speak to me and no sooner caught my eye than beckoning me to her side she let me know that my sister desired to see me erasing every sign of emotion as soon as possible i descended with lucy and was soon at the side of my sisters berth  grace received me with an angelic smile but i almost gasped for breath as i noticed the prodigious change that had come over her in so brief a space she now looked more like a being of another world than ever and this too immediately after coming from the refreshment of a nights rest i kissed her forehead which had an unnatural chill on it i thought and i felt the feeble pressure of an arm that was thrown affectionately round my neck i then sat down on the transom still holding my sisters hand grace looked anxiously at me for half a minute ere she spoke as if to ascertain how far i was conscious of her situation  lucy tells me brother she at length said that you think of carrying me down the river as far as town in order to get further advice i hope this is a mistake of our dear lucys however  it is not grace if the wind stand here at the westward i hope to have you in lucys own house in wall street by tomorrow evening i know she will receive you hospitably and have ventured to form the plan without consulting you on the subject  better that i should be at clawbonnyif anything can now do me good brother it will be native air and pure country air hearken to my request and stop at the creek  your serious request grace will be a law to me if made on due reflection this growing feebleness however alarms me and i cannot justify it to myself not to send for advice  remember miles it is not yet twentyfour hours since one of the ablest men of the country saw me we have his written instructions and all that man can do for me they will do for me no brother listen to my entreaties and go into the creek i pine i pine to be again at dear clawbonny where alone i can enjoy anything like peace of body or mind this vessel is unsuited to me i cannot think of a future or pray in it brother dearest brother carry me home if you love me  there was no resisting such an appeal i went on deck with a heavy heart and gave the necessary orders to the pilot and in about eightandforty hours after we emerged into the hudson we left that noble stream again to shoot beneath the shaded leafy banks of our own inlet grace was so feeble as to be carried to the chaise in which she was supported by lucy during the short drive to the house when i reached my own dwelling i found mr hardinge pacing the little portico or piazza waiting for my arrival with an uneasiness of manner that at once proclaimed his anxiety to see me he had driven the horse of the chaise and had imbibed a first impression of graces danger  miles my dear boymy second sonthe simplehearted excellent old man commenced miles my dear boy the hand of god has been laid heavily on usyour beloved sister my own precious grace is far more ill than i had any idea of before this morning  she is in the hands of her merciful creator i said struggling to command myself who i greatly fear is about to call her from a world that is not good enough for one so innocent and pure to take her to himself i have foreseen this from the hour i first met her after my return though a single ray of hope dawned on me when post advised the change of scene so far from producing good this excursion has produced evil and she is much worse than when we left home  such shortsighted mortals are webut what can we do my boyi confess my judgment my faculties themselves are nearly annihilated by the suddenness of this shock i had supposed her illness some trifling complaint that youth and care would certainly remove and here we stand as it might be at the call of the trumpets blast almost around her grave  i am most anxious to lean on your wisdom and experience my dear sir at this critical moment if you will advise i shall be happy to follow your instructions  we must lean on god miles answered my worthy guardian still pacing the piazza the tears running down his cheeks in streams and speaking so huskily as barely to be intelligible yes we will have the prayers of the congregation next sunday morning and most devout and heartfelt prayers they will be for her own sainted mother was not more deservedly loved to be called away so youngto die in the first bloom of youth and loveliness as it werebut it is to go to her god we must endeavour to think of her gainto rejoice over rather than mourn her loss  i grieve to perceive that you regard my sisters case as so entirely hopeless sir  hopelessit is full of the brightest promise and when i come to look calmly at it my reason tells me i ought not to grieve still miles the loss of lucy herself would scarce be a more severe blow to me i have loved her from childhood cared for her as for one of my own and feel the same love for her that i should feel for a second daughter your parents were dear to me and their children have always appeared to me to belong to my own blood had i not been your guardian boy and you and grace been comparatively so rich while i and mine were so poor it would have been the first wish of my heart to have seen rupert and grace you and lucy united which would have made you all my beloved children alike i often thought of this until i found it necessary to repress the hope lest i should prove unfaithful to my trust now indeed mrs bradforts bequest might have smoothed over every difficulty but it came too late it was not to be providence had ordered otherwise  you had an ardent supporter of your scheme in one of your children at least sir  so you have given me to understand miles and i regret that i was informed of the fact so late or i might have contrived to keep off other young men while you were at sea or until an opportunity offered to enable you to secure my daughters affections that done neither time nor distance could have displaced you the needle not being more true than lucy or the laws of nature more certain  the knowledge of these sterling qualities sir only makes me regret my having come too late so much the more  it was not to beat one time i did think rupert and grace had a preference for each other but i must have been deceived god had ordered it otherwise and wisely no doubt as his omniscience foresaw the early drooping of this lovely flower i suppose their having been educated together so much like brother and sister has been the reason there was so much indifference to each others merits you have been an exception on account of your long absences miles and you must look to those absences for the consolation and relief you will doubtless require alas alas that i could not now fold grace to my heart as a daughter and a bride instead of standing over her grave nothing but ruperts diffidence of his own claims during our days of poverty could have prevented him from submitting himself to so much loveliness and virtue i acquit the ad of insensibility for nothing but the sense of poverty and the pride of a poor gentleman added perhaps to the brotherly regard he has always felt for grace could have kept him from seeking her hand grace properly enough would have requited his affection  such is a specimen of the delusion under which we live daily here was my sister dying of blighted affections under my own roof and the upright conscientious father of the wretch who had produced this withering evil utterly unconscious of the wrong that had been done still regarding his son with the partiality and indulgence of a fond parent to me it seemed incredible at the time that unsuspecting integrity could carry its simplicity so far but i have since lived long enough to know that mistakes like these are constantly occurring around us effects being hourly attributed to causes with which they have no connection and causes being followed down to effects that are as imaginary as human sagacity is faulty as for myself i can safely say that in scarce a circumstance of my life that has brought me the least under the cognizance of the public have i ever been judged justly in various instances have i been praised for acts that were either totally without any merit or at least the particular merit imputed to them while i have been even persecuted for deeds that deserved praise an instance or two of the latter of these cases of the false judgment of the world will be laid before the reader as i proceed  mr hardinge continued for some time to expatiate on the loveliness of graces character and to betray the weight of the blow he had received in gaining this sudden knowledge of her danger he seemed to pass all at once from a state of inconsiderate security to one of total hopelessness and found the shock so much harder to endure at length he sent for lucy with whom he continued closeted for near an hour i ascertained afterwards that he questioned the dear girl closely on the subject of my sisters malady even desiring to know if her affections were any way connected with this extraordinary sinking of the vital powers but not in the slightest degree inclining to the distrust of ruperts being in any manner implicated in the affair lucy truthful and frank as she was felt the uselessness nay the danger of enlightening her father and managed to evade all his more delicate inquiries without involving herself in falsehoods she well knew if he were apprised of the real state of the case that rupert would have been sent for and every reparation it was in his power to make would have been insisted on as an act of justice a hopeless and distressing attempt to restore the confidence of unbounded love and the esteem which once lost is gone forever perhaps the keenest of all graces sufferings proceeded from the consciousness of the total want of merit in the man she had so effectually enshrined in her heart that he could only be ejected by breaking in pieces and utterly destroying the tenement that had so long contained him with ordinary notions this change of opinion might have sufficed for the purposes of an effectual cure but my poor sister was differently constituted she had ever been different from most of her sex in intensity of feeling and had come near dying while still a child on the occasion of the direful catastrophe of my fathers loss and the decease of even our mother though long expected had come near to extinguish the flame of life in the daughter as i have already said more than once a being so sensitive and so pure ever seemed better fitted for the regions of bliss than for the collisions and sorrows of the world  now we were at clawbonny again i scarce knew how to employ myself grace i could not see lucy who took the entire management of the invalid requiring for her rest and quiet in this she did but follow the directions of reason as well as those left by post and i was fain to yield knowing that my sister could not possibly have a more judicious or a more tender nurse  the different persons belonging to the mill and the farm came to me for directions which i was compelled to give with thoughts engrossed with the state of my sister more than once i endeavoured to arouse myself and for a few minutes seemed to enter if i did not truly enter with interest into the affairs presented to my consideration but these little rallies were merely so many attempts at selfdelusion and i finally referred everything to the respective persons entrusted with the different branches of the duty bidding them act as they had been accustomed to do in my absence  why yes masser mile answered the old negro who was the head man in the field dis berry well if he can do it remember i alway hab masser hardinge to talk to me about e crop and sich ting and dat a wonerful help to a poor nigger when he in a nonplush  surely hiram you are a better husbandman than mr hardinge and myself put together and cannot want the advice of either to tell you how to raise corn or to get in hay  dat berry true sahso true i wont deny him but you know how it be masser mile a nigger do lub to talk and it help along work wonerfully to get a good dispute afore he begin  as respects the blacks this was strictly true though as respectful as slavery and habit could make them they were so opinionated and dogmatical each in his or her sphere that nothing short of a downright assertion of authority could produce submission to any notions but their own they loved to argue the different points connected with their several duties but they did not like to be convinced mr hardinge would discuss with them from a sense of duty and he would invariably yield unless in cases that involved moral principles on all such points and they were not of unfrequent occurrence in a family of so many blacks he was as inflexible as the laws of the medes and persians but as respected the wheat the potatoes the orchards the mill or the sloop he usually submitted to the experience of those more familiar with the business after having discussed the matters in council this rendered him exceedingly popular at clawbonny the persuaded usually having the same sort of success in the world as a good listener as for the rector himself after so many long discussions he began to think he had actually influenced the different steps adopted the cause of one of the illusions i have already pourtrayed  old hiram did not quit me when he came for instructions alias a dispute without a word of inquiry touching grace i could see that the alarm had passed among the slaves and it was quite touching to note the effect it produced on their simple minds it would have been sufficient for them to love her that grace was their young mistress but such a mistress as she had ever been and one so winning in manner and person they might be said almost to worship her  i berry sorry to hear miss grace be onwell sah said old hiram looking at me sorrowfully it go hard wid us all if anyting happen dere i alway spose masser mile dat miss grace and masser rupert come togeder some time as we all expects you and miss lucy will dem are happy days sah at clawbonny for den we all know our new masser and new missus from de cradle no nowe can nebber spare miss grace sah even i should miss her in e field  the very blacks had observed the state of things which had deluded my poor sister and the slave had penetrated his masters secret i turned away abruptly from the negro lest he should also detect the evidence of the weakness extorted by his speech from the eyes of manhood    chapter vi                              like the lily   that once was mistress of the field and flourished   ill hang my head and perish    queen catherine   i saw little of lucy that night she met us at evening prayers and tears were in her eyes as she arose from her knees without speaking she kissed her father for good night more affectionately than ever i thought and then turned to me her hand was extended we had seldom met or parted for eighteen years without observing this little act of kindness but she did notnay could not speak i pressed the little hand fervently in my own and relinquished it again in the same eloquent silence she was seen no more by us until next day  the breakfast had ever been a happy meal at clawbonny my father though merely a shipmaster was one of the better class and he had imbibed many notions in the course of his different voyages that placed him much in advance of the ordinary habits of his day and country then an american shipmaster is usually superior to those of other countries this arises from some of the peculiarities of our institutions as well as from the circumstance that the navy is so small among other improvements my father had broken in upon the venerable american custom of swallowing a meal as soon as out of bed the breakfast at clawbonny from my earliest infancy or as long as i can remember had been eaten regularly at nine oclock a happy medium between the laziness of dissipation and the hurry of illformed habits at that hour the whole family used to meet still fresh from a nights repose and yet enlivened and gay by an hour or two of exercise in the open air instead of coming to the family board half asleep with a sort of drowsy sulkiness as if the meal were a duty and not a pleasure we ate as leisurely as keen appetites would permit laughed chatted related the events of the morning conversed of our plans for the day and indulged our several tastes and humours like people who had been up and stirring and not like so many drowsy drones swallowing our food for forms sake the american breakfast has been celebrated by several modern writers and it deserves to be though certainly not to be compared to that of france still it might be far better than it is did our people understand the mood in which it ought to be enjoyed  while on this subject the reader will excuse an old mans prolixity if i say a word on the state of the science of the table in general as it is put in practice in this great republic a writer of this country one mr cooper has somewhere said that the americans are the grossest feeders in the civilized world and warns his countrymen to remember that a national character may be formed in the kitchen this remark is commented on by captain marryatt who calls it both unjust and illnatured as for the illnature i shall say nothing unless it be to remark that i do not well see how that which is undeniably true ought to be thought so very illnatured that it is true every american who has seen much of other lands must know captainmarryatts allegation that the tables are good in the large towns has nothing to do with the merits of this question the larger american towns are among the best eating and drinking portions of the world but what are they as compared to the whole country what are the public tables or the tables of the refined as compared to the tables of the mass even in these very towns all things are to be judged of by the rules and not by the exceptions because a small portion of the american population understand what good cookery is it by no means follows that all do who would think of saying that the people of england live on white bait and venison because the nobility and gentry the aldermen inclusive can enjoy both in the seasons ad libitum i suspect this mr cooper knows quite as well what he is about when writing of america as any european if pork fried in grease and grease pervading half the other dishes vegetables cooked without any art and meats done to rags make a good table then is this mr cooper wrong and captain marryatt right and vice versâ as yet while nature has done so much in america art has done but little much compared with numbers and time certainly but little as compared with what numbers and time have done elsewhere nevertheless i would make an exception in favour of america as respects the table of one country though not so much in connection with the coarseness of the feeding as in the poverty of the food i consider the higher parts of germany to be the portions of the christian world where eating and drinking are in the most primitive condition and that part of this great republic which mr alison would probably call the state of new england to come next in abundance and excellence of food in the native form america is particularly favoured baltimore being at the very nucleus of all that is exquisite in the great business of mastication nevertheless the substitution of cooks from the interior of new england for the present glistening tenants of her kitchens would turn even that paradise of the epicure into a sort of oleaginous waste enough of cookery  lucy did not appear at prayers next morning i felt her absence as one feels the certainty of some dreadful evil breakfast was announced still lucy did not appear the table was smoking and hissing and romeo clawbonny who acted as the everyday houseservant or footman had several times intimated that it might be well to commence operations as a cold breakfast was very cold comfort  miles my dear boy observed mr hardinge after opening the door to look for the absentee half a dozen times we will wait no longer my daughter no doubt intends to breakfast with grace to keep the poor dear girl company for it is dull work to breakfast by oneself you and i miss lucy sadly at this very moment though we have each others company to console us  we had just taken our seats when the door slowly opened and lucy entered the room  good morning dearest father said the sweet girl passing an arm round mr hardinges neck with more than her usual tenderness of manner and imprinting a long kiss on his bald head good morning miles stretching towards me a hand but averting her face as afraid it might reveal too much when exposed fully to my anxious and inquiring gaze grace passed a pretty quiet night and is i think a little less disturbed this morning than she was yesterday  neither of us answered or questioned the dear nurse what a breakfast was that compared to so many hundreds in which i had shared at that very table and in that same room three of the accustomed faces were there it is true all the appliances were familiar some dating as far back as the time of the first miles romeo now a greyheaded and wrinkled negro was in his usual place but chloe who was accustomed to pass often between her young mistress and a certain closet at that meal which never seemed to have all we wanted arranged on the table at first was absent as was that precious young mistress herself gracious providence i mentally ejaculated is it thy will it should ever be thus am i never again to see those dovelike eyes turned on me in sisterly affection from the head of my table as i have so often seen them on hundreds and hundreds of occasions lucys spirits had sometimes caused her to laugh merrily and her musical voice once used to mingle with ruperts and my own more manly and deeper notes in something like audible mirth not that lucy was ever boisterous or loud but in early girlhood she had been gay and animated to a degree that often blended with the noisier clamour of us boys with grace this had never happened she seldom spoke except in moments when the rest were still and her laugh was rarely audible though so often heartfelt and joyous it may seem strange to those who have never suffered the pang of feeling that such a customary circle was broken up forever but that morning the first in which i keenly felt that my sister was lost to me i actually missed her graceful eloquent silence  miles said lucy as she rose from the table tears trembling on her eyelids as she spoke half an hour hence come to the family room grace wishes to see you there this morning and i have not been able to deny her request she is weak but thinks the visit will do her good do not fail to be punctual as waiting might distress her good morning dearest papa when i want you i will send for you  lucy left us with these ominous notices and i felt the necessity of going on the lawn for air i walked my halfhour out and returned to the house in time to be punctual to the appointment chloe met me at the door and led the way in silence towards the family room her hand was no sooner laid on the latch than lucy appeared beckoning me to enter i found grace reclining on that small settee or causeuse on which we had held our first interview looking pallid and uneasy but still looking lovely and as ethereal as ever she held out a hand affectionately and then i saw her glance towards lucy as if asking to be left with me alone as for myself i could not speak taking my old place i drew my sisters head on my bosom and sat holding it in silence for many painful minutes in that position i could conceal the tears which forced themselves from my eyes it exceeding all my powers to repress these evidences of human grief as i took my place the figure of lucy disappeared and the door closed  i never knew how long a time grace and i continued in that tender attitude i was not in a state of mind to note such a fact and have since striven hard to forget most that occurred in that solemn interview after a lapse of so many years however i find memory painfully accurate on all the leading circumstances though it was impossible to recall a point of which i took no heed at the moment such things only as made an impression is it in my power to relate  when grace gently and i might add faintly raised herself from my bosom she turned on me eyes that were filled with a kind anxiety on my account rather than on her own  brother she said earnestly the will of god must be submitted toi am very very illbroken in piecesi grow weaker every hour it is not right to conceal such a truth from ourselves or from each other  i made no reply although she evidently paused to give me an opportunity to speak i could not have uttered a syllable to have saved my life the pause was impressive rather than long  i have sent for you dearest miles my sister continued not that i think it probable i shall be called away soon or suddenlygod will spare me for a little while i humbly trust in order to temper the blow to those i love but he is about to call me to him and we must all be prepared for it you and dear dear lucy and my beloved guardian as well as myself i have not sent for you even to tell you this for lucy gives me reason to believe you expect the separation but i wish to speak to you on a subject that is very near my heart while i have strength and fortitude to speak on it at all promise me dearest to be calm and to listen patiently  your slightest wish will be a law to me beloved most precious sister i shall listen as if we were in our days of childish confidence and happinessthough i fear those days are never to return  feel not thus miles my noblehearted manly brother heaven will not desert you unless you desert your god it does not desert me but angels beckon me to its bliss were it not for you and lucy and my dear dear guardian the hour of my departure would be a moment of pure felicity but we will not talk of this now you must prepare yourself miles to hear me patiently and to be indulgent to my last wishes even should they seem unreasonable to your mind at first  i have told you grace that a request of yours will be a law to me have no hesitation therefore in letting me know any or all your wishes  let us then speak of worldly things for the last time i trust my brother sincerely do i hope that this will be the last occasion on which i shall ever be called to allude to them this duty discharged all that will remain to me on earth will be the love i bear my friends this heaven itself will excuse as i shall strive not to let it lessen that i bear my god  grace paused and i sat wondering what was to follow though touched to the heart by her beautiful resignation to a fate that to most so young would seem hard to be borne  miles my brother she continued looking at me anxiously we have not spoken much of your success in your last voyage though i have understood that you have materially increased your means  it has quite equalled my expectations and rich in my ship and ready money i am content to say nothing of clawbonny do what you will with your own therefore my sister not a wish of mine shall ever grudge a dollar i would rather not be enriched by your loss make your bequests freely and i shall look on each and all of them as so many memorials of your affectionate heart and many virtues  graces cheeks flushed and i could see that she was extremely gratified though still tremblingly anxious  you doubtless remember that by our fathers will miles my property becomes yours if i die without children before i reach the age of twentyone while yours would have been mine under the same circumstances as i am barely twenty it is out of my power to make a legal will  it is in your power to make one that shall be equally binding grace i will go this instant for pen ink and paper and as you dictate will i write a will that shall be even more binding than one that might come within the rules of the law  nay brother that is unnecessary all i wish i have already said in a letter addressed to yourself and which should you now approve of it will be found among my papers as a memorandum but there should be no misapprehension between you and me dearest miles i do not wish you even fully to consent to my wishes now take time to consider and let your judgment have as much influence on your decision as your own excellent heart  i am as ready to decide at this moment as i shall be a year hence it is enough for me that you wish the thing done to have it done sister  bless youbless youbrothersaid grace affectionately pressing my hand to her heartnot so much that you consent to do as i wish as for the spirit and manner in which you comply still as i ask no trifle it is proper that i release you from all pledges here given and allow you time for reflection then it is also proper you should know the full extent of what you promise  it is enough for me that it will be in my power to perform what you desire further than that i make no stipulation  i could see that grace was profoundly struck with this proof of my attachment but her own sense of right was too just and active to suffer the matter to rest there  i must explain further she added mr hardinge has been a most faithful steward and by means of economy during my long minority the little cost that has attended my manner of living and some fortunate investments that have been made of interestmoney i find myself a good deal richer than i had supposed in relinquishing my property miles you will relinquish rather more than twoandtwenty thousand dollars or quite twelve hundred a year there ought to be no misapprehensions on this subject between us least of all at such a moment  i wish it were more my sister since it gives you pleasure to bestow it if it will render you any happier to perfect any of your plans take ten thousand of my own and add to the sum which is now yours i would increase rather than lessen your means of doing good  milesmilessaid grace dreadfully agitatedtalk not thusit almost shakes my purpose but no listen now to my wishes for i feel this will be the last time i shall ever dare to speak on the subject in the first place i wish you to purchase some appropriate ornament of the value of five hundred dollars and present it to lucy as a memorial of her friend give also one thousand dollars in money to mr hardinge to be distributed in charity a letter to him on the subject and one to lucy will also be found among my papers there will still remain enough to make suitable presents to the slaves and leave the sum of twenty thousand dollars entire and untouched  and what shall i do with these twenty thousand dollars sister i asked grace hesitating to proceed  that sum dearest miles i wish to go to rupert you know that he is totally without fortune with the habits of a man of estate the little i can leave him will not make him rich but it may be the means of making him happy and respectable i trust lucy will add to it when she comes of age and the future will be happier for them all than the past  my sister spoke quick and was compelled to pause for breath as for myself the reader can better imagine than i can describe my sensations which were of a character almost to overwhelm me the circumstance that i felt precluded from making any serious objections added to the intensity of my suffering left me in a state of grief regret indignation wonder pity and tenderness that it is wholly out of my power to delineate here then was the tenderness of the woman enduring to the last caring for the heartless wretch who had destroyed the very springs of life in her physical being while it crushed the moral like a worm beneath the foot yet bequeathing with her dying breath as it might be all the worldly goods in her possession to administer to his selfishness and vanity  i know you must think this strange brother resumed grace who doubtless saw how utterly unable i was to reply but i shall not die at peace with myself without it unless he possess some marked assurance of my forgiveness my death will render rupert miserable with such a marked assurance he will be confident of possessing my pardon and my prayers then both he and emily are pennyless i fear and their lives may be rendered blanks for the want of the little money it is in my power to bestow at the proper time lucy i feel confident will add her part and you who remain behind me can all look on my grave and bless its humble tenant  angel i murmuredthis is too much can you suppose rupert will accept this money  ill as i thought of rupert hardinge i could not bring my mind to believe he was so base as to receive money coming from such a source and with such a motive grace however viewed the matter differently not that she attached anything discreditable to ruperts compliance for her own womanly tenderness long and deeply rooted attachment made it appear to her eyes more as an act of compliance with her own last behest than as the act of degrading meanness it would unquestionably appear to be to all the rest of the world  how can he refuse this to me coming to him as the request will from my grave rejoined the lovely enthusiast he will owe it to me he will owe it to our former affectionfor he once loved me miles nay he loved me even more than you ever did or could dearestmuch as i know you love me  by heavens grace i exclaimed unable to control myself any longer that is a fearful mistake rupert hardinge is incapable of loving anything but himself he has never been worthy of occupying the most idle moment of a heart true and faithful as yours  these words escaped me under an impulse i found entirely impossible to control scarcely were they uttered ere i deeply regretted the indiscretion grace looked at me imploringly turned as pale as death and trembled all over as if on the verge of dissolution i took her in my arms i implored her pardon i promised to command myself in future and i repeated the most solemn assurances of complying with her wishes to the very letter i am not certain i could have found it in my heart not to have recalled my promise but for the advantage my sister obtained over me by means of this act of weakness there was something so exceedingly revolting to me in the whole affair that even graces holy weakness failed to sanctify the act in my eyes at least so far as rupert was concerned i owe it to myself to add that not a selfish thought mingled with my reluctance which proceeded purely from the distaste i felt to seeing lucys brother and a man for whom i had once entertained a boyish regard making himself so thoroughly an object of contempt as i entertained serious doubts of even ruperts sinking so low i felt the necessity of speaking to my sister on the subject of such a contingency  one might hesitate about accepting your money after all dearest sister i said and it is proper you give me directions what i am to do in the event of ruperts declining the gift  i think that is little probable miles answered grace who lived and died under a species of hallucination on the subject of her early lovers real characterrupert may not have been able to command his affections but he cannot cease to feel a sincere friendship for me to remember our ancient confidence and intimacy he will receive the bequest as you would take one from dear lucy added my sister a painfullooking smile illuminating that angelic expression of countenance to which i have so often alluded or as that of a sister you would not refuse such a thing to lucys dying request and why should rupert to mine  poor grace little did she see the immense difference there was in my relation to lucy and that which rupert bore to her i could not explain this difference however but merely assented to her wishes renewing for the fourth or fifth time my pledges of performing with fidelity all she asked at my hands grace then put into my hands an unsealed letter addressed to rupert which she desired me to read when alone and which i was to have delivered with the legacy or donation of money  let me rest once more on your bosom miles said grace reclining her head in my arms quite exhausted under the reaction of the excitement she had felt while urging her request i feel happier at this moment than i have been for a long time yet my increasing weakness admonishes me it cannot last long miles darling you must remember all our sainted mother taught you in childhood and you will not mourn over my loss could i leave you united to one who understood and appreciated your worth i should die contented but you will be left alone poor miles for a time at least you will mourn for me  foreverlong as life lasts beloved grace i murmured almost in her ear  exhaustion kept my sister quiet for a quarter of an hour though i felt an occasional pressure of her hands both of which held one of mine and i could hear words asking blessings and consolation for me whispered from time to time in heartfelt petitions to heaven as she gained strength by repose my sister felt the desire to continue the discourse revive i begged her not to incur the risk of further fatigue but she answered smiling affectionately in my face  restthere will be no permanent rest for me until laid by the side of my parents miles do your thoughts ever recur to that picture of the future that is so precious to the believer and which leads us to hope if not absolutely to confide in it as a matter of faith that we may recognise each other in the next state of being and that in a communion still sweeter than any of this life since it will be a communion free from all sin and governed by holiness  we sailors give little heed to these matters grace but i feel that in future the idea you have just mentioned will be full of consolation to me  remember my bestbeloved brother it is only the blessed that can enjoy such a recognitionto the accursed it must add an additional weight to the burthen of their woe  felix trembled the thought that even this chance of again meeting my sister and of communing with her in the form in which i had ever seen and loved her might be lost came in aid of other good resolutions that the state of the family had quickened in my heart i thought however it might be well not to let grace lead the conversation to such subjects after all that had just passed repose becoming necessary to her again i therefore proposed calling lucy in order that she might be carried to her own room i say carried for by a remark that fell from chloe i had ascertained that this was the mode in which she had been brought to the place of meeting grace acquiesced but while we waited for chloe to answer the bell she continued to converse  i have not exacted of you miles my sister continued any promise to keep my bequest a secret from the world your own sense of delicacy would do that but i will make it a condition that you do not speak of it to either mr hardinge or lucy they may possibly raise weak objections particularly the last who has and ever has had some exaggerated opinions about receiving money even in heydays of poverty and poor as she was you know notwithstanding our true love for each other and close intimacy i never could induce lucy to receive a cent nay so scrupulous has she been that the little presents which friends constantly give and receive she would decline because she had not the means of offering them in return  i remembered the gold the dear girl had forced on me when i first went to sea and could have kneeled at her feet and called her blessed  and this did not make you love and respect lucy the less my sister but do not answer so much conversing must distress you  not at all miles i speak without suffering nor does the little talking i do enfeeble me in the least when i appear exhausted it is from the feelings which accompany our discourse i talk much very much with dear lucy who hears me with more patience than yourself brother  i knew that this remark applied to graces wish to dwell on the unknown future and did not receive it as a reproach in any other sense as she seemed calm however i was willing to indulge her wish to converse with me so long as she dwelt on subjects that did not agitate her speaking of her hopes of heaven had a contrary effect and i made no further opposition  lucys hesitation to be under the obligations you mention did not lessen her in your esteem i repeated  you know it could not miles lucy is a dear good girl and the more intimately one knows her the more certain is one to esteem her i have every reason to bless and pray for lucy still i desire you not to make either her or her father acquainted with my bequest  rupert would hardly conceal such a thing from so near and dear friends  let rupert judge of the propriety of that for himself kiss me brother do not ask to see me again today for i have much to arrange with lucy tomorrow i shall expect a long visit god bless you my own dearmy only brother and ever have you in his holy keeping  i left the room as chloe entered and in threading the long passage that led to the apartment which was appropriated to my own particular purposes as an office cabinet or study i met lucy near the door of the latter i could see she had been weeping and she followed me into the room  what do you think of her miles the dear girl asked uttering the words in a tone so low and plaintive as to say all that she anticipated herself  we shall lose her lucy yes tis gods pleasure to call her to himself  had worlds depended on the effort i could not have got out another syllable the feelings which had been so long pent up in graces presence broke out and i am not ashamed to say that i wept and sobbed like an infant  how kind how womanlike how affectionate did lucy show herself at that bitter moment she said but little though i think i overheard her murmuring poor milespoor dear mileswhat a blow it must be to a brothergod will temper this loss to him and other similar expressions she took one of my hands and pressed it warmly between both her own held it there for two or three minutes hovered round me as the mother keeps near its slumbering infant when illness renders rest necessary and seemed more like a spirit sympathizing with my grief than a mere observer of its violence in reflecting on what then passed months afterwards it appeared to me that lucy had entirely forgotten herself her own causes of sorrow her own feelings as respected grace in the single wish to solace me but this was ever her character this was her very nature to live out of herself as it might be and in the existences of those whom she esteemed or loved during this scene lucy lost most of the restraints which womanhood and more matured habits had placed on her deportment and she behaved towards me with the innocent familiarity that marked our intercourse down to the time i sailed in the crisis it is true i was too dreadfully agitated at first to take heed of all that passed but i well remember that before leaving me in obedience to a summons from grace she laid her head affectionately on mine and kissed the curls with which nature had so profusely covered the last i thought at the time notwithstanding that the salute would have been on the forehead or cheek three years before or previously to her acquaintance with drewett  i was a long time in regaining entire selfcommand but when i did i opened my sisters letter to rupert agreeably to her request and perused it thrice without a pause even to reflect it was conceived in these words    my dearest rupert    god in his infinite and inscrutable wisdom when you read this letter   will have seen fit to call me to himself let not this seeming loss in   any manner afflict you my friend for i feel the humble assurance that   i shall reap the full benefit of the saviours great sacrifice i could   not have been happy in this life rupert and it is a mercy that i am   taken thus early to a better it grieves me to part from your   excellent father from yourself from our precious and rightfully   beloved lucy and from dear dear miles this is the last tribute i pay   to nature and i hope it will be pardoned for its character there is a   strong hope within me that my death will be sanctified to the benefit   of my friends with this view and this view only beloved rupert i   wish you to remember it in all other respects let it be forgotten you   have found it impossible to command your affections and worlds would   not have tempted me to become your wife without possessing all your   heart i pray daily almost hourlytears had evidently blotted this   portion of the letterfor you and emily live together and make each   other happy she is a sweet girl has enjoyed advantages that clawbonny   could not bestow and which will contribute to your gratification in   order that you may sometimes think of mepoor grace was not aware of   this contradiction in her requestsmiles will send you a legacy that i   leave you accept it as a little fortune with emily i wish sincerely   it were much larger but you will not overlook the intention and forget   the insufficiency of the sum small as it is i trust it will enable you   to marry at once and lucys heart may be confided in for the rest    farewell ruperti do not say farewell emily for i think this   letter as well as its object had better remain a secret between you   and me and my brotherbut i wish your future wife all earthly   happiness and an end as full of hope as that which attends the   deathbed of your affectionate    grace wallingford  oh woman woman what are ye not when duly protected and left to the almost divine impulses of your generous natures what may ye not become when rendered mercenary and envious by too close a contact with those worldly interests which are never admitted to an ascendancy without destroying all your moral beauty    chapter vii      and the beautiful whose record   is the verse that cannot die   they too are gone with their glorious bloom   from the love of human eye    mrs hemans   i cannot dwell minutely on the events of the week that succeeded grace sunk daily hourly and the medical advice that was obtained more as a duty than with any hope of its benefiting the patient failed of assisting her mr hardinge saw the invalid often and i was admitted to her room each day where she would lie reclining on my bosom for hours at a time seemingly fond of this innocent indulgence of her affections on the eve of her final departure as it was out of the question that my sister should again visit the family room the causeuse was brought into her chamber where it was made to perform the office to which it had been several times devoted in its proper apartment since my return from sea that venerable chair still exists and i often pass thoughtful hours in it in my old age musing on the past and recalling the different scenes and conversations of which it could tell did it possess consciousness and the faculty of speech  mr hardinge officiated in his own church agreeably to his intention on the succeeding sunday lucy remained with her friend and i make no doubt their spirits devoutly communed with ours the while for i mastered sufficient fortitude to be present at st michaels i could observe an earnest sympathy in every member of the little congregation and tears fell from nearly every eye when the prayer for the sick was read mr hardinge remained at the rectory for the further duties of the day but i rode home immediately after morning service too uneasy to remain absent from the house longer than was necessary at such a moment as my horse trotted slowly homeward he overtook neb who was walking towards clawbonny with an air so different from his customary manner i could not help remarking it neb was a muscular active black and usually walked as if his legs were all springs but he moved along now so heavily that i could not but see some weight upon the spirits had produced this influence on the body the change was naturally enough attributed to the state of affairs with chloe and i felt disposed to say a word to my faithful slave who had been unavoidably overlooked in the pressure of sorrow that had weighed me down for the last ten days i spoke to the poor fellow as cheerfully as i could as i came up and endeavoured to touch on such subjects as i thought might interest without troubling him  this is a famous windfall that has crossed mr marbles track neb i said pulling up in order to go a short distance at an even pace with my brothertar as nice an old woman for a mother as pretty a little girl for a niece and as snug a haven to moor in at the end of the voyage as any old wornout seadog could or ought to wish  yes sir masser mile neb answered as i fancied in the manner of one who was thinking of something different from what he said yes sir mr marble a reglar seadog  and as such not the less entitled to have a good old mother a pretty niece and a snug home  no sir none de wuss for bin seadog all must allow nebberdeless masser mile i sometime wish you and i nebber hab see salt water  that is almost as much as wishing we never looked down the hudson from the hills and banks of clawbonny boy the river itself being salt not far below us you are thinking of chloe and fancying that had you stayed at home your chance of getting into her good graces would have been better  no masser mile no sir nobody at clawbonny tink just now of anyting but deat  i started in surprise mr hardinge kept everything like exaggeration and those physical excitements which it is so much the habit of certain sects to mistake for religious impulses even from the negroes of the clawbonny property nebs speech sounded more like an innovation of this nature than i had ever heard among my people and i looked hard at the fellow for an instant before i answered  i am afraid i understand you neb was my reply after a meaning pause it is a relief to me to find that my people retain all their affections for the children of their old master and mistress  we hardhearted indeed sir if we dont ah masser mile you and i see many dreadful ting togeder but we nebber see any ting like dis  nebs dark cheek was glistening with tears as he spoke and i spurred my horse lest my own manhood might give way there in the road and in the presence of those who were fast approaching why neb had expressed sorrow for having ever gone to sea i could not account for in any other manner than by supposing that he imagined grace was in some manner a sufferer by my absence from home  when i reached the house not a soul was visible the men had all gone to church and were to be seen in the distance coming along the road singly and in a melancholy manner not a sign of the customary thoughtless merriment of a negro escaping a single individual among them but it was usual for some of the black venuses to be seen sunning themselves at that season exhibiting their summer finery to each other and their admirers not one was now visible all the front of the house the lawn the kitchens of which there were no less than three and the kitchen yards in short every familiar haunt of the dwelling was deserted and empty this boded evil and throwing the bridle over a post i walked hurriedly towards the part of the building or buildings would be a better word inhabited by grace  as i entered the passage which communicated with my sisters own room the departure from ordinary appearances was explained six or seven of the negresses were kneeling near the door and i could hear the low solemn earnest voice of lucy reading some of the collects and other prayers suited to the sickchamber and to the wants of a parting soul lucys voice was music itself but never before had it sounded so plaintively sweet the lowest intonation was distinctly audible as if the dear devout creature felt that the being she addressed was not to be approached in any other manner while the trembling earnestness of the tones betrayed the depth of feeling with which each syllable escaped from the heart talk of liturgies impairing the fervour of prayer this may be the fact with those who are immersed in themselves while communing with god and cannot consent even to pray without placing their own thoughts and language however illdigested and crude uppermost in the business of the moment do not such persons know that as respects united worship their own prayers are to all intents and purposes a formulary to their listeners with the disadvantage of being received without preparation or direction to the mindnay too often substituting a critical and prurient curiosity for humble and intelligent prayer in these later times when christianity is reassuming the character of the quarrels of sects and as an old man who has lived and hopes to die in communion with the angloamerican church i do not wish to exculpate my own particular branch of the catholic body from blame but in these later times when christianity is returning to its truculency forgetful of the chiefest of virtues charity i have often recalled the scene of that solemn noontide and asked myself the question if any man could have heard lucy as i did on that occasion concluding with the petition which christ himself gave to his disciples as a comprehensive rule if not absolutely as a formulary and imagine the heart could not fully accompany words that had been previously prescribed  no sooner had lucys solemn tones ceased than i passed through the crowd of weeping and still kneeling blacks and entered my sisters room grace was reclining in an easy chair her eyes closed her hands clasped together but lying on her knees and her whole attitude and air proclaiming a momentary but total abstraction of the spirit i do not think she heard my footstep at all and i stood at her side an instant uncertain whether to let her know of my presence or not at this instant i caught the eye of lucy who seemed intent on the wish to speak to me grace had three or four small rooms that communicated with each other in her part of the dwelling and into one of these which served as a sort of boudoir though the name was then unknown in america i followed the dear girl whose speaking but sad look had bidden me do so  is my father near at hand lucy asked with an interest i did not understand since she must have known he intended to remain at his own residence in readiness for the afternoon service  he is not you forget he has to attend to evening prayers  i have sent for himmiles taking one of my hands in both her own with the tenderness a mother would manifest to a very dear child dear miles you must summon all your fortitude  is my sister worse i demanded huskily for prepared as i was for the result i was not expecting it by any means so soon  i cannot call it worse miles to be about to be called away to god in such a frame of mind but it is proper i should tell you all rather less than an hour since grace told me that the hour was at hand she has the knowledge of her approaching end though she would not let me send for you she said you would have ample time to witness it all for my father however i have sent and he must soon be here  almighty providence lucy do you really think we shall lose grace so soon  as it is the will of god to take her from us miles i can scarce repine that her end should be so easy and in all respects so tranquil  so long as memory is granted to me will the picture that lucy presented at that moment remain vividly impressed on my mind she loved grace as a most dear sister loved her as an affectionate generousminded devoted woman alone can love and yet so keenly was she alive to the nature of the communication it was her duty to make that concern for me alone reigned in her saddened and anxious eye her mind had schooled itself to bear its own grief and meek believing and disposed to foresee all that her profound faith taught her to hope i do believe she considered my sister a subject of envy rather than of regret though her solicitude on my account was so absorbing this generous selfdenial touched my feelings in more ways than one enabling me to command myself to a degree that might otherwise have been out of my power during the few succeeding hours i felt ashamed to manifest all i endured in the presence of so much meek but pious fortitude and that exhibited by one whose heart i so well knew to be the very seat of the best human affections the sad smile that momentarily illuminated lucys countenance as she gazed anxiously in my face when speaking was full of submissive hope and christian faith  gods will be done i rather whispered than uttered aloud heaven is a place more suited to such a spirit than the abodes of men  lucy pressed my hand and appeared relieved from a load of intense anxiety by this seeming fortitude she bade me remain where i was until she had herself apprized grace of my return from church i could see through the open door that the negresses had been directed to retire and presently i heard the footstep of mr hardinge approaching the room adjoining that in which i then was and which answered the purpose of a sort of antechamber for those who came to the sickroom from the more public side of the house i met my excellent old guardian in that apartment and lucy was at my side at the next instant one word from the last sufficed to keep us in this room while she returned to that of grace  god have mercy on us my dear boythe divine ejaculated as much in prayer as in griefand i say on us as well as on you for grace has ever been dear to me as a child of my own i knew the blow must come and have prayed the lord to prepare us all for it and to sanctify it to us old and young but notwithstanding death has come literally when no man knoweth i must have materials for writing miles and you will choose an express for me out of your people let the man be ready to mount in half an hour for i shall not require half that time to prepare my letter  medical advice is useless i am afraid dear sir i answered we have posts directions and very respectable attendance from our own family physician dr wurtz who gave me to understand several days since that he saw no other means of averting the evil we dread than those already adopted still sir i shall be easier if we can persuade dr bard to cross the river and have already thought of sending neb once more on that errand  do so returned mr hardinge drawing towards him a little table on which dr wurtz had written a few prescriptions that were used more for form i believe than any expectation of the good they could do and beginning to write even while talkingdo sohe addedand neb can put this letter in the postoffice on the eastern bank of the river which will be the quickest mode of causing it to reach rupert  rupert i exclaimed on a key that i instantly regretted  certainly we can do no less than send for rupert miles he has ever been like a brother to grace and the poor fellow would feel the neglect keenly did we overlook him on an occasion like this you seem astonished at my thinking of summoning him to clawbonny  rupert is at the springs sirhappy in the society of miss mertonwould it not be better to leave him where he is  what would you think miles were lucy on her deathbed and we should fail to let you know it  i gazed so wildly at the good old man i believe that even his simplicity could not avoid seeing the immense difference between the real and the supposititious case  very true poor miles very true mr hardinge added in an apologetic manner i see the weakness of my comparison though i was beginning to hope you were already regarding lucy once more with the eyes of a brother but rupert must not be forgotten neither and here is my letter already written  it will be too late sir i got out hoarselymy sister cannot survive the day  i perceived that mr hardinge was not prepared for this his cheek grew pale and his hand trembled as he sealed the epistle still he sent it as i afterwards discovered  gods will be done the excellent divine murmured if such should really be his holy will we ought not to mourn that another humble christian spirit is called away to the presence of its great creator rupert can at least attend to do honour to all that we can honour of the saint we lose  there was no resisting or contending with so much simplicity and goodness of heart and had it been in my power a summons to the room of grace called all my thoughts to her my sisters eyes were now open i shuddered felt a sinking of the heart like that produced by despair as i caught their unearthly or rather their supernatural expression it was not that anything which indicated death in its more shocking aspects met my look but simply that i could trace the illumination of a spirit that already felt itself on the eve of a new state of being and one that must at least separate all that remained behind from any further communication with itself i am not certain that i felt no pang at the thought my sister could be entirely happy without any participation on my part in her bliss we are all so selfish that it is hard to say how far even our most innocent longings are free from the taint of this feature of our nature  but grace herself could not entirely shake off the ties of kindred and human love so long as her spirit continued in its earthly tenement so far from this every glance she cast on one or all of us denoted the fathomless tenderness of her nature and was filled with its undying affection she was weak frightfully so i fancied for death appeared to hasten in order to release her as swiftly and easily as possible yet did her interest in me and in lucy sustain her sufficiently to enable her to impart much that she wished to say in obedience to a sign from her i knelt at her side and received her head on my bosom as near as possible in that attitude in which we had already passed hours since her illness mr hardinge hovered over us like a ministering spirit uttering in a suppressed and yet distinct voice some of the sublimest of those passages from scripture that are the most replete with consolation to the parting spirit as for lucy to me she seemed to be precisely in that spot where she was most wanted and often did graces eyes turn towards her with gleamings of gratitude and love  the hour is near brother grace whispered as she lay on my bosom remember i die asking forgiveness as much for those who may have done me wrong as for myself forget nothing that you have promised me do nothing to cause lucy and her father sorrow  i understand you sisterwas my low answer depend on all i have saidall you can wish  a gentle pressure of the hand was the token of contentment with which this assurance was received  from that moment it seemed to me that grace was less than usual attached to the things of the world nevertheless her interest in those she loved and who loved her continued to the last  let all the slaves that wish to see me enter grace said rousing herself to perform a trying but necessary duty i never can repay them for all they have done for me but i trust them to you miles with confidence  lucy glided from the room and in a few minutes the long train of dark faces was seen approaching the door the grief of these untutored beings like their mirth is usually loud and vociferous but lucy dear considerate energetic lucyenergetic even in the midst of a sorrow that nearly crushed her to the earthhad foreseen all this and the blacks were admitted only on the condition of their preserving a command over themselves in the interview  grace spoke to every one of the females taking leave of each calmly and with some useful and impressive admonition while all the older men were also noticed personally  go and rejoice that i am so soon released from the cares of this world she said when the sad ceremony was over pray for me and for yourselves my brother knows my wishes in your behalf and will see them executed god bless you my friends and have you in his holy keeping  so great was the ascendency lucy had obtained over these poor simple creatures during the short time they had been under her mild but consistent rule that each and all left the room as quiet as children awestruck by the solemnity of the scene still the oldest and most wrinkled of their cheeks were wet with tears and it was only by the most extraordinary efforts that they were enabled to repress the customary outbreakings of sorrow i had gone to a window to conceal my own feelings after this leavetaking when a rustling in the bushes beneath it caught my ear looking out there lay neb flat on his face his herculean frame extended at full length his hands actually gripping the earth under the mental agony he endured and yet the faithful fellow would not even utter a groan lest it might reach his young mistresss ears and disquiet her last moments i afterwards ascertained he had taken that post in order that he might learn from time to time by means of signs from chloe how things proceeded in the chamber above lucy soon recalled me to my old post grace having expressed a wish to that effect  it will be but an hour and we shall all be together again grace said startling us all by the clearness and distinctness of her enunciation the near approach of death places us on a height whence we can see the entire world and its vanities at a single view  i pressed the dying girl closer to my heart a species of involuntary declaration of the difficulty i experienced in regarding her loss with the religious philosophy she was inculcating  mourn not for me milesshe continuedyet i know you will mourn but god will temper the blow and in his mercy may cause it to profit you for ever  i did not could not answer i saw grace endeavouring to get a look at my countenance as if to observe the effect of the scene by my assistance she was so placed as to obtain her wish the sight i believe aroused feelings that had begun to yield to the influence of the last great change for when my sister spoke next it was with a tenderness of accent that proved how hard it for those who are deeply affectionate to lose their instincts  poor miles i almost wish we could go together you have been a dear good brother to mewhat a sweet consolation i afterwards found in these wordsit grieves me to leave you so nearly alone in the world but you will have mr hardinge and our lucy  the pause and the look that succeeded caused a slight tremour to pass over my frame graces eyes turned anxiously from me to the form of the kneeling and weeping lucy i fancied that she was about to express a wish or some regret in connection with us two that even at such a moment i could not have heard without betraying the concern it would give me she did not speak however though her look was too eloquent to be mistaken i ascribed the forbearance to the conviction that it would be too late lucys affections belonging to andrew drewett at that instant i had a bitter remembrance of nebs words of i sometime wish masser mile you and i nebber had see salt water but that was not the moment to permit such feelings to get the mastery and grace herself felt too clearly that her minutes were numbered to allow her mind to dwell on the subject  an almighty providence will direct everything for the best in this as in other things she murmured though it was still some little time i thought before her mind reverted to her own situation the welfare of two as much beloved as lucy and myself could not be a matter of indifference to one of graces disposition even in the hour of death  mr hardinge now knelt and the next quarter of an hour passed in prayer when the divine rose from his knees grace her countenance beaming with an angelic serenity gave him her hand and in a clear distinct voice she uttered a prayer for blessings connecting her petitions with the gratitude due him for his care of us orphans i never saw the old man so much touched before this unexpected benediction for it had that character coming from youth to age quite unmanned him the old man sunk into a chair weeping uncontrollably this aroused lucy who regarded the grey hairs of her father with awe as she witnessed the strength of his emotions but feelings of this nature could not long absorb a man like mr hardinge who soon regained as much of the appearance of composure as it was possible to maintain by such a deathbed  many may think me young to die grace observed but i am weary of the world it is my wish to submit myself to the will of god but blessed be his holy name that he sees fit to call me to him this day lucy beloved onego into the next room and draw the curtain asunder i shall then be enabled to gaze on the fields of dear clawbonny once more that will be my last look at the outer world  this leavetaking of inanimate things objects long known and loved is of frequent occurrence with the dying it is not in our natures to quit for ever this beautiful world without casting one longing lingering look behind the hand of its divine creator was gloriously impressed on the rural loveliness of my native fields that day and a holy tranquillity seemed to reign over the grain the orchards the meadows and the wooded heights the couch of grace was purposely placed at a point in her own chamber that commanded a wide view of the farm through the vista formed by the door and windows of the adjoining room here she had often sat during her confinement to her rooms contemplating scenes so familiar and so much loved i saw her lips quiver as she now gazed on them for the last time and was convinced some unusual sentiment connected with the past pressed on her feelings at that instant i could see the same view myself and perceived that her eyes were riveted on the little wood where rupert and i had met the girls on our return from sea a favourite place of resort and one that i doubted not had often been the witness of the early confidence between grace and her recreant lover death was actually hovering over that sainted being at the moment but her womans heart was not could not be insensible to the impressions produced by such a sight in vain the warm light from the heavens bathed the whole landscape in a flood of glory in vain the meadows put forth their flowers the woods their variegated bright american verdure and the birds their innocent gaiety and brilliant plumage the fancy of grace was portraying scenes that had once been connected with the engrossing sentiment of her life i felt her tremble as she lay in my arms and bending my head towards her in tender concern i could just distinguish the murmuring of a prayer that it was easy to understand was a petition offered up in behalf of rupert this done she asked herself to have the curtain drawn again to shut out the obtrusive thought for ever  i have often thought since the events of that sad day that graces dissolution was hastened by this accidental recurrence of her mind to rupert and his forgotten love i call it love though i question if a being so thoroughly selfish ever truly loved any one but himself perhaps not himself indeed in a way to entitle the feeling to so respectable an epithet grace certainly drooped the faster from that unfortunate moment it is true we all expected her death thought it would occur that day even though surprised at the suddenness with which it came at last but we did not expect it within an hour  and what an hour was that which succeeded both mr hardinge and lucy passed quite half of it on their knees engaged in silent prayer for it was thought petitions uttered aloud might disturb the sick there were minutes in which the stillness of the tomb already reigned among us i am not enough of a physician to say whether the change that now came over my sisters mind was the consequence of any shock received in that long intense look at the wood or whether it proceeded from the sinking of the system and was connected with that mysterious link which binds the immortal part of our being so closely to the material until the tie is loosened forever it is certain however that graces thoughts wandered and while they never lost entirely their leaning towards faith and a bright christian hope they became tinctured with something allied to childish simplicity if not absolutely to mental weakness nevertheless there was a moral beauty about grace that no failing of the faculties could ever totally eradicate  it was fully half an hour that the breathing quiet of prayer lasted in all that time my sister scarcely stirred her own hands being clasped together and her eyes occasionally lifted to heaven at length she seemed to revive a little and to observe external objects in the end she spoke  lucy dearest she said what has become of rupert does he know i am dying if so why does he not come and see me for the last time  it is scarcely necessary for me to say how much lucy and myself were startled at this question the former buried her face in her hands without making any reply but good mr hardinge altogether unconscious of anythings being wrong was eager to exculpate his son  rupert has been sent for my dear child he said and though he is engrossed with love and miss merton he will not fail to hasten hither the instant he receives my letter  miss merton repeated grace pressing both her hands on her templeswho is she i do not remember anybody of that name  we now understood that the mind of the dear patient was losing its powers of course no efforts were made to give a truer direction to her thoughts we could only listen and weep presently grace passed an arm round the neck of lucy and drew her towards her with a childish earnestness  lucy love she continuedwe will persuade these foolish boys from this notion of going to sea what if miless father and ruperts greatgrandfather were sailors it is no reason they should be sailors too  she paused appeared to meditate and turned towards me her head was still inclining on my bosom and she gazed upwards at my face as fondly as she did in that tender meeting we held just after my return home in the family room there was sufficient strength to enable her to raise her pallid but not emaciated hand to my face even while she passed it over my cheeks once more parting the curls on my temples and playing with my hair with infantile fondness  miles the dear angel whispered utterance beginning to fail herdo you remember what mother told us about always speaking the truth you are a manly boy brother and have too much pride to say anything but the truth i wish rupert were as frank  this was the first the last the only intimation i had ever heard from grace of her being conscious of any defect in ruperts character would to god she had seen this important deficiency earlier though this is wishing a child to possess the discernment and intelligence of a woman the hand was still on my cheek and i would not have had it removed at that bitter moment to have been well assured of lucys love  see my sister resumed though she now spoke merely in a whisperhow brown his cheek is though his forehead is white i doubt if mother would know him lucy is ruperts cheek as brown as this dear  rupert has not been as much exposed of late as miles lucy answered huskily graces arm still clinging to her neck  the wellknown voice appeared to awaken a new train of thought  lucy my sister asked are you as fond of miles as we both used to be when children  i have always had and shall ever retain a deep affection for miles wallingford lucy answered steadily  grace now turned towards me releasing her hold of lucys neck from pure inability to sustain it and she fastened her serene blue eyes on my countenance whence they never deviated while she breathed my tears were uncontrollable and they seemed to perplex rather that distress her of a sudden we heard her voice aloud speaking gently but with a fervour that rendered it distinct the words she uttered were full of the undying affection of a heart that never turned away from me for a single instant no not even in the petulance of childhood almighty father she said look down from thy mercyseat on this dear brotherkeep him for thyself and in thy good time call him through the saviours love to thy mansions of bliss  these were the last words that grace wallingford ever spoke she lived ten minutes longer and she died on my bosom like the infant that breathes its last in the arms of its mother her lips moved several times once i fancied i caught the name of lucy though i have reason to think she prayed for us all rupert included down to the moment she ceased to exist    chapter viii      there have been sweet singing voices   in your walks that now are still   there are seats left void in your earthly homes   which none again may fill    mrs hemans   i never saw the body of my sister after i handed it resembling a sleeping infant to the arms of lucy there is a sort of mania in some a morbid curiosity to gaze on the features of the dead but with me it has ever been the reverse i had been taken to the family room to contemplate and weep over the faces of both my parents but this was at an age when it became me to be passive i was now at a time of life when i might be permitted to judge for myself and as soon as i began to think at all on the subject which was not for some hours however i resolved that the last look of love the sweet countenance sinking in death it is true but still animate and beaming with the sentiments of her pure heart should be the abiding impression of my sisters form i have cherished it ever since and often have i rejoiced that i did not permit any subsequent images of a corpse to supplant it as respects both my parents the images left on my mind for years and years was painful rather than pleasing  graces body was no sooner out of my arms i had scarcely imprinted the last long kiss on the ivorylike but still warm forehead than i left the house clawbonny had no impertinent eyes to drive a mourner to his closet and i felt as if it were impossible to breathe unless i could obtain the freedom of the open air as i crossed the little lawn the wails from the kitchens reached me now that the invalid could no longer be disturbed by their lamentations the unsophisticated negroes gave vent to their feelings without reserve i heard their outcries long after every other sound from the house was lost on my ear  i held my way along the road with no other view but to escape from the scene i had just quitted and entered the very little wood which might be said to have been the last object of the external world that had attracted my sisters attention here everything reminded me of the past of the days of childhood and youth of the manner in which the four clawbonny children had lived together and roamed these very thickets in confidence and love i sat in that wood an hour a strange unearthly hour it seemed to me i saw graces angel countenance imprinted on the leaves heard her low but gay laugh as she was wont to let it be heard in the hours of happiness and the tones of her gentle voice sounded in my ears almost as familiarly as in life rupert and lucy were there too i saw them heard them and tried to enter into their innocent merriment as i had done of old but fearful glimpses of the sad truth would interpose in time to break the charm  when i left that little wood it was to seek a larger cover and fields farther removed from the house it was dark before i thought of returning all that time was passed in a species of mystical hallucination in which the mind was lost in scenes foreign to those actually present i saw graces sweet image everywhere i heard her voice at every turn now she was the infant i was permitted to drag in her little wagon the earliest of all my impressions of that beloved sister then she was following me as i trundled my hoop next came her little lessons in morals and warnings against doing wrong or some grave but gentle reproof for errors actually committed after which i saw her in the pride of young womanhood lovely and fitted to be loved the sharer of my confidence and one capable of entering into all my plans of life how often that day did the murmuring of a brook or the humming of a bee become blended in my imagination with the song the laugh the call or the prayers of that beloved sister whose spirit had ascended to heaven and who was no more to mingle in my concerns or those of life  at one time i had determined to pass the night abroad and commune with the stars each of which i fancied in turn as they began slowly to show themselves in the vault above might be the abidingplace of the departed spirit if i thought so much and so intensely of grace i thought also of lucy nor was good mr hardinge entirely forgotten i felt for their uneasiness and saw it was my duty to return neb and two or three others of the blacks had been looking for me in all directions but that in which i was and i felt a melancholy pleasure as i occasionally saw these simpleminded creatures meet and converse their gestures their earnestness their tears for i could see that they were often weeping indicated alike that they were speaking of their young mistress how they spoke i wanted no other communications to understand  ours had ever been a family of love my father manly affectionate and strongly attached to my mother was admirably suited to sustain that dominion of the heart which the last had established from her earliest days at clawbonny this power of the feelings had insensibly extended itself to the slaves who seldom failed to manifest how keenly alive they all were to the interests and happiness of their owners among the negroes there was but one who was considered as fallen below his proper level or who was regarded as an outcast this was an old fellow who bore the name of vulcan and who worked as a blacksmith on the skirts of the farm having been named by my grandfather with the express intention of placing him at the anvil this fellows trade caused him to pass most of his youth in an adjacent village or hamlet where unfortunately he had acquired habits that unsuited him to live as those around him were accustomed to live he became in a measure alienated from us drinking and otherwise living a life that brought great scandal on his sable connections who were gathered more closely around the homestead nevertheless a death or a return home or any important event in the family was sure to bring even vulcan back to his allegiance and for a month afterwards he would be a reformed man on this occasion he was one of those who were out in the fields and woods in quest of me and he happened to be the very individual by whom i was discovered  the awestruck solemn manner in which the reckless vulcan approached were all other proofs wanting would have proclaimed the weight of the blow that had fallen on clawbonny the eyes of this fellow were always red but it was easy to see that even he had been shedding tears he knew he was no favourite seldom came near me unless it were to excuse some of his neglects or faults and lived under a sort of ban for his constantly recurring misdeeds nevertheless a common cause of grief now gave him confidence and neb himself could hardly have approached me with a manner of more easy but respectful familiarity  ah masser mile masser mile vulcan exclaimed certain that we felt alike on this topic if on no other poor young missus when we ebber get noder like she  my sister is in heaven vulcan where i hope all at clawbonny blacks as well as whites will endeavour to meet her by living in a manner that will improve the mercy of god  you tink dat posserbul masser mile demanded the old man fixing his dull eyes on me with an earnest intentness that proved he had not entirely lost all sensibility to his moral condition  all things are possible with god vulcan keeping him and his commandments constantly in mind you may still hope to see your young mistress and to share in her happiness  wonnerful exclaimed the old man dat would be a great conserlation ah masser mile how often she come when a little lady to my shop door and ask to see e spark fly miss grace hab a great taste for blacksmitin and a great knowledge too i do tink dat next to some oder ting she lub to see iron redhot and e horse shod  you have come to look for me vulcan and i thank you for this care i shall return to the house presently you need give yourself no further trouble remember old man that the only hope that remains of either of us ever seeing miss grace again is in living as mr hardinge so often tells us all we ought to live  wonnerful repeated old vulcan whose mind and feelings were in a happy condition to receive such a lesson yes sah masser mile she come to my shop to see e spark flyi shall miss her like a darter  this was a specimen of the feelings that prevailed among the negroes though the impression on most of the others was more lasting than that made on the blacksmith whom i now dismissed taking the path myself that led to the house it was quite dark when i crossed the lawn a figure was just visible in the shadows of the piazza and i was on the point of turning in the direction of a side door in order to avoid the meeting when lucy advanced eagerly to the edge of the steps to receive me  oh milesdear miles how happy i am to see you again the precious girl said taking my hand with the warmth and frankness of a sister my father and myself have been very uneasy about you my father indeed has walked towards the rectory thinking you may have gone thither  i have been with you and grace and your father my good lucy ever since we parted i am more myself now however and you need feel no further concern on my account i thank you from the bottom of my heart for that which you have already felt and will give you no further concern  the manner in which lucy now burst into tears betrayed the intensity of the feelings that had been pent up in her bosom and the relief she found in my assurances she did not scruple even about leaning on my shoulder so long as the paroxysm lasted as soon as able to command herself however she wiped her eyes again took my hand with confiding affection looked anxiously towards me as she said soothingly  we have met with a great loss miles one that even time cannot repair neither of us can ever find another to fill the place that grace has occupied our lives cannot be lived over again we cannot return to childhood feel as children love as children live as children and grow up together as it might be with one heart with the same views the same wishes the same opinions i hope it is not presuming on too great a resemblance to the departed angel if i add the same principles  no lucy the past for us is gone for ever clawbonny will never again be the clawbonny it was  there was a pause during which i fancied lucy was struggling to repress some fresh burst of emotion  yet miles she presently resumed we could not ask to have her recalled from that bliss which we have so much reason to believe she is even now enjoying in a short time grace will be to you and me a lovely and grateful image of goodness and virtue and affection and we shall have a saddened perhaps but a deepfelt pleasure in remembering how much we enjoyed of her affection and how closely she was united to us both in life  that will be indeed a link between us two lucy that i trust may withstand all the changes and withering selfishness of the world  i hope it may miles lucy answered in a low voice and as i fancied at the moment with an embarrassment that i did not fail to attribute to the consciousness she felt of andrew drewetts claims on all such intimate association of feeling we who have known each other from children can scarcely want causes for continuing to esteem and to regard each other with affection  lucy now appeared to think she might trust me to myself and she led the way into the house i did not see her again until mr hardinge caused the whole household to be assembled at evening prayers the meeting of the family that night was solemn and mournful for myself i fancied that the spirit of grace was hovering around us more than once did i fancy that i heard her sweet voice mingling in the petitions or leading the service as was her practice on those occasions when our good guardian could not attend i observed all the negroes looking at me with solicitude like those who recognised my right to feel the blow the deepest it was a touching evidence of respectful interest that each man bowed to me reverently and each woman curtsied as he or she left the room as for chloe sobs nearly choked her the poor girl having refused to quit the body of her mistress except for that short moment i thought lucy would have remained with her father and myself for a few minutes but for the necessity of removing this poor heartstricken creature who really felt as if the death of her young mistress was a toss of part of her own existence  i have already dwelt on the circumstances attending the death of grace longer than i intended and shall now cease to harass my own feelings or to distress those of my readers by unnecessarily enlarging on more of the details the next three or four days produced the usual calm and though it was literally years ere lucy or myself ceased altogether to weep for her loss we both obtained the selfcommand that was necessary for the discharge of our ordinary duties grace it will be remembered died of a sunday about the usual hour for dinner agreeably to the custom of the country in which there is usually a little too much of an indecent haste in disposing of the dead owing in some degree to climate however the funeral would have taken place on wednesday and that would have been delaying twentyfour hours longer than might have been granted in most cases but mr hardinge who gave all the directions had named thursday noon as the hour for the interment we had few relatives to expect most of those who would have been likely to attend had circumstances admitted of it living in distant places that rendered it inconvenient and indeed scarcely possible  i passed most of the intervening time in my study reading and indulging in such contemplations as naturally suggest themselves to the mourner lucy dear girl had written me two or three short notes asking my wishes on various points among other things when i wished to pay a last visit to the body my answer to this question brought her to my room with some little surprise of manner for she had been so much with grace living and dead as to think it strange one who had loved her so well while living should not desire to take a final look at the beautiful remains i explained my feelings on this head and lucy seemed struck with them  i am not sure you will not have decided wisely miles she saidthe picture being one too precious to destroy you will be gratified in knowing however that grace resembles an angel quite as much in death as she did in life all who have seen her being struck with the air of peaceful tranquillity her features now present  bless youbless you lucythis is allsufficient i did wish for some such assurance and am now content  several of your family are in the house miles in readiness to attend the funeral a stranger has just arrived who seems to have some such desire too though his face is unknown to all at the place he has asked to see you with an earnestness that my father scarce knows how to refuse  let him come here then lucy i can only suppose it to be some one of the many persons grace has served her short life was all activity in that particular  lucys face did not corroborate that notion but she withdrew to let my decision be known in a few minutes a large hardfeatured but not illlooking man approaching fifty entered my room walked up to me with tears in his eyes squeezed my hand warmly and then seated himself without ceremony he was attired like a thriving countryman though his language accent and manner denoted one superior to the ordinary run of those with whom he was otherwise associated in externals i had to look at him a second time ere i could recognise jack wallingford my fathers bachelor cousin the western landholder  i see by your look cousin miles that you only half remember me my visitor remarked i deeply regret that i am obliged to renew our acquaintance on so melancholy an occasion  there are so few of us left mr wallingford that this kindness will be doubly appreciated i answered if i did not give orders to have you apprised of the loss we have all sustained it is because your residence is so far from clawbonny as to render it improbable you could have received the intelligence in time to attend the solemn ceremony that remains to be performed i did intend to write to you when a little better fitted to perform such a duty  i thank you cousin the blood and name of wallingford are very near and dear to me and clawbonny has always seemed a sort of home  the dear creature who now lies dead under its roof cousin john so considered you and you may be pleased to know that she wished me to leave you this property in my will the last time i went to sea as of the direct line a wallingford being the proper owner of clawbonny in that particular she preferred your claims to her own  ay this agrees with all i ever heard of the angel answered john wallingford dashing a tear from his eyes a circumstance that gave one a favourable opinion of his heart of course you refused and left the property to herself who had a better right to it  i did sir though she threatened to transfer it to you the moment it became hers  a threat she would have found it difficult to execute as i certainly would have refused to receive it we are half savages no doubt out west of the bridge but our lands are beginning to tell in the markets and we count already some rich men among us  this was said with a selfsatisfied manner that my cousin was a little too apt to assume when property became the subject of conversation i had occasion several times that day even to remark that he attached a high value to money though at the same time it struck me that most of his notions were just and honourable he quite worked his way into my favour however by the respect he manifested for clawbonny and all that belonged to it so deep was this veneration that i began to think of the necessity of making a new will in order to bequeath him the place in the event of my dying without heirs as i now imagined must sooner or later occur as lucy was not likely to be my wife no one else i fancied ever should be i had nearer relations than jack wallingford some of whom were then in the house cousinsgerman by both father and mother but they were not of the direct line and i knew that miles the first would have made this disposition of the place could he have foreseen events and had the law allowed it then grace had wished such an arrangement and i had a sad happiness in executing all the known wishes of my sister  the funeral did not occur until the day after the arrival of john wallingford who accidentally heard of the death that had occurred in the family and came uninvited to attend the obsequies as has been mentioned i passed most of the evening in the company of this relative with whom i became so much pleased as to request he would walk with me next day as second nearest of kin this arrangement as i had reason to know in the end gave great offence to several who stood one degree nearer in blood to the deceased though not of her name thus are we constitutedwe will quarrel over a grave even a moment that should lay open eternity to our view with all its immense consequences and accompaniments in order to vindicate feelings and passions that can only interest us as it might be for a day fortunately i knew nothing of the offence that was taken at the time nor did i see any of my kinsmen but john wallingford that evening his presence in my room being owing altogether to a certain selfpossession and an à plomb that caused him to do very much as he pleased in such matters  i rose on the following morning at a late hour and with a heaviness at the heart that was natural to the occasion it was a lovely summers day but all in and around clawbonny wore the air of a sunday the procession was to form at ten oclock and as i cast my eyes from my window i could see the negroes moving about on the lawns and in the lanes attired in their best but wearing no holiday faces it seemed to me to be a species of unnatural sabbath possessing all its solemnity its holy stillness its breathing calm but wanting in that solacing spirit of peace which is so apt to be imparted to the day of rest in the country most particularly at that season of the year several of the neighbours who did not belong to clawbonny were beginning to appear and i felt the necessity of dressing in order to be in readiness for what was to follow  i had eaten alone in my little study or library from the time my sister died and had seen no one since my return to the house the servants excepted besides my guardian lucy and john wallingford the last had taken a light supper with me the previous night but he was then breakfasting with the rest of the guests in the family eatingroom mr hardinge doing the honours of the house  as for myself i found my own little table prepared with its coffee and light meal as i had ordered before retiring it had two cups however and a second plate had been laid in addition to my own i pointed to this arrangement and demanded of the old whiteheaded houseservant who was inwaiting what it meant  miss lucy sahshe say she mean to breakfast wid masser mile dis mornin sah  even the accents of this negro were solemn and sad as he made this familiar explanation like those of a man who was conscious of having reached an hour and an occasion that called for peculiar awe i bade him let miss lucy know that i was in the study  ah masser mile added the old man with tears in his eyes as he left the room miss lucy e only young missus now sah  in a few minutes lucy joined me she was in deep black of course and that may have added to the appearance of paleness but no one could be deceived in the manner in which the dear girl had mourned and wept since we parted the subdued expression of her face gave it a peculiar sweetness and in spite of the absence of colour i thought as lucy advanced towards me both hands extended and a smile of anxious inquiry on her lips that she had never appeared more lovely i did not hesitate about pressing those hands with fervour and of kissing the warm though colourless cheek all this passed as it might have done between an affectionate brother and sister neither of us thinking i am persuaded of aught but the confidence and friendship of childhood  this is kind of you dear lucy i said as we took our seats at the little table my cousin john wallingford though a good man in the main is scarcely near enough or dear enough to be admitted at a time like this  i have seen him lucy repliedthe tremour in her voice showing how hard she found it to avoid melting in tears and rather like him i believe he was a favourite with mamma wallingford so lucy was accustomed to call my mother and that ought to be a high recommendation with us miles  i am disposed to like him and shall endeavour to keep up more intercourse with him than i have hitherto done it is as we begin to find ourselves alone in the world lucy that we first feel the necessity of counting blood and kin and of looking around us for support  alone you are not miles and never can be while i and my dear father live we are certainly nearer to you than any that now remain among your blood relatives you can neither suffer nor be happy without our partaking in the feelings  this was not said without an effort that much i could detect yet it was said firmly and in a way that left no doubt of its entire sincerity i even wished there had been less of nature and more of hesitation in the dear girls manner while she was endeavouring to assure me of the sympathy she felt in my happiness or unhappiness but the waywardness of a passion as tormenting and yet as delightful as love seldom leaves us just or reasonable  lucy and i then talked of the approaching ceremony each of us was grave and sorrowful but neither indulged in any outward signs of grief we knew the last sad offices were to be performed and had braced ourselves to the discharge of this melancholy duty it was not customary with the females of purely new york families of the class of the hardinges to be present at the performance of the funeral rites but lucy told me she intended to be in the little church and to share in as much of the religious offices as were performed within the building in a population as mixed as ours has become it is not easy to say what is and what is not now a national or state usage on such an occasion but i knew this was going farther than was usual for one of lucys habits and opinions and i expressed a little surprise at her determination  were it at any other funeral i would not be present miles she said the tremour of her voice sensibly increasing but i cannot divest myself of the idea that the spirit of grace will be hovering near that the presence of her more than sister will be acceptable whatever the providence of god may have ordered for the dear departed i know it will be grateful to myself to join in the prayers of the churchbesides i am not altogether without the womanly feeling of wishing to watch over the form of grace while it remains above ground and now miles brother friend graces brother or by whatever endearing term i may address you added lucy rising coming to my side of the table and taking my hand i have one thing to say that i alone can say for it would never suggest itself as necessary to my dear father  i looked earnestly at lucys sweet countenance and saw it was full of concerni had almost said of alarm  i believe i understand you lucy i answered though a sensation at the throat nearly choked merupert is here  he is miles i implore you to remember what would be the wishes of her who is now a saint in heavenwhat her entreaties her tears would implore of you had not god placed a barrier between us  i understand you lucywas the husky replyi do remember all you wish though that recollection is unnecessary i would rather not see him but never can forget that he is your brother  you will see as little of him as possible milesbless you bless you for this forbearance  i felt lucys hasty but warm kiss on my forehead as she quitted the room it seemed to me a seal of a compact between us that was far too sacred ever to allow me to dream of violating it  i pass over the details of the funeral procession this last was ordered as is usual in the country the friends following the body in vehicles or on horseback according to circumstances john wallingford went with me agreeably to my own arrangement and the rest took their places in the order of consanguinity and age i did not see rupert in the procession at all though i saw little beside the hearse that bore the body of my only sister when we reached the churchyard the blacks of the family pressed forward to bear the coffin into the building mr hardinge met us there and then commenced those beautiful and solemn rites which seldom fail to touch the hardest heart the rector of st michaels had the great excellence of reading all the offices of the church as if he felt them and on this occasion the deepest feelings of the heart seemed to be thrown into his accents i wondered how he could get on but mr hardinge felt himself a servant of the altar standing in his masters house and ready to submit to his will under such circumstances it was not a trifle that could unman him the spirit of the divine communicated itself to me i did not shed a tear during the whole of the ceremony but felt myself sustained by the thoughts and holy hopes that ceremony was adapted to inspire i believe lucy who sat in a far corner of the church was sustained in a similar manner for i heard her low sweet voice mingling in the responses lip service let those who would substitute their own crude impulses for the sublime rites of our liturgy making ill digested forms the supplanter of a ritual carefully and devoutly prepared listen to one of their own semiconversational addresses to the almighty over a grave and then hearken to these venerable rites and learn humility such men never approach sublimity or the sacred character that should be impressed on a funeral ceremony except when they borrow a fragment here and there from the very ritual they affect to condemn in their eagerness to dissent they have been guilty of the weakness of dissenting so far as forms are concerned from some of the loftiest most comprehensive most consolatory and most instructive passages of the inspired book  it was a terrible moment when the first clod of the valley fell on my sisters coffin god sustained me under the shock i neither groaned nor wept when mr hardinge returned the customary thanks to those who had assembled to assist me in burying my dead out of my sight i had even sufficient fortitude to bow to the little crowd and to walk steadily away it is true that john wallingford very kindly took my arm to sustain me but i was not conscious of wanting any support i heard the sobs of the blacks as they crowded around the grave which the men among them insisted on filling with their own hands as if miss grace could only rest with their administration to her wants and i was told not one of them left the spot until the place had resumed all the appearance of freshness and verdure which it possessed before the spade had been applied the same roses removed with care were restored to their former beds and it would not have been easy for a stranger to discover that a newmade grave lay by the side of those of the late captain miles wallingford and his muchrespected widow still it was known to all in that vicinity and many a pilgrimage was made to the spot within the next fortnight the young maidens of the adjoining farms in particular coming to visit the grave of grace wallingford the lily of clawbonny as she had once been styled    chapter ix      i knew that we must partno power could save   thy quiet goodness from an early grave   those eyes so dull though kind each glance they cast   looking a sisters fondness to the last   thy lips so pale that gently pressd my cheek   thy voicealas thou couldst but try to speak   all told thy doom i felt it at my heart   the shaft had strucki knew that we must part    sprague   it is not easy to describe the sensation of loss that came over me after the interment of my sister it is then we completely feel the privation with which we have met the body is removed from out of our sight the places that knew them shall know them no more there is an end to all communion even by the agency of sight the last of the senses to lose its hold on the departed and a void exists in the place once occupied i felt all this very keenly for more than a month but most keenly during the short time i remained at clawbonny the task before me however will not allow me to dwell on these proofs of sorrow nor do i know that the reader could derive much advantage from their exhibition  i did not see rupert at the funeral that he was there i knew but either he himself or lucy for him had managed so well as not to obtrude his person on my sight john wallingford who well knew my external or visible relation to all the hardinges thinking to do me a pleasure mentioned as the little procession returned to the house that young mr hardinge had by dint of great activity succeeded in reaching clawbonny in time for the funeral i fancy that lucy under the pretence of wishing his escort contrived to keep her brother at the rectory during the time i was abroad  on reaching the house i saw all my connexions and thanked them in person for this proof of their respect for the deceased this little duty performed all but john wallingford took their leave and i was soon left in the place alone with my bachelor cousin what a house it was and what a house it continued to be as long as i remained at clawbonny the servants moved about it stealthily the merry laugh was no longer heard in the kitchen even the heavyfooted seemed to tread on air and all around me appeared to be afraid of disturbing the slumbers of the dead never before nor since have i had occasion to feel how completely a negative may assume an affirmative character and become as positive as if it had a real existence i thought i could see as well as feel my sisters absence from the scene in which she had once been so conspicuous an actor  as none of the hardinges returned to dinner the good divine writing a note to say he would see me in the evening after my connexions had withdrawn john wallingford and myself took that meal tête à tête my cousin with the apparent motive of diverting my thoughts from dwelling on the recent scene began to converse on subjects that he was right in supposing might interest me instead of flying off to some topic so foreign to my feelings as constantly to recall the reason he judiciously connected the theme with my loss  i suppose you will go to sea again as soon as your ship can be got ready cousin miles he commenced after we were left with the fruit and wine these are stirring times in commerce and the idle man misses golden opportunities  gold has no longer any charm for me cousin john i answered gloomily i am richer now than is necessary for my wants and as i shall probably never marry i see no great use in toiling for more still i shall go out in my own ship and that as soon as possible here i would not pass the summer for the place and i love the sea yes yes i must make a voyage to some part of europe without delay it is the wisest thing i can do  that is hearty and like a man there is none of your mopes about the wallingfords and i believe you to be of the true stock but why never marry miles your father was a sailor and he married and a very good time ive always understood he had of it  my father was happy as a husband and did i imitate his example i should certainly marry too nevertheless i feel i am to be a bachelor  in that case what will become of clawbonny demanded jack wallingford bluntly  i could not avoid smiling at the question as i deemed him my heir though the law would give it to nearer relatives who were not of the name but it is probable that john knowing himself to be so much my senior had never thought of himself as one likely to outlive me  i shall make a new will the instant i get to town and leave clawbonny to you i answered steadily and truly for such a thought had come into my mind the instant i saw him you are the person best entitled to inherit it and should you survive me yours it shall be  miles i like that exclaimed my cousin with a strange sincerity stretching out a hand to receive mine which he pressed most warmly you are very right i ought to be the heir of this place should you die without children even though you left a widow  this was said so naturally and was so much in conformity with my own notions on the subject that it did not so much offend as surprise me i knew john wallingford loved money and all men having a very respectful attachment to the representative of value such a character invariably means that the party named suffers that attachment to carry him too far i wished therefore my kinsman had not made just such a speech though it in no manner shook my intentions in his favour  you are more ready to advise your friends to get married than to set the example i answered willing to divert the discourse a little you who must be turned of fifty are still a bachelor  and so shall i remain through life there was a time i might have married had i been rich and now i am reasonably rich i find other things to employ my affections still that is no reason you should not leave me clawbonny though it is not probable i shall ever live to inherit it notwithstanding it is family property and ought not to go out of the name i was afraid if you were lost at sea or should die of any of those outlandish fevers that sailors sometimes take the place would get into females and there would no longer be a wallingford at clawbonny miles i do not grudge you the possession of the property the least in the world but it would make me very unhappy to know one of those hazens or morgans or vanderschamps had it jack had mentioned the names of the children of so many miss wallingfords aunts or greataunts of mine and cousins of his ownsome of them may be nearer to you by a halfdegree or so but none of them are as near to clawbonny it is wallingford land and wallingford land it ought to remain  i was amused in spite of myself and felt a disposition now to push the discourse further in order better to understand my kinsmans character  should neither of us two marry i said and both die bachelors what would then be the fate of clawbonny  i have thought of all that miles and here is my answer should such a thing happen and there be no other wallingford left then no wallingford would live to have his feelings hurt by knowing that a vanderdunderschamp or whatever these dutchmen ought to be called is living in his fathers house and no harm would be done but there are wallingfords besides you and me  this is quite new for i had supposed we two were the last  not so miles the first left two sons our ancestor the eldest and one younger who removed into the colony of new jersey and whose descendants still exist the survivors of us two might go there in quest of our heir in the long run but do not forget i come before these jersey blues let them be who or what they may  i assured my kinsman he should come before them and changed the discourse for to own the truth the manner in which he spoke began to displease me making my apologies i retired to my own room while john wallingford went out professedly with the intention of riding over the place of his ancestors with a view to give it a more critical exanimation than it had hitherto been in his power to do  it was quite dark when i heard the arrival of the hardinges as the carriage of lucy drove up to the door in a few minutes mr hardinge entered the study he first inquired after my health and manifested the kind interest he had ever taken in my feelings after which he proceeded  rupert is here he said and i have brought him over to see you both he and lucy appeared to think it might be well not to disturb you tonight but i knew you better who should be at your side at this bitter moment my dear miles if it be not rupert your old friend and playmate your fellow truant as one might say and almost your brother  almost my brother still i commanded myself grace had received my solemn assurances and so had lucy and rupert had nothing to apprehend i even asked to see him desiring at the same time that it might be alone i waited several minutes for ruperts appearance in vain at length the door of my room opened and chloe brought me a note it was from lucy and contained only these wordsmiles for her sake for mine command yourself dear creature she had no reason to be alarmed the spirit of my sister seemed to me to be present and i could recall every expression of her angelcountenance as it had passed before my eyes in the different interviews that preceded her death  at length rupert appeared he had been detained by lucy until certain her note was received when she permitted him to quit her side his manner was full of the consciousness of undeserving and its humility aided my good resolutions had he advanced to take my hand had he attempted consolation had he in short behaved differently in the main from what he actually did i cannot say what might have been the consequences but his deportment at first was quiet respectful distant rather than familiar and he had the tact or grace or caution not to make the smallest allusion to the sad occasion which had brought him to clawbonny when i asked him to be seated he declined the chair i offered a sign he intended the visit to be short i was not sorry and determined at once to make the interview as much one of business as possible i had a sacred duty confided to me and this might be as fit an occasion as could offer in which to acquit myself of the trust  i am glad so early an opportunity has offered mr hardinge i said as soon as the opening civilities were over to acquaint you with an affair that has been entrusted to me by grace and which i am anxious to dispose of as soon as possible  by graceby miss wallingford exclaimed rupert actually recoiling a step in surprise if not absolutely in alarmi shall feel honouredthat is shall have a melancholy gratification in endeavouring to execute any of her wishes no person commanded more of my respect mr wallingford and i shall always consider her one of the most amiable and admirable women with whom it was ever my happy fortune to be acquainted  i had no difficulty now in commanding myself for it was easy to see rupert scarce knew what he said with such a man i saw no great necessity for using extraordinary delicacy or much reserve  you are doubtless aware of two things in our family history i continued therefore without circumlocution one that my sister would have been mistress of a small fortune had she reached the term of twentyone years and the other that she died at twenty  ruperts surprise was now more natural and i could see that his interestshame on our propensities for itwas very natural too  i am aware of both and deeply deplore the last he answered  being a minor she had it not in her power to make a will but her requests are legal legacies in my eyes and i stand pledged to her to see them executed she has left rather less than 22000 in all with 500 of this money i am to present lucy with some suitable memorial of her departed friend some small charitable dispositions are also to be made and the balance or the round sum of 20000 is to be given to you  to me mr wallingfordmilesdid you really say to me  to you mr hardingesuch is my sisters earnest requestand this letter will declare it as from herself i was to hand you this letter when acquainting you with the bequest i put graces letter into ruperts hand as i concluded and i sat down to write while he was reading it though employed at a desk for a minute or two i could not avoid glancing at rupert in order to ascertain the effect of the last words of her he had once professed to love i would wish not to be unjust even to rupert hardinge he was dreadfully agitated and he walked the room for some little time without speaking i even fancied i overheard a halfsuppressed groan i had the compassion to affect to be engaged in order to allow him to recover his selfpossession this was soon done as good impressions were not lasting in rupert and i knew him so well as soon to read in his countenance gleanings of satisfaction at the prospect of being master of so large a sum at the proper moment i arose and resumed the subject  my sisters wishes would be sacred with me i said even had she not received my promise to see them executed when a thing of this character is to be done the sooner it is done the better i have drawn a note at ten days payable at the bank of new york and in your favour for 20000 it will not inconvenience me to pay it when due and that will close the transaction  i am not certain wallingford that i ought to receive so large a sumi do not know that my father or lucy or indeed the world would altogether approve of it  neither your father nor lucy nor the world will know anything about it sir unless you see fit to acquaint them i shall not speak of the bequest and i confess that on my sisters account i should prefer that you would not  well mr hardinge answered rupert coolly putting the note into his wallet i will think of this request of poor graces and if i can possibly comply with her wishes i will certainly do so there is little that she could ask that i would deny and my effort will be to honour her memory as i see you are distressed i will now retire you shall know my determination in a few days  rupert did retire taking my note for 20000 with him i made no effort to detain him nor was i sorry to hear he had returned to the rectory to pass the night whither his sister went with him the next day he proceeded to new york without sending me any message retaining the note however and a day or two later i heard of him on his way to the springs to rejoin the party of the mertons  john wallingford left me the morning of the day after the funeral promising to see me again in town do no forget the will miles said that singular man as he shook my hand and be certain to let me see that provision in it about clawbonny before i go west of the bridge again between relations of the same name there should be no reserves in such matters  i scarce knew whether to smile or to look grave at so strange a request but i did not change my determination on the subject of the will itself feeling that justice required of me such a disposition of the property i confess there were moments when i distrusted the character of one who could urge a claim of this nature in so plain a manner and that too at an instant when the contemplated contingency seemed the more probable from the circumstance that death had so recently been among us notwithstanding there was so much frankness in my kinsmans manner he appeared to sympathize so sincerely in my loss and his opinions were so similar to my own that these unpleasant twinges lasted but for brief intervals on the whole my opinion was very favourable to john wallingford and as will be seen in the sequel he soon obtained my entire confidence  after the departure of all my kindred i felt indeed how completely i was left alone in the world lucy passed the night at the rectory to keep her brother company and good mr hardinge though thinking he remained with me to offer sympathy and consolation found so many demands on his time that i saw but little of him it is possible he understood me sufficiently well to know that solitude and reflection while the appearance of the first was avoided were better for one of my temperament than any set forms of condolence at any rate he was at hand while he said but little to me on the subject of my loss  at last i got through the day and a long and dreary day it was to me the evening came bland refreshing bringing with it the softer light of a young moon i was walking on the lawn when the beauty of the night brought grace and her tastes vividly to my mind and by a sudden impulse i was soon swiftly walking towards her now silent grave the highways around clawbonny were never much frequented but at this hour and so soon after the solemn procession it had so lately seen no one was met on the road towards the churchyard it was months indeed after the funeral that any of the slaves ventured into the latter by night and even during the day they approached it with an awe that nothing could have inspired but the death of a wallingford perhaps it was owing to my increased age and greater observation but i fancied that these simple beings felt the death of their young mistress more than they had felt that of my mother  st michaels churchyard is beautifully ornamented with flourishing cedars these trees had been cultivated with care and formed an appropriate ornament for the place a fine cluster of them shaded the graves of my family and a rustic seat had been placed beneath their branches by order of my mother who had been in the habit of passing hours in meditation at the grave of her husband grace and i and lucy had often repaired to the same place at night after my mothers death and there we used to sit many an hour in deep silence or if utterance were given to a thought it was in a respectful whisper as i now approached this seat i had a bitter satisfaction in remembering that rupert had never accompanied us in these pious little pilgrimages even in the day of her greatest ascendancy grace had been unable to enlist her admirer in an act so repugnant to his innate character as for lucy her own family lay on one side of that cluster of cedars as mine lay on the other and often had i seen the dear young creature weeping as her eyes were riveted on the graves of relatives she had never known but my mother had been her mother and for this friend she felt an attachment almost as strong as that which was entertained by ourselves i am not certain i ought not to say an attachment quite as strong as our own  i was apprehensive some visitors might be hovering near the grave of my sister at that witching hour and i approached the cedars cautiously intending to retire unseen should such prove to be the case i saw no one however and proceeded directly to the line of graves placing myself at the foot of the freshest and most newly made hardly was this done when i heard the word miles uttered in a low halfstifled exclamation it was not easy for me to mistake the voice of lucy she was seated so near the trunk of a cedar that her dark dress had been confounded with the shadows of the tree i went to the spot and took a seat at her side  i am not surprised to find you here i said taking the dear girls hand by a sort of mechanical mode of manifesting affection which had grown up between us from childhood rather than from any sudden impulseyou that watched over her so faithfully during the last hours of her existence  ah miles returned a voice that was filled with sadness how little did i anticipate this when you spoke of grace in the brief interview we had at the theatre  i understood my companion fully lucy had been educated superior to cant and false morals her father drew accurate and manly distinctions between sin and the exactions of a puritanical presumption that would set up its own narrow notions as the law of god and innocent as she was no thought of error was associated with the indulgence of her innocent pleasures but grace suffering and in sorrow while she herself had been listening to the wonderful poems of shakspeare did present a painful picture to her mind which so far from being satisfied with what she had done in my sisters behalf was tenderly reproachful on account of fancied omissions  it is the will of god lucy i answered it must be our effort to be resigned  if you can think thus miles how much easier ought it to be for me and yet  yet what lucy i believe you loved my sister as affectionately as i did myself but i am sensitive on this point and tender true warm as i know your heart to be i cannot allow that even you loved her more  it is not that milesit is not that have i no cause of particular regretno sense of shameno feeling of deep humility to add to my grief for her loss  i understand you lucy and at once answer no you are not rupert any more than rupert is you let all others become what they may you will ever remain lucy hardinge  i thank you miles answered my companion gently pressing the hand that still retained hers and thank you from my heart but your generous nature will not sae this matter as others might we were aliens to your blood dwellers under your own roof received into the bosom of your own family and were bound by every sacred obligation to do you no wrong i would not have my dear upright father know the truth for worlds  he never will know it lucy and it is my earnest desire that we all forget it henceforth rupert and i must be strangers though the tie that exists between me and the rest of your family will only be drawn the closer for this sad event  rupert is my brother lucy answered though it was in a voice so low that her words were barely audible  you would not leave me quite alone in the world i said with something like reproachful energy  no miles nothat tie as you have said must and should last for life nor do i wish you to regard rupert as of old it is impossibleimproper evenbut you can concede to us some of that same indulgence which i am so willing to concede to you  certainlyrupert is your brother as you say and i do not wish you ever to regard him otherwise he will marry emily merton and i trust he may be happy here over my sisters grave lucy i renew the pledge already made to you never to act on what has occurred  i got no answer to this declaration in words but lucy would actually have kissed my hand in gratitude had i permitted it this i could not suffer however but raised her own hand to my lips where it was held until the dear girl gently withdrew it herself  miles lucy said after a long and thoughtful pause it is not good for you to remain at clawbonny just at this time your kinsman john wallingford has been here and i think you like him why not pay him a visit he resides near niagara west of the bridge3 as he calls it and you might take the opportunity of seeing the falls    footnote 3 in the western part of the state of new york there are   several small lakes that lie nearly parallel to each other and not far   asunder with lengths that vary from fifteen to forty miles the outlet   of one of these lakesthe cayugalies in the route of the great   thoroughfare to buffalo and a bridge of a mile in length was early   thrown across it from this circumstance has arisen the expression of   saying west of the bridge meaning the frontier counties which   include amongother districts that which is also known as the   genessee country  i understand you lucy and am truly grateful for the interest you feel in my happiness i do not intend to remain long at clawbonny which i shall leave tomorrow  tomorrow interrupted lucy and i thought like one who was alarmed  does that appear too early i feel the necessity of occupation as well as of a change of scene you will remember i have a ship and interests of moment to myself to care for i must turn my face and move towards the east instead of towards the west  you intend then miles to pursue this profession of yours lucy said as i thought with a little like gentle regret in her manner and tones  certainlywhat better can i do i want not wealth i allow am rich enough already for all my wants but i have need of occupation the sea is to my liking i am still young and can afford a few more years on the water i shall never marry lucy startedand having now no heir nearer than john wallingford  john wallingfordyou have cousins much nearer than he  that is true but not of the old line it was graces wish that i should leave our cousin john the clawbonny property at least whatever i do with the rest you are so rich now as not to need it lucy else would i leave every shilling to you  i believe you would dear miles answered lucy with fervent warmth of manner you have ever been all that is good and kind to me and i shall never forget it  talk of my kindness to you lucy when you parted with every cent you had on earth to give me the gold you possessed on my going to sea i am almost sorry you are now so much richer than myself else would i certainly make you my heir  we will not talk of money any longer in this sacred place lucy answered tremulously what i did as a foolish girl you will forget we were but children then miles  so lucy did not wish me to remember certain passages in our earlier youth doubtless her present relations to andrew drewett rendered the recollection delicate if not unpleasant i thought this less like herself than was her wontlucy who was usually so simpleminded so affectionate so frank and so true nevertheless love is an engrossing sentiment as i could feel in my own case and it might be that its jealous sensitiveness took the alarm at even that which was so innocent and sincere the effect of these considerations added to that of lucys remark was to change the discourse and we conversed long in melancholy sadness of her we had lost for this life altogether  we may live ourselves to grow old miles lucy observed but never shall we cease to remember grace as she was and to love her memory as we loved her dear self in life there has not been an hour since her death that i have not seen her sitting at my side and conversing in sisterly confidence as we did from infancy to the day she ceased to live  as lucy said this she rose drew her shawl around her and held out her hand to take leave for i had spoken of an intention to quit clawbonny early in the morning the tears the dear girl shed might have been altogether owing to our previous conversation or i might have had a share in producing them lucy used to weep at parting from me as well as grace and she was not a girl to change with the winds but i could not part thus i had a sort of feeling that when we parted this time it would virtually be a final separation as the wife of andrew drewett never could be exactly that which lucy hardinge had now been to me for near twenty years  i will not say farewell now lucy i observed should you not come to town before i sail i will return to clawbonny to take leave of you god only knows what will become of me or whither i shall be led and i could wish to defer the leavetakings to the last moment you and your excellent father must have my final adieus  lucy returned the pressure of my hand uttered a hasty goodnight and glided through the little gate of the rectory which by this time we had reached no doubt she fancied i returned immediately to my own house so far from this however i passed hours alone in the churchyard sometimes musing on the dead and then with all my thoughts bent on the living i could see the light in lucys window and not till that was extinguished did i retire it was long past midnight  i passed hours teeming with strange emotions among hose cedars twice i knelt by graces grave and prayed devoutly to god it seemed to me that petitions offered in such a place must be blessed i thought of my mother of my manly spirited father of grace and of all the past then i lingered long beneath lucys window and in spite of this solemn visit to the graves of the dead the brightest and most vivid image that i carried away with me was of the living    chapter x      shy three thousand ducatswell   bass ay sir for three months   shy for three monthswell   bass for the which as i told you antonio shall become bound   shy antonio shall become boundwell    merchant of venice   i found john wallingford in town awaiting my appearance he had taken lodgings at the city hotel on purpose to be under the same roof with me and we occupied adjoining rooms i dined with him and after dinner he went with me to take a look at the dawn the secondmate told me that marble had made a flying visit to the ship promised to be back again in a few days and disappeared by comparing dates i ascertained that he would be in time to meet the mortgage sale and felt no further concern in that behalf  miles said john wallingford coolly as we were walking up pine street on our way back towards the tavern did you not tell me you employed richard harrison as a legal adviser  i did mr hardinge made me acquainted with him and i understand he is one of the oldest lawyers in the country that is his office on the other side of the streethere directly opposite  i saw it and that was the reason i spoke it might be well just to step in and give some directions about your will i wish to see clawbonny put in the right line if you would give me a deed of it for one dollar i would not take it from you the only son of an eldest son but it would break my heart to hear of its going out of the name mr harrison is also an old adviser andfriend of mine  i was startled with this plaindealing yet there was something about the manner of the man that prevented my being displeased  mr harrison would not be visible at this hour but i will cross to the office and write him a letter on the subject i answered doing as i said on the instant and leaving john wallingford to pursue his way to the house alone the next day however the will was actually drawn up executed and placed in my cousins hands he being the sole executor if the reader should ask me why i did this especially the last i might be at a loss to answer a strange confidence had come over me as respects this relative whose extraordinary frankness even a more experienced man might have believed to be either the height of honesty or the perfection of art whichever was the case i not only left my will with him but in the course of the next week i let him into the secret of all my pecuniary affairs graces bequest to rupert alone excepted john wallingford encouraged this confidence telling me that plunging at once heart and hand into the midst of business was the most certain mode of forgetting my causes of sorrow plunge into anything with my whole heart i could not then though i endeavoured to lose my cares in business  one of my first acts in the way of affairs was to look after the note i had given to rupert it had been made payable at the bank where i kept my deposits and i went thither to inquire if it had been left for collection the following conversation passed between myself and the cashier on this occasion  good morning mr i said saluting the gentleman i have come to inquire if a note for 20000 made by me in favour of rupert hardinge esquire at ten days has been left for collection if so i am ready to pay it now  the cashier gave me a business smileone that spoke favourably of my standing as a moneyed manbefore he answered the question this smile was also a sign that money was plenty  not absolutely for collection captain wallingford as nothing would give us more pleasure than to renew it if you would just go through the form of obtaining a city endorser  mr hardinge has then left it for collection i observed pained in spite of all that had passed at ruperts giving this conclusive evidence of the inherent meanness of his character  not exactly for collection sir was the cashiers answer for wishing to anticipate the money by a few days and being under the necessity of leaving town we discounted it for him  anticipateyou have discounted the note sir  with the greatest pleasure knowing it to be good mr hardinge remarked that you had not found it convenient to draw for so large a sum on the spot and had given this note at short date and the consideration having been received in full he was desirous of being put in cash at once we did not hesitate of course  consideration received in full escaped me spite of a determination to be cool but luckily the appearance of another person on business prevented the words or the manner from being noted well mr cashier i will draw a check and take up the note now  more smiles followed the check was given the note was cancelled and handed to me and i left the bank with a balance in my favour of rather more than 10000 instead of the 30000 odd which i had held previously to entering it it is true i was heir at law to all graces assets which mr hardinge had handed over to me the morning i left clawbonny duly assigned and transferred these last consisted of stocks and of bonds and mortgages drawing interest being on good farms in our own county  well miles what do you mean to do with your ship demanded jack wallingford that evening i understand the freight for which you bargained has been transferred to another owner on account of your late troubles and they tell me freights just now are not very high  really cousin jack i am hardly prepared to answer the question colonial produce commands high prices in the north of germany they tell me and were i in cash i would buy a cargo on my own account some excellent sugars and coffees c were offered me today quite reasonably for ready money  and how much cash would be necessary to carry out that scheme my man  some 50000 more or less while i have but about 10000 on hand though i can command 20000 additional by selling certain securities so i must abandon the notion  that does not follow necessarily let me think a night on it and we will talk further in the morning i like quick bargains but i like a cool head this hot town and old madeira keep me in a fever and i wish a nights rest before i make a bargain  the next morning john wallingford returned to the subject at breakfast which meal we took by ourselves in order to be at liberty to converse without any auditors  i have thought over that sweet subject the sugars miles commenced my cousin and approve of the plan can you give me any further security if i will lend you the money  i have some bonds and mortgages to the amount of twentytwo thousand dollars with me which might be assigned for such a purpose  but 22000 are an insufficient security for the 30000 or 35000 which you may need to carry out your adventure  that is quite true but i have nothing else worth mentioningunless it be the ship or clawbonny  tut for the shipshe is gone if you and your cargo go and as for insurances i want none of themi am a landed man and like landed securities give me your note at three months or six months if you will with the bonds and mortgages you mention and a mortgage on clawbonny and you can have 40000 this very day should you need them  i was surprised at this offer having no notion my kinsman was rich enough to lend so large a sum on a further conversation however i learned he had near double the sum he had mentioned in ready money and that his principal business in town was to invest in good city securities he professed himself willing however to lend me half in order to help along a kinsman he liked i did not at all relish the notion of mortgaging clawbonny but john soon laughed and reasoned me out of that as for graces securities i parted with them with a sort of satisfaction the idea of holding her effects being painful to me  were it out of the family or even out of the name i should think something of it myself miles he said but a mortgage from you to me is like one from me to you you have made me your heir and to be honest with you boy i have made you mine if you lose my money you lose your own  there was no resisting this my kinsmans apparent frankness and warmth of disposition overcame all my scruples and i consented to borrow the money on his own terms john wallingford was familiar with the conveyancing of real estate and with his own hand he filled up the necessary papers which i signed the money was borrowed at 5 per cent my cousin positively refusing to receive the legal rate of interest from a wallingford payday was put at six months distance and all was done in due form  i shall not put this mortgage on record miles jack wallingford remarked as he folded and endorsed the paper i have too much confidence in your honesty to believe it necessary you have given one mortgage on clawbonny with too much reluctance to render it probable you will be in a hurry to execute another as for myself i own to a secret pleasure in having even this incomplete hold on the old place which makes me feel twice as much of a wallingford as i ever felt before  for my part i wondered at my kinsmans family pride and i began to think i had been too humble in my own estimate of our standing in the world it is true it was not easy to deceive myself in this particular and in point of fact i was certainly right but when i found a man who was able to lend 40000 at an hours notice valuing himself on coming from miles the first i could not avoid fancying miles the first a more considerable personage than i had hitherto imagined as for the money i was gratified with the confidence john wallingford reposed in me had really a wish to embark in the adventure for which it supplied the means and regarded the abstaining from recording the mortgage an act of delicacy and feeling that spoke well for the lenders heart  my cousin did not cast me adrift as soon as he had filled my pockets on the contrary he went with me and was a witness to all the purchases i made the colonial produce was duly bought in his presence and many a shrewd hint did i get from this coolheaded and experienced man who while he was no merchant in the common sense of the term had sagacity enough to make a firstclass dealer as i paid for everything in ready money the cargo was obtained on good terms and the dawn was soon stowed as soon as this was done i ordered a crew shipped and the hatches battened on  as a matter of course the constant and important business with which i was now occupied had a tendency to dull the edge of my grief though i can truly say that the image of grace was never long absent from my mind even in the midst of my greatest exertions nor was lucy forgotten she was usually at my sisters side and it never happened that i remembered the latter without seeing the beautiful semblance of her living friend watching over her faded form with sisterly solicitude john wallingford left me at the end of a week after seeing me fairly under way as a merchant as well as shipowner and shipmaster  farewell miles he said as he shook my hand with a cordiality that appeared to increase the longer he knew me farewell my dear boy and may god prosper you in all your lawful and just undertakings never forget you are a wallingford and the owner of clawbonny should we meet again you will find a true friend in me should we never meet you will have reason to remember me  this leavetaking occurred at the inn a few hours later i was in the cabin of the dawn arranging some papers when i heard a wellknown voice on deck calling out to the stevedores and riggers in a tone of authoritycome bear a hand and lay aft off that forecastle to this derrickwho ever saw a derrick standing before after the hatches were battened down in a firstclass shipa regular a no 1 bear a handbear a hand youve got an old seadog among you men  there was no mistaking the person on reaching the deck i found marble his coat off but still wearing all the rest of his goashores flourishing about among the labourers putting into them new life and activity he heard my footsteps behind him but never turned to salute me until the matter in hand was terminated then i received that honour and it was easy to see the cloud that passed over his red visage as he observed the deep mourning in which i was clad  good morning to you captain wallingford he said making a mates bowgood morning sir gods will be done we are all sinners and so are some of the stevedores whove left this derrick standing as if the ship needed it for a jurymast yes sir gods will must be submitted to and sorry enough was i to read the obittery in the newspapersgrace c daughter c and only sister cyoull be glad to hear however sir that willow cove is moored head and starn in the family as one might say and that the bloody mortgage is cut adrift  i am glad to hear this mr marble i answered submitting to a twinge as i remembered that a mortgage had just been placed on my own paternal acres and i trust the place will long remain in your blood how did you leave your mother and niece  ive not left em at all sir i brought the old lady and kitty to town with me on what i call the mutual sightseeing principle they are both up at my boardinghouse  i am not certain moses that i understand this mutual principle of which you speak  god bless you miles returned the mate who could presume to be familiar again now we had walked so far aft as not to have any listeners call me moses as often as you possibly can for its little i hear of that pleasant sound now mother will dub me oloff and little kitty calls me nothing but uncle after all i have a bulrush feelin about me and moses will always seem the most natral as for the mutual principle it is just this im to show mother the dawn one or two of the marketsfor would you believe it the dear old soul never saw a market and is dying to visit one and so i shall take her to see the bear first and the oswego next and the fly last though she cries out agin a market that is much visited by flies then i must introduce her to one of the dutch churchesafter that t will go hard with me but i get the dear soul into the theatre and they tell me there is a lion up town that will roar as loud as a bull that she must see of course  and when your mother has seen all these sights what will she have to show you  the tombstone on which i was laid out as a body might say at five weeks old she tells me they traced the stone out of feelin like and followed it up until they fairly found it set down as the headstone of an elderly single lady with a most pious and edifying inscription on it mother says it contains a whole varse from the bible that stone may yet stand me in hand for anything i know to the contrary miles  i congratulated my mate on this important discovery and inquired the particulars of the affair with the old usurer in what manner the money was received and by what process the place had been so securely moored head and starn in the family  it was all plain sailing when a fellow got on the right course marble answered do you know miles that they call paying off one of your heavy loads on land lifting the mortgage and a lift it is i can tell you when a man has no money to do it with the true way to get out of debt is to arn money ive found that much out since i found my mother and the cash in hand all you have to do is to hand it over old van tassel was civil enough when he saw the bag of dollars and was full of fine speeches he didnt wish to distress the worthy mrs wetmore not he and she was welcome to keep the money as long as she pleased provided the interest was punctually paid but id have none of his soft words and laid down the spaniards and told him to count them i lifted his encumbrance as they calld it as easily as if it had been a pillow of fresh feathers and walked off with that bit of paper in my hands with the names tore off it and satisfaction give me as my lawyer said this law is droll business miles if money is paid they give you satisfaction just as gentlemen call on each other you know when a little cross but whatever you do never put your hand and seal to a mortgage for land under such a curse is as likely to slide one way as the other clawbonny is an older place than willow cove even and both are too venerable and venerated to be mortgaged  the advice came too late clawbonny was mortgaged already and i confess to several new and violent twinges as i recalled the fact while marble was telling his story still i could not liken my kinsman plaintalking warmhearted familyloving john wallingford to such a griping usurer as mrs wetmores persecutor  i was glad to see my mate on every account he relieved me from a great deal of irksome duty and took charge of the ship bringing his mother and kitty that very day to live in the cabin i could perceive that the old woman was greatly surprised at the neatness she found in all directions according to her notions a ship floated nearly as much in tar as in the water and great was her pleasure in finding rooms almost conscience will not allow me to say quite as clean as her own residence for one whole day she desired to see no more than the ship though it was easy to discover that the good woman had set her heart on the dutch church and the lion in due time her son redeemed all his pledges not forgetting the theatre with the last good mrs wetmore was astounded and kitty infinitely delighted the pretty little thing confessed that she should like to go every night wondered what horace bright would think of it and whether he would dare venture alone to a playhouse should he happen to come to york in 1803 this country was still in the palmy state of unsophistication there were few scarcely any strolling players and none but those who visited the cities properly so called enjoyed opportunities of witnessing the wonders of paint patch and candlelight as auxiliary to the other wonders of the stage poor little kitty there was a day or two during which the sock and buskin wrought their usual effect on her female nature and almost eclipsed the glories of horace bright in her own bright eyes  i could not refrain from accompanying marbles party to the museum in that day this was a somewhat insignificant collection of curiosities in greenwich street but it was a miracle to the aunt and niece even the worthy manhattanese were not altogether guiltless of esteeming it a wonder though the greater renown of the philadelphia museum kept this of new york a little in the shade i have often had occasion to remark that in this republic the people in the country are a little less country and the people of the towns a good deal less town than is apt to be the case in great nations the last is easily enough accounted for the towns having shot up so rapidly and receiving their accessions of population from classes not accustomed to town lives from childhood were a thousand villages to be compressed into a single group of houses their people would long retain the notions tastes and habits of villagers though they would form a large town in the aggregate such in a measure is still the fact with our american towns no one of them all having the air tone or appearance of a capital while most of them would be paragons in the eyes of such persons as old mrs wetmore and her granddaughter thus it was that the greenwich street museum gave infinite satisfaction to these two unsophisticated visitors kitty was most struck with certain villainous waxfigures works of art that were much on a level with certain similar objects that were lately if they are not now exhibited for the benefit of the dean and chapter of westminster abbey above the tombs of the plantagenets and almost in contact with that marvel of gothic art henry viis chapel it is said that misery makes a man acquainted with strange bedfellows so it would seem do shillings and sixpences to return to kitty after admiring divers beauties such as the new york beauty the south carolina beauty and the pennsylvania beauty she fastened her own pretty eyes on a nun wondering who a female in such an attire could be in 1803 a nun and a nunnery would be almost as great curiosities in america as a rhinoceros though the country has since undergone some changes in this respect  grandmother exclaimed kitty who can that lady beit isnt lady washington is it  it looks more like a clergymans wife kitty answered the worthy mrs wetmore not a little nonplushed herself as she afterwards admitted i should think madam washington went more gaily dressed and looked happier like im sure if any woman could be happy it was she  ay answered her son there is truth in that remark this woman here is what is called a nun in the roman catholic quarters of the world  a nun repeated little kitty isnt that the sort of woman that shuts herself up in a house and promises never to get married uncle  youre quite right my dear and its matter of surprise to me how you should pick up so many useful idees in an outoftheway place like willow cove  it was not out of your way uncle said kitty a little reproachfully or you never would have found us  in that particlar it was well enough my dear yes a nun is a sort of shehermit a breed that i detest altogether  i suppose kitty i inquired you think it wicked in man or woman to take a vow never to get married  the poor girl blushed and she turned away from the nun without making any reply no one can say what turn the conversation might have taken had not the grandmothers eye fell on an indifferent copy of leonardos celebrated picture of the last supper receiving at the same time a printed explanation one got up by some local antiquary who had ventured to affix names to the different personages of the group at his own suggestion i pointed out the principal figure of the painting which is sufficiently conspicuous by the way and then referred the good woman to the catalogue for the rest of the names  bless me bless me exclaimed the worthy mother that i should live ever to see paintings of such people kitty my dear this baldheaded old man is st peter did you ever think that st peter was bald and there is st john with black eyeswonderful wonderful that i should ever live to see likenesses of such blessed men  kitty was as much astonished as her grandmother and even the son was a little mystified the latter remarked that the world was making great headway in all such things and for his part he did not see how the painters and authors found out all they drew and recorded  the reader may easily imagine that half a day spent in such company was not entirely thrown away still half a day sufficed and i went to the old coffeehouse at one to eat a sandwich and drink a glass of porter that being the inn then most frequented for such purposes especially by the merchants i was in my box with the curtain drawn when a party of three entered that which adjoined it ordering as many glasses of punch which in that day was a beverage much in request of a morning and which it was permitted even to a gentleman to drink before dining it was the sherrycobbler of the age although i believe every thing is now pronounced to be out of fashion before dinner  as the boxes were separated merely by curtains it was impossible to avoid hearing any conversation that passed in the one adjoining my own especially when the parties took no pains to speak low as happened to be the case with my three neighbours consequently i recognised the voices of andrew drewett and rupert hardinge in an instantthat of the third person being unknown to me  well norton said rupert a little affectedly as to manner you have got drewett and myself down here among you traders and i hope you will do the honours of the place in a way to confer on the latter some credit a merchant is nothing without credit you know  have no apprehensions for your gentility hardinge returned the person addressed many of the first persons in town frequent this house at this hour and its punch is renowned bytheway i saw in a paper the other day rupert that one of your relatives is deadmiss grace wallingford your sisters old associate  a short pause followed during which i scarcely breathed  no not a relation rupert at length answered only my fathers ward you know how it is in the country the clergyman being expected to take care of all the sick and all the orphans  but these wallingfords are people altogether above standing in need of favours drewett hastily observed i have been at their place and really it is a respectable spot as for miss wallingford she was a most charming girl and her death will prove a severe blow to your sister hardinge  this was said with so much feeling that i could almost forgive the speaker for loving lucy though i question if i could ever truly forgive him for being beloved by her  why yes rejoined rupert affecting an indifference that i could detect he was far from feeling grace was a good creature though living so much with her in childhood she had less interest in my eyes perhaps than she might have had in those of one less accustomed to see her notwithstanding i had a certain sort of regard for grace i will confess  respect and esteem heri should think all who knew her must added drewett as if determined to win my heart and in my opinion she was both beautiful and lovely  this from a man who is confessedly an admirernay engaged to your own sister as the world says hardinge must be taken as warm praise said the third but i suppose drewett sees the dear departed with the eyes of her friendfor miss hardinge was very intimate with her i believe  as intimate as sisters and loving each other as sisters returned drewett with feeling no intimate of miss hardinges can be anything but meritorious  grace wallingford had merit beyond a question added rupert as has her brother who is a good honest fellow enough when a boy i was rather intimate with him  the certain proof of his excellencies and virtues put in the stranger laughing but if a ward there must be a fortune i think i have heard these wallingfords were richish  yes that is just itrichish said drewett some forty or fifty thousand dollars between them all of which the brother must now inherit and glad am i it falls to so good a fellow  this is generous praise from you drewett for i have heard this brother might prove your rival  i had some such fears myself once i will confess returned the other but they are all vanished i no longer fear him and can see and acknowledge his merits besides i am indebted to him for my life  no longer fear himthis was plain enough and was proof of the understanding that existed between the lovers and why should i be fearedi who had never dared to say a word to the object nearest my heart that might induce her to draw the ordinary distinction between passion and esteemlove and a brotherly regard  ay drewett is pretty safe i fancy rupert remarked laughing though it will hardly do for me to tell tales out of school  this is a forbidden subject rejoined the lover and we will talk of wallingford he must inherit his sisters fortune  poor graceit was little she had to leave i fancy rupert quietly observed  ay little in your eyes hardinge added the third person but a good deal in those of her brother the shipmaster one might think ever since you have fallen heir to mrs bradforts estate a few thousands count for nothing  were it a million that brother would think it dearly purchased by the loss of his sister exclaimed drewett  its plain enough there is no rivalry between andrew and miles added the laughing rupert certainly money is not quite of so much account with me now as it used to be when i had nothing but a clergymans salary to glean from as for mrs bradforts fortune it came from a common ancestor and i do not see who has a better right to it than those who now enjoy it  unless it might be your father said the third man who stood before you according to the laws of primogeniture i dare say rupert made love to his venerable cousin if the truth were known and induced her to overlook a generation with his oily tongue  rupert did nothing of the sort it is his glory to love emily merton and emily merton only as my worthy cousin could not take her fortune with her she left it among her natural heirs how do you know i have got any of it i give you my honour my account in bank is under 20000  a pretty fair account that by jove exclaimed the other it must be a rapping income that will permit a fellow like you to keep up such a balance  why some persons say my sister has the whole fortune i dare say that drewett can satisfy you on this head the affair concerns him quite as much as it does any other person of my acquaintance  i can assure you i know nothing about it answered drewett honestly nor do i desire to know i would marry miss hardinge tomorrow though she had not a cent  its just this disinterestedness andrew that makes me like you observed rupert magnificently depend on it youll fare none the worse in the long run for this admirable trait in your character lucy knows it and appreciates it as she should  i wished to hear no more but left the box and the house taking care not to be seen from that moment i was all impatience to get to sea i forgot even the intention of visiting my sisters grave nor did i feel that i could sustain another interview with lucy herself that afternoon i told marble the ship must be ready to sail the succeeding morning    chapter xi     go tenderness of years take this key give enlargement to the   swainbring him festinately hither i must employ him in a letter to my   love    loves labour lost   i will not attempt to analyze the feelings which now impelled me to quit america i had discovered or thought i had discovered certain qualities in andrew drewett which rendered him in some measure at least worthy of lucy and i experienced how painful it is to concede such an advantage to a rival still i must be just enough to add that in my cooler moments when i came to consider that lucy could never be mine i was rejoiced to find such proofs of a generous disposition in her future husband on the other hand i could not divest myself of the idea that perfect confidence in his own position could alone enable him to be so liberal in his opinions of myself the reader will understand how extravagant was this last supposition when he remembers that i had never given lucy herself or the world any sufficient reason to suppose that i was a suitor for the dear girls hand  i never saw marble so industrious as he proved to be when he received my hurried orders for sailing that afternoon he shipped his mother and niece for willow cove by an albany sloop the same evening got the crew on board and the dawn into the stream before sunset and passed half the night in sending off small stores as for the ship she had been cleared the day the hatches were battened down according to every rule of mercantile thrift i ought to have been at sea twentyfour hours when these orders were given but a lingering reluctance to go further from the grave of grace the wish to have one more interview with lucy and a disposition to indulge my mate in his commendable zeal to amuse his newfound relatives kept me in port beyond my day  all these delays however were over and i was now in a feverish hurry to be off neb came up to the city hotel as i was breakfasting and reported that the ship was riding at single anchor with a short range and that the foretopsail was loose i sent him to the postoffice for letters and ordered my bill all my trunks had gone aboard before the ship hauled off andthe distances in new york then being shortneb was soon back and ready to shoulder my carpetbag the bill was paid three or four letters were taken in my hand and i walked towards the battery followed by the faithful black who had again abandoned home chloe and clawbonny to follow my fortunes  i delayed opening the letters until i reached the battery despatching neb to the boat with orders to wait i took a turn among the treesstill reluctant to quit the native soilwhile i broke the seals two of the letters bore the postmarks of the office nearest clawbonny the third was from albany and the fourth was a packet of some size from washington franked by the secretary of state and bearing the seal of office surprised at such a circumstance i opened the last of these communications first  the official letter proved to be an envelope containingwith a civil request to myself to deliver the enclosuresdispatches addressed to the consul at hamburg for which port my ship had been advertised some time of course i could only determine to comply and that communication was disposed of one of the clawbonny letters was in mr hardinges hand and i found it to contain some excellent and parental advice he spoke of my sister but it was calmly and with the humble hope that became his sacred office i was not sorry to find that he advised me not to visit clawbonny before i sailed lucy he said was well and a gentle sadness was gradually taking the place of the livelier grief she had endured immediately after the loss of her friend you were not aware miles how keenly she suffered my good old guardian continued for she struggled hard to seem calm in your presence but from me my dear child had no secrets on this subject whatever she may see fit to have on another hours has she passed weeping on my bosom and i much doubt if the image of grace has been absent from her waking thoughts a single minute at any one time since we first laid your sisters head in the coffin of you she does not speak often but when she does it is ever in the kindest and most solicitous manner calling you miles poor miles or dear miles with all that sisterly frankness and affection you have known in her from childhood the old gentleman had underscored the sisterly himself  to my delight and surprise there was a long very long letter from lucy too how it happened that i did not recognise her pretty delicate ladylike handwriting is more than i can say but the direction had been overlooked in the confusion of receiving so many letters together that direction too gave me pleasure it was to miles wallingford esquire whereas the three others were addressed to capt miles wallingford ship dawn new york now a shipmaster is no more entitled in strict usage to be called a captain than he is to be called an esquire your manofwar officer is the only true captain a master being nothing but a master then no american is entitled to be called an esquire which is the correlative of knight and is a title properly prohibited by the constitution though most people imagine that a magistrate is an esquire ex officio he is an esquire as a member of congress is an honourable by assumption and not of right and i wish the country had sufficient selfrespect to be consistent with itself what should we think of mark anthony esquire or of squire lucius junius brutus or his excellency julius cæsar esquire4 nevertheless esquire is an appellation that is now universally given to a gentleman who in truth is the only man in this country that has any right to it at all and he only by courtesy lucy had felt this distinction and i was grateful for the delicacy and tact with which she had dropped the captain and put in the esquire to me it seemed to say that she recognised me as one of her own class let rupert and his light associates think of me as they might lucy never departed a hairs breadth from the strictly proper in all matters of this sort something having been obtained from education but far more from the inscrutable gifts of nature    footnote 4 a few years since the writer saw a marriage announced in a   coloured paper which read married by the rev julius   cæsarwashington to miss  as for the letter itself it is too long to copy yet i scarce know how to describe it full of heart it was of course for the dear girl was all heart and it was replete with her truth and nature the only thing in it that did not give me entire satisfaction was a request not to come again to clawbonny until my return from europe time she added will lessen the pain of such a visit and by that time you will begin to regard our beloved grace as i already regard her a spotless spirit waiting for our union with it in the mansions of bliss it is not easy miles to know how to treat such a loss as this of ours god may bless it to our lasting good and in this light it is useful to bear it ever in mind while a too great submission to sorrow may only serve to render us unhappy still i think no one who knew grace as we knew her can ever recall her image without feeling himself drawn nearer to the dread being who created her and who has called her to himself so early we alone thoroughly understood the beloved creature my dear excellent father loved her as he loves me but he could not did not know all the rare virtues of her heart these could be known only to those who knew her great secret and god be praised even rupert has little true knowledge of that  my father has spoken to me of graces wish that he and i should accept some memorials of the affection she bore us these were unnecessary but are far too sacred to be declined i sincerely wish that their value in gold had been less for the hair i possess some of which is reserved for you is far more precious to me than any diamonds or stones could possibly become as however something must be purchased or procured i have to request that my memorial may be the pearls you gave grace on your return from the pacific of course i do not mean the valuable necklace you have reserved for one who will one day be still dearer to you than any of us but the dozen or two of pearls that you bestowed on your sister in my presence at clawbonny they are sufficiently valuable in themselves to answer all the purposes of graces bequest and i know they were very much prized by her as your gift dear miles i am certain you will not believe they will be the less valuable in my eyes on that account as i know where they are i shall go to clawbonny and take possession of them at once so you need give yourself no further concern on account of the memorial that was to be presented to me i acknowledge its reception unless you object to my proposition  i scarce knew what to think of this i would gladly have bestowed on lucy pearls of equal value to those i had given grace but she refused to receive them and now she asked for these very pearls which intrinsically were not half the value of the sum i had informed mr hardinge grace had requested me to expend in purchasing a memorial this avidity to possess these pearlsfor so it struck mewas difficult to account for grace having owned divers other ornaments that were more costly and which she had much oftener worn i confess i had thought of attempting to persuade lucy to receive my own necklace as the memorial of grace but a little reflection satisfied me of the hopelessness of success and nothing had been said on the subject of course i acquiesced in the wish of the dear girl to possess the pearls but at the same time i determined to make an additional purchase more thoroughly to carry out the wishes of my sister  on the whole the letter of lucy gave me a great and soothing pleasure i came to a resolution to answer it and to send that answer back by the pilot i had no owner to feel any solicitude in the movements of the ship had no longer a sister to care for myself and to whom else could my last words on quitting the land be so appropriately addressed as to this constant and truehearted friend that much at least i could presume to call lucy and even to that i clung as the shipwrecked mariner clings to the last plank that floats  the fourth letter to my astonishment bore the signature of john wallingford and the date of albany he had got this far on his way home and written me a line to let me know the fact i copy his epistle in full viz    dear miles    here i am and sorry am i to see by the papers there you are still   recollect my dear boy that sugars will melt it is time you were off   this is said for your own sake and not for mine as you well know i am   amply secured still the markets may fall and he who is first in them   can wait for a rise while he who is last must take what offers    above all miles do not take it into your head to alter your will   things are now arranged between us precisely as they should be and i   hate changes i am your heir and you are mine your counsel richard   harrison esquire is a man of great respectability and a perfectly   safe repository of such a secret i leave many of my papers in his   hands and he has now been my counsel ever since i had need of one and   treads so hard on hamiltons heels that the last sometimes feels his   toes this is as counsel however and not as an advocate    adieu my dear boy we are both wallingfords and the nearest of kin to   each other of the name clawbonny will be safe with either of us and   either of us will be safe with clawbonny    your affectionate cousin   john wallingford  i confess that all this anxiety about clawbonny began to give me some uneasiness and that i often wished i had been less ambitious or less hasty would be the better word and had been content to go to sea again in my simple character of shipmaster and shipowner leaving the merchant to those who better understood the vocation  i now went to the boat and to the ship marble was all ready for me and in ten minutes the anchor was clear of the bottom in ten more it was catted and fished and the dawn was beating down the bay on a young flood with a light breeze at southwest the pilot being in charge i had nothing to do but go below and write my letters i answered everybody even to the secretary of state who at that time was no less a man than james madison to him however i had nothing to say but to acknowledge the receipt of the dispatches and to promise to deliver them my letter to mr hardinge was i hope such as a son might have written to a revered parent in it i begged he would allow me to add to his library by a purchase of theological works of value and which in that day could only be procured in europe this was to be his memorial of my sister i also begged of his friendship an occasional look at clawbonny though i did not venture to speak of the mortgage of which i now felt a sort of conviction he would not approve  the letter to john wallingford was as pithy as his own to me i told him my will was made on a conviction of its perfect propriety and assured him it would not be altered in a hurry i told him the sugars were safe and let him understand that they were already on their way to hamburg whence i hoped ere long to send him a good account of their sale  to lucy i was by no means so laconic on the subject of the pearls of grace i begged her to do just as she pleased adding a request however that she would select such others of my sisters ornaments as might be most agreeable to herself on this point i was a little earnest since the pearls were not worth the sum grace had mentioned to me and i felt persuaded lucy would not wish me to remain her debtor there was a pair of bracelets in particular that grace had highly prized and which were very pretty in themselves my father had purchased the stonesrubies of some beautyin one of his voyages for my mother who had fancied them too showy for her to wear i had caused them to be set for grace and they would make a very suitable ornament for lucy and were to be so much the more prized from the circumstance that grace had once worn them it is true they contained a little though very little of my hair for on this grace had insisted but this hair was rather a blemish and might easily be removed i said as much in my letter  on the subject of my sisters death i found it impossible to write much the little i did say however was in full accordance with her own feelings i felt persuaded and i had no difficulty in believing she would sympathize in all i did express and in much that i had not words to express  on the subject of the necklace i did find language to communicate a little though it was done in the part of the letter where a woman is said to give her real thoughtsthe postscript in answer to what lucy had said on the subject of my own necklace i wrote as follows vizyou speak of my reserving the more valuable pearls for one who at some future day may become my wife i confess this was my own intention originally and very pleasant was it to me to fancy that one so dear would wear pearls that had been brought up out of the sea by my own hands but dearest lucy all these agreeable and delusive anticipations have vanished depend on it i shall never marry i know that declarations of this sort in young men of three and twenty like those of maidens of nineteen excite a smile oftener than they produce belief but i do not say this without reflection and i may add without feeling she whom i once did hope to persuade to marry me although much my friend is not accustomed to view me with the eyes that lead to love we were brought together under circumstances that have probably induced her to regard me more as a brother than as a suitor and while the golden moments have passed away her affections have become the property of another i resemble in this particular at least our regretted grace and am not likely to change my nature may be sterner and my constitution stronger than those of my poor sister proved to be but i feel i cannot love twice not as i have and still do love most certainly why should i trouble you with all this however i know you will not accept of the necklacethough so ready to give me your own last piece of gold when i went to sea you have ever been so fastidious as to refuse every thing from us that had the least appearance of a pecuniary obligationand it is useless to say more about it i have no right to trouble you with my griefs especially at a moment when i know your affectionate heart is suffering so deeply from our recent loss  i will confess that while writing this i fancied i was making a sort of halfdeclaration to lucy one that might at least give her some faint insight into the real state of my heart and i had a melancholy satisfaction in thinking that the dear girl might by these means learn how much i had prized and still did prize her it was only a week later while pondering over what i had written the idea occurred to me that every syllable i had said would apply just as well to emily merton as to lucy hardinge peculiar circumstances had made me intimately acquainted with our young english friend and these circumstances might well have produced the very results i had mentioned we all believed emilys affections to be engaged to rupert who must have succeeded during my absence at sea a modest and selfdistrusting nature like that of lucys would be very apt to turn to any other than herself in quest of the original of my picture  these letters occupied me for hours that to lucy in particular was very long and it was not written wholly without care when all were done and sealed and enveloped to the address of the postmaster i went on deck the pilot and marble had not been idle while i had been below for i found the ship just weathering the southwest spit a position that enabled me to make a fair wind of it past the hook and out to sea  certainly i was in no haste to quit home i was leaving my native land clawbonny the grave of my sister and lucy dearest lucy all behind me and at such an instant one feels the ties that are about to be separated still every seaman is anxious for an offing and glad was i to see the head of the dawn pointing in the right direction with her yards nearly square and a foretopmast studdingsail set the pilot was all activity and marble cool clearheaded in his duty and instinctively acquainted with everything belonging to a vessel was just the man to carry out his views to his hearts content  the ship went rising and falling on the swells of the ocean that now began to make themselves felt past the light and the low point of the hook within a few minutes after we had squared away and once more the open ocean lay before us i could not avoid smiling at neb just as we opened the broad waste of waters and got an unbroken view of the rolling ocean to the southward the fellow was on the maintopsail yard having just run out and lashed the heel of a topgallantstuddingsail boom in order to set the sail before he lay in to the mast he raised his herculean frame and took a look to windward his eyes opened his nostrils dilated and i fancied he resembled a hound that scented game in the gale as he snuffed the seaair which came fanning his glistening face filled with the salts and peculiar flavours of the ocean i question if neb thought at all of chloe for the next hour or two  as soon as we got over the bar i gave the pilot my package and he got into his boat it was not necessary to shorten sail in order to do this for the vessels way did not exceed five knots  do you see the sail hereaway in the southeastern board said the pilot as he went over the side pointing towards a white speck on the ocean take care of that fellow and give him as wide a berth as possible or he may give you a look at halifax or bermuda  halifax or bermuda i have nothing to do with either and shall not go there why should i fear that sail  on account of your cargo and on account of your men that is his majestys ship leander she has been off here now more than a week the inwardbound craft say she is acting under some new orders and they name several vessels that have been seen heading northeast after she had boarded them this new war is likely to lead to new troubles on the coast and it is well for all outwardbound ships to be on the lookout  his majestys ship was a singular expression for an american to use towards any sovereign twenty years after the independence of the country was acknowledged but it was common then nor has it ceased entirely even among the newspapers of the present hour so much harder is it to substitute a new language than to produce a revolution notwithstanding this proof of bad taste in the pilot i did not disregard his caution there had been certain unpleasant rumours up in town for more than a month that the two great belligerents would be apt to push each other into the old excesses england and france at that day having such a monopoly of the ocean as to render them somewhat independent of most of the oldfashioned notions of the rights of neutrals as for america she was cursed with the cant of economyan evil that is apt to produce as many bad consequences as the opposite vice extravagance the money paid as interest on the sums expended in the war of 1812 might have maintained a navy that would have caused both belligerents to respect her rights and thereby saved the principal entirely to say nothing of all the other immense losses dependent on an interrupted trade but demagogues were at work with their raven throats and it is not reasonable to expect that the masses can draw very just distinctions on the subject of remote interests when present expenditure is the question immediately before them it is true i remember a modern french logician who laid down the dogma that the tendency of democracies being to excesses if you give a people the power they would tax themselves to death but however true this theory may be in the main it certainly is not true quoad the good citizens of the great model republic it was bad enough to be accursed with a spurious economy but this was not the heaviest grievance that then weighed upon the national interests the demon of faction party spirit was actively at work in the country and it was almost as rare to find a citizen who was influenced purely by patriotic and just views as it would be to find an honest man in the galleys the nation as a rule was either english or french some swore by the first consul and some by billy pitt as for the commercial towns taken in connection with the upper classes these were little more than so many reflections of english feeling exaggerated and rendered still more factitious by distance those who did not swallow all that the english tories chose to pour down their throats took the pillules napoleons without gagging if there were exceptions they were very few and principally among travelled menpilgrims who by approaching the respective idols had discovered they were made by human hands  impressment at sea and out of neutral vessels was revived as a matter of course with the renewal of the war and all american ships felt the expediency of avoiding cruisers that might deprive them of their men strange as it may seem a large and leading class of americans justified this claim of the english as it was practised on board their own countrys vessels what will not men defend when blinded and excited by faction as this practice was to put the mariner on the defensive and to assume that every man was an englishman who could not prove out on the ocean a thousand miles from land perhaps that he was an american it followed that english navy officers exercised a jurisdiction over foreigners and under a foreign flag that would not be tolerated in the lord high chancellor himself in one of the streets of london that of throwing the burthen of proving himself innocent on the accused party there was an abundance of other principles that were just as obvious and just as unanswerable as this which were violated by the daily practices of impressment but they all produced no effect on the members of congress and public writers that sustained the right of the english who as blindly espoused one side of the main question as their opponents espoused the other men acting under the guidance of factions are not compos mentis  i think i may say without boasting unreasonably of my own good sense that i have kept myself altogether aloof from the vortex of parties from boyhood to the present hour my father had been a federalist but a federalist a good deal cooled off from having seen foreign countries and no attempts had ever been made to make me believe that black was white in the interest of either faction i knew that impressment from foreign vessels out of the waters of great britain at least could be defended on no other ground but that of power and as for colonial produce and all the subtleties that were dependent on its transportation i fancied that a neutral had a perfect right to purchase of one belligerent and sell to another provided he found it his interest so to do and he violated no positivenot paperblockade or did not convey articles that are called contraband of war  with these views then it is not surprising that i easily came into the pilots opinion and determined to give the leander a sufficient berth as sailors express it  the leander was a fifty on two decks a very silly sort of a craft though she had manfully played her part at the nile and on one or two other rather celebrated occasions and was a good vessel of the build still i felt certain the dawn could get away from her under tolerably favourable circumstances the leander afterwards became notorious on the american coast in consequence of a man killed in a coaster by one of her shot within twenty miles of the spot where i now saw her an event that had its share in awakening the feeling that produced the war of 1812 a war of which the effects are just beginning to be made manifest in the policy of the republic a fact bytheway that is little understood at home or abroad the leander was a fast ship of her kind but the dawn was a fast ship of any kind and i had great faith in her it is true the fifty had the advantage of the wind but she was a long way off well to the southward and might have something in sight that could not be seen even from our topgallant yards whither neb was sent to take a look at the horizon  our plan was soon laid the south side of long island trending a little to the north of east i ordered the ship to be steered east by south which with the wind at southsouthwest gave me an opportunity to carry all our studdingsails the soundings were as regular as the ascent on the roof of a shed or on that of a graded lawn and the land in sight less than two leagues distant in this manner we ran down the coast with about six knots way on the ship as soon as we got from under the jersey shore  in less than an hour or when we were about four leagues from sandy hook light the englishman wore short round and made sail to cut us off by this time he was just forward of our weather beam a position that did not enable him to carry studdingsails on both sides for had he kept off enough for this he would have fallen into our wake while by edging away to close with us his aftersails becalmed the forward and this at the moment when every thing of ours pulled like a team of wellbroken carthorses notwithstanding all this we had a nervous afternoons and nights work of it these old fifties are great travellers off the wind and more than once i fancied the leander was going to lay across my bows as she did athwart those of the frenchman at the nile the dawn however was not idle and as the wind stood all that day throughout the night and was fresher though more to the southward than it had hitherto been next morning i had the satisfaction of seeing montauk a little on my leebow at sunrise while my pursuer was still out of gunshot on my weather beam  marble and i now held a consultation on the subject of the best mode of proceeding i was half disposed to let the leander come up and send a boat on board us what had we to fear we were bound to hamburg with a cargo one half of which came from the english while the other half came from french islandsbut what of that marble however would not listen to such a project he affirmed that he was a good pilot in all the sounds and that it would be better to risk everything rather than let that fifty close with us  keep the ship away for montauk sir exclaimed the matekeep her away for montauk and let that chap follow us if he dare theres a reef or two inside that ill engage to lead him on should he choose to try the game and that will cure him of his taste for chasing a yankee  will you engage moses to carry the ship over the shoals if i will do as you desire and go inside  ill carry her into any port east of block island cap tain wallingford though new york born as it now turns out im down east edicated and have got a coasting pilot of my own in my head  this settled the matter and i came to the resolution to stand on      chapter xii      the wind blows fair the vessel feels   the pressure of the rising breeze   and swiftest of a thousand keels   she leaps to the careering seas    willis   half an hour later things drew near a crisis we had been obliged to luff a little in order to clear a reef that even marble admitted lay off montauk while the leander had kept quite as much away with a view to close this brought the fifty so near us directly on our weather beam as to induce her commander to try the virtue of gunpowder her bowgun was fired and its shot only a twelvepounder richochèd until it fairly passed our forefoot distant a hundred yards making its last leap from the water precisely in a line with the stem of the dawn this was unequivocal evidence that the game could not last much longer unless the space between the two vessels should be sensibly widened fortunately we now opened montauk fort and the option was offered us of doubling that point and entering the sound or of standing oh towards block island and putting the result on our heels after a short consultation with marble i decided on the first  one of the material advantages possessed by a manofwar in a chase with a merchant vessel is in the greater velocity with which her crew can make or take in sail i knew that the moment we began to touch our braces tacks and sheets that the leander would do the same and that she would effect her objects in half the time in which we could effect ours nevertheless the thing was to be done and we set about the preparations with care and assiduity it was a small matter to round in our weather braces until the yards were nearly square but the rigging out of her studdingsail booms and the setting of the sails was a job to occupy the dawns people several minutes marble suggested that by edging gradually away we should bring the leander so far on our quarter as to cause the aftersails to conceal what we were about forward and that we might steal a march on our pursuers by adopting this precaution i thought the suggestion a good one and the necessary orders were given to carry it out  any one might be certain that the englishmans glasses were levelled on us the whole time some address was used therefore in managing to get our yards in without showing the people at the braces this was done by keeping off first and then by leading the ropes as far forward as possible and causing the men to haul on them seated on deck in this manner we got our yards nearly square or as much in as our new course required when we sent hands aloft forward to get out the lee booms but we reckoned without our host john bull was not to be caught in that way the hands were hardly in the lee fore rigging before i saw the fifty falling off to our course her yards squared and signs aboard her that she had larboard studding sails as well as ourselves the change of course had one good effect however it brought our pursuer so far on our quarter that standing at the capstan i saw him through the mizen rigging this took the dawn completely from under the leanders broadside leaving us exposed to merely four or five of her forward guns should she see fit to use them whether the english were reluctant to resort to such very decided means of annoyance so completely within the american waters as we were clearly getting to be or whether they had so much confidence in their speed as to feel no necessity for firing i never knew but they did not have any further recourse to shot  as might have been foreseen the fifty had her extra canvass spread some time before we could open ours and i fancied she showed the advantage thus obtained in her rate of sailing she certainly closed with us though we closed much faster with the land still there was imminent danger of her overhauling us before we could round the point unless some decided step were promptly taken to avoid it  on the whole mr marble i said after my mates and myself had taken a long and thoughtful look at the actual state of thingson the whole mr marble it may be well to take in our light sails haul our wind and let the manofwar come up with us we are honest folk and there is little risk in his seeing all we have to show him  never think of it cried the mate after this long pull the fellow will be as savage as a bear with a sore head hed not leave a hand on board us that can take his trick at the wheel and its ten chances to one that he would send the ship to halifax under some pretence or other that the sugars are not sweet enough or that the coffee was grown in a french island and tastes french nonocaptain wallingfordheres the wind at sousouwest and were heading notheeast andbynothehalfnothe already with that fellow abaft the mizen riggin as soon as we get a pint more to the norard well have him fairly in our wake  ay that will do very well as a theory but what can we make of it in practice we are coming up towards montauk at the rate of eight knots and you have told me yourself there is a reef off that point directly towards which we must this moment be standing at this rate fifteen minutes might break us up into splinters  i could see that marble was troubled by the manner in which he rolled his tobacco about and the riveted gaze he kept on the water ahead i had the utmost confidence in his seamanlike prudence and discretion while i knew he was capable of suggesting anything a ship could possibly perform in an emergency that called for such an exercise of decision at that moment he forgot our present relations and went back as he often did when excited to the days of our greater equality and more trying scenes  harkee miles he said the reef is dead ahead of us but there is a passage between it and the point i went through that passage in the revvylutionwar in chase of an english west injyman and stood by the lead the whole way myself keep her away nebkeep her away another pint sosteadyvery well dyce anglice thuskeep her so and let john bull follow us if he dare  you should be very sure of your channel mr marble i said gravely to take so much responsibility on yourself remember my all is embarked in this ship and the insurance will not be worth a sixpence if we are lost running through such a place as this in broad daylight reflect a moment i beg of you if not certain of what you do  and what will the insurance be worth agin halifax or bermuda ill put my life on the channel and would care more for your ship miles than my own if you love me stand on and let us see if that lubberly makebelieve twodecker dare follow  i was fain to comply though i ran a risk that i find impossible now to justify to myself i had my cousin john wallingfords property in charge as well as my own or what was quite as bad i placed clawbonny in imminent jeopardy still my feelings were aroused and to the excitement of a race was added the serious but vague apprehensions all american seamen felt in that day of the great belligerents it is a singular proof of human justice that the very consequences of these apprehensions are made matter of reproach against them  it is not my intention to dwell further on the policy of england and france during their great contest for superiority than is necessary to the narrative of events connected with my own adventures but a word in behalf of american seamen in passing may not be entirely out of place or season men are seldom wronged without being calumniated and the body of men of which i was then one did not escape that sort of reparation for all the grievances they endured which is dependent on demonstrating that the injured deserve their sufferings we have been accused of misleading english cruisers by false information of being liars to an unusual degree and of manifesting a grasping love of gold beyond the ordinary cupidity of man now i will ask our accusers if it were at all extraordinary that they who felt themselves daily aggrieved should resort to the means within their power to avenge themselves as for veracity no one who has reached my present time of life can be ignorant that truth is the rarest thing in the world nor are those who have been the subjects of mystifications got up in payment for wrongs supposed or real the most impartial judges of character or facts as for the charge of an undue love of money it is unmerited money will do less in america than in any other country of my acquaintance and infinitely less than in either france or england there is truth in this accusation as applied either to a particular class or to the body of the american people only in one respect it is undeniable that as a new nation with a civilization that is wanting in so many of its higher qualities while it is already so far advanced in those which form the basis of national greatness money does not meet with the usual competition among us the institutions too by dispensing with hereditary consideration do away with a leading and prominent source of distinction that is known to other systems thus giving to riches an exclusive importance that is rather apparent however than real i acknowledge that little or no consideration is yet given among us to any of the more intellectual pursuits the great bulk of the nation regarding literary men artists even professional men as so many public servants that are to be used like any other servants respecting them and their labours only as they can contribute to the great stock of national wealth and renown this is owing in part to the youth of a country in which most of the material foundation was so recently to be laid and in part to the circumstance that men being under none of the factitious restraints of other systems coarse and vulgarminded declaimers make themselves heard and felt to a degree that would not be tolerated elsewhere notwithstanding all these defects which no intelligent and least of all no travelled american should or can justly deny i will maintain that gold is not one tittle more the goal of the american than it is of the native of other active and energetic communities it is true there is little besides gold just now to aim at in this country but the great number of young men who devote themselves to letters and the arts under such unfavourable circumstances a number greatly beyond the knowledge of foreign nations proves it is circumstances and not the grovelling propensities of the people themselves that give gold a so nearly undisputed ascendency the great numbers who devote themselves to politics among us certainly any thing but a moneymaking pursuit proves that it is principally the want of other avenues to distinction that renders gold apparently the sole aim of american existence to return from this touch of philosophy to our ships  the progress of the dawn soon left us no choice in the course to be steered we could see by the charts that the reef was already outside of us and there was now no alternative between going ashore or going through marbles channel we succeeded in the last gaining materially on the leander by so doing the englishman hauling his wind when he thought himself as near to the danger as was prudent and giving up the chase i ran on to the northward an hour longer when finding our pursuer was hull down to the southward and westward i took in our larboard studdingsails and brought the ship by the wind passing out to sea again to the eastward of block island  great was the exultation on board the dawn at this escape for escape it proved to be next morning at sunrise we saw a sail a long distance to the westward which we supposed to be the leander but she did not give chase marble and the people were delighted at having given john bull the slip while i learned caution from the occurrence determining not to let another vessel of war get near enough to trouble me again could i possibly prevent it  from this time for twenty days the passage of the dawn had nothing unusual we crossed the banks in fortysix and made as straight a course for the western extremity of england as the winds would allow for several days i was uncertain whether to go northabout or not believing that i should fall in with fewer cruisers by doubling scotland than by running up channel the latter was much the nearest route though so much depends on the winds that i determined to let these last govern until we had made twothirds of our distance across the ocean the winds had stood very much at southwest and though we had no heavy weather our progress was good but in 20° east from greenwich we got northeasters and our best tack being the larboard i stood for ten days to the southward and eastward this brought us into the track of every thing going to or coming from the mediterranean and had we stood on far enough we should have made the land somewhere in the bay of biscay i knew we should find the ocean dotted with english cruisers however as soon as we got into the european waters and we tacked to the northwest when about a hundred leagues from the land  the thirtythird day out proved one of great importance to me the wind had shifted to southwest and it was blowing fresh with very thick weatherrain mingled with a fine mist that often prevented ones seeing a quarter of a mile from the ship the change occurred at midnight and there was every prospect of the winds standing until it shoved us into the chops of the channel from which we were then distant about four hundred miles according to my own calculation marble had the watch at four oclock and he sent for me that i might decide on the course to be steered and the sail to be carried the course was n n east but as for the sail i determined to stand on under our topsails and forecourse spanker and jib until i could get a look by daylight when the sun was fairly up there was no change and i gave orders to get along some of the larger studdingsails and to set the maintopgallant sail having my doubts whether the spars would bear any more canvass under the stiff breeze that was blowing  this is no great distance from the spot where we surprised the lady of nantes captain wallingford marble observed to me as i stood overlooking the process of bending a foretopmast studdingsail in which he was engaged with his own hands nor was the weather any thicker then than it is now though that was a haze and this is a mist  you are out of your longitude a few hundred miles master moses but the comparison is well enough otherwise we have twice the wind and sea we had then moreover and that was dry weather while this is to speak more gingerly a little moist  ay ay sir there is just that difference them were pleasant days captain wallingfordi say nothing agin thesebut them ere were pleasant times as all in the crisis must allow  perhaps we shall think the same of these some five or six years hence  well thats natur i must confess its amazing how the last vyge hangs in a mans memory and how little we think of the present i suppose the lord made us all of this disposition for its sartain we all manifest it come bear a hand neb on that foreyard and let us see the length of the stunsail boom  but neb contrary to his habits stood upright on the yard holding on by the lift and looking over the weather leach of the topsail apparently at some object that either was just then visible or which had just before been visible  what is it cried marble struck with the blacks attitude and manner what dye see  i dont see him now sir nuttin now but dere was a ship  whereaway i demanded  off here masser milelarboard bow well forrard look sharp and soon see him yourself sir  sharp enough we did look all hands of us on deck and in less than a minute we caught a pretty good view of the stranger from the forecastle he might have been visible to us half a minute in one of those momentary openings in the mist that were constantly occurring and which enabled the eye to command a range around the ship of half a mile losing it again however almost as soon as it was obtained notwithstanding the distance of time i can perfectly recall the appearance of that vessel seen as she was for a moment only and seen too so unexpectedly it was a frigate as frigates then were or a ship of that medium size between a heavy sloopofwar and a twodecker which perhaps offers the greatest proportions for activity and force we plainly saw her creamcoloured or as it is more usual to term it her yellow streak dotted with fourteen ports including the bridle and gleaming brightly in contrast to the dark and glistening hull over which the mist and the spray of the ocean cast a species of sombre lustre the stranger was under his three topsails spanker and jib each of the former sails being double reefed his courses were in the brails as the wind did not blow hard enough to bring a vessel of any size to more than one reef even on a bowline this short canvass proved that the frigate was on her cruising ground and was roaming about in quest of anything that might offer this was just the canvass to give a cruiser a wicked look since it denoted a lazy preparation which might in an instant be improved into mischief as all cruising vessels when on their stations doing nothing reef at night and the hour was still early it was possible we had made this ship before her captain or firstlieutenant had made his appearance on deck there she was at all events dark lustrous fair in her proportions her yards looming square and symmetrical her canvass damp but stout and new the copper bright as a teakettle resembling a new cent her hammockcloths with the undress appearance this part of a vessel of war usually offers at night and her quarterdeck and forecastle guns frowning through the lanyards of her lower rigging like so many slumbering bulldogs muzzled in their kennels  the frigate was on an easy bowline or to speak more correctly was standing directly across our forefoot with her yards nearly square in a very few minutes each keeping her present course the two ships would have passed within pistolshot of each other i scarce knew the nature of the sudden impulse which induced me to call out to the man at the wheel to starboard his helm it was probably from instinctive apprehension that it were better for a neutral to have as little to do with a belligerent as possible mingled with a presentiment that i might lose some of my people by impressment call out i certainly did and the dawns bows came up to the wind looking to the westward or in a direction contrary to that in which the frigate was running as her yards were square or nearly so as soon as the weather leeches touched the helm was righted and away we went with the wind abeam with about as much breeze as we wanted for the sail we carried  the dawn might have been half a mile to windward of the frigate when this manoeuvre was put in execution we were altogether ignorant whether our own ship had been seen but the view we got of the stranger satisfied us that he was an englishman throughout the whole of the long wars that succeeded the french revolution the part of the ocean which lay off the chops of the channel was vigilantly watched by the english and it was seldom indeed a vessel could go over it without meeting more or less of their cruisers  i was not without a hope that the two ships would pass each other without our being seen the mist became very thick just as we hauled up and had this change of course taken place after we were shut in the chances were greatly in favour of its being effected once distant a mile from the frigate there was little danger of her getting a glimpse of us since throughout all that morning i was satisfied we had not got an horizon with that much of diameter  as a matter of course the preparations with the studdingsails were suspended neb was ordered to lay aloft as high as the crosstrees and to keep a vigilant lookout while all eyes on deck were watching as anxiously in the mist as we had formerly watched for the shadowy outline of la dame de nantes marbles long experience told him best where to look and he caught the next view of the frigate she was directly under our lee gliding easily along under the same canvass the reefs still in the courses in the brails and the spanker rolled up as it had been for the night  by george cried the mate all them johnny bulls are still asleep and they havent seen us if we can give this fellow the slip as we did the old leander captain wallingford the dawn will become as famous as the flying dutchman see there he jogs on as if going to mill or to church and no more stir aboard him than there is in a quaker meetin how my good old soul of a mother would enjoy this  there the frigate went sure enough without the smallest sign of any alarm having been given on board her the vessels had actually passed each other and the mist was thickening again presently the veil was drawn and the form of that beautiful ship was entirely hid from sight marble rubbed his hands with delight and all our people began to joke at the expense of the englishman if a merchantman could see a manofwar it was justly enough said a manofwar ought certainly to see a merchantman her lookouts must have all been asleep or it would not have been possible for us to pass so near under the canvass we carried and escape undiscovered most of the dawns crew were native americans though there were four or five europeans among them of these last one was certainly an englishman and as i suspected a deserter from a public ship and the other beyond all controversy was a plant of the emerald isle these two men were particularly delighted though well provided with those veracious documents called protections which like beggars certificates never told anything but truth though like beggars certificates they not unfrequently fitted one man as well as another it was the wellestablished laxity in the character of this testimony that gave the english officers something like a plausible pretext for disregarding all evidence in the premises their mistake was in supposing they had a right to make a man prove anything on board a foreign ship while that of america was in permitting her citizens to be arraigned before foreign judges under any conceivable circumstances if england wanted her own men let her keep them within her own jurisdiction not attempt to follow them into the jurisdiction of neutral states  well the ship had passed and i began myself to fancy that we were quit of a troublesome neighbour when neb came down the rigging in obedience to an order from the mate  relieve the wheel master clawbonny said marble who often gave the negro his patronymic we may want some of your touches before we reach the foot of the danse which way was john bull travelling when you last saw him  he goin eastward sirneb was never half as much nigger at sea as when he was on shorethere being something in his manly calling that raised him nearer to the dignity of white menbut sir he was gettin his people ready to make sail  how do you know thatno such thing sir all hands were asleep taking their second naps  well you see misser marble den you know sir  neb grinned as he said this and i felt persuaded he had seen something that he understood but which very possibly he could not explain though it clearly indicated that john bull was not asleep we were not left long in doubt on this head the mist opened again and distant from us about threequarters of a mile bearing on our lee quarter we got another look at the frigate and a look that satisfied everybody what she was about the englishman was in stays in the very act of hauling his headyards a certain sign he was a quick and sureworking fellow since this manoeuvre had been performed against a smart sea and under doublereefed topsails he must have made us just as we lost sight of him and was about to shake out his reefs  on this occasion the frigate may have been visible from our decks three minutes i watched all her movements as the cat watches the mouse in the first place her reefs were shaken out as the ships bows fell off far enough to get the sea on the right side of them and her topsails appeared to me to be mastheaded by instinct or as the bird extends its wings the fore and maintopgallant sails were fluttering in the breeze at this very momentit blew rather too fresh for the mizenand then their bosoms were distended and their bowlines hauled how the fore and maintacks got aboard i could not tell though it was done while my eyes were on the upper sails i caught a glimpse of the foresheet however as the clew was first flapping violently and then was brought under the restraint of its own proper powerful purchase the spanker had been hauled out previously to help the ship in tacking  there was no mistaking all this we were seen and chased everything on board the frigate being instantly and accurately trimmed full and by she looked up into our wake and i knew must soon overtake a heavilyladen ship like the dawn in the style in which she was worked and handled under the circumstances therefore i motioned marble to follow me aft where we consulted together touching our future proceedings i confess i was disposed to shorten sail and let the cruiser come alongside but marble as usual was for holding on  we are bound to hamburg said the mate which lies hereaway on our leebeam and no man has a right to complain of our steering our course the mist has shut the frigate in again and it being very certain he will overhaul us on a bowline i advise you miles to lay the yards perfectly square edge away two points more and set the weather stunsails if we do not open john very soon again we may be off three or four miles to leeward before he learns where we are and then you know a starnchase is always a longchase  this was good advice and i determined to follow it it blew rather fresh at the instant and the dawn began to plunge through the seas at a famous rate as soon as she felt the drag of the studdingsails we were now running on a course that made an obtuse angle with that of the frigate and there was the possibility of so far increasing our distance as to get beyond the range of the openings of the mist ere our expedient were discovered so long did the density of the atmosphere continue indeed that my hopes were beginning to be strong just as one of our people called out the frigate this time she was seen directly astern of us and nearly two miles distant such had been our gain that ten minutes longer would have carried us clear as we now saw her i felt certain she would soon see us eyes being on the lookout on board her beyond a question nevertheless the cruiser was still on a bowline standing on the course on which we had been last seen  this lasted but a moment however presently the englishmans bow fell off and by the time he was dead before the wind we could see his studdingsails flapping in the air as they were in the act of being distended by means of halyards tacks and sheets all going at once the mist shut in the ship again before all this could be executed what was to be done next marble said as we were not on our precise course it might serve a good turn to bring the wind on our starboard quarter set all the studdingsails we could carry on the same side and run off eastnortheast i inclined to this opinion and the necessary changes were made forthwith the wind and mist increased and away we went on a diverging line from the course of the englishman at the rate of quite ten knots in the hour this lasted fully forty minutes and all hands of us fancied we had at last given the cruiser the slip jokes and chuckling flew about among the men as usual and everybody began to feel as happy as success could make us when the dark veil lifted at the southwest the sun was seen struggling through the clouds the vapour dispersed and gradually the whole curtain which had concealed the ocean throughout that morning arose extending the view around the ship little by little until nothing limited it but the natural horizon  the anxiety with which we watched this slow rising of the curtain need scarcely be described every eye was turned eagerly in the direction in which its owner expected to find the frigate and great was our satisfaction as mile after mile opened in the circle around us without bringing her beautiful proportions within its range but this could not last for ever there not being sufficient time to carry so large a vessel over the curvature of the oceans surface as usual marble saw her first she had fairly passed to leeward of us and was quite two leagues distant driving ahead with the speed of a racehorse with a clear horizon an open ocean a stiff breeze and hours of daylight it was hopeless to attempt escape from as fast a vessel as the stranger and i now determined to put the dawn on her true course and trust altogether to the goodness of my cause heels being out of the question the reader who will do me the favour to peruse the succeeding chapter will learn the result of this resolution    chapter xiii      whom have we here buckingham to disturb   the king hath sent him sure i must dissemble    king henry vi   at first the frigate took single reefs in her topsails set topgallantsails over them and hauled up on taut bowlines but seeing no signs of our studdingsails coming down she shook out her reefs squared her yards set topmast studdingsails and kept off to a course that would be certain to intercept us she was up on our line of sailing some little time before we got down to her and she kept standing off and on hauling up her courses and furling her topgallantsails and hauling down all of her light sails the jib excepted as for the dawn she kept steadily on carrying everything she could bear we had topmast and lower studdingsails and not a tack or sheet had been touched when we got within a quarter of a mile of the frigate the englishman now showed his colours when we let him see the stars and stripes still no sail was touched on board us as if surprised at our obstinacy john bull let fly a chasegun taking good care not to send the shot very near us i thought it time now to shorten sail and to pretend to see him we began to haul down our studdingsails merchantfashion and were fairly alongside of the frigate before even this preliminary step to heavingto was effected as we approached the frigate bore up and ran off in company with us keeping a hundred fathoms distance from us and watching us closely at this instant i ordered the topgallantsails settled on the caps as a sign we intended to let him board us  at length having reduced the sail to the three topsails reefed i hoveto the dawn and waited for a visit from the englishmans boat as soon as the frigate saw us fairly motionless she shot up on our weather quarter half a cables length distant swung her long saucylooking yards and layto herself at the same instant her leequarter boat dropped into the water with the crew in it a boy of a midshipman scrambled down the ships side and entered it also a lieutenant followed when away the cockle of a thing swept on the crest of a sea and was soon pulling round under our stern i stood on the lee quarter examining my visiters as they struggled against the swell in order to get a boathook into our main chains the men were like any other manofwars men neat sturdy and submissive in air the reefer was a welldressed boy evidently a gentlemans son but the lieutenant was one of those old weatherbeaten seadogs who are seldom employed in boats unless something more than common is to be done he was a man of forty hardfeatured pockmarked redfaced and scowling i afterwards ascertained he was the son of some underling about the portsmouth dockyard who had worked his way up to a lieutenancy and owed his advancement principally to his readiness in impressing seamen his name was sennit  we threw mr sennit a rope as a matter of course and marble met him at the gangway with the usual civilities i was amused with the meeting between these men who had strictly that analogy to each other which is well described as diamond cut diamond each was dogmatical positive and full of nautical conceit in his own fashion and each hated the others country as heartily as man could hate while both despised frenchmen but sennit knew a mate from a master at a glance and without noticing marbles seabow a slight for which marble did not soon forgive him he walked directly aft to me not well pleased as i thought that a shipmaster had neglected to be at the gangway to meet a sea lieutenant  your servant sir commenced mr sennit condescending to notice my bow your servant sir i suppose we owe the pleasure of your company just now to the circumstance of the weathers clearing  this sounded hostile from the go off and i was determined to give as good as i received  quite likely sir was my answer uttered as coolly as i could speaki do not think you got much the advantage as long as there was thick weather  ay you re a famous fellow at hide and go seek and i do not doubt would make a long chase in a dark night but his majestys ship speedy is not to be dodged by a yankee  so it would seem sir by your present success  men seldom run away without there is a cause for it its my business to find out the reason why you have attempted it so sir i will thank you for the name of your ship to begin with  the dawn of new york  ay fullblooded yankeei knew you were new england by your tricks  new york is not in new england nor do we call a new york ship a yankee put in marble  ay ayif one were to believe all you mates from the t other side say he would soon fancy that king george held his throne by virtue of a commission from president washington  president washington is dead heaven bless him retorted marbleand if one were to believe half of what you english say he would soon fancy that president jefferson held his office as one of king georges waiting men  i made a sign for marble to be silent and intimated to the lieutenant i was ready to answer any further inquiries he wished to make sennit did not proceed however without giving a significant look at the mate which to me seemed to say i have pressed a mate in my time  well sir the dawn of new york he continued noting the name in his pocketbookhow are you called yourself  the dawn of new york miles wallingford master  miles wallingford master where from whither bound and with what laden  from new york bound to hamburg cargo sugars coffee and cochineal  a very valuable cargo sir observed mr sennit a little drily i wish for your sake it had been going to any other part of the world as this last war has sent the french into that part of germany and hamburg is suspected of being rather too much under boneys influence  and were we bound to bordeaux sir what power have you to stop a neutral at this distance at sea  if you put it on power mr wallingford you depend on a crutch that will betray you we have power enough to eat you should that be necessaryi suppose you mean right  i shall not dispute with you sir about words  well to prove to you that i am as amicably disposed as yourself i will say no more on the subject with your permission i will now examine your papers and to show you that i feel myself among friends i will first send my own boat back to the speedy  i was infinitely disgusted with this mans manner it had the vulgar sort of witticism about even his air that he so much affected in his speech the whole being deformed by a species of sly malignancy that rendered him as offensive as he seemed to me to be dangerous i could not refuse to let a belligerent look at my papers however and went below to get them while sennit gave some private orders to his reefer and sent him away to the frigate  while on this subject the reader must excuse an old mans propensity to gossip if i say a word on the general question of the right of search as for the pretence that was set up by some of the advocates of impressment out of neutral ships which laid down the position that the belligerent being on board in the exercise of an undoubted right to inquire into the character of the ship and cargo he took with him the right to lay hands on all the subjects of his own sovereign he might happen to find there it is not worthy of a serious reply because a man has a right to take the step preliminary to the discharge of an admitted power as an incident of that power it does not follow that he can make the incident a principle and convert it into a justification of acts unlawful in themselves on this head therefore i shall say nothing holding it to be beyond dispute among those who are competent to speak on the subject at all but the abuse of that admitted power to board and ascertain the character of a ship has created so lively a feeling in us americans as to induce us to forego some of the wholesome principles that are necessary to the wellbeing of all civilized nations it is thus in my judgment that we have quite recently and erroneously laid down the doctrine that foreign vessels of war shall not board american ships on the coast of africa in a time of peace in order to ascertain their character  on this subject i intend to speak plainly in the first place i lay no claim to that spurious patriotism which says our country right or wrong this may do for the rabble but it will not do for god to whom our first and highest obligations are due neither country nor man can justify that which is wrong and i conceive it to be wrong in a political if not in a moral sense to deny a vessel of war the privilege which england here claims i can see but one plausible argument against it and that is founded on the abuses which may arise from the practice but it will not do to anticipate abuses in this instance more than in any other every right whether national or international may be abused in its exercise and the argument if good for anything is as good against every other right of international law as it is against this abuse after it has occurred might be a justifiable reason for suspending the exercise of an admitted right until some remedies were applied to prevent their recurrence but it can never be urged as a proper argument against the right itself if abuses occur we can get them remedied by proper representations and if these last fail we have the usual appeal of nations as well might it be said the law of the land shall not be administered because the sheriffs officers are guilty of abuses as to say the law of nations shall cease because we apprehend that certain commercial rivalries may induce others to transcend them when the wrong is done it will be time enough to seek the remedy  that it is the right of a vessel of war to ascertain the character of a ship at sea is dependent on her right to arrest a pirate for instance in what manner can this be done if a pirate can obtain impunity by simply hoisting the flag of some other country which the cruiser is obliged to respect all that the latter asks is the power to ascertain if that flag is not an imposition and this much every regularly commissioned public ship should be permitted to do in the interests of civilization and in maintenance of the police of the seas  the argument on the other side goes the length of saying that a public cruiser is in the situation of a sheriffs officer on shore who is compelled to arrest his prisoner on his own responsibility in the first place it may be questioned if the dogma of the common law which asserts the privilege of the citizen to conceal his name is worthy of a truly enlightened political freedom it must not be forgotten that liberty first took the aspect of franchises in which men sought protection from the abuses of power in any manner they could and often without regarding the justness of the general principles with which they were connected confusion in these principles arising as a consequence but admitting the dogma of the common law to be as inherently wise as it is confessedly a practice there is no parallel in the necessity of the case of an arrest on shore and of an arrest at sea in the former instance the officer may apply to witnesseshe has the man before him and compares him with the description of the criminal and should he make an erroneous arrest under misleading circumstances his punishment would be merely nominalin many cases nothing but the common law whilst it gives the subject this protection does not deny the right of the officer to arrest it only punishes the abuse of this power and that is precisely what nations ought to do in a case of the abuse of the right to examine a merchantman  the vessel of war cannot apply to witnesses and cannot judge of national character by mere external appearances since an americanbuilt ship can be sailed by portuguese the actual necessities of the case are in favour of the present english claim as well as that great governing principle which says that no great or principal right can exist in international law without carrying with it all the subordinate privileges which are necessary to its discreet exercise  thus much i could not refrain from saying not that i think john bull is very often right in his controversies with ourselves but because i think in this case he is and because i believe it far safer in the long run for a nation or an individual to have justice on his side than always to carry his point  i was soon on deck carrying my writingdesk under my arm mr sennit preferring to make his examination in the open air to making it below he read the clearance and manifest with great attention afterwards he asked for the shipping articles i could see that he examined the names of the crew with eagerness for the man was in his element when adding a new hand to his frigates crew  let me see this nebuchadnezzar clawbonny mr wallingford he said chuckling the name has an alias in its very absurdity and i doubt not i shall see a countrymanperhaps a townsman  by turning your head sir you can easily see the man he is at the wheel  a blackumphyes those fellows do sometimes sail under droll titles i do not think the lad was born at gosport  he was born in my fathers house sir and is my slave  slave a pretty word in the mouth of a free and independent son of liberty mr wallingford it is lucky you are not bound to that land of despotism old england or you might see the fetters fall from about the chaps limbs  i was nettled for i felt there was some justice in this sarcasm and this too at the very moment i felt it was only halfmerited and not at all perhaps from an englishman but sennit knew as much of the history of my country as he did of his own having obtained all he had learned of either out of newspapers nevertheless i succeeded in keeping silent  nathan hitchcock this chap has a suspiciously yankee name will you let me see him sir observed the lieutenant  the chaps name then does him no more than justice for i believe he is strictly what we call a yankee  nathan came aft at the call of the secondmate and sennit no sooner saw him than he told him to go forward again it was easy to see that the man was perfectly able to distinguish by means of the eye alone between the people of the two countries though the eye would sometimes deceive even the most practised judges as the speedy was not much in want of men he was disposed not to lay his hands on any but his own countrymen  i shall have to ask you sir to muster all your people in the gangway said sennit rising as he passed me the ships papers i am only a supernumerary of the speedy and i expect we shall soon have the pleasure of seeing her first on board the honourable mr powlett we are a nob ship having lord harry dermond for our captain and lots of younger sons in the cockpit  i cared little who commanded or officered the speedy but i felt all the degradation of submitting to have my crew mustered by a foreign officer and this too with the avowed object of carrying away such portions of them as he might see fit to decide were british subjects in my judgment it would have been much more creditable and much wiser for the young hercules to have made an effort to use his club in resisting such an offensive and unjustifiable assumption of power than to be setting up doubtful claims to establish principles of public law that will render the exercise of some of the most useful of all international rights perfectly nugatory i felt a disposition to refuse compliance with sennits request and did the result only affect myself i think i should have done so but conscious that my men would be the sufferers i thought it more prudent to comply accordingly all the dawns people were ordered to muster near the quarterdeck  while i endeavour to do justice to principles i wish to do no injustice to sennit to own the truth this man picked out the englishman and irishman as soon as each had answered his first questions they were ordered to get their things ready to go on hoard the speedy and i was coolly directed to pay them any wages that might be due marble was standing near when this command was given and seeing disgust most likely in my countenance he took on himself the office of replying  you think accounts should be balanced then before these men quit the ship he asked significantly  i do sir and its my duty to see it done i will thank you to attend to it at once returned the lieutenant  well sir that being the case we shall be receivers instead of payers by looking at the shipping articles you will see that each of these men received fifty dollars or two months advance seamens wages were as high frequently in that day as twenty or thirty dollars and quite half of the deadhorse remains to be worked out we will therefore thank his majesty to pay us the odd twentyfive dollars for each of the men  what countryman are you demanded the lieutenant with a menacing look cornish by your impudence have a care sir i have carried off mates before now in my day  i came from the land of tombstones which is an advantage as i know the road we all must travel sooner or later my name is marble at your service and theres a hard natur under it as youll find on trial  just at this moment the frigates boat came round her stern carrying the hon mr powlett or the gentleman whom sennit had announced as her firstlieutenant i thought the rising anger of the last was a little subdued by the appearance of his senior officers social position and private rank making even a greater difference between the two than mere date of commission sennit suppressed his wrath therefore though i make no doubt the resentment he felt at the contumelious manner of my mate had no little influence on what subsequently occurred as things were he waited before he proceeded any further for the speedys boat to come alongside  mr powlett turned out to be a very different sort of person from his brother lieutenant there was no mistaking him for anything but a gentleman or for a sailor beyond a question he owed his rank in his ship to family influence and he was one of those scions of aristocracy by no means the rule however among the highborn of england who never was fit for anything but a carpetknight though trained to the seas as i afterwards learned his father held high ministerial rank a circumstance that accounted for his being the firstlieutenant of a sixandthirty at twenty with a supernumerary lieutenant under him who had been a sailor some years before he was born but the captain of the speedy himself lord harry dermond was only fourandtwenty though he had commanded his ship two years and fought one very creditable action in her  after making my best bow to mr powlett and receiving a very gentlemanlike salutation in return sennit led his brother officer aside and they had a private conference of some little length together  i shall not meddle with the crew sennit i overheard powlett say in a sort of complaining tone as he walked away from his companion really i cannot become the master of a pressgang though the speedy had to be worked by her officers you are used to this business and i leave it all to you  i understood this to be a carte blanche to sennit to carry off as many of my people as he saw fit there being nothing novel or surprising in mens tolerating in others acts they would disdain to perform in person as soon as he left his junior in rank the youthful firstlieutenant approached me i call him youthful for he appeared even younger than he was though i myself had commanded a ship when only of his own age it was easy to see that this young man felt he was employed on an affair of some importance  it is reported to us on board the speedy sir the hon mr pewlett commenced that you are bound to hamburg  to hamburg sir as my papers will show  our government regards all trade with that part of the continent with great distrust particularly since the late movements of the french i really wish sir you had not been bound to hamburg  i believe hamburg is still a neutral port sir and if it were not i do not see why an american should not enter it until actually blockaded  ah these are some of your very peculiar american ideas on such subjects i cannot agree with you however it being my duty to obey my orders lord harry has desired us to be very rigorous in our examination and i trust you will understand we must comply however unpleasant it may be sir i understand now sugar and coffee are exceedingly suspicious  they are very innocent things rightly used as i hope mine will be  have you any particular interest in the cargo captain wallingford  only that of owner sir both ship and cargo are my own private property  and you seem to be english or americanfor i confess myself unable to tell the difference between the people of the two countries though i dare say there is a very great difference  i am an american by birth as have been my ancestors for generations  i declare that is remarkable well i can see no difference but if you are american i do not see why the sugar and coffee are not american too lord harry however desired us to be very particular about these things for some reason or other do you happen to know now where this sugar grew  the canes of which it was made grew i believe in st domingo  st domingois not that a french island  certainly in part sir though the spaniards and the negroes dispute the possession with the french  i declare i must send lord harry word of this i am exceedingly sorry captain wallingford to detain your ship but my duty requires me to send a young gentleman on board the speedy for orders  as i could urge no plausible objection the young gentleman was again sent back to the frigate in the mean time sennit had not been idle among my crew were a swede and a prussian and both these men having acquired their english in london or liverpool he affected to believe they were natives of the old island ordering them to get their dunnage ready to go under the pennant neither of the men however was disposed to obey him and when i joined the group leaving the hon mr powlett waiting the return of his boat on the quarterdeck i found the three in a warm discussion on the subject  ill tell you what it is mr wallingford sennit cried as i approached we will compromise matters here are two fellows who are lancashire men if the truth were known that pretend to be norwegians or fins or to come from some other outlandish country or other and i wish to place them under his majestys pennant where they properly belong as they are so reluctant to receive this honour i will consent to take that finelooking kentish man who is worth them both put together  as this was said sennit pointed to tom voorhees an athletic handsome young north river man of dutch extraction a fellow who had not a drop of english blood in his veins and the ablestbodied and the best seaman in the dawn a fact that the lieutenants nautical tact had not been slow to detect  you are asking me to let you have a man who was born within ten miles of myself i answered and whose family i know to be american for near two centuries  ay ay youre all of old families in america as everybody knows the chap is english born for a hundred guineas and i could name a spot in kent not ten miles distant from that where he first saw the light i do not say however you were not his neighbourfor you have a dover look yourself  you might be less disposed to pleasantry sir were this a thirtysix or were you and i on shore  sennit gave me a disdainful look and terminated the affair by ordering voorhees to get his chest ready and to join the two other men he had pressed taking example however from the swede and the prussian voorhees walked away using no measures to obey as for myself thoroughly disgusted with this man a vulgar rogue i walked aft to the other lieutenant who was only a gentlemanlike dunce  mr powlett now began to converse of london and he told me how often he had been at the opera when last in townand remarked what an exceedingly delightful fête champêtre was lady somebodys entertainment of that sort this occupied us until the boat returned with a very civil request from the captain of the speedy that i would do him the favour to pay him a visit bringing with me the ships papers as this was what no belligerent had a right to demand though privateersmen constantly did it i could comply or not fancying it might expedite matters regarding the civility of the request as a good omen and feeling a desire to deal with principals in an affair that was very needlessly getting to be serious i consented to go marble was called and formally told to take charge of the ship i could see a smile of contempt on sennits face at this little ceremony though he made no objection in terms i had expected that the firstlieutenant would go to the frigate with me but after a short consultation with his junior the last was deputed to do me this honour  sennit now appeared disposed to show me every slight and indignity it was in his power to manifest like all vulgarminded men he could not refrain from maltreating those whom he designed to injure he made me precede him into the boat and went up the speedys side first himself on reaching that vessel his captains conduct was very different lord harry was not a very noble looking personage as your worshippers of rank imagine nobility to appear but he was decidedly wellmannered and it was easy enough to see he commanded his own ship and was admirably fitted so to do i have had occasion to learn that there is a vast deal of aristocratic and democratic cant on the subject of the appearance abilities qualities and conduct of europeans of birth and station in the first place nature has made them very much as she makes other people and the only physical difference there is proceeds from habit and education then as to the enervating effects of aristocracy and noble effeminacy i have seen ten times as much of it among your counterjumpers and dealers in bob binet as i have seen in the sons of dukes and princes and in my later days circumstances have brought me much in contact with many of these last manliness of character is far more likely to be the concomitant of aristocratic birth than of democratic i am afraid for while those who enjoy the first feel themselves above popular opinion those who possess the last bow to it as the asiatic slave bows to his master i wish i could think otherwise but experience has convinced me of these facts and i have learned to feel the truth of an axiom that is getting to be somewhat familiar among ourselves vizthat it takes an aristocrat to make a true democrat certain i am that all the real manly independent democrats i have ever known in america have been accused of aristocracy and this simply because they were disposed to carry out their principles and not to let that imperious sovereign the neighbourhood play the tyrant over them as for personal merit quite as fair a proportion of talent is found among the wellborn as among the low and he is but an ad captandum vulgus sort of a philosopher who holds the contrary doctrine talleyrand was of one of the most ancient and illustrious houses of europe as was turenne while mansfield erskine grey wellington and a host of englishmen of mark of our time come of noble blood nonothe cause of free institutions has much higher and much juster distinctions to boast of than this imaginary superiority of the humbly born over those who come of ancient stock  lord harry dermond received me just as one of his station ought to receive one of mine politely without in the least compromising his own dignity there was a goodnatured smile on his face of which at first i did not know what to make he had a private conversation with sennit too but the smile underwent no change in the end i came to the conclusion that it was habitual with him and meant nothing but though so much disposed to smile lord harry dermond was equally disposed to listen to every suggestion of sennit that was likely to favour the main chance prizemoney is certainly a great stain on the chivalry of all navies but it is a stain with which the noble wishes to be as deeply dyed as the plebeian human nature is singularly homogeneous on the subject of money and youngerson nature in the lands of majorats and entails enjoys a liveliness of longing on the subject that is quite as conspicuous as the rapacity of the veriest plebeian who ever picked a pocket  i am very sorry captain wallingford captain lord harry dermond observed to me when his private conference with sennit was ended and altogether superior to the weakness of powlett who would have discussed the point that it is my duty to send your ship into plymouth the french have got such an ascendency on the continent that we are obliged to use every act of vigilance to counteract them then your cargo is of enemys growth  as for the ascendency my lord you will see we americans have nothing to do with it and my cargo being necessarily of last years crops must have been grown and manufactured in a time of general peace if it were not i do not conceive it would legalize my capture  we must leave sir william scott to decide that my good sir answered the captainwith his customary smile and there is no use in our discussing the matter an unpleasant dutyas if he thought the chance of putting two or three thousand pounds in his pocket unpleasantan unpleasant duty however need not be performed in a disagreeable manner if you will point out what portion of your people you could wish to keep in your ship it shall be attended to of course you remain by your property your self and i confess whatever may be done with the cargo i think the ship will be liberated as the day is advancing and it will require some little time to exchange the people i should be exceedingly happy if you would do me the favour to lunch in my cabin  this was gentlemanly conduct if it were not lawful i could foresee a plenty of evil consequences to myself in the delay though i own i had no great apprehensions of a condemnation there was my note to john wallingford to meet and two months detention might keep me so long from home as to put the payment at maturity quite out of the question then came the mortgage on clawbonny with its disquieting pictures and i was in anything but a good humour to enjoy lord harry dermonds hospitality still i knew the uselessness of remonstrances and the want of dignity there would be in repining and succeeded in putting a good face on the matter i simply requested that my chief mate the cook and neb might be left in the dawn submitting it to the discretion of my captors to take out of her as many of the remainder of her people as they saw fit lord harry remarked it was not usual to leave a mate but to oblige me he would comply the frigate would go in for water in the course of a fortnight when i might depend on having the entire crew his majestys subjects excepted restored to my command    chapter xiv      1st gent what is my ransom master let me know   mast a thousand crowns or else lay down your head   mate and so much shall you give or off goes yours    king henry vi   i never saw a man more astounded or better disposed to fly into a passion than was the case with mr moses oloff van duzen marble when he was told that the dawn was to be sent into england for adjudication nothing kept his tongue within the bounds of moderation and i am far from certain i might not add his fists but my assurances he would be sent on board the speedy unless he behaved with prudence as our people were sent out of the ship i thought several times he would break out in open hostilities and he did actually propose to me to knock sennit down and throw him overboard with a significant look i told him it was not time for this the mate now laid a finger on his nose winked and from that moment he not only seemed cheerful but he assisted in hoisting in and out the different articles that were exchanged in shifting the crews  when all was ready it appeared that sennit was to be our prizemaster although a lieutenant in commission he had only been lent to lord harry dermond by the admiral in order to fill up the crew of that favoured officer the speedy having her regular complement of lieutenants without him as the cruise was so nearly up and the ship had experienced great success in impressing since she sailed sennit could be spared and if the truth were said i make no doubt his messmates in the frigate were glad to be rid of him now they had no further occasion for his peculiar skill and services  mr sennit brought on board with him as a prizecrew ten foremast men besides a mastersmate of the name of diggens under ordinary circumstances this last dignitary would have been of sufficient skill to take the ship in but this was the first prize lord harry had taken she promised to be valuable if condemned and i suppose he and his young gentlemanlike luffs were desirous of getting rid of their vulgar associate at any rate messrs sennit and diggens both came on board us bag and baggage  the various changes the lunch and the chase of the morning had so far worn away the day that the two vessels did not make sail until four oclock pm when both ships filled at the same time the speedy on a wind with two reefs in her topsails as when first seen to play about for more prizes and the dawn under studdingsails with the wind nearly over the taffrail when all was ready each ship started away from the vacant point on the ocean where they had been lying for hours moving on diverging lines at a rate that soon put a wide expanse of water between them  i felt the circumstance of being left under the command of such a man as sennit almost as sensibly as i felt the loss of my ship he and the mate established themselves in my cabin within the first hour in a way that would have brought about an explosion had not policy forbade it on my part sennit even took possession of my stateroom in which he ordered his own cot to be swung and from which he coolly directed my mattress to be removed as the lockers were under locks and keys i permitted him to take possession without a remonstrance diggens stowed his bedding in marbles berth leaving my mate and myself to shift for ourselves at a suggestion from marble i affected great indignation at this treatment directing neb to clear away a place in the steerage in which to live and to swing hammocks there for marble and myself this movement had some effect on sennit who was anxious to get at the smallstores all of which were under good locks and locks that he did not dare violate under an order from the admiralty it was therefore of much importance to him to belong to my mess and the necessity of doing something to appease my resentment became immediately apparent to him he made some apologies for his cavalier conduct justifying what he had done on the score of his rank and the usages of navies and i thought it prudent to receive his excuses in a way to avoid an open rupture sennit was left in possession of the stateroom but i remained in the steerage consenting however to mess in the cabin this arrangement which was altogether premeditated on my part gave me many opportunities of consulting privately with marble and of making sundry preparations for profiting by the first occasion that should offer to retake the ship in that day recaptures were of pretty frequent occurrence and i no sooner understood the dawn was to be sent in than i began to reflect on the means of effecting my purpose marble had been kept in the ship by me expressly with this object  i suppose the reader to have a general idea of the position of the vessel as well as of the circumstances in which she was placed we were just three hundred and fiftytwo miles to the southward and westward of scilly when i observed at meridian and the wind blowing fresh from the southsouthwest there was no time to lose did i meditate anything serious against the prize crew the first occasion that presented to speak to my mate offered while we were busy together in the steerage stowing away our effects and in making such dispositions as we could to be comfortable  what think you moses of this mr sennit and his people i asked in a low voice leaning forward on a watercask in order to get my head nearer to that of the mate they do not look like firstrate manofwarsmen by activity and surprise could we not handle them  marble laid a finger on his nose winked looked as sagacious as he knew how and then went to the steerage door which communicated with the companionway to listen if all were safe in that quarter assured that there was no one near he communicated his thoughts as follows  the same idee has been at work here he said tapping his forehead with a forefinger and good may come of it this mr sennit is a cunning chap and will want good looking after but his mate drinks like a coalheaver i can see that in his whole face a toplantern is not lighter he must be handled by brandy then a more awkward set of longshore fellows were never sent to manage a squarerigged craft than these which have been sent from the speedy they must have given us the very sweepings of the hold  you know how it is with these dashing young manofwar captains they keep all their best materials for a fight french frigates are tolerably plenty they tell me and this lord harry dermond much as he loves sugar and coffee would like to fall in with a la vigilante or a la diane of equal force far better this is the secret of his giving sennit such a set of raw ones besides he supposes the dawn will be at plymouth in eightandforty hours as will certainly be the case should this wind stand  the fellows are just so many london loafers i have always thought marble had the merit of bringing this word into fashion there are but three seamen among them and they are more fit for a hospital than for a lowyeryard or a jibboom  there was a good deal of truth blended with some exaggeration mixed up with this statement of tire mate as a matter of course the captain of the speedy had not sent away his best men though they were not quite as bad as marble in his desire to overcome them was disposed to fancy it is true there were but three of their number whom the quick nautical instinct of the mate had recognised as real seamen though all had been on board ship long enough to render them more or less useful  whatever we do must be done at once i rejoined we are four athletic men to act against twelve the odds are heavy but we shall have the advantage of being picked men and of attacking by surprise  i wish you had thought of asking to keep voorhees in the ship miles that fellow would be worth three ordinary men to us  i did think of it but the request would never have been granted one could ask for a cook or a mate or a servant like neb but to ask for an able seaman or two would have been to declare our object  i believe youre right and we must be thankful for the good stuff we have as it is how far will the law bear us out in knocking men on the head in such an undertaking its peace for america and we must steer clear of piracy  ive thought of all that moses and see no great cause of apprehension a man has certainly a right to recover that by the strong hand which he lost by the strong hand should blood be spilt which i hope to avert the english courts might judge us harshly while the american would acquit us the law would be the same in both cases though its administration would be very different i am ready to cast my own fortune on the issue and i wish no man to join me who will not do so heart and hand i see no reason to suppose it will be necessary to take life to which i have as strong reluctance as you can have yourself  theres my hand exclaimed marble and as for its owners heart you well know where that is to be found miles enough has been said for a beginning we will look about us this afternoon and talk further after supper  good do you say a word to billings the cook and i will open the matter to neb of the last we are certain but it may be well to make some promises to your man  leave that to me miles i know my chap and will deal with him as i would with an owner  marble and myself now separated and i went on deck to observe how things promised in that quarter by this time the speedys topsails were beginning to dip and the dawn was driving forward on her course with everything drawing that she could carry all the english were on deck sennit included the last gave me a sufficiently civil salute as i put my foot on the quarterdeck but i avoided falling into any discourse with him my cue was to note the men and to ascertain all i could concerning their distribution during the approaching night diggens i could see was a redfaced fellow who probably had lost his promotion through love of the bottle though as often happens with such persons a prime seaman and a thorough manofwarsman of him i thought i could make sure by means of brandy sennit struck me as being a much more difficult subject to get along with there were signs of cogniac about his face too but he had more rank more at stake and brighter hopes than the mastersmate then he was evidently better practised in the ways of the world than his companion and had constantly a sort of uneasy vigilance about his eye and manner that gave me no little concern  it was my wish to strike a blow if possible that very night every minute carrying us fast towards the chops of the channel where the english had so many cruisers in general as to render ultimate escape next to impossible should we even be so lucky as to regain command of our own ship i was afraid moreover sennit might take it into his head to have all hands all night under the pretext of drawing in with the land should he actually adopt this course our case was nearly hopeless  your mate seems to love the cupboard mr wallingford sennit remarked to me in a goodnatured manner with an evident wish to establish still more amicable relations between us than had yet existed he has been in and about that galley these ten minutes fidgeting with his tinpot like a raw hand who misses his mothers tea  sennit laughed at his own humour and i could hardly answer with a smile for i knew my mate had adopted this experiment to open communications with the cook  mr marble is famous for his love of slops i answered evasively  well he does not look it i have seldom seen a more thoroughlooking seadog than your mate captain wallingfordthis was the first time sennit had dignified me with this titleand i took a fancy to him on that account as soon as i saw him you will do me the favour to sup with us in the cabin i hope for i see signs at the galley that it will soon be ready  i shall expect to join your mess sir now explanations have passed between us i suppose my mate is to be one of my party as well as yours  certainly i shall ask the favour of you to let mr marble relieve diggens for half an hour or so while the poor fellow gets a bite well do as much for you another time  this was said in a dry laughing sort of a way which showed that mr sennit was fully aware he was making a request a little out of rule to ask a man to aid in carrying his own ship into port as a prize but i took it as it was meant for a rough joke that had convenience at the bottom  it was not long ere neb came to announce that supper was ready sennit had made but an indifferent dinner it would seem and he appeared every way disposed to take his revenge on the present occasion calling out to me to follow he led the way cheerfully into the cabin professing great satisfaction at finding we were to make but one mess of it strictly speaking a prize crew under circumstances like those in which the dawn was now placed had no right to consume any portion of the vessels own stores condemnation being indispensable to legalize lord harry dermonds course even according to the laws of his own country but i had ordered neb to be liberal with my means and a very respectable entertainment was spread before our eyes when we reached the cabin sennit was soon hard at work but under pretence of looking for some better sugar than had been placed on the table i got three bottles of brandy privately into nebs hands whispering him to give one to the mastersmate on deck and the other two to the crew i knew there were too many motives for such a bribe connected with our treatment the care of our private property and other things of that nature to feel any apprehension that the true object of this liberality would be suspected by those who were to reap its advantages  sennit marble and myself sate quite an hour at table the former drank freely of wine though he declined having anything to do with the brandy as he had taken two or three glasses of the rejected liquor in my presence before the two ships parted i was convinced his present forbearance proceeded from a consciousness of the delicate circumstances in which he was placed and i became rather more wary in my own movements at length the lieutenant said something about the poor devil on deck and marble was sent up to look out for the ship while diggens came below to eat the instant the mastersmate appeared i could see the brandy had been doing its work on him and i was fearful his superior might notice it he did not however being too well pleased with the madeira i had set before him to trouble himself about a few drams more or less that might have fallen to the share of his subordinate  at length this memorable supper like everything else of earth came to an end and all of us went on deck in a body leaving neb and the cook to clear away the fragments it was now night though a soft starlight was diffused over the surface of the rolling water the wind had moderated a little and the darkness promised to pass without any extra labour to the people several of the studdingsails having been taken in by diggens orders when he first went below  when seamen first come on deck at sea there is usually a pause in the discourse while each notes the weather the situation of the ship and the signs of the hour sennit and myself did this almost as a matter of course separating in order that each might make his observations at leisure as for marble he gave up the command of the deck to diggens walking forward by himself neb and the cook were keeping up the customary clattering with plates knives and forks  have the people had their suppers yet mr diggens demanded the lieutenant  not yet sir we have no cook of our own you know sir and so have been obliged to wait sir  the kings men wait for nobody order that black fellow to let them have their suppers at once while that is doing well tell off the watches for the night  diggens was evidently getting more and more under the influence of brandy keeping the bottle hid somewhere near him by which means he took frequent draughts unperceived he gave the necessary orders notwithstanding and presently the men were mustered aft to be told off into the two watches that were required for the service of the ship this was soon done sennit choosing five and diggens his five  its past eight oclock said sennit when the selections were made go below the watch and all but the man at the wheel of the watch on deck can go below to the lights to eat bear a hand with your suppers my lads this is too big a craft to be left without lookouts forward though i dare say the yankees will lend us a hand while you are swallowing a mouthful  to be sure we will sir cried marble who had come to the gangway to witness the proceedings here you nebcome out of that galley and play forecastleman while john bull gets his supper hes always cross when hes hungry and well feed him well to make a good neighbourhood  this caused some who heard it to laugh and others to swear and mutter every one nevertheless appeared willing to profit by the arrangement the englishmen being soon below hard at work around the kids it now struck me that marble intended to clap the forecastlehatch down suddenly and make a rush upon the prize officers and the man at the wheel leaving one hand to secure the scuttle we should have been just a man apiece for those on deck and i make no doubt the project would have succeeded had it been attempted in that mode i was by nature a stronger man than sennit besides being younger and in my prime while diggens would not have been more than a child in marbles hands as for the man at the wheel neb could have thrown him halfway up to the mizentop on an emergency but it seemed that my mate had a deeper project in view nor was the other absolutely certain as i afterwards learned one of the englishmen soon coming out of the forecastle to eat on deck quite likely aware that there might be some risk in letting all hands remain below  it was now sufficiently dark for our purposes and i began to reflect seriously on the best mode of proceeding when all at once a heavy splash in the water was heard and marble was heard shouting man overboard  sennit and i ran to the lee mainrigging where we just got a glimpse of the hat of the poor fellow who seemed to be swimming manfully as the ship foamed past him  starboard your helm shouted marblestarboard your helm come to these forebraces nebbear a hand this away you cook captain wallingford please lend us a pull look out for the boat mr sennit well take care of the headyards  now all this had been regularly concocted in the mates mind in advance by these means he not only managed to get all our people together but he got them away from the boat the whole was done so naturally as to prevent the smallest suspicion of any design to do sennit justice i must acknowledge that he behaved himself particularly well on this sudden appeal to his activity and decision the loss of a man was to him a matter of deep moment all his habits and propensities inclining him to be solicitous about the manning of ships a man saved was as good as a man impressed and he was the first person in the boat by the time the ship had lost her way the boat was ready and i heard sennit call out the order to lower as for us americans we had our hands full to get the headyards braced up in time and to settle away the topgallant halyards aft in order to save the spars in two minutes however the dawn resembled a steed that had suddenly thrown his rider diverging from his course and shooting athwart the field at right angles to his former track scenting and snuffing the air forward all was full but the afteryard having been square from the first their sails lay aback and the ship was slowly forging ahead with the seas slapping against her bows as if the last were admonishing her to stop  i now walked aft to the taffrail in order to make certain of the state of things just as i reached the stern sennit was encouraging the men to give way with the oar i saw that he had six of his people with him and no doubt six of his best menthe boldest and most active being always the most forward on such occasions there was no time to be lost and i turned to look for marble he was at my elbow having sought me with the same object we walked away from the man at the wheel together to get out of earshot  nows your time miles the mate muttered slipping one of my own pistols into my hands as he spokethat mastersmate is as muzzy as a tapster at midnight and i can make him do what i please neb has his orders and the cook is ready and willing you have only to say the word to begin  there seems little necessity for bloodshed i answered if you have the other pistol do not use it unnecessarily we may want it for the boat  boat interrupted marble what more have we to do with the boat nonomiles let this mr sennit go to england where he belongs now see how ill manage diggens he added i want to get a luff purchase up out of the forecastlewill you just order two or three of your fellows forward to go down and pass it up for me  dye hear there forward called out diggens with a very thick tonguetumble down into that forecastle three or four of you and pass up the tackle for mr marble  now there were but three of the englishmen left in the ship exclusively of the mastersmate himself and the man at the wheel this order consequently sent all three immediately into the forecastle marble coolly drew over the hatch secured it ordered the cook to keep a general lookout forward and walking aft as if nothing occurred said in his quiet way  the ships yours again captain wallingford  mr diggens i said approaching the mastersmate as i have a necessity for this vessel which is my property if you please sir ill now take charge of her in person you had better go below and make yourself comfortable there is good brandy to be had for the asking and you may pass an agreeable evening and turn in whenever it suits you  diggens was a sot and a fool but he did not want for pluck his first disposition was to give battle beginning to call out for his men to come to his assistance but i put an end to this by seizing him by the collar and dropping him a little unceremoniously down the companionway half an hour later he was dead drunk and snoring on the cabin floor  there remained only the man at the wheel to overcome he was a seaman of course and one of those quiet orderly men who usually submit to the powers that be approaching him i said  you see how it is my lad the ship has again changed owners as for you you shall be treated as you behave stand to the wheel and youll get good treatment and plenty of grog but by becoming fractious youll find yourself in irons before you know where you are  ayay sir answered the man touching his hat and contenting himself with this brief and customary reply  now mr marble i continued it is time to have an eye on the boat which will soon find the man or give him up i own that i wish we had recovered the ship without tossing the poor fellow overboard  fellow overboard cried marble laughingid ha thrown all england into the sea had it been necessary and in my power but it wasnt necessary to throw overboard so much as a child the chap theyre arter is nothing but one of the fenders with the deep sea lashed to its smaller end and a tarpaulin stopped on the larger mr sennit need be in no great hurry for ill engage his man overboard will float as long as his yawl  the whole of marbles expedient was thus explained and i confess i was much relieved by a knowledge of the truth apart from the general relief that accompanied the consciousness of not having taken human life should we again fall into english hands a thing by no means improbable in the situation in which we were placed this circumstance might be of the last importance to us in the mean time however i had to look to the boat and the ship  the first thing we did was to clew up the three topgallantsails this gave us a much easier command of the vessel shorthanded as we were and it rendered it less hazardous to the spars to keep the dawn on a wind when this was done i ordered the afterbraces manned and the leaches brought as near as possible to touching it was time for the oars were heard and then i got a view of the boat as it came glancing down on our weather quarter i instantly gave the order to fill the after sails and to keep the ship full and by the braces were manned as well as they could be by marble neb and the cook while i kept an eye on the boat with an occasional glance at the man at the wheel  boat ahoy i hailed as soon as the lieutenant got near enough for conversation  ay boat ahoy sure enough growled sennit some gentlemans back will pay for this trick the man overboard is nothing but a dd paddy made out of a fender with a tarpaulin truck i suspect your mate of this mr wallingford  my mate owns the offence sir it was committed to get you out of the ship while we took charge of her again the dawn is under my orders once more mr sennit and before i permit you to come on board her again we must have an understanding on the subject  a long meaning whistle with a muttered oath or two satisfied me that the lieutenant had not the slightest suspicion of the truth until it was thus abruptly announced to him by this time the boat was under our stern where she was brought in order to be hooked on the men intending to come up by the tackles for this i cared not however it being an easy matter for me standing on the taffrail to knock any one on the head who should attempt to board us in that fashion by way of additional security however neb was called to the wheel marble taking the english sailor forward to help haul the bowlines and trim the yards the ship beginning to gather way too i threw sennit the end of a lowerstuddingsail halyards that were brought aft for the purpose ordered his bowman to let go his hold of the tackle and dropped the boat a safe towing distance astern neb being ordered to keep the weather leaches touching just way enough was got on the ship to carry out the whole of this plan without risk to anybody  youll not think of leaving us out here on the atlantic mr wallingford five hundred miles from the lands end sennit at length called out time having been taken to chew the cud of reflection  thats as you behave sir i wish you no harm personally mr sennit though i much wish my own ship the night promises to be good and the wind is moderating so that the boat will be perfectly safe i will have you hauled up and we will throw you a spare sail for a covering and you will have the consolation of knowing that we shall have to keep watch while you are sleeping  ay sir i understand it all jobs comfort that will be as i do not suppose you are to be coaxed out of the advantage you have obtained we have no choice but compliance give us some food and water in addition and for gods sake dont cast us adrift in this boat so far from land  i gave sennit an assurance that we would take care of him and orders were issued to comply with his wishes we passed the sail into the boat and lowered a breadbag a kid full of beef and pork and a breaker of fresh water i took all these precautions the more readily as i did not know but we might be compelled to cast the boat adrift and one would not wish to resort to such a step without desiring to leave his crew the best possible chance for their lives i will do marble the justice to say he was active in making these arrangements though had the question of destroying the entire prizecrew presented itself on one side and that of losing the ship on the other he would not have hesitated about sinking great britain itself were it possible to achieve the last i was more human and felt exceedingly relieved when i again found myself in command of the dawn after an interregnum of less than ten hours without a drop of blood having been spilled  as soon as everything required was passed into the boat she was dropped astern nearly to the whole length of the studdingsail halyards this would make her tow more safely to both parties to those in her because there was less risk of the ships dragging her under and to ourselves because it removed all danger of the englishmens returning our favour by effecting a surprise in their turn at such a distance from the ship there would always be time for us to rally and defeat any attempt to get alongside    chapter xv      capt and as for these whose ransome we have set   it is our pleasure one of them depart   therefore come you with us and let him go    king henry vi   by such simple means and without resistance as it might be did i recover the possession of my ship the dawn but now that the good vessel was in my power it was by no means an easy thing to say what was to be done with her we were just on the verge of the ground occupied by the channel cruisers and it was preposterous to think of running the gauntlet among so many craft with the expectation of escaping it is true we might fall in with twenty english manofwar vessels before we met with another speedy to seize us and order us into plymouth had everything been in order and in the usual state but no cruiser would or could board us and not demand the reasons why so large a ship should be navigated by so small a crew it was over matters like these that marble and i now consulted no one being on the quarterdeck but the mate who stood at the wheel and myself the cook was keeping a lookout on the forecastle the englishman had lain down in full view by my orders at the foot of the mainmast while neb ever ready to sleep when not on duty was catching a nap on the booms  we have got the ship moses i commenced and the question next arises what we are to do with her  carry her to her port of destination captain wallingford to be sure what else can we do with her sir  ay that is well enough if it can be done but in addition to the difficulty of four mens taking care of a craft of five hundred tons we have a sea before us that is covered with english cruisers  as for the four men you may safely set us down as eight ill engage we do as much in a blow as eight such fellows as are picked up nowadays long shore the men of the present time are mere children to those one met with in my youth miles  neither neb nor the cook nor i am a man of other times but are all men of today so you must call us but three after all i know we can do much but a gale may come that would teach us our insignificance as it is we are barely able to furl the maintopgallantsail in a squall leaving one hand at the wheel and another to let go rigging no no moses we must admit we are rather shorthanded putting the best face on the matter  if you generalize in that mode miles my dear boy i must allow that we are we can go up channel and ten chances to one but we fall in with some yankee who will lend us a hand or two  we shall be twice as likely to meet with king georges ships who will overhaul our articles and want to know what has become of the rest of our people  then well tell em that the rest of the crew has been pressed they know their own tricks too well not to see the reasonableness of such an idee  no officer would leave a vessel of this size with only her master mate cook and one man to take care of her even had he found a crew of deserters from his own ship in her in such a case and admitting a right to impress from a foreigner at all it would be his duty to send a party to carry the craft into port no no moseswe must give all the english a wide berth now or they will walk us into plymouth yet  blast the hole i was in it a prisoner during the revvylushun and never want to see its face agin theyve got what they call the mill prison there and its a mill that does grinding less to my taste than the thing of yourn at clawbonny why not go northabout miles there must be few cruisers up thataway  the road is too long the weather is apt to be too thick and the coast is too dangerous for us moses we have but two expedients to choose betweento turn our heads to the westward and try to get home trusting to luck to bring us up with some american who will help us or steer due east and run for a french portbordeaux for instancewhere we might either dispose of the cargo or ship a new crew and sail for our port of destination  then try the last by all means with this wind we might shove the ship in with the land in the course of two or three days and go clear of everything i like the idee and think it can be carried out burdux is always full of americans and there must be men enough to be had for the asking knocking about the quays  after a little further conversation we determined on this plan and set about carrying it into execution on the spot in roundingto the ship had been brought by the wind on the larboard tack and was standing to the northward and westward instead of to the eastward the course we now wished to steer it was necessary therefore to ware round and get the ships head in the right direction this was not a difficult manoeuvre at all and the englishman helping us with seeming goodwill it was soon successfully executed when this was accomplished i sent the english sailor into the cabin to keep diggens company and we set a watch on deck of two and two marble and myself taking charge four hours and four hours in the old mode  i acknowledge that i slept little that night two or three limes we detected sennit attempting to haul close up under the ships stern out of all question with a view to surprise us but as often would he drop to the length of his towrope us he saw marbles head or mine watching him above the taffrail when the day dawned i was called and was up and on the lookout as our horizon enlarged and brightened round the ship the great object was to ascertain as early as possible what vessels might be in our neighbourhood  but a solitary sail was visible she appeared to be a ship of size closehauled heading to the southward and eastward by steering on our proper course or certainly by diverging a little to the northward it would be an easy matter to speak her as i could plainly see she was not a ship of war my plan was formed in a moment on communicating it to marble it met with his entire approbation measures were taken accordingly to carry it into immediate execution  in the first place i ordered sennit who was awake and had been i believe the whole night to haul the boat up and to lay hold of one of the boattackles this he did willingly enough no doubt expecting that he was to be received into the ship under a treaty i stood on the lookout to prevent an attack one man being abundantly able to keep at bay a dozen who could approach only by ascending a rope hand over hand while marble went below to look after the two worthies who had been snoring all night in the cabin in a minute my mate reappeared leading up the seaman who was still more asleep than awake this man was directed to lay hold of the tackle and slide down into the boat there being no remedy and descending being far easier than ascending this exploit was soon performed and we were well rid of one of our enemies sennit now began to remonstrate and to point out the danger there was of being towed under the ship going through the water the whole time at the rate of five or six knots i knew however that the english were too skilful to run the risk of being drowned unnecessarily and that they would let go of the tackle before they would suffer the boat to be swamped it was ticklish work i allow but they succeeded surprisingly well in taking care of themselves  we had more difficulty with diggens this fellow had been so beastly drunk that he scarce knew what he was about when awoke and marble rather dragged him on deck and aft to the taffrail than assisted him to walk there we got him at last and he was soon dangling by the tackle so stupid and enervated was the masters mate however that he let go his hold and went into the ocean the souse did him good i make no doubt and his life was saved by his friends one of the sailors catching him by the collar and raising him into the boat  sennit availed himself of this accident to make further remonstrances on the subject of having any more men put in the boat it was easy to see it was as much his policy to get everybody out of that little conveyance as it was mine to get all the english into her  for gods sake captain wallingford knock off with this if you please cried the lieutenant with a most imploring sort of civility of manneryou see how it is we can barely keep the boat from swamping with the number we have in her and a dozen times during the night i thought the ship would drag her under nothing can be easier than for you to secure us all if you will let us come on board one at a time  i do not wish to see you in irons mr sennit and this will remove any necessity for resorting to an expedient so unpleasant hold on upon the tackle therefore as i shall feel obliged to cast you off entirely unless you obey orders  this threat had the desired effect one by one the men were let up out of the forecastle and sent into the boat cooked meat bread rum and water were supplied to the english and to be ready to meet any accident we lowered them a compass and sennits quadrant we did the last at his own earnest request for he seemed to suspect we intended sending him adrift as indeed was my plan at the proper moment  although the boat had now twelve men in her she was in no danger being a stout buoyant sixoared yawl that might have held twenty on an emergency the weather looked promising toothe wind being just a good topgallant breeze for a ship steering full and by the only thing about which i had any qualms was the circumstance that southwest winds were apt to bring mists and that the boat might thus be lost the emergency nevertheless was one that justified some risks and i pursued my plan steadily  as soon as all the english were in the boat and well provided with necessaries we felt at more liberty to move about the ship and exert ourselves in taking care of her the man at the wheel could keep an eye on the enemythe dawn steering like a pilotboat neb was sent aloft to do certain necessary duty and the topgallantsails being loose the clewlines were overhauled and the sails set i did this more to prevent the english ship from suspecting something wrong at seeing a vessel running off before the wind under such short canvass than from any desire to get ahead since we were already going so fast as to render it probable we should pass the other vessel unless we altered our course to meet her  diogenes billings the cook had now a little leisure to serve us a warm breakfast if mr sennit were living i think he would do us the justice to say he was not forgotten we sent the people in the boat some good hot coffee well sweetened and they had a fair share of the other comfortable eatables of which we partook ourselves we also got out and sent them the masts and regular sails of the boat which was fitted to carry two sprits  by this time the stranger ship was within two leagues of us and it became necessary to act i sent marble aloft to examine the horizon and he came down to report nothing else was in sight this boded well i proceeded at once to the taffrail where i hailed the boat desiring sennit to haul her up within comfortable conversing distance this was done immediately  mr sennit i commenced it is necessary for us to part here the ship in sight is english and will take you up i intend to speak her and will take care that she knows where you are by standing due east you will easily cut her off and there cannot be a doubt of her picking you up  for heavens sake consider a moment capt wallingford sennit exclaimed before you abandon us out here a thousand miles from land  you are just three hundred and twentysix miles from scilly and not much more from the lands end mr sennit with a wind blowing dead for both then your own countrymen will pick you up of a certainty and carry you safe into port  ayinto one of the westindia islands if an englishman at all yonder vessel is a running westindiaman she may take us all the way to jamaica  well then you will have an opportunity of returning at your leisure you wished to take me almost as much out of my course or if not absolutely out of my course quite as much out of my time i have as little relish for plymouth as you seem to have for jamaica  but the stranger may be a frenchmannow i look at him he has a french look  if he should be french he will treat you well it will be exchanging beef for soupmaigre for a week or two these frenchmen eat and drink as well as you english  but capt wallingford their prisons this fellow bonaparte exchanges nobody this war and if i get into france i am a ruined man  and if i had gone into plymouth i fear i should have been a ruined man too  remember we are of the same blood after allpeople of the same stockjust as much countrymen as the natives of kent and suffolk old saxon blood both of us  thank you sir i shall not deny the relationship since it is your pleasure to claim it i marvel however you did not let your cousins ship pass without detaining her  how could i help it my dear wallingford lord harry is a nobleman and a captain and what could a poor devil of a lieutenant whose commission is not a year old do against such odds nonothere should be more feeling and goodfellowship between chaps like you and me who have their way to make in the world  you remind me of the necessity of being in motionadieu mr sennitcut moses  marble struck a blow with the axe onthe studdingsail halyards and away the dawn glided leaving the boat tossing on the waves twenty fathoms further astern on the very first send of the sea what mr sennit said i could not hear now but i very plainly saw him shake his fist at me and his head too and i make no manner of doubt if he called me anything that he did not call me a gentleman in ten minutes the boat was fully a mile astern at first sennit did not appear disposed to do anything lying motionless on the water in sullen stillness but wiser thoughts succeeded and stepping his two masts in less than twenty minutes i saw his sails spread and the boat making the best of its way to get into the track of the stranger  it had been my intention originally to speak the strange ship as i had told sennit but seeing there was no probability of her altering her course so as to pass the boat i changed my purpose and stood directly athwart her forefoot at about half a miles distance i set the yankee bunting and she showed the english ensign in return had she been french however it would have made no odds to me for what did i care about my late captors becoming prisoners of war they had endeavoured to benefit themselves at my cost and i was willing enough to benefit myself at theirs  we made our preparations for setting studding sails now though i thought there were signs of a desire in the englishman to speak me i knew he must be armed and felt no wish to gratify him inasmuch as he might take it into his head to make some inquiries concerning the boat which if not already visible from his decks soon must be i was certain the dawn deep as she was would go four feet to the indiamans three and once past him i had no apprehensions in the event of a chase  the english ship caught sight of the boat when we were about a mile on his lee quarter with lower and topmast studdingsails set going quite eight knots on a due east course we became aware of the fact by her hoisting a jack at the fore from that moment i gave myself no concern on the subject of sennit and his prizecrew twenty minutes later we saw the ship back her maintopsail and by means of the glasses we plainly perceived the boat alongside of her after some delay the yawl was hoisted on the deck of the ship and the latter filled her topsail i had some curiosity to ascertain what would come next it would seem that sennit actually induced the master of the westindiaman to give chase for no sooner did the vessel gather way than she bore up after us packing on everything that would draw we were greatly rejoiced at having improved the leisure time in making sail ourselves for having a lower studdingsail and two topmast studdingsails on the ship when this race began i did not feel much apprehension of being overtaken by way of making more sure of an escape however we set the royals  when the westindiaman bore up in chase we were about two leagues ahead of our pursuer so far from lessening this distance though she carried royal studdingsails we gradually increased it to three until satisfied he could do nothing the master of the strange ship took in his light sails and hauled by the wind again carrying the late prizecrew in a direct line from england i afterwards learned that sennit and his companions were actually landed in the island of barbadoes after a pleasant passage of only twentysix days i make no doubt it took them much longer to get back again for it was certain not one of them had reappeared in england six months from that day  we now had the ship to ourselves though with a very diminished crew the day was the time to sleep and relieving each other at the wheel those who were off duty slept most of the time when they were not eating at six in the evening however all hands were up making our preparations for the night  at that hour the wind was steady and favourable the horizon clear of vessels of every sort and the prospects of a pleasant night were sufficiently good the run in the course of the day was equal to one hundred miles and i computed the distance to brest at something less than four hundred miles by getting in nearer with the land i should have the option of standing for any french port i pleased that lay between cherbouig and bayonne  well moses i observed to my old friend and shipmate when we had finished our survey this looks promising as long as the wind remains in this quarter we shall do well enough should we actually get in safely i shall not regret the delay the credit of having done so good a thing and of having done it so well being worth as much to me as any interest on capital or wear and tear of gear can possibly be as for mr sennit i fancy he is some sixty or eighty miles off here at the southward and westward and weve done with him for the voyage  suppose he should fall in with the speedy and report what has happened miles returned the mate i have been calculating that chance the stranger was standing directly for the frigates cruising ground and he may meet her we will not halloo till were out of the woods  that risk is so remote i shall not let it give me any trouble it is my intention to run in for the land at our fastest rate of sailing and then profit by the best wind that offers to get into the nearest haven if you can suggest a better scheme moses i invite you to speak  marble assented though i perceived he was not entirely free from the apprehension he had named until the next morning arrived bringing with it no change and still leaving us a clear sea that day and the succeeding night too we made a capital run and at meridian of the third day after the recapture of the dawn i calculated our position to be just one hundred and four miles to the southward and eastward of ushant the wind had shifted however and it had just come out light at northeast we went to work all hands of us to get in the studdingsails and to brace up and haul aft an operation that consumed nearly two hours we were so busily employed indeed as to have little or no time to look about us and my surprise was the less therefore when the cook called out sail ho i was busy trimming the mainyard when this announcement was made and looking up i saw a lugger standing towards us and already within long gunshot i afterwards ascertained that perceiving us to be approaching her this craft had lain like a snake in the grass under bare poles until she thought us sufficiently near when she made sail in chase i saw at a glance several important facts in the first place the lugger was french beyond all dispute in the second she was a cruiser public or private in the third escape from her under any circumstances was highly improbable under those which actually existed impossible but why should we endeavour to escape from this vessel the countries were at peace we had just bought louisiana from france and paid fifteen millions of dollars for it thereby not only getting the country ourselves but keeping it out of the hands of john bull and we were said to be excellent friends again then the dawn had extricated herself from english clutches only a day or two before no doubt the lugger would give us all the aid we could require  she is french for a thousand dollars miles i cried lowering my glass from the first good look of the stranger and by keeping away two points we shall speak her in fifteen minutes  ay french rejoined the mate but blast em all round id much rather have nothing to do with any of the rogues ill tell you how it is miles these are onmoralizing times and the sea is getting to be sprinkled with so many van tassels that im afeard you and ill be just that dear good old soul my mother and little kitty to be frightened or if not exactly frightened to be wronged out of our just rights  little fear of that this time mosesthis is a frenchman as we are bound in to a french port hell not hesitate to lend us halfadozen hands in order to help us along  ay and take half the ship and cargo for salvage i know these piccaroons and you ought to know em too miles for its only two or three years since you were a prisoner of war among em that was a delightful feelin i rather conclude  times are altered moses and ill show confidence in the change keep the ship away nebso meet hersteer for the luggers foremast that will do  of course these orders soon brought the two vessels alongside of each other as the lugger approached we made her out to be a stout but active craft of sixteen guns and apparently full of men she set the tricolor when half a mile distant sure of her prey should we turn out to be a prize we showedhim the stars and stripes of course fancying he would treat them as a friend  it was not long before both vessels had roundedto and preparations were made to hail  what sheeps zat demanded one in good broken english  the dawn of newyorkmay i ask the name of your lugger  le polissoncorsair francoiswhat you load eh  sugar and coffee with cochineal and a few other articles  pestevere you boun monsieur sil vous plait  hamburg  diablezis is non ze cheminhow you come her sair viz ze vin at sowvess  we are going in to brest being in need of a little succour  you vish salvage eh parbleu we can do you zat mosh good as veil as anodair  i was then ordered privateer fashion to lower a boat and to repair on board the lugger with my papers when old i had no stern or quarterboat to lower the frenchman manifested surprise but he sent his own yawl for me my reception on board the polisson was a little free for frenchmen the captain received me in person and i saw at a glance i had to deal with men who were out on the high seas with the fear of english prisonships constantly before their eyes in quest of gold i was not invited into the cabin a crowded dark and dirty hole for in that day the french were notoriously foul in their vessels but was directed to show my papers seated on a hencoop  as everything was regular about the register manifest and clearance i could see that monsieur gallois was not in a particularly good humour he had one whom i took to be a renegade englishman with him to aid in the examination though as this man never spoke in my presence i was unable precisely to ascertain who he was the two had a long consultation in private after the closest scrutiny could detect no flaw in the papers then monsieur gallois approached and renewed the discourse  vy you have no boat sair he asked  i lost my boat three days since about a hundred leagues to the southward and westward  it is not have bad veddairwhy you got no more marins in your sheepeh  i saw it would be best to tell the whole truth at once for were i to get any aid from this lugger the facts sooner or later must be made known accordingly i gave the frenchman and his englishlooking companion a full account of what had occurred between us and the speedy after this narrative there was another long conference between mons gallois and his friend then the boat was again manned and the captain of the lugger accompanied by his privycounsellor and myself went on board the dawn here a very cursory examination satisfied my visiters of the truth of my story  i confess i expected some commendation from a french man when he heard the ready manner in which we had got our vessel out of the hands of the philistines no such thing an expressive bon had escaped mons gallois once or twice it is true but it was apparent he was looking much sharper for some pretext to make us a prize himself than for reasons to commend our conduct each new aspect of the affair was closely scanned and a new conference with the adviser was held apart  sair said mons gallois i have mosh regret but your sheep is bon prize you have been prisonnier to ze english ze enemy of la france and you shall not capture yourself lamérique is not at waris neutral as you shall say and ze américains cannot make ze prize i considair your ship monsieur as in ze hand of ze english and shall capture him mes regrets sont vifs mais que voulez vous ze corsair most do his devoir ze same as ze sheep national i shall send you to brest vere if you be not sold par un décret i shall be too happy to restore votre batimentallons  here was a dénouement to the affair with a vengeance i was to be captured because i had been captured once a corporal always a corporal as the english had taken me the french would take me a prize today you must be a prize tomorrow i have always thought the case of the dawn was the first of the long series of wrongs that were subsequently committed on american commerce in virtue of this same principle a little expanded and more effectually carried out perhaps and which in the end terminated by blockading all europe and interdicting the high seas on paper  i knew the uselessness of remonstrating with a rapacious privateersman let him send me in i thought to myself at first it is just where i wish to go once in the minister must get me clear the fellow will only be the dupe of his own covetousness and i shall profit by it in the degree that he will be a loser  i presume mons gallois entertained a very different view of the matter for he manifested great alacrity in throwing a crew of no less than seventeen souls big and little on board us i watched these operations in silence as did neb and diogenes as for marble he lighted a segar took his seat on the windlass and sat in dignified anger ready to explode on the slightest occasion yet apprehensive he might be sent out of the ship should he betray onehalf of what he felt out of the ship neither of us was sent however the french probably feeling indisposed to be troubled with passengers in the narrow quarters they had for themselves    chapter xvi                           you are safe   nay morealmost triumphant listen then   and hear my words of truth    marino falierlo   it was just four oclock pm when the dawn and the polisson parted company the former steering on her old course for brest while the latter continued her cruise the lugger sailed like a witch and away she went towards the chops of the channel on a bowline leaving us to stand towards the french coastclosehauled also but on the opposite tack  it is scarcely necessary to dwell on the feelings with which we four who were eyewitnesses of all that passed witnessed the proceedings even diogenes was indignant as for marble i have already alluded to his state of mind and if i had not the following dialogue which took place at sunset the first that occurred between us in private since the second capturewhile the french were eating their suppers would serve to explain it  well miles the mate drily observed whatever we have to do must be done at once when shall we beginin the middle or in the morning watch  begin what moses i asked a little surprised at the settled manner in which he put his question  to throw these frenchmen overboardof course you dont mean to let them carry your ship into brest  why not we were bound to brest when we fell in with them and if they will take us there it will only save us the trouble of doing it ourselves  dont be deceived by any such hope miles ive been in the hands of frenchmen before i knew you and there is little hope of getting out of them so long as the ship and cargo will pay for detention no no my dear boy you know i love you better than anything on arth my dear old soul of a mother and little kitty exceptedfor it wouldnt be religious to like you better than my own flesh and bloodbut after these two i like you better than any one on arth and i cant be quiet and see you run your property into the fire never let the ship go into france after what has happened if you can help it  can we possibly help it or do you propose that four men shall retake this vessel from seventeen  well the odds are not so great miles marble rejoined looking coolly round at the noisy set of little frenchmen who were all talking together over their soup certainly not a very formidable band in a handtohand encounter though full of fire and animation there are four of us and only seventeen of them such as they are i rather think we could handle em all in a regular setto with fists theres neb hes as strong as a jackass diogenes is another hercules and neither you nor i am a kitten i consider you as a match in a serious scuffle for the best four among them chaps  this was not said in the least boastingly though certainly the estimate of comparative force made by my mate was enormously out of the way it was true that we four were unusually powerful and athletic men but it was also true that six of the french might very well be placed in the same category i was not subject to the vulgar prejudice of national superiority i hope one of the strongest of all the weaknesses of our very weak nature i have never yet been in a country of which the people did not fancy themselves in all particulars the salt of the earth though there are very different degrees in the modes of bragging on such subjects in the present instance marble had not the least idea of bragging however for he really believed we four in an open onslaught firearms out of the question might have managed those seventeen frenchmen i think myself we might have got along with twice our number taking a fair average of the privateers men and reducing the struggle to the arms of nature but i should have hesitated a long time in making an open attack on even them  still i began to regard my chances of escaping should we be sent into a french port by the privateer as far less certain than they had appeared at first marble had so much to say of the anarchists in france as he had known them in the worst period of the revolution and so many stories to tell of ships seized and of merchants ruined that my confidence in the right was shaken bonaparte was then in the height of his consular poweron the point of becoming emperor indeedand he had commenced this new war with a virulence and disregard of acknowledged rights in the detention of all the english then resident in france that served to excite additional distrust whatever may be said of the comprehensiveness and vastness of the genius of napoleon as a soldier and statesman i presume few upright and enlightened men can now be found to eulogize his respect for public law at any rate i began to have lively misgivings on the subject and the consultation between my mate and myself terminated in our coming to a resolution to serve the french prizecrew substantially as we had served the english prizecrew if possible varying the mode only to suit the new condition of things this last precaution was necessary as in the fulness of my confidence i had made mons gallois acquainted with all the circumstances of throwing the fender overboard and the manner in which we had got possession of the ship it was not to be expected therefore that particular artifice could be made to succeed with him  it must have been the result of prejudice and of constant reading of articles extracted from the english journals that influenced me but i confess it seemed a much easier matter to retake my ship from seventeen frenchmen than from twelve englishmen i was not so besotted as to suppose surprise or artifice would not be necessary in either case but had the issue been made up on brute force i should have begun the fray with greater confidence in the first than in the last case all this would have been very wrong in our particular situation though as a rule and as applied to seafaring men it might be more questionable how often and how much have i seen reason to regret the influence that is thus silently obtained amongst us by our consenting to become the retailers of other peoples prejudices one of the reasons why we have so long been mere serviles on this point is owing to the incompleteness of the establishments of the different leading presses of the country we multiply instead of enlarging these enterprises the want of concentration of talent compels those who manage them to resort to the scissors instead of the pen and it is almost as necessary for an american editor to be expert with the shears as it is for a tailor thus the public is compelled to receive hashes instead of fresh dishes and things that come from a distance notoriously possessing a charm it gets the original cookery of london instead of that of their own country  prejudice or not confidence is not a bad thing when a conflict is unavoidable it may be well to respect your enemy down to the very moment of making the charge but that commenced the more he is despised the better when diogenes and neb were told it would be necessary to go over again the work so lately thought to be completed neither of the negroes manifested the least concern diogenes had been in the crisis as well as neb and he had got to entertain a very anglican sort of notion of french prowess on the water and as for my own black he would have followed without the slightest remonstrance wherever masser mile please to lead  theys only french said diogenes in a philosophical sort of way we can handle em like children  i would not discourage this notion though i saw its folly telling our two supporters to hold themselves ready for an attack marble and i left them to cogitate and commence the manner of proceeding whatever was done must be done that night there being reason to think the ship would get in somewhere next day  the name of our prizemaster was le gros he was not aptly designated however being a little shrivelled yellowfaced fellow who did not seem to be a hercules at all nevertheless unlike sennit he was all vigilance and activity he never left the deck and being so near in with the coast i felt pretty certain we should have his company above board all night whatever was attempted therefore must be attempted in defiance of his watchfulness nor was this all additional prudence was necessary since we were so near the coast as greatly to increase the chance of our being picked up by some other french cruiser should we even escape from this extreme caution was our cue therefore and marble and i separated seemingly each to take his repose with a perfect understanding on all these points  mons le gros paid no attention to the staterooms or to the accommodations below his whole care was bestowed on the ship apprehension of falling in with some british cruiser kept his eyes wide open and his gaze constantly sweeping the horizon so far as the obscurity would allow i was incessantly on the alert myself stealing up from the cabin as far as the companionway at least a dozen times in the course of the night in the hope of finding him asleep but on each occasion i saw him moving up and down the quarterdeck in rapid motion armed to the teeth and seemingly insensible to fatigue and all the other weaknesses of nature it was useless to attempt to find him off his guard and worn out marble and myself fell into deep sleep about three in the morning out of pure exhaustion as for the two negroes they slept the entire night waiting our summons for their rallying to the work neb in particular had all the absence of responsibility that distinguishes the existence of a slave feeling very much the same unconcern as to the movements of the vessel as any other human being feels in connection with those of the earth in which he is a passenger  it was ten oclock when i awoke refreshed but disappointed marble was still snoring in his berth and i was compelled to give him a call i could perceive there was a breeze and that the ship was going through the water fast by her lurching she was close hauled it takes a seaman but a minute or two to throw on his loose attire and no time was lost on the present occasion while my mate and i were thus engaged the former happened to cast a look out of the cabin windows which were open on account of the warmth of the weather and offered no obstruction to a long view of the ocean directly in our wake  halloo miles marble exclaimed by jove we are chased such is the secret of mr frogs being so much alive this fine morning yonder comes a frigate or my name is not oloff marble  a frigate there was sure enough she was about two leagues astern of us and resembled a pyramidal cloud moving along the water so completely were her spars covered with canvass that she was an englishman was more than probable from the cruising ground as well as from the fact of the prizecrew running from her in that day no french shipofwar loitered long at any particular point her enemies being so numerous as to render pursuit certain ere many hours could elapse after determining these facts in our minds marble and i went on deck  my first look was ahead to my deep regret there lay the land actually within three leagues of us the wind was fresh at northeast and monsieur le gros appeared to be steering for a group of islands that lay a little and ever so little on our lee bow brest was out of the question if we could get in with the land among these islands it was as much as we could do before the racer astern would be up to us the frenchmen were evidently alarmed an english prisonship with all its known horrors being very vividly placed before their eyes monsieur le gros screamed and gave twenty orders in a minute while the other sixteen men made more noise than would be heard among a thousand americans heavens what a clamour these chaps kept up and all about nothing too the ship having every stitch of canvass on her that would draw i felt like the arab who owned the rarest mare in the desert but who was coming up with the thief who had stolen her himself riding an inferior beast and all because the rogue did not understand the secret of making the mare do her best pinch her right ear or i shall overtake you called out the arab and more than twenty times was i disposed to trim the dawns sails and send neb to the wheel in order to escape the disgrace of being overhauled by the frigate there was a chance for me however in this second recapture and i thought it preferable to let things take their course my new conquerors might be mystified whereas there was little hope for us should monsieur le gros get in after such an uproar  in little more than an hours time the dawn began to shorten sail hauling up her courses and topgallantsails rocks showing themselves within half a mile of her a large boat met as here coming alongside as soon as certain who we were the people in this boat were fishermen and were so much accustomed to all the movements of the coast that they understood the nature of the affair as soon as they were apprised of our character of course they were eagerly questioned touching the possibility of the dawns being carried in through any of the rockylooking passages that lay before us monsieur le gros looked very blank when he was told that all his hopes lay in there being sufficient water in one channel and of that the fishermen confessed their own ignorance if the noise and confusion were annoying before these men came alongside it was astounding afterwards all this time the frigate was drawing near fast and half an hour would certainly bring her within gunshot there is something intoxicating in a race i felt a strong desire to get away from the englishman at the very moment i believed my chances for justice would be worst in the hands of the french feeling the necessity of losing no time i now made a lively appeal to monsieur le gros myself proposing that we should both go in with the fishingboat and examine the passage ourselves by using proper activity the whole might be done in a quarter of an hour we should then know whether to carry the ship in or to run on the rocks and save what we could of the cargo by means of lighters  order on board ship is out of the question without coolness silence and submission a fussy sailor is always a bad sailor calmness and quiet being the great requisites for the profession after the general knowledge is obtained no really good officer ever makes a noise except when the roar of the elements renders it indispensable in order to be heard in that day french ships of war did not understand this important secret much less french privateers i can only liken the clamour that was now going on in the dawns leegangway to that which is raised by dutch fishwomen on the arrival of the boats from sea with their cargoes to talk of billingsgate in comparison with these women is to do the holland and flemish ladies gross injustice english phlegm being far more silent than dutch phlegm no sooner was my proposition made than it was accepted by acclamation and the privateersmen began to pour into the boat heels over head without order and i may say without orders monsieur le gros was carried off in the current and when the fishermen cast off but three frenchmen were left in the ship all the others had been swept away by a zeal to be useful that was a little quickened perhaps by the horrors of an english prisonship  even diogenes laughed at the random manner in which we were thus left in possession of our own there is no question that the french intended to return while there is no question it was also their intention to go in short they were in a tumult and acted under an impulse instead of under the government of their reasons  you will have the complaisance mons wallingford cried le gros as the boat started away from the ships side to fill the topsail and run for the passage when we wave our hats  ayay i answered leave it to me to fill the topsails and to give the john bulls the slip  this was said in french and it drew cries of bon and of vive la france from all in the boat what the fellows thought i will not pretend to say but if they thought they were to get on board the dawn again they did not know the men they left behind them as for the frenchmen who remained marble and i could have managed them alone and i was glad they were with us since they could be made to pull and haul  the ship was under her three topsails spanker and jib when mons le gros thus singularly gave her up to my control the mainyard lying square my first step was to fill the topsail and gather way on the vessel this was soon done and keeping away i stood on towards the rocks which soon bore on our weather bow determined to run as near them as i dared thinking to frighten the englishman so much as to induce him to keep at armslength i might cast away the ship it is true but even this would be preferable to falling again into english hands with all the occurrences still so recent a year or two later the affair of the speedys men might be forgotten but while a thing is fresh there is always some danger of its creating feeling at least thus i reasoned and thus i acted  once more i had the dawn under my own orders and could i keep the frigate out of gunshot i cared very little for mons le gros at first the privateersmen supposed that in filling away i merely intended to further their views but no sooner did they perceive the ship standing on to leeward of the passage than the truth seemed to flash on their befogged faculties this was not until the depth of water was ascertained to be sufficient for their purposes and such a flourishing of tarpaulins and greasy caps as succeeded i had not witnessed for many a day all these signals and calls however were disregarded but away went the dawn with her yards just rounded in a point with the wind fairly abeam coasting along as near the islands as i thought it at all prudent to venture as for the frigate she was still keeping her luff in order to get far enough to windward to make sure of her prey at this moment the two ships might have been a league asunder  mons le gros was no sooner aware of the trick i had played him than out he dashed with his fishingboat making sail in chase and helping his dull craft along with half a dozen oars seeing this i let the foresail drop and sheeted home and hoisted the maintopgallantsail not that i felt at all afraid of the boat but because it was my wish to avoid bloodshed if possible among the other absurdities the french had committed in their haste to get away from the frigate was that of leaving six or eight muskets with several cartridgeboxes behind them with these weapons it would have been easy for us to have given the privateersmen such a hint as would not fail to keep them at bay then i always had my pistols which were not only valuable implements but were doublebarrelled and well loaded our only ground of alarm therefore came from the englishman  possibly monsieur le gros thought differently for his chase was animated and apparently in earnest but notwithstanding all his zeal the dawn left him astern going through the water at the rate of about six knots but the frigate was coming up at the rate of eight knots making it certain that she would get us under her guns in an hour or two at most unless some great advantage was obtained over her by means of the complicated navigation and shallow water  when at bordeaux the previous year i had purchased a chart of the french coast with a book containing directions similar to those which are to be found in our own coasting pilot as a matter of course i had them both with me and i found them of great service on this occasion the text described the islands we were near as being separated by narrow channels of deep water in which the danger was principally owing to sunken rocks it was these rocks that had induced the fishermen to pronounce the passages impracticable and my coasting directions cautioned all navigators to be wary in approaching them the dawn however was in precisely the situation which might render these rocks of the last service to her and preferring shipwreck to seeing my vessel in either english or french hands again i determined to trust to the very dangers of the navigation as my safeguard i might go clear of the bottom but it was certain if i kept outside i could not escape from the frigate an accidental occurrence in connection with the boat favoured us and i was not slow to profit by the advantage it offered finding it impossible to come up with the ship by keeping in her wake monsieur le gros had taken a short cut in the boat between some islets that we were obliged to round and he actually came out ahead of us instead of endeavouring to close with the ship however he led into an excessively narrow passage making furious gestures for us to follow this was at the instant when the frigate fired her first gun at us the shot of which just fell a very little short did we pass the channel in which monsieur le gros had carried the boat we should fall to leeward of the whole group of islands or islets would be the better wordwhen all would literally depend on our heels there was but a moment in which to decide in another minute the ship would be past the opening which could only be regained by tacking if it could be regained at all i gave the order to luff  our three frenchmen fancying themselves now certainly bound to la belle france were as active as cats neb and diogenes throwing their powerful force on the braces with a goodwill too we soon had the dawn braced sharp up heading well to windward of the passage monsieur le gros was delighted apparently he thought all was right again and he led the way flourishing both hands while all in the boat fishermen inclusive were bawling and shouting and gesticulating in a way that would certainly have confused us had i cared a straw about them i thought it well enough to follow the boat but as for their cries they were disregarded had monsieur le gros seen fit to wait for the ship in the narrowest part of the inlet he might have embarrassed us but so far from this he appeared to be entirely carried away by the excitement of the chase and was as eager to push ahead as a boy who was struggling to be first in at the goal  it was a nervous instant when the dawns bow first entered the narrow passage the width from rock to rock speaking only of visible things might have been thirty fathoms and this strait narrowed rather than widened for several hundred feet until it was reduced fully onethird the tide ran like a milltail and it was perhaps lucky for us that there was no time for reflection or irresolution the aspect of things being so serious as might well have thrown the most decided man into uncertainty and doubt the current sucked the vessel in like the maelstrom and we were whirling ahead at a rate that would have split the ship from her keel to her toptimbers had we come upon a sunken rock the chances were about even for i regarded the pilotage as a very random sort of an affair we glanced on in breathless expectation therefore not knowing but each instant would involve us in ruin  this jeopardy endured about five minutes at the end of that brief space the ship had run the gauntlet for the distance of a mile driven onward by the current rather than by the wind so tremendous was our velocity in the narrowest part that i actually caught myself grasping the rail of the ship as we glanced past the rocks as if to keep myself from a fall the french gave a loud and general shout just as the boat issued out of this raceway into a wide capacious bay within the group of islands which had the appearance of forming a roadstead of some note there was a battery on the end of the last island a lighthouse and a cluster of fishermens huts all indicating that the place was one of considerable resort  monsieur le gros was waiting for us about two cableslengths from the place where we issued into the bay having considerately chosen an anchorage for us at a point commanded by the four sixandthirty pounders of the battery the distance enabled me to look about within the range of islands was a sort of sound quite a league in width and on this sound the main coast presented several bays in which coasters were at anchor most of the prominent points had small batteries of no great force as against a fleet or even against a single heavy ship but which were sufficiently formidable to keep a sloop of war or a frigate at a respectable distance as all the guns were heavy a vessel passing through the middle of this sound would hardly be safe more especially did the gunners do their duty by anchoring at the spot where the boat waited for us we at once gave up the ship to the privateersmen the battery first mentioned commanding that point completely as good luck would have it however an expedient offered in the direction of the wind and tide which were opposed to each other and i availed myself of the circumstance as promptly as possible  do our best the dawn could not fetch the spot where the boat had dropped her kedge we passed within hail of it notwithstanding and loud were the calls to us to shorten sail and anchor as we came within hearing affecting to be anxious to get up to the precise point where the boat lay i mystified monsieur le gros in my answers telling him i would stand on a short distance or until i could fetch him when i would tack as this was intelligible it satisfied my captors though a hundred nimportes were yelled after us and nimporte it was in fact one spot being just as good to anchor in as another for half a league all round us  the dawn did her duty that day and there was occasion for it the frigate still continuing the chase the circuit she had to make and the berth she thought it prudent to give the first battery enabled us to gain on her materially when we passed the boat the englishmans upper sails were visible on the outside of the island flying along the rocks at a rate that spoke well of his heels he rounded the point when we were midsound but here the battery served us a good turn for instead of hauling up close by the wind the english were obliged to run off with the wind free to keep out of harms way their presence notwithstanding was probably of great service to the dawn for here had been a communication between monsieur le gros and the battery by means of a small boat sent from the latter and we should have been very likely to have a messenger in the shape of a shot sent after us when it was seen we continued to stand across for the main instead of tacking for the designated anchorage had not the men in the battery had the higher game of the frigate in view as soon as john bull got within range the gunners began to play on him but it was at a distance that rendered their fire next to useless  any one in the least acquainted with the movements of ships will understand the advantage we now possessed the dawn was beating through a good wide passage with a young flood breasting her to windward and a steady sixknot breeze blowing the passage between these islands and the main was about four leagues long while that which the fishermen had wished us first to enter was near the middle of the group we were already a mile from the boat and considerably to windward of her the tide having done that much for us when mons le gros saw fit to lift his kedge and commence a new pursuit he had the sagacity to see that we should soon be obliged to tack on account of the main coast and to stand over towards the island again accordingly instead of following in our wake he profited by the set of the current and pulled directly to windward with a view to cut us off all this we very plainly saw but we cared very little for mons le gros and his boat the ship could outsail the last very easily in such a breeze and it was always in our power to tack in midchannel instead of crossing her or coming near her at all the frigate gave me much more trouble  the englishman as i afterwards learned was a frenchbuilt ship called the fortunée or as jack termed her now she had got to be designated in the anglosaxon dialect the fortunee which was liberally rendered into the vernacular as the happygolucky she was an old ship but an exceedingly fast one and her commander had rendered himself famous by the manner in which he ventured about on the french coast this was the third time he had gone through this very sound in spite of the batteries and having some experience in the windings and turnings he was now much better able to get along scatheless than on the two former occasions as soon as he thought himself at a safe distance from the sixandthirties he hauled up and made five short stretches near the main where he had much the best of the tide and the whole strength of the breeze and where there was nothing to molest him the usual roadstead being under the island of course  the first hour sufficed to let me understand there was no chance of escaping the frigate if we continued to beat up through the passage we might reach its western end a little in advance of her it is true but no hope at all of getting away would remain when we again reached the open ocean and she inshore of us in this dilemma marble made one of his happy suggestions my merit amounting to no more than seizing the right moment and carrying out his idea with promptitude the passage first named lay in a line with us and we had every reason to believe the ship could go through it when we were invited to enter the tide was not as high by six feet as it had now risen to be and my mate suggested the expedient of trying it in going out  the englishman will never dare follow on account of the battery which lies on the side of it he added whereas the french will not fire at us believing us to be escaping from a common enemy  the whole force of what had been said flashed upon me in an instant i set the tricolor over a british ensign to cause the people of this second battery to think us an english prize and stood straight for the pass just without which lay a small brig at anchor in order to make the deception more complete we hauled up our courses and let run the topgallant halyards as if ready to bring up seeing this mons le gros fancied we were about to anchor under the battery and that we had hoisted our flags to taunt the english for caps and hats were waved in exultation in the boat then distant from us a quarter of a mile we passed close to the brig which greeted us with acclamations and vives la france as we swept by her my eye was on the battery the whole time it was built to command the roadstead and without any reference to the pass which no enemy would be apt to attempt it is true two heavy guns bore on this entrance but they were in a detached work that was never manned except in emergencies  i drew a long breath and felt a mountain removed from my very soul as the ship passed out of the range of the last gun in the little semicircle the soldiers were making gestures to us to indicate we were getting too far west for a good berth but we heeded them not instead of shortening sail the fore and main tacks were boarded and the topgallantsails set this revealed our intention and the clamour on the shore even reached the ship preparations were making to get a piece of light artillery to bear on us and some twenty gunners began to scamper towards the detached battery the whole thing was now reduced to a sheer race we passed the last battery ten minutes before the french could reach it the latter having to go round a considerable bay and six minutes later we went out to sea with the american ensign and jacks and pennants flying at each masthead and wherever else such an emblem of triumph could be shown    chapter xvii      o i am out of breath in this fond chase   the more my prayer the lesser is my grace    shakspeare   marble and i looked each other in the face and then burst into a laugh as the french fired a single shot from the twogun battery which flew beyond us but which could scarcely hit us on account of some intervening rocks i altered the course of the ship in order to get a little more out of the range after this we had nothing to fear from the french the boat did not attempt to follow us and thus ended our communication with le polisson and her people a that time as for la fortunée it would require at least four hours for her to beat round the end of the cluster of islands and seeing the hopelessness of doing this in time to overtake such a ship as the dawn her commander made a dash in at the unfortunate brig which he actually succeeded in cutting out from the roadstead in spite of all the defences of the place the last i heard of these gentlemen was the reports of the guns that were exchanged between the battery and the frigate while the last i saw of them was the smoke that floated over the spot long after the islands had sunk beneath the horizon the dawn stood directly out to sea with the wind still at the northward though it had drawn more through the pass inshore  well miles cried marble as he and i sat eating our dinner on deck where neb had been ordered to serve it you know what ive always said of your luck its proof agin every thing but providence die you must and will some of these times but not until youve done something remarkable sail with you my boy i consider your company a standing policy of insurance and have no sort of consarn about fortin while im under your orders with any other man i should be nothing but a bloody hermit instead of the dutiful son and affectionate uncle i am but what do you mean to perform next  i have been thinking moses our best step will be to shape our course for hamburg whither we are bound this northerly wind cant last long at this season and another southwester would just serve our turn in ten days or a fortnight we might make our haven  and then those french chaps that are attacking yonder kid of pork as if it were a wild beast the fellows never saw good solid food before  feed them welltreat them welland make them work they would never think of troubling us nor do i suppose they know anything of navigation i see they smoke and chew we will give em as much tobacco as their hearts can wish or their mouths hold and this will keep them in good humour  and john bull  why john is another sort of a person to deal with certainly i am not sure that a third english cruiser would molest us we can keep our own secret concerning sennit and his party and we may not meet with another after all my plan is to run close in with the english coast and show our colours boldlynow nine in ten of the british menofwar will let us pass unquestioned believing we are bound to london unless they happen to have one of those pressing gentry like sennit on board i have often been told that ships which pass close in with the english coast generally pass unquestioned by the large craft uniformlythough they may have something to apprehend from the brigs and cutters your smallfry always give the most trouble moses  we have not found it so this vyge miles however youre not only captain but youre owner and i leave you to paddle your own canoe we must go somewhere and i will not say your plan is not as good as any i can start with thirty years more of experience  we talked the matter over canvassing it in all its bearings until it was settled to adopt it  the ship was steered large until the french coast was entirely sunk and then we trimmed her by the wind heading up as near to our course as the breeze would permit nothing occurred in the course of the remainder of the day to produce either trouble or uneasiness though my three frenchmen came to certain explanations with me that at first menaced a little difficulty they refused to work and i was compelled to tell them i should put them on board the first english vessel of war we met this had the desired effect and after an amicable discussion i agreed to pay them high wages on our arrival in a friendly port and they agreed to serve me as well as they knew how seven men were rather less than half a crew for a vessel of the dawns size but it was possible to get along with that number the steering was the hardest part of the dutyneither of the frenchmen being able to take his trick at the helm we got along with the necessary work however and so glad were we all to be rid of both english and french that i hazard little in saying we would have endured twice as much cheerfully could we be certain of meeting no more of their cruisers providence had ordered matters very differently  that night the wind shifted again to the southward and westward we braced in the yards and brought the ship to her course but i thought it best not to carry sail hard in the dark accordingly i left orders to be called at sunrise marble having the watch at that hour when i came on deck in consequence of this summons i found my mate examining the horizon with some earnestness as if be were looking for strangers  we are a merry party this morning captain wallingford marble cried out as soon as he saw me i have found no less than six sail in sight since the day dawned  i hope that neither is a lugger i feel more afraid of this polisson just now than of all the names in christendom that fellow must be cruising in the chops of the channel and we are working our way well in towards that part of the world  i hope so too sir but this chap out here at northwest has a suspicious luggerlike look it may be that i see only the heads of his topsails but they are amazingly like luggs  i now took a survey of the ocean for myself the vessel marble distrusted i unhesitatingly pronounced to be a lugger quite as likely the polisson as any other craft the other four vessels were all ships the five forming a complete circle of which the dawn was in the centre the lugger however was some miles the nearest to us while as to the strangers if they saw each other across the diameter of the circle at all it was as much as was possible under the circumstances it struck me our wisest way was to keep steadily on our course like honest people marble was of the same opinion and to say the truth there was little choice in the matter the ship being so completely surrounded the worst feature of the case was our position which would be certain to draw all the cruisers to the centre and consequently to ourselves  two hours produced a material change all five of the strangers had closed in upon us and we were now able to form tolerably accurate notions of their characters the two astern one on our larboard and one on our starboard quarter were clearly heavy vessels and consorts though of what nation it was not yet so easy to decide that they were consorts was apparent by their signalling one another and by the manner in which they were closing as they carried studdingsails alow and aloft they were coming up with us fast and in all probability would be alongside in two or three hours more  two of the ships ahead struck me as frigates having their broadsides exposed to us we had raised one line of ports but it was possible they might turn out to be twodeckers ships of war they were beyond all question and i fancied them english from the squareness of their upper sails they too were consorts making signals to each other and closing fast on opposite tacks the lugger was no longer equivocal it was the polisson and she was standing directly for us though it was ticklish business since the remaining ship a corvette as i fancied was already in her wake carrying sail hard going like a witch and only about two leagues astern  monsieur gallois had so much confidence in his heels that he stood on regardless of his pursuer i thought it best to put a bold face on the matter knowing that sufficient time might be wasted to enable the sloop of war to get near enough to prevent the privateer from again manning us my principal apprehension was that he might carry us all off in revenge for what had happened and set fire to the ship against either of these steps however i should offer all the resistance in my power  it was just ten oclock when the polisson ranged up abeam of us the second time and we hoveto it was evident the french recognised us and the clamour that succeeded must have resembled that of babel when the people began first to converse without making themselves understood knowing we had no small boat monsieur gallois lost no time but lowering a yawl of his own he came alongside of us in person as i had commanded the three frenchmen to remain below he found no one on deck but marble diogenes neb and myself  parbleu monsieur vallingfort exclaimed the privateersman saluting me very civilly notwithstanding appearancescest bien extraordinaire vat you do vid me meneh put em in ze zea comme avec le anglais  i was spared the necessity of any explanation by the sudden appearance of my own three prisoners who disregarded my orders and came rushing up to their proper commander openmouthed and filled with zeal to relate all that had passed the whole three broke out at once and a scene that was sufficiently ludicrous followed it was a continued volley of words exclamations oaths and compliments to the american character so blended as to render it out of the question that mons gallois could understand them the latter found himself obliged to appeal to me i gave a very frank account of the whole affair in english a language that my captor understood much better than he spoke  mons gallois had the rapacity of a highwayman but it was singularly blended with french politeness he had not always been a privateersmana calling that implies an undue love of gold and he was quite capable of distinguishing between right and wrong in matters in which his own pocket had no direct concern as soon as he comprehended the affair he began to laugh and to cry bon i saw he was in a good humour and not likely to resent what had happened and i finished my history in somewhat sarcastic language portraying mons le gross complaisance in quitting the ship and in piloting her about the bay a little drily perhaps there were sundry sacrrres and bêtes uttered the while but all came out freely and without anger as if mons gallois thought a good joke the next thing to a good prize  tenez mon ami he cried squeezing my hand as he looked round at the corvette now less than a league distant you are vat you anglais call good fellow jadmire votre esprit you have escape admirablement and i shall have vifs regrets now to ave opportunité to cultiver votre connaissance mais i most laafsmille pardonsyou àve non too moch peeps mais cest impossible dabandonner mes compatriots allons mes enfants au cânot  this was the signal for the french to quit us the three men i had shipped taking their departure without ceremony mons gallois was the last in the boat of course and he found time to squeeze my hand once more and to renew his vifs regrets at not having more leisure to cultivate my acquaintance the corvette was already so near as to render it necessary for the polisson to be in motion another time perhaps we might be more fortunate  in this manner did i part from a man who had not scrupled to seize me in distress as he would a waif on a beach by manning me the prizecrew would have fallen into the hands of the enemy and making a merit of necessity mons gallois was disposed to be civil to those whom he could not rob odd as it may seem i felt the influence of this manner to a degree that almost reconciled me to the act before committed although the last was just as profligate and illegal as any that could well be committed of so much more importance with the majority of men is manner than matter a very limited few alone knowing how to give to the last its just ascendency  the polisson was not long in gathering way after her boat was hoisted in she passed on the crest of a wave so near that it was easy to distinguish the expressions of her peoples faces few of which discovered the equanimity of that of their commanders and to hear the incessant gabbling that was kept up on board her day and night from morn till dewy eve m gallois bowed complaisantly and he smiled as amiably as if he never had put a hand in another mans pocket but his glass was immediately turned towards the corvette which now began to give him some little uneasiness manning us indeed with that fellow surging ahead at the rate he was would have been quite out of the question  being reduced to our old number of four i saw no use in working ourselves to death by filling the topsail with the certainty the sloopofwar would make us roundto again the dawn therefore remained stationary wailing the issue with philosophical patience  there is no use moses in endeavouring to escape i remarked we are not stronghanded enough to get sail on the ship before the fellow will be up with us  ay and there goes his bunting and a gun answered the mate the white english ensign a sign the chap is under some admiral or vice or rear of the white while if i mistake not the two frigates show blue flagsif so tis a sign theyre not consorts  the glass confirmed this and we were left to suppose that all three englishmen did not belong to the same squadron at this moment the state of the game was as followsthe dawn was lyingto with her forecourse up mainsail furled maintopsail aback and topgallant yards on the caps jib and spanker both set the polisson was flying away on the crests of the seas closehauled evidently disposed to make a lee behind the two frigates to windward which we took for and which it is probable she knew to be french the ships to leeward were passing each other within hail the one to the eastward tacking immediately after and coming up in her consorts wake both vessels carrying everything that would draw the ships to the southward or the supposed frenchmen might then have been two leagues from us while those to leeward were three as for the corvette her course seemed to lie directly between our masts on she came with everything beautifully trimmed the water spouting from her hawseholes as she rose from a plunge and foaming under her bows as if made of a cloud her distance from us was less than a mile  it was now that the corvette made signals to the ships to windward they were answered but in a way to show the parties did not understand each other she then tried her hand with the vessels to leeward and notwithstanding the distance she succeeded better i could see these two frigates or rather the one that led sending questions and answers to the corvette although my best glass would hardly enable me to distinguish their ensigns i presume that the corvette asked the names of the english vessels communicated her own and let the fact be known that the ships to windward were enemies  a few minutes later our affairs as they were connected with the sloopofwar came to a crisis this ship now came on close under our lee losing a little of her way in passing an expedient probably thought of to give her a little more time to put her questions and to receive the desired answers i observed also that she let go all her bowlines which seemed much to deaden her way of which there still remained sufficient notwithstanding to carry her well clear of us the following dialogue then passed the englishman asking the questions of course that being a privilege expressly appropriated to the public vessel on occasions of this sort  what ships thatand whither bound  dawn of new york miles wallingford from home to hamburg  did not the lugger board you  ayayfor the second time in three days  what is she calledand what is her force  le polisson of brestsixteen light guns and about a hundred men  do you know anything of the ships to windward  nothing at all but i suppose them to be french  pray sir why do you supumumookook  the distance prevented my hearing more away went the sloop steadying her bowlines the call piping belay as each sail was trimmed to the officer of the decks fancy in a few more minutes we could not distinguish even the shrill notes of that instrument the corvette continued on in chase of the lugger regardless of the four other vessels though the two to windward now showed the tricolor and fired guns of defiance  mons gallois soon after tacked evidently disposed to stand for the frigates of his country when the sloopofwar immediately went round also heading up towards these very vessels determined to cut off the lugger even if it were to be done by venturing within range of the shot of her protectors it was a bold manoeuvre and deserved success if it were only for its spirit and daring  i thought however that the frigates of the tricolor paid very little attention to the lugger by altering their course a trifle it would have been in their power to cover her completely from the attempts of the corvette but instead of doing this they rather deviated a little the other way as if desirous of approaching the two ships to leeward on the side that would prevent their being cut off from the land as neither party seemed disposed to take any notice of us we filled our topsail and stood out of the circle under easy canvass believing it bad policy to have an appearance of haste haste however was a thing out of our power it requiring time for four men to make sail  about eleven or halfpast eleven the four frigates were distant from each other rather more than a leaguethe dawn being just then half a league from the two frenchmen and rather more distant from the english had an action then commenced we might have been a mile out of the line of fire curious to know the result i stood on a short distance farther and backed my topsail to await the issue i was influenced to take this course from an expectation that either party after a conflict with an equal would be less disposed to molest a neutral and that i might possibly obtain assistance from the conquerorfew cruisers being found at that day without having foreigners on board that they would be willing to give to a vessel in distress as for the account i meant to give to the party to whom i intended to apply it would depend on circumstances if the french remained on the spot i could relate the affair with the prizecrew of the speedy if the english that of the polisson in neither case would an untruth be told though certain collateral facts might be and probably would have been suppressed  the frenchmen began to haul down their light sails just as we hoveto this was done in a lubberly and irregular manner as if little concert or order prevailed on board them marble prowled out his remarks deeming the whole proceeding a bad omen for the tricolor it is certain that the french marine in 1803 was not a service to boast of the english used to say that they seldom got a french ship without working for her and this was probably true as the nation is warlike and little disposed to submit without an effort still france at that day could hardly be said to be maritime and the revolutions and changes she had undergone were not likely to favour the creation of a good corps of naval officers brave men were far more plenty than skilful seamen and then came the gabbling propensity one of the worst of all human failings to assist in producing a disorderly ship  it was a pretty sight to see those four ships strip for the fight although the french canvass did not come down exactly according to rule the english however were in no hurry the two tricolor men being under their three topsails spankers and jibs with the topgallantsails clewed up before john bull reduced even a royal the latter it will be remembered were to leeward and had to close with their adversaries in doing this they made one stretch so far in our direction in the hope of tacking in their enemies wakes that i saw they would probably speak us i confess this was more than i had bargained for but it was now too late to run which would probably have led to our seizure i determined therefore to await the result with dignity  just as the english ships were coming within musketshot of the dawn the frenchthen distant about a mile and a half to the eastward and half a mile south of uswore ship and came round with their heads to the westwardor in our direction as this was coming nearer instead of moving from them the englishmen began to start their tacks and sheets in order to be ready their six royals were all flying at the same instant as were their flyingjibs at the next the canvass was rolled up and out of sight then the yards themselves came down and all the light sails about the ships vanished as a bird shuts its wings after this the courses were hauled up snug but the sails were not handed by this time the leading ship of these two frigates was within a cableslength of us just luffing up sufficiently to give our weatherquarter the necessary berth  by george miles marble said as he stood at my side watching the movements of the stranger that second frigate is the speedy i know her by the billet and the distance of her bridleport from her head you never saw such a space for anchors before then you may see she is a sixandthirty with white hammockcloths who ever saw that twice at sea  marble was right there came the speedy sure enough and doubtless the eyes of lord harry dermond and his officers would be on us in a very few more minutesthe distance between the two frigates being less than two cableslengths in the mean time i had to attend to the headmost vessel  can you tell me anything of the two ships to the southward of us demanded the stranger through his trumpet without any preamble  nothing but what you see sir i suppose them to be french and see that they are coming after you  after us exclaimed the english captain in a voice loud enough and now near enough to be heard without the aid of the trumpet after us indeed ready abouthelms aleemaintopsail haul there hawl of all  these orders came out at brief intervals and in a voice of thunderproducing prompt obedience the consequence was that this ship tacked directly on our weatherbeam and so near us that one might have thrown a biscuit aboard her but she went round beautifully scarce losing her way at all and away she started again looking her enemies directly in the face  nows our time to fill miles and draw ahead the speedy will think weve been spoken and alls right she must come here to tack into her consorts wake and a blind man could not avoid reading our nameshe would be so close man the leebraces and right the helm neb  fill we did and what is more we put our helm up so much as to leave quite a cableslength between us and the speedy when that ship got far enough ahead to tack or at the point which we had just left i believe we were recognised indeed it is not easy to imagine otherwise as the commonest glass would enable the dullest eyes to read our name were other means of recognition wanting but a sailor knows a ship by too many signs to be easily deceived  the speedy was in stays when we saw the proofs of our being known her headyards were not swung but there she lay like one who lingers uncertain whether to go or to remain an officer was in her gangway examining us with a glass and when the ship fell off so much as to bring us out of the range of sight he ran off and reappeared on the taffrail this was the junior lieutenant i could plainly recognise him with my own glass others soon joined him and among them was lord harry dermond himself i fancied they even knew me and that all their glasses were levelled directly at my face what a moment of intense uncertainty was that the ships were not a quarter of a mile apart though the dawn was increasing that distance fast and by paying broad off the speedy would have me under her broadside where was her prize crew i not in the dawn or certainly sennit would have communicated with his commander and if not in the ship they must be in the ocean or were they prisoners below and kept purposely out of sight all these thoughts must have passed through the minds of the english officers  i thought we were lost again but providence once more saved us all this time the leading english frigate and the two frenchmen were fast approaching each other in a few minutes they must engage while the speedy was left further and further astern of her consort at this critical instant one of the frenchmen fired a gun of defiance that report seemed to arouse the speedy as from a trance her headyards came furiously round all the officers vanished from her taffrail and down went both fore and maintacks and to the masthead rose all three of her topgallantsails thus additionally impelled the lively craft dashed ahead and was soon in her allotted berth or half a cableslength astern of the black prince as i afterwards heard was the name of the commanding english ship on this occasion i may as well add here that the french commodores ship was named la désirée and her consort le cerf mons menneval was senior officer of the french and sir hotham ward of the english i never knew the name of the other french captain or if i did i have forgotten it  my object had been in bearing up to get as far as possible from the speedy in order that she might not recognise us and especially that she might not read the name on our stern but this running off so much to leeward was not precisely the berth that one would wish to occupy when a seafight is going on directly to windward and within half gunshot no sooner was my lord harry dermond in motion again therefore than we hauled the dawn up with her head to the westward with a view to get as soon as possible out of the probable range of the fire it was true the combatants might vary their manoeuvres so as to render all parts of the periphery of a certain circle around them anything but agreeable but the chances were greatly in favour of the battles beginning with one party to windward of the other  our ship behaved well on this occasion getting out of the way with sufficient rapidity while this was in the course of execution i had an opportunity to look after the corvette and the lugger the last was still leading having managed by means of short tacks to work up considerably to windward of the two french frigates here she had made a last tack to the eastward intending to run for the coast the sloopofwar was still in her wake and was following on her heels at a rapid rate    chapter xviii      you and i have known sir   at sea i think   we have sir   you have done well by water   and you by land    antony and cleopatra   the reader will understand that i offer to his view a shifting panorama as soon as the dawn had got about a mile and a half from the english frigates a distance that was a little increased by the advance of the last towards their enemies we again backed our topsails for i had an ungovernable desire to be a spectator of what was to follow this feeling was common to all four of us it being next to impossible to get either neb or diogenes to pull a rope for gazing at the frigates as for steering it would have been out of the question i really believe as no one among us could keep his eyes long enough from the combatants to look after our own ship  some persons may think it was foolish not to make the most of our time in endeavouring to get as far as possible from the speedy perhaps it was but two miles distant there was really less to apprehend than might at first appear it was not probable the english would abandon the french vessels as long as they could stick by them or until they were captured and i was not so completely ignorant of my trade as to imagine that vessels like those of la grande nation which were in sight were to be taken without doing their adversaries a good deal of harm then the prizes themselves would require looking after and there were many other chances of our now going scotfree while there was really very small ground of danger but putting aside all these considerations curiosity and interest were so active in us all as to render it almost morally impossible we should quit the place until the battle was decided i am not absolutely certain the dawn would have moved had we been disposed to make her with these brief explanations then we will turn our attention exclusively to the frigates  by the time we had got the dawn just where we wished her to be the combatants were drawing quite near to each other the speedy had carried sail so long as to be a little to windward of her consorts wake though half a cableslength astern of her the french were in still closer order and they would soon be far enough advanced to bring the leading ship on each side under fire i supposed the opposing vessels would pass about a cableslength apart all four were under their topsails jibs and spankers with the courses in the brails the black prince and the speedy had their topgallantsails clewed up while la désirée and le cerf had theirs still sheeted home with the yards on the caps all four vessels had sent down royalyards this was fighting sail and everything indicated that monsieur menneval intended to make a day of it  the first gun was fired on this occasion from the désirée the leading french ship it was directed at the black prince and the shot probably told as sir hotham ward immediately kept away evidently with a desire to escape being raked the french did the same to keep square with their adversaries and the four vessels now ran on parallel lines though going different ways and a short cableslength asunder la désirée followed up her single gun with each division as it would bear until her whole broadside was delivered the black prince stood it all without answering though i could see that she was suffering considerably more especially aloft at length sir hotham ward was heard in the affair he let fly his whole broadside almost simultaneously and a spiteful threatening roar it was the smoke now began to hide his ship though la désirée by moving towards us kept ahead of her own sulphurous canopy  the speedy soon opened on the french commodore then by the roar astern i knew le cerf was at work in the smoke all four ships shivered their topsails to pass more slowly and there was a minute during which as it appeared to me all four actually stopped under the fiery cloud they had raised in order to do each other all the harm they could the frenchmen however soon issued from behind the curtain and the cessation in the firing announced that the ships had parted i could not see much of the english at first on account of the smoke but their antagonists came out of the fray short as it had been with torn sails crippled yards and le cerf had her mizen topmast actually hanging over to leeward just as i got a view of this calamity i caught a glimpse of the black prince closehauled luffing up athwart the wake of her enemies and manifestly menacing to get the wind the speedy followed with the accuracy of clockwork having rather closed with her leader instead of falling farther behind presently the black prince tacked but in so doing down came her maintopgallantmast bringing with it the yard and the sail as a matter of course this was a sign that mr menneval had not been firing a salute  the french stood on after this first rude essay with their enemies for several minutes during which time we could see their people actively but irregularly employed in clearing away the wrecks stoppering rigging and otherwise repairing damages le cerf in particular was much troubled with the topmast that was dangling over her leequarter and her people made desperate and tolerably welldirected efforts to get rid of it this they effected and about ten minutes after the firing had ceased the french ships put their helms up and went off to the northward dead before the wind as if inviting their enemies to come on and fight it out fairly in that manner if they felt disposed to pursue the affair any farther  it was time something of this sort was done for the delay had brought all four of the vessels so far to the westward as to leave them within a mile of the dawn and i saw the necessity of again getting out of the way we filled and stood off as fast as possible it was time something of the sort was done in another sense also when m menneval bore up his antagonists were closing fast on his weatherquarter and unless he meant to fight to leeward it was incumbent on him to get out of the way in his turn  sir hotham ward however was too skilful a seaman to neglect the advantage mons menneval had given him the instant the french kept away he did the same but instead of falling broad off before the wind he luffed again in time not having touched a brace and crossed the wakes of his enemies giving a most effective broadside into the cabinwindows of le cerf to my surprise la desiree held on her course until the speedy had repeated the dose the english then wore short round and were seemingly on the point of going over the same thing when mons menneval finding this a losing game hauled up firing as his guns bore and le cerf did the same with her head the other way destroying everything like concert in their movements the english closed and in a minute all four of the ships were enveloped in a common cloud of white smoke all we could now see were the masts from the trucks down sometimes as low as the tops but oftener not lower than the topsailyards the reports of the guns were quite rapid for a quarter of an hour after which they became much less frequent though a hundred pieces of ordnance were still at work behind that cloudy screen  several shot flew in our direction and two actually passed between our masts notwithstanding so keen was the interest we continued to feel that the topsail was again backed and there we lay lookerson as indifferent to the risks we ran as if we had been ashore minute passed after minute until a considerable period had been consumed yet neither of the combatants became fairly visible to us occasionally a part of a hull pushed itself out of the smoke or the wind blew the latter aside but at no time was the curtain sufficiently drawn to enable us to tell to which nation the vessel thus seen belonged the masts had disappeared not one remaining above the smoke which had greatly enlarged its circle however  in this manner passed an hour it was one of the most intensely interesting of my whole life and to me it seemed a day so eager was i to ascertain some result i had been several times in action as the reader knows but then the minutes flew whereas now this combat appeared drawn out to an interminable length i have said an hour thus passed before we could even guess at the probable result at the end of that time the firing entirely ceased it had been growing slacker and slacker for the last halfhour but it now stopped altogether the smoke which appeared to be packed on the ocean began to rise and disperse and little by little the veil rose from before that scene of strife  the vessel first seen by us was our old acquaintance the speedy all three of her topmasts were gone the fore just below the crosstrees and the two others near the lower caps her mainyard had lost one yardarm and her lower rigging and sides were covered with wreck she had her foresail mizen and forestaysail and spanker set which was nearly all the canvass she could show  our eyes had barely time to examine the speedy ere the dark hull of le cerf made its appearance this ship had been very roughly treatednothing standing on board her twenty feet from the deck but her foremast and the head of that was gone nearly down to the top the sea all around her was covered with wreck and no less than three of her boats were out picking up men who were adrift on the spars she lay about a cableslength from the speedy and appeared to be desirous of being still farther off as she had no sooner got her boats up than she dropped her foresail and stood off dead before it  it was in watching the movements of le cerf that we first got a glimpse of la désirée this ship reappeared almost in a line with her consort and like her steering off before the wind their common object seemed to be to get within close supporting distance of each other and to increase the space between them and their enemies both these vessels had the tricolored flag flying at the stumps of their masts as respects the last however la désirée was a little better off than her consorthaving her foremast and mainmast standing entirethough her mizenmast was gone close to the deck what was a very bad affair for her her foreyard had been shot away in the slings the two inner ends lying on the forecastle while the yardarms were loosely sustained by the lifts this ship kept off under her mainsail and forestaysail  the black prince was the last to get clear of the smoke she had everything in its place from her topmast crosstrees down the three topgallantmasts were gone and the wrecks were already cleared but all the topsailyards were on the caps and her rigging spars and tops were alive with men as indeed were those of the speedy this was the secret of the cessation in the actionthe two english frigates having turned their hands up to secure their spars while the frenchmen by running off dead before the wind were in positions not to bring a broadside gun to bear and the cabinchasers of a frigate were seldom of much use in that day on account of the rake of the stern it always appeared to me that the spaniards built the best ships in this respectthe english and americans in particular seeming never to calculate the chances of running away i do not say this in reference to the spanish ships however under any idea that the spanish nation wants couragefor a falser notion cannot existbut merely to state their superiority in one point of naval architecture at the very moment when having built a fine ship they did not know how to make use of her  the first ten minutes after the four combatants were clear of the smoke were actively employed in repairing damages on the part of the french confusedly and i make no doubt clamorously on that of the english with great readiness and a perfect understanding of their business notwithstanding this was the general character of the exertions of the respective parties there were exceptions to the rule on board le cerf for instance i observed a gang of men at work clearing the ship from the wreck of the mainmast who proceeded with a degree of coolness vigour and method which showed what materials were thrown away in that service for want of a good system and chiefly as i shall always think because the officers did not understand the immense importance of preserving silence on board a crowded vessel the native taciturnity of the english increased by the social discipline of that wellorderedperhaps overorderednation has won them as many battles on the ocean as the native loquacity of their enemiesincreased possibly during the reign of les citoyens by political exaggerationhas lost it is lucky for us that the american character inclines to silence and thoughtfulness in grave emergencies we are noisy garrulous and sputtering only in our politics  perceiving that the storm was likely to pass to leeward we remained stationary a little time to watch the closing scene i was surprised at the manner in which the black prince held aloof after the speedy had bore up and was running down in the track of her enemies sheering first upon one quarter of le cerf and then on the other pouring in a close and evidently a destructive fire at length sir hotham ward bore up and went off before the wind also moving three feet to the speedys two in consequence of being able to carry all three of her topsails it would seem that monsieur menneval was not satisfied with the manner in which his consort was treated for instead of waiting to be assailed in the same way he put his helm to port and came by the wind delivering a broadside as his ship luffed that soon explained the reason of the black princes delay that ship had been getting up preventers to save her masts and something important must have been cut by this discharge from la desiree as her mainmast went immediately after she received the fire dragging down with it her mizentopmast the english ship showed stuff however under circumstances so critical everything on the foremast still drew and she continued on heading direct for her enemy nor did she attempt to luff until within two hundred yards of her when she came by the wind slowly and heavily a manoeuvre that was materially aided by the foretopmasts following the spars aft just as her helm must have been put toport le cerf finding the battle was again to be stationary also came by the wind and then all four of the ships went at it again as ardently as if the affair had just commenced  it would not be easy to relate all the incidents of this second combat for two hours the four ships lay within a cableslength of each other keeping up as animated a contest as circumstances would allow i was particularly struck with the noble behaviour of the black prince which ship was compelled to fire through the wreck of her masts notwithstanding which she manifestly got the best of the cannonading as against tier particular antagonist la desiree i cannot say that either of the four vessels failed of her duty though i think as a whole sir hotham ward showed the most game probably from the fact that he had the most need of it encumbered by so much wreck of which it was impossible to get rid while exposed to so heavy a fire the black prince however was finally dropped by her adversary la desiree drawing gradually ahead until neither of those two vessels could bring a gun to bear the english now turned to to clear away wreck again while the frenchman bent a new forecourse and a new spanker those that had been standing being reduced to rags  the speedy and cerf had not been idle the while the french vessel played her part manfully nor was there much to choose between them when the latter wore round and followed her consort exchanging a fire with the black prince in passing her  had not the real superiority of the english over the french on the ocean now come in play this combat would have been a drawn battle though accompanied by the usual characteristics of such struggles at the close of the last and the beginning of the present century or the latter considering an escape ti sort of victory but both parties were reduced to the necessity of repairing damages and this was the work to prove true nautical skill any man may load and fire a gun but it needs a trained seaman to meet the professional emergencies of warfare a clodhopper might knock a mast out of a vessel but a sailor must replace it from the beginning of this affair all of us in the dawn had been struck with the order regularity and despatch with which the black prince and speedy had made and shortened sail and the quickness and resource with which they had done all that seamanship required in securing wounded spars and torn sails while there had been no end to marbles sneers and comments on the bungling confusion of the french this difference now became doubly apparent when there was no smoke nor any cannonading to divert the attention of the respective crews in half an hour the black prince was clear of the wreck and she had bent several new sails while the difficulties on board her antagonist appeared just then to be at their height this same difference existed between the two other vessels though on the whole le cerf got out of her distress sooner and more skilfully than her consort as to the speedy i must do my old acquaintance lord harry dermond the justice to say that he both fought his ship and repaired his damages in a highly seamanlike manner ill answer for it the hon lieut powlett had not much to do with either he had much better been in his mothers drawingroom that day and permitted a more fitting man to fill his place sennit was then on his way to barbadoes however nor do i believe your master of a pressgang ever does much before an enemy  fully two hours passed during which the combatants were busy in repairing damages at the end of this time la desirée and le cerf had drawn more than a mile to the eastward of the english ships the latter following them as soon as clear of their wrecks but under diminished sail the black prince had actually got up three spare topmasts in the interval and was now ready to set their sails the speedy was less active or less skilful though she too had not been idle then the english drove fast towards their enemies mons menneval bore up in good season this time edging away and opening the fire of both ships on his adversaries when they were about half a mile distant the effect of this early movement was soon apparent it being a great mistake to reserve a ships fire as against an enemy that approaches nearly bows on mdonough owed his victory in plattsburg bay to having improved so favourable a chance and the french were beaten at the nile because they did not though nelson probably would have overcome them under any circumstances the energy imparted by one of his character more than counterbalancing any little advantage in tactics  on the present occasion we could see the fire of the french taking effect on the black princes spars as soon as they opened her batteries as the mattter was subsequently explained in the official account that ships lower masts were badly wounded before she sent up the new topmasts and receiving some further injuries stick began to come down after stick until nothing was left of all her hamper but three stumps of lower masts the highest less than twenty feet above the deck sir hotham ward was now in the worst plight he had been in that day his ship being unable to advance a foot her drift excepted until everything was cut away to the landsman it may appear a small job to cut ropes with axes and thus liberate a vessel from the encumbrance and danger of falling spars but the seaman knows it is often a most delicate and laborious piece of duty the ocean is never quiet and a vessel that is not steadied by the pressure of her sails frequently rolls in a way to render it no slight task even to maintain ones footing on her decks frigates and ships of the line frequently proving more inconvenient than smaller vessels under such circumstances  there was one fortunate occurrence to the british connected with this disaster the french had been so thoroughly bent on dismasting the black prince that they paid little attention to the speedy that ship actually passing a short distance to windward of her consort unnoticed and unharmed as the french were going to leeward the whole time it enabled the speedy to get out of the range of their guns before she bore up as soon as this was effected she followed her enemies under twice as much canvass as they carried themselves of course in less than half an hour she was enabled to close with le cerf coming up on one of her quarters and opening a heavy fire close aboard her all this time the black prince remained like a log upon the water trying to get clear of her wreck the combat driving slowly away from her to leeward her men worked like ants and we actually heard the cheers they raised as the hull of their ship forged itself clear of the maze of masts yards sails and rigging in which it had been so long enveloped this was no sooner done than she let fall a sail from her spritsailyard one bent for the occasion and a topgallantsail was set to a light spar that had been rigged against the stump of the mainmast the stick that rose highest from her deck  as the battle like a gust in the heavens was passing to leeward marble and i determined to fill and follow the combatants down the course being precisely that we wished to steer with a view however to keep out of the range of shot we hauled the dawn up to the eastward first intending to keep her away in the wake of the black prince of course we were in no hurry it now being in our power to go six feet to that ships one  in executing our purpose we passed close to the wreck of the english frigates spars there they were rolling about on the troubled water and we actually saw the body of a man caught in some of the rigging as the sea occasionally tossed it to the surface the poor fellow had probably gone over with the mast and been drowned before assistance could be rendered with an enemy escaping manofwarsmen are not very particular about picking up the bodies of their dead  i did not venture to run the dawn directly down in the englishmans wake but we kept her off and on rather taking good care not to go within a mile of her all this time the speedy was playing upon the cerfs quarter the latter ship becoming too crippled to luff while mons menneval was travelling off to leeward unmolested having obtained an advantage in the way of speed that he was unwilling to put in any jeopardy by coming again under fire this officer did not want for spirit but the french had got to be so accustomed to defeat in their naval encounters with the english that like several other nations on the land they had begun to look upon victory as hopeless the cerf was very nobly fought notwithstanding the disadvantages under which she laboured that ship held out until the black prince had actually given her a close broadside on her larboard quarter the speedy being kept the whole time on her starboard with great skill pouring in a nearly unresisted fire the cerf struck only as she found that the battle was to be two to one and under so many other disadvantages in the bargain  this closed the affair so far as the fighting was concerned la desiree standing on unmolested though as i afterwards learned she was picked up next morning by a homewardbound english twodecker hauling down her colours without any resistance  the reader may feel some curiosity to know how we fell on board the dawn during the five hours that elapsed between the firing of the first and the last guns on this occasion what was said among us and how we proceeded as soon as the victory was decided the last he will learn in the regular course of the narrative as for the first it is soon told it was not easy to find four men who were more impartial as between the combatants than those in the dawn my early preferences had certainly been in favour of england as was very generally the case among all the bettereducated americans of my period at least as low down as the war of 1812 but going beyond the scene of internal political discussion and substituting observation for the eulogies and sophisms of the newspapers had wrought divers changes in my opinion england was then no more to me than any other nation i was not of the french school of politics however and kept myself as much aloof from one of these foreign schools of political logicians as from the other i may be said to have been born a federalist but this change of sentiment had prevented my ever giving a federal vote since attaining my majority  marble had entertained a strong dislike for england ever since the revolution but at the same time he had inherited the vulgar contempt of his class for frenchmen and i must own that he had a fierce pleasure in seeing the combatants destroy each other had we been near enough to witness the personal suffering inflicted by the terrible wounds of a naval combat i make no doubt his feelings would have been different but as things were he only saw french and english ships tearing each other to pieces during the height of the affair he observed to meif this monsieur gallois and his bloody lugger could only be brought into the scrape miles my mind would be contented i should glory in seeing the corvette and the polisson scratching out each others eyes like two fishwomen whose dictionaries have given out  neb and diogenes regarded the whole thing very much as i suppose the caesars used to look upon the arena when the gladiators were the most bloodthirsty the negroes would laugh cry golly or shake their heads with delight when halfadozen guns went off together receiving the reports as a sort of evidence that crashing work was going on on board the vessels but i overheard a dialogue between these two children of africa that may best explain their feelings  which you tink whip neb diogenes asked with a grin that showed every ivory tooth in his head  i tink em bot get it smartly answered my fellow you see how a speedy make quick work eh  i wish em go a leetle nearer nebsome shot nebber hit at all  dat always so cook in battle dere dat a smasher for john bull  he wont want to press more men just now eh neb  now you see johnny crepaud catch it woss dat cracks e cabin winders  what dat to us neb spose he eat one anoder dont hurt us  here the two spectators broke out into a loud fit of laughter clapping their hands and swinging their bodies about as if the whole thing were capital fun diogenes was so much delighted when all the black princes spars went that he actually began to dance neb regarding his antics with a sort of goodnatured sympathy there is no question that man at the bottom has a good deal of the wild beast in him and that he can be brought to look upon any spectacle however fierce and sanguinary as a source of interest and entertainment if a criminal is to be executed we always find thousands of both sexes and all ages assembling to witness a fellowcreatures agony and though these curious personages often have sentimental qualms during the revolting spectacle itself they never turn away their eyes until satisfied with all that there is to be seen of the terrible or the revolting  a word must be added concerning an acquaintancemonsieur gallois just as the black princes masts went i saw him a long way to windward stretching in towards the coast and carrying sail as hard as his lugger would bear the corvette was still close at his heels and marble soon after drew my attention towards him to observe the smoke that was rising above the sloopofwar the distance was so great and the guns so light that we heard no reports but the smoke continued to rise until both vessels went out of sight in the southwestern board i subsequently learned that the lugger escaped after all she was very hard pressed and would have been captured had not the english ship carried away her maintopgallantmast in her eagerness to get alongside to that accident alone did m gallois owe his escape i trust he and m le gros had a happy meeting    chapter xix      the sea waxd calm and we discovered   two ships from far making amain to us   of corinth that of epidaurus this   but on they cameo let me say no more   gather the sequel by that went before    comedy of errors   it was high time for the dawn to be doing of all the ships to leeward the speedy the vessel we had most reason to apprehend was in the best condition to do us harm it was true that just then we might outsail her but a manofwars crew would soon restore the balance of power if it did not make it preponderate against us i called to my mate and we went aft to consult  it will not do for us to remain any longer here moses i began the english are masters of the day and the speedys officers having recognised us beyond all doubt she will be on our heels the moment she can  i rather think miles her travelling for some hours to come is over there she is however and she has our crew on board her and it would be a good thing to get some of them if possible if a body had a boat now i might go down with a flag of truce and see what tarms could be made  i laughed at this conceit telling marble he would be wise to remain where he was i would give the speedy four hours to get herself in tolerable sailing trim again supposing her bent on pursuit if in no immediate hurry it might occupy her fourandtwenty hours  i think she may be disposed to follow the other french frigate which is clearly making her way towards brest i added in which case we have nothing to fear by george there goes a gun and here comes a shot in our directionyou can see it moses skipping along the water almost in a line between us and the frigateay here it comes  all this was literally true the speedy lay with her bows towards us and she had suddenly fired the shot to which i alluded and which now came bounding from wave to wave until it struck precisely in a line with the ship about a hundred yards distant  halloo cried marble who had levelled his glass towards the frigatestheres the deuce to pay down there milesone boat pulling thisaway for life or death and another ater it the shot was intended for the leading boat and not for us  this brought my glass down too sure enough there was a small boat pulling straight for us and of course directly to windward of the frigate the men in it exerting every nerve there were seven seamen in this boat six at the oars and one steering the truth flashed on me in a moment these were some of our own people headed by the secondmate who had availed themselves of the circumstance of one of the speedys boats being in the water without a crew to run away with it in the confusion of the moment the black prince had taken possession of the prize as we had previously noted and that with a single boat and the cutter in pursuit appeared to me to be coming from the frenchman i immediately acquainted marble with my views of the matter and he seized on the idea eagerly as one probable and natural  thems our fellows miles he exclaimed we must fill and meet em halfway  it was certainly in our power to lessen the distance the fugitives had to run by standing down to meet the leading boat this could not be done however without going within reach of the english guns the late experiment showing unanswerably that we lay just without the drop of their shot as it was i never saw men in a greater excitement than that which now came over us all in the dawn fill we did immediately that at least could do no harm whereas it might do much good i never supposed for a moment the english were sending boats after us since with the wind that was blowing it would have been easy for the dawn to leave them miles behind her in the first hour each instant rendered my first conjecture the most likely to be true there could be no mistaking the exertions of the crews of the two boats the pursuers seemingly doing their best as well as the pursued the frigate could no longer fire however the boats being already in a line and there being equal danger to both from her shot  the reader will understand that large ships seldom engage when the ocean will permit it without dropping one or more of their boats into the water and that warm actions at sea rarely occur without most of the boats being more or less injured it often happens that a frigate can muster only one or two boats that will swim after a combat and frequently only the one she had taken the precaution to lower into the water previously to engaging it was owing to some such circumstance that only one boat followed the fugitives in the present instance the race must necessarily be short and it would have been useless to send a second boat in pursuit could one be found after the first two or three allimportant minutes were lost  the dawn showed her ensign as a sign we saw our poor fellows struggling to regain us and then we filled our maintopsail squaring away and standing down directly for the fugitives heavens how that mainyard went round though there were but three men at the braces each of us hauled and worked like a giant there was every inducement of feeling interest and security to do so with our present force the ship could scarcely be said to be safe whereas the seven additional hands and they our own people who were straining every nerve to join us would at once enable us to carry the ship direct to hamburg  our old craft behaved beautifully neb was at the wheel the cook on the forecastle while marble and i got ropes cleared away to throw to the runaways as soon as they should be near enough to receive them down we drove towards the boat and it was time we did for the cutter in pursuit which pulled ten oars and was full manned was gaining fast on the fugitives as we afterwards learned in the eagerness of starting our men had shipped the crest of a sea and they were now labouring under the great disadvantage of carrying more than a barrel of water which was washing about in the bottom of their cutter rendering her both heavy and unsteady  so intense was the interest we all felt in the result of this struggle that our feelings during the battle could not be compared to it i could see marble move his body as a sitter in a boat is apt to do at each jerk of the oars under the notion it helps the party along diogenes actually called out and this a dozen times at least to encourage the men to pull for their lives though they were not yet within a mile of us the constant rising and setting of the boats prevented my making very minute observations with the glass but i distinguished the face of my secondmate who was sitting aft and i could see he was steering with one hand and bailing with the other we now waved our hats in hopes of being seen but got no answering signal the distance being still too great  at that moment i cared nothing for the guns of the english ship though we were running directly for them the boatthe boat was our object for that we steered as unerringly as the motion of the rolling water would allow it blew a good working breeze and what was of the last importance to us it blew steadily i fancied the ship did not move notwithstanding though the rate at which we drew nearer to the boat ought to have told us better but anxiety had taken the place of reason and we were all disposed to see things as we felt rather than as we truly found them  there was abundant reason for uneasiness the cutter astern certainly going through the water four feet to the others three manned with her regular crew with everything in order and with men accustomed to pull together the largest boat and rowing ten oars to the six of my mates i make no doubt that the cutter of the black prince would have beaten materially in an ordinary race more especially in the rough water over which this contest occurred but nearly a tenth full of water the boat of the fugitives had a greatly lessened chance of escape  of course we then knew no more than we could see and we were not slow to perceive how fast the pursuers were gaining on the pursued i really began to tremble for the result and this so much the more as the larger cutter was near enough by this time to permit me to discover by means of the glass the endsof several muskets rising out of her sternsheets could she get near enough for her officers to use these weapons the chance of our people was gonesince it was not to be even hoped they had any arms  the end approached the dawn had got good way on hermarble and diogenes having dragged down the maintopgallant sheets and hoisted the sail the water foamed under our bows and the boat was soon so near it became indispensable to haul our wind this we did with the ships head to the westward without touching a brace though we luffed sufficiently to throw the wind out of all the square sails the last was done to deaden the vessels way in order that the fugitives might reach her  the struggle became frightful for its intenseness our men were so near we could recognise them without the aid of a glass with it i could read the glowing anxiety that was in my secondmates countenance each instant the pursuers closed until they were actually much nearer to the pursued than the latter were to the dawn for the first time now i suspected the truth by the heavy movement of the flying cutter and the water that the secondmate was constantly bailing out of her using his hat marble brought up the muskets left by the privateersmen and began to renew their primings he wished to fire at once on the pursuing boatshe being within range of a bullet but this i knew would not be legal i promised to use them should the english attempt to board the ship but did not dare to anticipate that movement  nearer and nearer came the boats the chasing gaining always on the chased and now the black prince and the speedy each threw a shot quite over us we were about a mile from the three frigatesrather increasing than lessening that distance however as they drifted to leeward while we were slightly luffing with our yards a little braced up the leeches lifting neb steered the ship as one would have guided a pilotboat he had an eye for the boats as well as for the sailsknew all that was wanted and all that to be done i never saw him touch a wheel with so delicate a hand or one that better did its duty the dawns way was so much deadened as to give the fugitives every opportunity to close while she was steadily coming up abreast of their course in readiness to meet them  at this instant the officer in the black princes cutter fired into that of the speedy and one of our men suddenly dropped his oar he was hit i thought the poor fellows arm was broken for i could see him lay a hand on the injured part like a man who suffered pain he instantly changed places with the secondmate who however seized his oar and began to use it with great power three more muskets were fired seemingly without doing any harm but the leading boat lost by this delay while its pursuers held steadily on our own people were within a hundred and fifty yards of usthe english less than twenty behind them why the latter did not now fire i do not actually know but i suppose it to be because their muskets were all discharged and the race was now too sharp to allow their officer to reload possibly he did not wish to take life unnecessarily the chances fast turning to his side  i called out to marble to stand by with a rope the ship was slowly drawing ahead and there was no time to be lost i then shouted to my secondmate to be of good heart and he answered with a cheer the english hurrahed and we sent back the cry from the ship  stand by in the boat for the rope i criedheave mosesheave  marble hove from the mizen chains the rope was caught and a motion of my hand told neb to keep the ship off until everything drew this was done and the rattling of the clewgarnet blocks announced that diogenes was hauling down the maintack with the strength of a giant the sail opened and moses and i hauled in the sheet until the ship felt the enormous additional pressure of this broad breadth of canvass at this instant there was a cheer from the boat leaping upon the taffrail i saw the men erect waving their hats and looking toward the pursuing cutter then within a hundred feet of them vainly attempting to come up with a boat that was now dragging nearly bows under and feeling all the strength of our tow the officer cheered his men to renewed exertion and he began to load a musket at this moment the towline slipped from the thwart of the boat and we shot away as it seemed to me a hundred feet on the send of the very next sea there was not time for the americans to get seated at their oars again before the other cutter grappled all that had been gained was lost and after so near and close a chance of recovering the most valuable portion of my crew was i again left on the ocean with the old four to manage the dawn  the english lieutenant knew his business too well to abandon the ship while there was a chance of recovering her the wind lulled a little and he thought the hope of success worth an effort merely taking all the oars out of the speedys cutter he dashed on in our wake at first he gained nor was i unwilling he should for i wished to speak him the main and foresheets were eased off and neb was told to keep the topsails lifting thus favoured he soon got within fifty yards of us straining every nerve to get nearer the officer pointed a musket at me and ordered me to heaveto i jumped off the taffrail and with my body covered to the shoulders pointed one of the french muskets at him and warned him to keep off  what have you done with the prizecrew put on board you from the speedy the other day called out the lieutenant  sent them adrift i answered weve had enough of prizecrews in this ship and want no more  heaveto sir on the pain of being treated as a pirate also  ay ay shouted marble who could keep silent no longerfirst catch a pirate fire if you are tired of your cruise i wish them bloody frenchmen had stopped all your grog  this was neither dignified nor politic and i ordered my mate to be silent in a goodnatured tone i inquired for the names of the late combatants and the losses of the different ships but this was too cool for our pursuers humour and i got no answer he did not dare fire however finding we were armed and as i supposed seeing there was no prospect of his getting easily on board us even should he get alongside he gave up the chase returning to the captured boat we again filled and trimmed everything and went dashing through the water at the rate of seven knots  the frigates did not fire at us after the guns already mentioned why i cannot positively say but i thought at the time that they had too many other things to attend to besides seeing the little chance there was of overtaking us should they even happen to cripple a spar or two  great was the disappointment on board the dawn at the result of the final incidents of this eventful day marble swore outright for no remonstrances of mine could cure him of indulging in this habit especially when a little excited diogenes grinned defiance and fairly shook his fists at the boat while neb laughed and halfcried in a breaththe sure sign the fellows feelings were keenly aroused  as for myself i felt as much as any of the party but preserved more selfcommand i saw it was now necessary to quit that vicinity and to take some definite steps for the preservation of my own ship and property there was little to apprehend however from the frigates unless indeed it should fall calm in the latter case they might board us with their boats which an hour or twos work would probably enable them to use again but i had no intention of remaining in their neighbourhood being desirous of profiting by the present wind  the sails were trimmed accordingly and the ship was steered northwesterly on a course that took us past the three vessels of war giving them so wide a berth as to avoid all danger from their batteries as soon as this was done and the dawn was travelling her road at a good rate i beckoned to marble to come near the wheel for i had taken the helmsmans duty on myself for an hour or two in other words i was doing that which from my boyish experience on the hudson i had once fancied it was not only the duty but the pleasure of every shipmaster to do viz steering little did i understand before practice taught me the lesson that of all the work on board ship which jack is required to do his trick at the wheel is that which he least covets unless indeed it may be the office of stowing the jib in heavy weather  well moses i began this affair is over and weve the atlantic before us again with all the ports of europe to select from and a captain one mate the cook and one man to carry the ship where we please to take her  ay ayt has been a bad job this last i was as sure of them lads until the lieutenant fired his musket as ever i was of a good landfall with a fair wind i cant describe to you miles the natur of the disappintment i felt when i saw em give up i can best compare it to that which came over me when i discovered i was nothing but a bloody hermit after all my generalizing about being a governor and a lord high admiral of an island all to myself as it might be  it cant be helped and we must take things as we find them the question is what is to be done with the ship should we venture into the channel yonder chaps will be after us with the news of a yankee on board of whom they put a prizecrew being adrift without the men and there are fifty cruisers ready to pick us up the news will spread all over the channel in a week and our chances of getting through the straits of dover will be so small as not to be worth naming nay these fellows will soon repair damages and might possibly overtake us themselves the speedy is only halfcrippled  i seei see youve a trick with you miles that makes a few words go a great way i see and i agree but an idee has come to my mind that youre welcome to and after turning it over do what you please with it instead of going to the eastward of scilly what say you to passing to the westward and shaping our course for the irish channel the news will not follow us thataway for some time and we may meet with some american or other bound to liverpool should the worst come to the worst we can pass through between ireland and scotland and work our way round cape wrath and go into our port of destination it is a long road i know and a hard one in certain seasons of the year but it may be travelled in midsummer comfortably enough  i like your notion well enough marble and am ready to carry it out as far as we are able it must be a hard fortune indeed that will not throw us in the way of some fisherman or coaster who will be willing to let us have a bend or two for double wages  why on that pint miles the difficulty is in the war and the hot press that must now be going the english will be shy in visiting the opposite coast and good men are hard to find just now im thinking floating about the coasts of england unless they are under a pennant  a hand or two that can steer will be an immense relief to us moses even though unable to go aloft call neb to the wheel then and well go look at the chart so as to lay our course  all was done accordingly in half an hour the dawn was steering for the western coast of england with everything set we thought it prudent to carry two hours after we began to move away from the spot where they lay the frigates had sunk behind the curvature of the earth and we lost sight of them altogether the weather continued good the breeze steady and fresh and the dawn did her duty admirably we began to get accustomed to our situations and found them less arduous than had been apprehended the direction of the wind was so favourable that it kept hope alive though we trebled our distance by going round the british islands instead of passing directly up channel twentyfour hours were necessary to carry us as far north as the lands end however and i determined to be then governed by circumstances should the wind shift we always had the direct route before us and i had my doubts whether putting a bold face on the matter running close in with the english shore and appearing to be bound for london were not the wisest course there certainly was the danger of the speedys telling our story in which case there would be a sharp lookout for us while there was the equal chance that she might speak nothing for a week eightandforty hours ahead of her i should not have feared much from her account of us  it is unnecessary to dwell minutely on the events of the next few days the weather continued good the wind fair and our progress was in proportion we saw nothing until we got within two leagues of scilly light when we were boarded by a pilotboat out from those islands this occurred at sunrise with the wind light at northeast and one sail in sight to windward that had the appearance of a brigofwar though she was still hull down and not heading for us  i saw that the smallness of our crew and the course we were steering struck these pilots the moment they had time to ascertain the first fact it was not usual in that day nor do i suppose it is now for deepladen americans to pass so near england coming from the southeast and steering to the northwest a remark to this effect fell from the mouth of the principal pilot as soon as i told him i did not wish to go in to any of the neighbouring ports  i am short of hands and am desirous of obtaining three or four good men i said who shall be well paid for their services and sent back without cost to the place whence they came  ay i see youve a small crew for so stout a craft master the pilot answered may i ask what has happened to bring you down so low  why you know how it is among your cruisers in wartimean english frigate carried away all hands with the exception of these you see  now this was true to the ear at least though i saw plainly enough that i was not believed  its not often his majestys officers shave so close the pilot answered with a sort of sneer i did not like they commonly send in hands with a ship when they find it necessary to take her own men  ay i suppose the laws require this with english vessels with americans they are less particular at all events you see the whole of us and i should be very glad to get a hand or two if possible out of your cutter  where are you bound masterbefore we ship wed like to know the port we sail for  hamburg  hamburg why master youre not heading for hamburg at all which lies up the english not up the irish channel  i am well aware of all that but i am afraid to go into the english channel so shorthanded those narrow waters give a man trouble unless he has a full crew  the channel is a good place to find men master however none of us can go with you and no words be necessary as youve no occasion for a pilot we must be off ater something else  the fellow now left me without more words and i saw there was no use in attempting to detain him he had got a league from us and we were jogging on our course before we discovered he was making signals to the brig which had kept dead away and had set studdingsails on both sides as this was carrying much more sail than we could venture to show i thought our chance of escape small indeed there was the whole day before us with a light and doubtless fastsailing cruiser in chase of a heavilyloaded merchantman as a sternchase is proverbially a long chase however i determined to do all we could to avoid the gentleman sail was made accordingly so far as we dared and the ship was steered a little off as her best mode of sailing in her present trim we saw the brig speak the pilotboat and from that moment were certain her commander had all the conjectures of the scilly man added to his own the effect was soon to be noted for when the two separated the cutter stood in for her own rocks while the brig renewed her chase  that was an uneasy day the manofwar gained but it was quite slowly she might beat us by a knot in the hour and being ten miles astern there was still the hope of its falling dark before she could close the wind too was unsteady and towards noon it grew so light as to reduce both vessels to only two or three knots way of course this greatly lessened the difference in our rate of sailing and i had now strong hopes that night might come before our pursuers could close  nor was i disappointed the wind continued light until sunset when it came out a fine breeze at northwest bringing us dead to windward of the brig which was then distant some six miles we got the proper sail on the ship as fast as we could though the cruiser was dashing ahead under everything she could carry long before we could get through with the necessary work when we did get at it notwithstanding i found she had not much the advantage of us and now began to entertain some hopes of shaking her off in the course of the night marble was confident of it and his confidence on points of seamanship was always entitled to respect  about ten both vessels were on the starboard tack standing to the southward and westward or out towards the broad atlantic with the brig about a league under the dawns lee and a little forward of her beam this was the most favourable position for us to be in in order to effect our purpose since the cruiser had already passed her nearest point to us on that tack the horizon to windward and all along the margin of the sea at the northward was covered with clouds which threatened by the way a capfull of wind this dark background would be likely to prevent our being seen and the instant the night shut in the outline of the brigs canvass i ordered our helm put down  it was lively business tacking such a ship as the dawn under so much canvass and in such a breeze with four men the helm was lashed hard down and at it we went like so many tigers the afteryards swung themselves though the maintack and sheet gave us a good deal of trouble we braced everything aft sharp up before we left it having first managed to get the foreyard square when this was done we filled all forward and dragged the yards and bowlines to their places with a will that seemed irresistible  there were no means of knowing whether the brig came round about this time or not agreeably to the rule of chasing she should have tacked when directly abeam unless she fancied she could eat us out of the wind by standing on we knew she did not tack when directly abeam but we could not see whether she came round after us or not at all events tack or not she must still be near a league under our lee and we drove on towards the english coast until the day reappeared not a man of us all sleeping a wink that night how anxiously we watched the ocean astern and to leeward as the returning light slowly raised the veil of obscurity from before us nothing was in sight even when the sun appeared to bathe the entire ocean in a flood of glory not even a white speck inshore and as for the brig we never saw or heard more of her doubtless she stood on on the old course hoping gradually to close with us or to draw so far ahead and to windward as to make certain of her prey in the morning  according to our reckoning the ship was now heading well up towards the coast of wales which we might expect to make in the course of the next fourandtwenty hours should the wind stand i determined therefore to make the best of the matter and to go directly up the irish channel hoping to fall in with some boat from the north shore that might not have as apt intellects on board it as those of our scilly pilot had proved to be we stood on consequently all that day and another sun set without our making the land we saw several vessels at a distance in the afternoon but we were now in a part of the ocean where an american ship would be as little likely to be disturbed as in any i know it was the regular track of vessels bound to liverpooland these last were as little molested as the want of men would at all permit could we get past that port we should then be in the way of picking up half a dozen irishmen    chapter xx      och botherationt is a beautiful coost     all made up of rocks and deep bays   ye may sail up and down a marvellous host     and admire all its beautiful ways    irish song   little did we or could we anticipate all that lay before us the wind held at northwest until the ship had got within twenty miles of the welsh coast then it came out light again at the southward we were now so near liverpool that i expected every hour to make some american bound in none was seen notwithstanding and we stood up channel edging over towards the irish coast at the same time determined to work our way to the northward as well as we could this sort of weather continued for two days and nights during which we managed to get up as high as whitehaven when the wind came dead ahead blowing a stiff breeze i foresaw from the commencement of this new wind that it would probably drive us down channel and out into the atlantic once more unless we could anchor i thought i would attempt the last somewhere under the irish coast in the hope of getting some assistance from among the children of st patrick we all knew that irish sailors half the time were not very well trained but anything that could pull and haul would be invaluable to us in heavy weather we had now been more than a week four of us in all working the ship and instead of being in the least fagged we had rather got settled into our places as it might be getting along without much trouble still there were moments when a little extra force would be of great moment to us and i could see by the angry look of the skies that these moments were likely to increase in frequency and in the magnitude of their importance to us  the waters we were in were so narrow that it was not long before we drew close in with the irish coast here to my great joy we saw a large fishingboat well out in the offing and under circumstances that rendered it easy for those in it to run close under our lee we made a signal therefore and soon had the strangers lyingto in the smooth water we made for them with our own mainyard aback it is scarcely necessary to say that we had gradually diminished our own canvass as it became necessary until the ship was under doublereefed topsails the forecourse jib and spanker we had brought the topsails down lower than was necessary in order to anticipate the time when it might be indispensable  the first of the men who came on board us was named terence o

will not drag  och is it that well all the bottom in this counthry is of that same natur none of it will drag without pulling mighty hard ill swear to any part of it  you surely would not think of anchoring a ship out here a league from the land with nothing to break either wind or sea and a gale commencing  i anchor divil the bit did i ever anchor a ship or a brig or even a cutther ive not got so high up as that yer honour but yons ould michael sweeny now manys the anchor hes cast out miles at a time sayin hes been a sayman and knows the says from top to bottom its michael yell want and michael ye shall have  michael was spoken to and he clambered up out of the boat as well as he could the task not being very easy since the fishermen with difficulty kept their dull heavy boat out of our mizen chains in the mean time marble and i found time to compare notes we agreed that mr terence mcscale or o somethingfor i forget the fellows surnamewould probably turn out a more useful man in hauling in mackerel and john dorys than in helping us to take care of the dawn nor did michael at the first glance promise anything much better he was very oldeighty i should thinkand appeared to have nullified all the brains he ever had by the constant use of whiskey the scent of which accompanied him with a sort of parasitical odour as that of tannin attends the leatherdresser he was not drunk just then however but seemed cool and collected i explained my wishes to this man and was glad to find he had a tolerable notion of nautical terms and that he would not be likely to get us into difficulty like terence through any ignorance on this score  is it anchor ye would yer honour answered michael when i had concluded sure thats aisy enough and the saison is good for that same for the wind is getting up like a giant as for the guineas yer honour mintions its of no avail atween frinds ill take em to obleege ye if yer honour so wills but the ship should be anchored if there niver was a grain of goold in the wurrrld would ye like a berth pratty well out or would yer honour choose to go in among the rocks and lie like a babby in its cradhle  i should prefer a safe roadstead to venturing too far in without a professed pilot by the look of the land inshore i should think it would be easy to find a lee against this wind provided we can get good holdinggrounds that is the difficulty i most apprehend  trust ould ireland for that yer honour yes put faith in us for that same yeve only to fill your topsail and stand in ould michael and ould ireland together will take care of yees  i confess i greatly disliked the aspect of things inshore with such a pilot but the aspect of things outside was still worse shorthanded as we were it would be impossible to keep the ship in the channel should the gale come on as heavily as it threatened and a single experiment satisfied me the four men in the boat would be of very little use in working her for i never saw persons who knew anything of the water more awkward than they turned out to be on our decks michael knew something it is true but he was too old to turn his knowledge to much practical account for when i sent him to the wheel neb had to remain there to assist him in steering there was no choice therefore and i determined to stand close in when should no suitable offer it would always be in our power to ware offshore the fishingboat was dropped astern accordingly the men were all kept in the ship and we stood in nearer to the coast the dawn bending to the blasts under the sail we carried in a way to render it difficult to stand erect on her decks  the coast promised well as to formation though there was much to apprehend on the subject of the bottom among rocks an anchor is a ticklish thing to confide in and i feared it might be a difficult matter to find a proper bottom as far out as i deemed it prudent to remain but michael and terence and pat and murphy or whatever were the names of our protesting confident friends insisted that ould ireland would never fail us marble and i stood on the forecastle watching the formation of the coast and making our comments as the ship drove through the short seas buried to her figurehead at length we thought a headland that was discernible a little under our leebow looked promising and michael was called from the wheel and questioned concerning it the fellow affirmed he knew the place well and that the holdingground on each side of it was excellent consenting at once to a proposition of mine to bring up under its lee we edged off therefore for this point making the necessary preparations for bringing up  i was too busy in getting in canvas to note the progress of the ship for the next twenty minutes it took all four of us to stow the jib leaving michael at the wheel the while and a tremendous job it was though i say it in humility four better men never lay out on a spar than those who set about the task on this occasion we got it in however but i need scarcely tell the seaman it was not stowed in the skin marble insisted on leading the party and never before had i seen the old fellow work as he did on that day he had a faculty of incorporating his body and limbs with the wood and ropes standing as it might be on air working and dragging with his arms and broad shoulders in a way that appeared to give him just as much command of his entire strength as another man would possess on the ground  at length we reduced the canvass to the foretopmast staysail and maintopsail the latter doublereefed it was getting to be time that the last should be close reefed and we carried four reefs in the dawn but we hoped the cloth would hold out until we wanted to roll it up altogether the puffs however began to come galefashion and i foresaw we should get it presently in a style that would require good looking to  the ship soon drove within the extremity of the headland the lead giving us forty fathoms of water i had previously asked michael what water we might expect but this he frankly owned he could not tell he was certain that ships sometimes anchored there but what water they found was more than he knew he was no conjuror and guessing might be dangerous so he chose to say nothing about it it was nervous work for a shipmaster to carry his vessel on a coast under such pilotage as this i certainly would have wore round as it was were it not for the fact that there was a clear sea to leeward and that it would always be as easy to run out into the open water as the wind was at that moment  marble and i now began to question our fisherman as to the precise point where he intended to fetch up michael was bothered and it was plain enough his knowledge was of the most general character as for the particulars of his calling he treated them with the coolest indifference he had been much at sea in his younger days it is true but it was in ships of war where the ropes were put into his hands by captains of the mast and where his superiors did all the thinking he could tell whether ships did or did not anchor near a particular spot but he knew no reason for the one or for the other in a word he had just that sort of knowledge of seamanship as one gets of the world by living in a province where we all learn the leading principles of humanity and trust to magazines and works of fiction for the finesse of life  the lead proved a better guide than michael and seeing some breakers inshore of us i gave the order to clew up the maintopsail and to luff to the wind before the ship should lose her way our irishmen pulled and hauled well enough as soon as they were directed what to do which enabled marble and myself each to stand by a stopper we had previously got the two bowers acockbill the cables were bent as soon as we made the land and nothing remained but to let run neb was at the wheel with orders to spring to the cables as soon as he heard them running out and everything was in readiness i shouted the order to let run and down both our anchors went at the same instant in twentytwo fathoms water the ship took cable at a fearful rate but marble and diogenes being at one bower and neb and i at the other we succeeded in snubbing her with something like twenty fathoms within the hawseholes there was a minute when i thought the old bark would get away from us and when by desperate efforts we did succeed in checking the mass it seemed as if she would shake the windlass out of her no time was lost in stoppering the cables and in rolling up the maintopsail  michael and his companions now came to wish us good luck get the guineas and to take their leave the sea was already so rough that the only mode that remained of getting into their boat was by dropping from the end of the spanker boom i endeavoured to persuade two or three of these fellows to stick by the ship but in vain they were all married and they had a certain protection against impressment in their present manner of life whereas should they be found at large some manofwar would probably pick them up and michaels tales of the past had not given them any great zest for the sort of life he described  when these irish fishermen left us and ran inshore we were thrown again altogether on our own resources i had explained to michael our want of hands however attributing it to accidents and impressments and he thought he could persuade four or five young fellows to come off as soon as the gale abated on condition we would take them to america after discharging at hamburg these were to be mere peasants it is true for seamen were scarce in that part of the world but they would be better than nothing half a dozen athletic young irishmen would relieve us seamen from a vast deal of the heavy lugging work of the ship and leave us strength and spirits to do that which unavoidably fell to our share with the understanding that he was to receive himself a guinea ahead for each sound man thus brought us we parted from old michael who probably has never piloted a ship since as i strongly suspect he had never done before    chapter xxi      the power of god is everywhere   pervades all space and time   the power of god can still the air   and rules in every clime   then bow the heart and bend the knee   and worship oer both land and sea    duo   i never knew precisely the point on the coast of ireland where we anchored it was somewhere between strangford and dundrum bay though the name of the headland which gave us a sort of protection i did not learn in this part of the island the coast trends north and south generally though at the place where we anchored its direction was nearly from northnortheast to southsouthwestwhich in the early part of the gale was as close as might be the course in which the wind blew at the moment we brought up the wind had hauled a little further to the northward giving us a better lee but to my great regret michael had scarcely left us when it shifted to due northeast making a fair rake of the channel this left us very little of a leethe point ahead of us being no great matter and we barely within it i consulted such maps as i had and came to the conclusion that we were off the county down a part of the kingdom that was at least civilized and where we should be apt to receive good treatment in the event of being wrecked our fishermen told us that they belonged to a ballysomething but what the something was i have forgotten if i ever understood them told us i say out of complaisance but tould would be the better word as all they uttered savoured so much of the brogue that it was not always easy to get at their meaning  it was past noon when the dawn anchored and the wind got more to the eastward about half an hour afterwards it was out of the question to think of getting under way again with so strong a wind and with our feeble crew had it been perfectly smooth water and had there been neither tide nor air it would have taken us half a day at least to get out two bowers it was folly therefore to think of it situated as we were it only remained to ride out the gale in the best manner we could  nothing occurred for several hours except that the gale increased sensibly in violence like an active disease it was fast coming to a crisis towards sunset however a little incident took place that gave me great uneasiness of itself though i had forebodings of evil from the commencement of that tempest two sail appeared in sight to windward being quite near us close in with the irish coast before either was observed on board the dawn the leading vessel of the two was a manofwar cutter running nearly before it under a closereefed squaresailcanvass so low that it might easily be confounded with the foam of the sea at a little distance she rounded the headland and was edging away from the coast apparently for searoom when she took a sudden sheer in our direction as if curious to ascertain what could have taken so large a squarerigged vessel as the dawn into her present berth this cutter actually ran athwart our hawse passing inside of us at a distance of some fifty yards we were examined but no attempt was made to speak us i felt no uneasiness at the proximity of these two cruisers for i knew a boat could not liveour ship fairly pitching her martingale into the water at her anchors  the frigate followed the cutter though she passed us outside even nearer than her consort i got my first accurate notion of the weight of the gale by seeing this large ship drive past us under a reefed foresail and a closereefed maintopsail running nearly dead before it as she came down she took a sheer like a vessel scudding in the open ocean and at one moment i feared she would plunge directly into us though she minded her helm in time to clear everything a dozen officers on board her were looking at us from her gangway her quarterdeck guns and rigging all were compelled to hold on with firm grasps and wonder seemed painted in every countenance i could see their features for half a minute only or even a less time but i could discern this expression in each face some looked up at our spars as if to ascertain whether all were right while others looked back at the headland they had just rounded like those who examined the roadstead most shook their heads as remarks passed from one to the other the captain as i took him to be spoke us what are you doing here came to me through a trumpet plainly enough but answering was out of the question before i could even get a trumpet to my mouth the frigate had gone foaming by and was already beyond the reach of the voice heads appeared over her taffrail for some time and we fancied these manofwars men regarded us as the instructed are apt to regard the ignorant whom they fancy to be in danger marble sneered a little at the curiosity betrayed by these two crafts but as for myself it caused great uneasiness i fancied they acted like those who were acquainted with the coast manifesting surprise at seeing a stranger anchored in the berth we occupied  i slept little that night marble kept me company most of the time but neb and diogenes were as tranquil as if sleeping on good french mattressesmade of hair not downwithin the walls of a citadel little disturbed these negroes who followed our fortunes with the implicit reliance that habit and education had bred in them as it might be in and in in this particular they were literally dyed in the wool to use one of the shop expressions so common among us  there was a little relaxation in the force of the gale in the middle of the night but with the return of day came the winds howling down upon us in a way that announced a more than common storm all hands of us were now up and paying every attention to the vessel my greatest concern had been lest some of the sails should get adrift for they had been furled by few and fatigued men this did not happen however our gaskets and lashings doing all of their duty we got our breakfasts therefore in the ordinary way and marble and myself went and stood on the forecastle to watch the signs of the times like faithful guardians who were anxious to get as near as possible to the danger  it was wonderful how the ship pitched frequently her aurora was completely submerged and tons of water would come in upon the forecastle washing entirely aft at the next send so that our only means of keeping above water was to stand on the windlassbitts or to get upon the heart of the mainstay dry we were not nor did we think of attempting to be so but such expedients were necessary to enable us to remain stationary often to enable us to breathe i no longer wondered at the manner in which the cutter and frigate had examined our position it was quite clear the fishermen knew very little about finding a proper berth for a ship and that we might pretty nearly as well have brought up in the middle of st georges channel could our groundtackle reach the bottom as to have brought up where we were  just about nine oclock marble and i had got near each other on the fiferail and held a consultation on the subject of our prospects although we both clung to the same topsailsheet we were obliged to hallow to make ourselves heard the howling of the wind through the rigging converting the hamper into a sort of tremendous eolian harp while the roar of the water kept up a species of bass accompaniment to this music of the ocean marble was the one who had brought about this communication and he was the first to speak  i say miles he called out his mouth within three feet of my earshe jumps about like a whale with a harpoon in it ive been afraid shed jerk the stem out of her  not much fear of that mosesmy great concern is that starboard bowercable it has a good deal more strain on it than the larboard and you can see how the strands are stretched  ay ayt is generalizing its strength as one may say spose we clap the helm aport and try the effects of a sheer  ive thought of that as there is a strong tide going it may possibly answer  these words were scarcely out of my mouth when three seas of enormous height came rolling down upon us like three great roistering companions in a crowd of sullen men the first of which raised the dawns bows so high in the air as to cause us both to watch the result in breathless silence the plunge into the trough was in a just proportion to the toss into the air and i felt a surge as if something gave way under the violent strain that succeeded the torrent of water that came on the forecastle prevented any thing from being seen but again the bows rose again they sunk and then the ship seemed easier  we are all adrift miles marble shouted leaning forward to be heard both bowers have snapped like thread and here we go headforemost in for the land  all this was true enough the cables had parted and the ships head was falling off fast from the gale like the steed that has slipped his bridle before he commences his furious and headlong career i looked round for the negroes but neb was already at the wheel that noble fellow true as steel had perceived the accident as soon as any of us and he sprang to the very part of the vessel where he was most needed he had a seamans faculties in perfection though ratiocination was certainly not his forte a motion of my hand ordered him to put the helm hard up and the answering sign let me know that i was obeyed we could do no more just then but the result was awaited in awful expectation  the dawns bows fell off until the ship lay broadside to the gale which made her reel until her lee lower yardarms nearly dipped then she overcame the cauldron of water that was boiling around her and began to draw heavily ahead three seas swept athwart her decks before she minded her helm in the least carrying with them every thing that was not most firmly lashed or which had not animal life to direct its movements away to leeward they swept off the hencoops and ripped four or five watercasks from their lashings even as if the latter had been packthread the camboosehouse went also at the last of these terrific seas and nothing saved the camboose itself but its great weight added to the strength of its fastenings in a word little was left that could very well go but the launch the gripes of which fortunately held on  by the time this desolation was completed the ship began to fall off and her movement through the water became very perceptible at first she dashed in toward the land running i make no doubt quite half a mile obliquely in that direction ere she got fairly before the wind a course which carried her nearly in a line with the coast marble and myself now got aft without much trouble and put the helm a little to starboard with a view to edge off to the passage as far as possible the wind blew so nearly down channel that there would have been no immediate danger had we an offing but the ship had not driven before the gale more than three or four hours when we made land ahead the coast trending in this part of the island nearly north and south marble suggested the prudence of taking time by the forelock and of getting the maintopsail on the ship to force her off the land the coast in the neighbourhood of dublin lying under our leebow we had taken the precaution to closereef everything before it was furled and i went aloft myself to lower this sail if i had formed a very respectful opinion of the power of the gale while on deck that opinion was materially heightened when i came to feel its gusts on the maintopsailyard it was not an easy matter to hold on at all and to work required great readiness and strength nevertheless i got the sail loose and then i went down and aided marble and the cook to drag home the sheets home they could not be dragged by us notwithstanding we got up a luff but we made the sail stand reasonably well  the ship immediately felt the effect of even this rag of canvass she drove ahead at a prodigious rate running i make no question some eleven or twelve knots under the united power collected by her hamper and this one fragment of a sail her drift was unavoidably great and i thought the current sucked her in towards the land but on the whole she kept at about the same distance from the shore foaming along it much as we had seen the frigate do the day before at the rate we were going twelve or fifteen hours would carry us down to the passage between holy head and ireland when we should get more searoom on account of the lands trending again to the westward  long long hours did marble and i watch the progress of our ship that day and the succeeding night each of us taking our tricks at the wheel and doing seamans duty as well as that of mate and master all this time the vessel was dashing furiously out towards the atlantic which she reached ere the morning of the succeeding day just before he light returned we were whirled past a large ship that was lyingto under a single stormstaysail and which i recognised as the frigate that had taken a look at us at our anchorage the cutter was close at hand and the fearful manner in which these two stronghanded vessels pitched and lurched gave me some idea of what must be our situation should we be compelled to luff to the wind i supposed they had done so in order to keep as long as possible on their cruising ground near the chops of the irish channel  a wild scene lay around us at the return of light the atlantic resembled a chaos of waters the portions of the rolling sheet that were not white with foam looking green and angry the clouds hid the sun and the gale seemed to be fast coming to its height at ten we drove past an american with nothing standing but his foremast like us he was running off though we went three feet to his two half an hour later we had the awful sight before our eyes of witnessing the sudden disappearance of an english brig she was lyingto directly on our course and i was looking at her from the windlass trying to form some opinion as to the expediency of our luffingto in order to hold our own of a sudden this brig gave a plunge and she went down like a porpoise diving what caused this disaster i never knew but in five minutes we passed as near as possible over the spot and not a trace of her was to be seen i could not discover so much as a handspike floating though i looked with intense anxiety in the hope of picking up some fellowcreature clinging to a spar as for stopping to examine one who did not understand the language might as well hope to read the german character on a milestone while flying past it in a railroad car  at noon precisely away went our foretopsail out of the gaskets one fastening snapped after another until the whole sail was adrift the tugs that this large sheet of canvass gave upon the spars as it shook in the wind threatened to jerk the foremast out of the ship they lasted about three minutes when after a report almost as loud as that of a small piece of ordnance the sail split in ribands ten minutes later our maintopsail went this sail left us as it might be bodily and i actually thought that a gun of distress was fired near us by some vessel that was unseen the boltrope was left set the sheets earings and reef points all holding on the cloth tearing at a single rent around the four sides of the sail the scene that followed i scarcely know how to describe the torn part of the maintopsail flew forward and caught in the afterpart of the foretop where it stood spread as one might say held by the top catharpins rigging and other obstacles this was the feather to break the camels back bolt after bolt of the forerigging drew or broke each parting with a loud report and away went everything belonging to the foremast over the bows from the deck up the maintopmast was dragged down by this fearful pull and that brought the mizentopgallantmast after it the pitching of so much hamper under the bows of the ship while her aftermasts stood threw the stern round in spite of the manner in which marble steered and the ship broachedto in doing this the sea made a fair breach over her sweeping the deck of even the launch and camboose and carrying all the leebulwarks in the waist with them neb was in the launch at the time hunting for some article kept there and the last i saw of the poor fellow he was standing erect in the bows of the boat as the latter drove over the vessels side on the summit of a wave like a bubble floating in a furious current diogenes it seems had that moment gone to his camboose to look after the plain dinner he was trying to boil when probably seizing the iron as the most solid object near him he was carried overboard with it and never reappeared marble was in a tolerably safe part of the vessel at the wheel and he kept his feet though the water rose above his waist as high indeed as his arms as for myself i was saved only by the mainrigging into which i was driven and where i lodged  i could not but admire the coolness and conduct of marble even at that terrific moment in the first place he put the helm hard down and lashed the wheel the wisest thing that could be done by men in our situation this he did by means of that nautical instinct which enables a seaman to act in the direst emergencies almost without reflection or as one closes his eyes to avoid danger to the pupils then he gave one glance at the state of things inboard running forward with the end of a rope to throw to diogenes should the cook rise near the ship by the time he was satisfied the hope of doing anything in that way was vain i was on deck and we two stood facing each other in the midst of the scene of desolation and ruin that was around us marble caught my hand with a look that spoke as plainly as words it told me the joy he felt at seeing i was spared his determination to stick by me to the last yet how low were his hopes of ultimate preservation it was such a look as any man would be glad to receive from a comrade in the heat of battle nevertheless it was not a look that promised victory  the situation of the ship would now have been much better than it had been in many respects were it not for the wreck all the masts forward had gone over the lee bow and would have lain in a sufficiently favourable situation for a strong crew to get rid of them but in our case we were compelled to let things take their course it is true we could cut away and this we began to do pretty freely but the lowerend of the foremast lay on the forecastle where it was grinding everything near it to pieces with the heaving and setting of the waves all the bulwarks in that part of the ship threatened soon to be beaten down and i felt afraid the cathead would be torn violently out of the ship leaving a bad leak leaks enough there were as it was the launch camboose watercasks and spare spars in driving overboard having forced out timberheads and other supports in a way to split the plank sheer which let in the water fast every time the lee gunwale went under i gave up my sugars and coffees from the first bringing my hopes down as low as the saving of the ship the instant i saw the state of the upper works  marble and i had not been educated in a school that is apt to despair as for my mate had he found himself on a plank in the middle of the atlantic i do believe he would have set about rigging a jurymast by splitting off a piece of the hull of his craft and spreading his shirt by way of sail i never knew a more inandinbred seaman who when one resource failed invariably set about the next best visible expedient we were at a loss however whether to make an effort to get rid of the foremast or not with the exception of the damages it did on the forecastle it was of use to us keeping the ships bow up to the wind and making better weather for us on deck the aftermasts standing while those forward were gone had the effect to press the stern of the vessel to leeward while this support in the water prevented her bows from falling off and we rode much nearer to the wind than is usual with a ship that is lyingto it is true the outer end of the fallen spars began to drive to leeward and acting as a long lever they were gradually working the broken end of the foremast athwart the forecastle ripping and tearing away everything on the gunwale and threatening the foot of the mainstay this made it desirable to be rid of the wreck while on the other hand there was the danger of the ships bottom beating against the end of the mast did the latter get overboard under all these circumstances however we determined to cut as much of the gear as possible and let the fallen spars work themselves clear of us if they could our job was by no means easy it was difficult to stand even on the deck of the dawn in a time like that and this difficulty was greatly increased forward by having so little to hold on by but work we did and in a way that cleared most of the rigging from the ship in the course of the next half hour we were encouraged by the appearances of the weather too the gale having broken and promising to abate the ship grew a little easier i thought and we moved about with more confidence of not being washed away by the seas that came on board us after a time we took some refreshments eating the remains of a former meal and cheered our hearts a little with a glass or two of good sherry temperance may be very useful but so is a glass of good wine when properly used then we went at it again working with a will and with spirit the wreck aft wanted very little to carry it over the side and going aloft with an axe i watched my opportunity cut one or two of the shrouds and stays just as the ship lurched heavily to leeward and got rid of the whole in the sea handsomely without further injury to the ship this was a good deliverance the manner in which the spars had threshed about having menaced our lives before we now attacked the wreck forward for the last time feeling certain we should get it adrift could we sever the connection formed by one or two of the larger ropes the leeshrouds in particular gave us trouble it being impossible to get at them inboard the fore channels being half the time under water and the bulwarks in their wake being all gone it was in fact impossible to stand there to work long enough to clear or cut all the lanyards marble was an adventurous fellow aloft on all occasions and seeing good footing about the top without saying a word to me he seized an axe and literally ran out on the mast where he began to cut the collars of the rigging at the masthead this was soon done but the spars were no sooner clear than impelled by a wave that nearly drowned the mate the end of the foremast slid off the forecastle into the sea leaving the ship virtually clear of the wreck but my mate adrift on the last i say virtually clear for the lee foretopsailbrace still remained fast to the ship by some oversight in clearing away the smaller ropes the effect of this restraint was to cause the whole body of the wreck to swing slowly round until it rode by this rope alone  here was a new and a most serious state of things i knew that my mate would do all that man could perform situated as he was but what man could swim against such a sea even the short distance that interposed between the spars and the ship the point of the wreck nearest the vessel was the end of the topsailyard to which the brace led and this was raised from the water by the strain the other end of the brace leading aloft fathoms at a time rendering it extremely difficult for marble to reach the rope by means of which i could now see notwithstanding all the difficulties he hoped to regain the vessel the voice could be heard by one directly to leeward the howling of the winds and the roar of the waters having materially lessened within the last few hours i shouted to marble therefore my intentions  stand by to get the brace as i ease it off inboard i cried then you will be safe  the mate understood me giving a gesture of assent with his arm when both were ready i eased off the rope suddenly and marble partly by crawling and partly by floating and dragging himself by the hands actually got to the yardarm which was immediately raised from the water however by the drift made by the spars while he was achieving his object i trembled as i saw this stout seaman the water dripping from his clothes thus elevated in the air with the angry billows rolling beneath him like lions leaping upward to catch the adventurer in their grasp marbles hand was actually extended to reach the brace when its block gave way with the strain the eye of the strap slipping from the yard down went the spar into the water next the trough of the sea hid everything from my sight and i was left in the most painful doubt of the result when i perceived the mate lashing himself to the top as the portion of the wreck that floated the most buoyantly he had managed to get in again and coolly went to work to secure himself in the best berth he could find the instant he regained the main mass of the wreck as he rose on the crest of a sea the poor fellow made a gesture of adieu to me the leavetaking of the mariner  in this manner did it please divine providence to separate us four who had already gone through so much in company with what moody melancholy did i watch the wreck as it slowly drifted from the ship i no longer thought of making further efforts to save the dawn and i can truly say that scarce a thought in connection with my own life crossed my mind there i stood for quite an hour leaning against the foot of the mizenmast with folded arms and riveted eyes regardless of the pitches and lurches and rolling of the ship with all my faculties and thoughts fastened on the form of marble expecting each time that the top rose to view to find it empty he was too securely lashed however to strike adrift though he was nearly half the time under water it was impossible to do anything to save him no boat was left had there been one it could not have lived nor could i have managed it alone spars he had already but what must become of him without food or water i threw two breakers of the last into the sea and a box of bread in a sort of idle hope they might drift down near the wreck and help to prolong the sufferers life they were all tossed about in the cauldron of the ocean and disappeared to leeward i knew not whither when marble was no longer visible from deck i went into the maintop and watched the mass of spars and rigging so long as any portion of it could be seen then i set it by compass in order to know its bearing and an hour before the sun went down or as soon as the diminished power of the wind would permit i showed an ensign aloft as a signal that i bore my mate in mind  he knows i will not desert him as long as there is hopeso long as i have life i muttered to myself and this thought was a relief to my mind in that bitter moment  bitter moment truly time has scarcely lessened the keenness of the sensations i endured as memory traces the feelings and incidents of that day from the hour when i sailed from home lucys image was seldom absent from my imagination ten minutes at a time i thought of her sleeping and waking in all my troubles the interest of the seafight i had seen could not prevent this recurrence of my ideas to their polar star their powerful magnet but i do not remember to have thought of lucy even once after marble was thus carried away from my side neb too with his patient servitude his virtues his faults his dauntless courage his unbounded devotion to myself had taken a strong hold on my heart and his loss had greatly troubled me since the time it occurred but i remember to have thought much of lucy even after neb was swept away though her image became temporarily lost to my mind during the first few hours i was thus separated from marble  by the time the sun set the wind had so far abated and the sea had gone down so much as to remove all further apprehensions from the gale the ship layto easily and i had no occasion to give myself any trouble on her account had there been light i should now have put the helm up and run to leeward in the hope of finding the spars and at least of keeping near marble but fearful of passing him in the darkness i deferred that duty until the morning all i could do was to watch the weather in order to make this effort before the wind should shift  what a night i passed as soon as it was dark i sounded the pumps and found six feet water in the hold it was idle for one man to attempt clearing a vessel of the dawns size and i gave myself no further thought in the matter so much injury had been done the upper works of the ship that i had a sort of conviction she must go down unless fallen in with by some other craft i cannot say apprehension for my own fate troubled me any or that i thought of the rum to my fortunes that was involved in the loss of the ship my mind reverted constantly to my companions could i have recovered them i should have been happy for a time at least  i slept two or three hours towards morning overcome will fatigue when i awoke it was in consequence of receiving the suns rays in my face springing to my feet i cast a confused and hurried glance around me the wind was still at northeast but it barely blew a good wholesail breeze the sea had gone down to the regular roll of the ocean and a finer day never shone upon the atlantic i hurried eagerly on deck and gazed on the ocean to leeward with longing eyes to ascertain if anything could be seen of the wreck of our spars nothing was visible from the maintop i could command a pretty wide horizon but the ocean lay a bright glittering blank the crests of its own waves excepted i felt certain the dawn was so weatherly that the spars were to leeward but the ship must have forged miles ahead during the last twelve hours and there was almost the equal certainty of her being a long distance to the southward of the floating hamper her head having lain in that direction since the time she broachedto to get her off before the wind then was my first concern after which i could endeavour to force her to the northward running the chance of falling in with the spars could i find my mate we might still die together which would hove been a melancholy consolation just then    chapter xxii      father of all in every age   in every clime adored   by saint by savage or by sage   jehovah jove or lord    pope   feeling the necessity of possessing all my strength i ate a breakfast before i commenced work it was with a heavy heart and but little appetite that i took this solitary meal but i felt that its effects were good when finished i knelt on the deck and prayed to god fervently asking his divine assistance in my extremity why should an old man whose race is nearly run hesitate to own that in the pride of his youth and strength he was made to feel how insufficient we all are for our wants yes i prayed and i hope in a fitting spirit for i felt that this spiritual sustenance did me even more good than the material of which i had just before partaken when i rose from my knees it was with a sense of hope that i endeavoured to suppress a little as both unreasonable and dangerous perhaps the spirit of my sainted sister was permitted to look down on me in that awful strait and to offer up its own pure petitions in behalf of a brother she had so warmly loved i began to feel myself less alone and the work advanced the better from this mysterious sort of consciousness of the presence of the souls of those who had felt an interest in me while in the body  my first measure was to lead the jibstay which had parted near the head of its own mast to the head of the mainmast this i did by bending on a piece of another rope i then got up the halyards and loosened and set the jib a job that consumed quite two hours of course this sail did not set very well but it was the only mode i had of getting forward canvass on the ship at all as soon as the jib was set in this imperfect manner i put the helm up and got the ship before the wind i then hauled out the spanker and gave it sheet by these means aided by the action of the breeze on the hull and spars i succeeded in getting something like three knots way on the ship keeping off a little northerly in which direction i felt sensible it was necessary to proceed in quest of the spars i estimated the drift of the wreck at a knot an hour including the good and moderate weather and allowing for that of the ship itself i supposed it must be by that time some twelve miles to leeward of me these twelve miles i managed to run by noon when i hauled up sufficiently to bring the wind abeam heading northwardly as the ship would now steer herself that is as small as it was necessary for me to go i collected some food took a glass and went up into the maintop to dine and to examine the ocean  the anxious anxious hours i passed in that top not an object of any sort appeared on the surface of the wide ocean it seemed as if the birds and the fishes had abandoned me to my loneliness i watched and examined the surrounding sea until my hands were tired with holding the glass and my eyes became weary with their office fortunately the breeze stood though the sea went down fast giving me every opportunity i could desire of effecting my object the ship yawed about a good deal it is true but on the whole she made a very tolerable course i could see by the water that she had a motion of about two knots for most of the time though as the day advanced the wind began to fall and her rate of going diminished quite one half  at length after passing hours aloft i went below to look after things there on sounding the pumps i found ten feet water in the hold though the upper works were now not at all submerged and the motion of the vessel was very easy that the dawn was gradually sinking under me was a fact too evident to be denied and all the concerns of thir life began to narrow into a circle of some fourandtwenty hours that time the ship would probably floatpossibly a little longer should the weather continue moderate the wind was decreasing still and thinking i might have a tranquil night i determined to pass that time in preparing for the last great change i had no will to makelittle to leave indeed after my vessel was gone for the debt due to john wallingford would go far towards absorbing all my property when his 40000 were paid under a forced sale little indeed would be the residue  the state of things would have been somewhat different under a fair sale perhaps but a forced sale would probably sweep away everything it is true my creditor was my heir for a legacy to lucy and a few bequests to my slaves excepted i had fairly bequeathed all i owned to my cousin as for the blacks themselves under the new policy of new york they would soon be free and i had no other interest in their fate than that of habit and affection  but why speak of property in the situation in which i was placed had i owned the whole of ulster county my wishes or any new will i might make must die with me the ocean would soon engulf the whole had i no desire to make an effort to save myself or at least to prolong my existence by means of a raftof boat there was none in the ship the english had the yawl and the launch had been driven away the spare spars were swept overboard as well as all the watercasks that had been lashed on deck i might have done something with the hatches and mizentopmast possibly could i have gotten the last into the water but the expedient was so desperate it did not hold out any hopes to be encouraged even the handspikes had gone in the launch and two of the buoys had been left with the anchors on the irish coast under all the circumstances it appeared to me that it would be more manly and resigned to meet my fate at once than to attempt any such feeble projects to prolong existence for a few hours i came to the resolution therefore to go down in my ship  what was there to make life particularly dear to memy home my muchbeloved clawbonny must go at all events and i will own that a feeling of bitter distrust crossed my mind as i thought of these things and that i began to fancy john wallingford might have urged me to borrow his money expressly to obtain a chance of seizing an estate that was so much prized by every wallingford i suppressed this feeling however and in a clear voice i asked my cousins pardon the same as if he had been within hearing of lucy i had no longer any hopegrace was already in heaven and the world contained few that cared for me after mr hardinge lucy always excepted i now loved marble and neb the most and these two were probably both dead or doomed like myself we must all yield up our lives once and though my hour came rather early it should be met as a man meets everything even to death itself  some time before the sun set i went aloft to take a last look at the ocean i do not think any desire to prolong my existence carried me up the mast but there was a lingering wish to look after my mate the ocean beamed gloriously that eventide and i fancied that it was faintly reflecting the gracious countenance of its divine creator in a smile of beneficent love i felt my heart soften as i gazed around me and i fancied heavenly music was singing the praises of god on the face of the great deep then i knelt in the top and prayed  rising i looked at the ocean as i supposed for the last time not a sail was anywhere to be seen i cannot say that i felt disappointedi did not expect relief from that quarter my object was to find my mate that we might die together slowly i raised the glass and the horizon was swept with deliberation nothing appeared i had shut the glass and was about to sling it when my eye caught the appearance of something floating on the surface of the ocean within a mile of the ship well to leeward and ahead i had overlooked it in consequence of ranging above it with the glass in the desire to sweep the horizon i could not be mistaken it was the wreck in a moment the glass was levelled and i assured myself of the fact the top was plainly visible floating quite high above the surface and portions of the yards and masts were occasionally seen as the undulations of the ocean left them bare i saw an object lying motionless across the toprim which i supposed to be marble he was either dead or asleep  what a revulsion of feeling came over me at this sight a minute before and i was completely isolated cut off from the rest of my species and resigned to a fate that seemed to command my quitting this state of being without further communion with mankind everything was changed here was the companion of so many former dangers the man who had taught me my profession one that i can truly say i loved quite near me and possibly dying for the want of that aid which i might render i was on deck in the twinkling of an eye the sheets were eased off and the helm put up obedient to my wishes the ship fell off and i soon got a glimpse from the spot where i stood at the wheel of the wreck a little clear of the weather cathead by this time the wind was so light and the ship had got to be so deep in the water that the motion of the last was very slow even with the helm up it scarce equalled half a knot i began to fear i should not be able to reach my goal after all  there were now intervals of dead calm then the air would return in little puffs urging the great mass heavily onward i whistled i prayed i called aloud for wind in short i adopted all the expedients known from that of the most vulgar nautical superstition up to profound petitions to the father of mercies i presume all this brought no change though the passage of time did about half an hour before the sun dipped into the ocean the ship was within a hundred yards of the wreck this i could ascertain by stolen glances for the direction i was now compelled to steer placed the forward part of the ship between me and my object and i did not dare quit the wheel to go forward lest i should miss it altogether i had prepared a grapnel by placing a small kedge in the leewaist with a hawser bent and could i come within a few feet of the floating hamper i felt confident of being able to hook into something it appeared to me now as if the ship absolutely refused to move go ahead she did notwithstanding though it was only her own length in five or six minutes my hasty glances told me that two more of these lengths would effect my purpose i scarce breathed lest the vessel should not be steered with sufficient accuracy it was strange to me that marble did not hail and fancying him asleep i shouted with all my energy in order to arouse him what a joyful sound that will be in his ears i thought to myself though to me my own voice seemed unearthly and alarming no answer came then i felt a slight shock as if the cutwater had hit something and a low scraping sound against the copper announced that the ship had hit the wreck quitting the wheel i sprang into the waist raising the kedge in my arms then came the upper spars wheeling strongly round under the pressure of the vessels bottom against the extremity of the lower mast i saw nothing but the great maze of hamper and wreck and could scarcely breathe in the anxiety not to miss my aim there was much reason to fear the whole mass would float off leaving me no chance of throwing the kedge for the smaller masts no longer inclined in and i could see that the ship and wreck were slowly separating a low thump on the bottom directly beneath me drew my head over the side and i found the foreyard as it might be a cockbill with one end actually scraping along the ships bottom it was the only chance i had or was likely to have and i threw the kedge athwart it luckily the hawser as it tautened brought a fluke directly under the yard within the flemish horse the braceblock and all the other ropes that are fitted to a lower yardarm so slow was the motion of the ship that my grapnel held and the entire body of the wreck began to yield to the pressure i now jumped to the jibhalyards and downhaul getting that sail reduced then i halfbrailed the spanker this was done lest my hold on the yard should give way  i can say that up to this instant i had not even looked for marble so intense had been my apprehensions of missing the wreck that i thought of nothing else could see nothing else satisfied however that my fast would hold i ran forward to look down on the top that the strain of the hawser had brought directly under the very bow over which it had fallen it was empty the object i had mistaken for marble dead or asleep was a part of the bunt of the maintopsail that had been hauled down over the toprim and secured there either to form a sort of shelter against the breaking seas or a bed whatever may have been the intention of this nest it no longer had an occupant marble had probably been washed away in one of his adventurous efforts to make himself more secure or more comfortable  the disappointment that came over me as i ascertained this fact was scarcely less painful than the anguish i had felt when i first saw my mate carried off into the ocean there would have been a melancholy satisfaction in finding his body that we might have gone to the bottom together at least and thus have slept in a common grave in the depths of that ocean over which we had sailed so many thousands of leagues in company i went and threw myself on the deck regardless of my own fate and wept in very bitterness of heart i had arranged a mattress on the quarterdeck and it was on that i now threw myself fatigue overcame me in the end and i fell into a deep sleep as my recollection left me my last thought was that i should go down with the ship as i lay there so complete was the triumph of nature that i did not even dream i do not remember ever to have enjoyed more profound and refreshing slumbers slumbers that continued until returning light awoke me to that nights rest i am probably indebted under god for having the means of relating these adventures  it is scarcely necessary to say that the night had been tranquil otherwise a seamans ears would have given him the alarm when i arose i found the ocean glittering like a mirror with no other motion than that which has so often been likened to the slumbering respiration of some huge animal the wreck was thumping against the ships bottom announcing its presence before i left the mattress of wind there was literally not a breath once in a while the ship would seem to come up to breathe as a heavy groundswell rolled along her sides and the wash of the element told the circumstance of such a visit else all was as still as the ocean in its infancy i knelt again and prayed to that dread being with whom it now appeared to me i stood alone in the centre of the universe  down to the moment when i arose from my knees the thought of making an effort to save myself or to try to prolong existence a few hours by means of the wreck did not occur to me but when i came to look about me to note the tranquil condition of the ocean and to heed the chances small as they were that offered the love of life was renewed within me and i seriously set about the measures necessary to such an end  the first step was to sound the pumps anew the water had not gained in the night as rapidly as it had gained throughout the preceding day but it had gained there being three feet more of it than when i last soundedthe infallible evidence of the existence of a leak that no means of mine could stop it was then hopeless to think of saving the ship she had settled in the water already so as to bring the lower bolts of both fore and main channels awash and i supposed she might float for fourandtwenty hours longer unless an injury that i had discovered under the larboard cathead and which had been received from the wreck should sooner get under water it appeared to me that a butt had been started there such a leak would certainly hasten the fate of the vessel by some hours should it come fairly into the account  having made this calculation as to the time i had to do it in i set seriously about the job of making provisions with my raft in one or two particulars i could not much improve the latter for the yards lying underneath the masts it rendered the last as buoyant as was desirable in moderate weather it struck me however that by getting the topgallant and royal masts with their yards in around the top i might rig a staging with the aid of the hatches that would not only keep me entirely out of water in mild weather but which would contain all one man could consume in the way of victuals and drink for a month to come to this object then i next gave my attention  i had no great difficulty in getting the spars i have mentioned loose and in hauling them alongside of the top it was a job that required time rather than strength for my movements were greatly facilitated by the presence of the topmast rigging which remained in its place almost as taut as when upright the other rigging i cut and having got out the fids of the two masts one at a time i pushed the spars through their respective caps with a foot of course i was obliged to get into the water to work but i had thrown aside most of my clothes for the occasion and the weather being warm i felt greatly refreshed with my bath in two hours time i had my topgallantmast and yard well secured to the toprim and the caps having sawed them in pieces for the purpose the fastenings were both spikes and lashings the carpenters stores furnishing plenty of the former as well as all sorts of tools  this part of the arrangement completed i ate a hearty breakfast when i began to secure the hatches as a sort of floor on my primitive joists this was not difficult the hatches being long and the rings enabling me to lash them as well as to spike them long before the sun had reached the meridian i had a stout little platform that was quite eighteen inches above the water and which was surrounded by a species of low ridgeropes so placed as to keep articles from readily tumbling off it the next measure was to cut all the sails from the yards and to cut loose all the rigging and iron that did not serve to keep the wreck together the reader can easily imagine how much more buoyancy i obtained by these expedients the foresail alone weighed much more than i did myself with all the stores i might have occasion to put on my platform as for the foretopsail there was little of it left the canvass having mostly blown from the yard before the mast went  my raft was completed by the time i felt the want of dinner and a very good raft it was the platform was about ten feet square and it now floated quite two feet clear of the water this was not much for a sea but after the late violent gale i had some reason to expect a continuation of comparatively good weather i should not have been a true seaman not to have bethought me of a mast and a sail i saved the foreroyalmast and the yard with its canvass for such a purpose determining to rig them when i had nothing else to do i then ate my dinner which consisted of the remnants of the old cold meat and fowls i could find among the cabin eatables  this meal taken the duty that came next was to provision my raft it took but little time or labour the cabin stores were quite accessible and a bag of pilotbread another of that peculiarly american invention called crackerssome smoked beef a case of liquors and two breakers of water formed my principal stock to this i added a pot of butter with some capital smoked herrings and some anchovies we lived well in the cabin of the dawn and there was no difficulty in making all the provision that six or eight men would have needed for a month perceiving that the raft now it was relieved from the weight of the sails and rigging was not much affected by the stores i began to look about me in quest of anything valuable i might wish to save the preparations i had been making created a sort of confidence in their success a confidence hope might be the better word that was as natural perhaps as it was unreasonable i examined the different objects that offered with a critical comparison of their value and future usefulness that would have been absurd had it not afforded a melancholy proof of the tenacity of our desires in matters of this nature it is certainly a sad thing to abandon a ship at sea with all her appliances and with a knowledge of the gold that she cost the dawn with her cargo must have stood me in eighty thousand dollars or even more and here was i about to quit her out on the ocean with an almost moral certainty that not a cent of the money could be or would be recovered from the insurers these last only took risks against the accidents of the ocean fire included and there was a legal obligation on the insured to see that the vessel was properly found and manned it was my own opinion that no accident would have occurred to the ship in the late gale had the full crew been on board and that the ship was not sufficiently manned was in a legal sense my own fault i was bound to let the english carry her into port and to await judgmentthe law supposing that justice would have been done in the premises the law might have been greatly mistaken in this respect but potentates never acknowledge their blunders if i was wronged in the detention the law presumed suitable damages it is true i might be ruined by the delay through the debts left behind me but the law with all its purity cared nothing for that could i have shown a loss by means of a falling market i might have obtained redress provided the court chose to award it and provided the party did not appeal or if he did that the subsequent decisions supported the first and providedall the decrees being in my favourmy lord harry dermond could have paid a few thousands in damagesa problem to be solved in itself  i always carried to sea with me a handsome chest that i had bought in one of my earlier voyages and which usually contained my money clothes and other valuables this chest i managed to get on deck by the aid of a purchase and over the ships side on the raft it was much the most troublesome task i had undertaken to this i added my writingdesk a mattress two or three counterpanes and a few other light articles which it struck me might be of usebut which i could cast into the sea at any moment should it become necessary when all this was done i conceived that my useful preparations were closed  it was near night and i felt sufficiently fatigued to lie down and sleep the water had gained very slowly during the last few hours but the ship was now swimming so low that i thought it unsafe to remain in the vessel while asleep i determined therefore to take my leave of her and go on the raft for that purpose it struck me too it might be unsafe to be too near the vessel when she went down and i had barely time to get the spars a short distance from the ship before darkness would come still i was unwilling to abandon the dawn altogether since the spars that stood on board her would always be a more available signal to any passing vessel than the low sail i could set on the raft should she float during the succeeding day they would increase the chances of a rescue and they offered an advantage not to be lightly thrown away  to force the spars away from the ship was not an easy task of itself there is an attraction in matter that is known to bring vessels nearer together in calms and i had this principle of nature first to overcome then to neutralize it without the adequate means for doing either still i was very strong and possessed all the resources of a seaman the raft too now its length was reduced was much more manageable than it had been originally and in rummaging about the twixtdecks i had found a set of oars belonging to the launch which had been stowed in the steerage and which of course were preserved these i had taken to the raft to strengthen my staging or deck and two of them had been reserved for the very purpose to which they were now applied  cutting away the kedge then and casting off the other ropes i had used with which to breastto the raft i began to shove off just as the sun was dipping so long as i could pull by the ship i did very well for i adopted the expedient of hauling astern instead of pushing broad off under the notion that i might get a better drift if quite from under the lee of the vessel than if lying on her broadside i say the lee though there wasnt a breath of air nor scarcely any motion of the water i had a line fast to a sterndavit and placing myself with my feet braced against the chest i soon overcame the vis inertia of the spars and exerting all my force when it was once in motion i succeeded in giving the raft an impetus that carried it completely past the ship i confess i felt no personal apprehension from the suction supposing the ship to sink while the raft was in absolute contact with it but the agitation of the water might weaken its parts or it might wash most of my stores away this last consideration induced me now to go to work with the oars and try to do all i could by that mode of propelling my dull craft i worked hard just one hour by my watch at the expiration of that time the nearest end of the raft or the lower part of the foremast was about a hundred yards from the dawns taffrail this was a slow movement and did not fail to satisfy me that if i were to be saved at all it would be by means of some passing vessel and not by my own progress  overcome by fatigue i now lay down and slept i took no precautions against the winds rising in the night firstly because i thought it impossible from the tranquil aspects of the heavens and the ocean and secondly because i felt no doubt that the wash of the water and the sound of the winds would arouse me should it occur differently as on the previous night i slept sweetly and obtained renewed strength for any future trials as on the preceding morning too i was awaked by the warm rays of the rising sun falling on my face on first awaking i did not know exactly where i was a moments reflection however sufficed to recall the past to my mind and i turned to examine my actual situation  i looked for the ship towards the end of the mast or in the direction where i had last seen her but she was not visible the raft had swung round in the night i thought and i bent my eyes slowly round the entire circle of the horizon but no ship was to be seen the dawn had sunk in the night and so quietly as to give no alarm i shuddered for i could not but imagine what would have been my fate had i been aroused from the sleep of the living only to experience the last agony as i passed away into the sleep of the dead i cannot describe the sensation that came over me as i gazed around and found myself on the broad ocean floating on a little deck that was only ten feet square and which was raised less than two feet above the surface of the waters it was now that i felt the true frailty of my position and comprehended all its dangers before it had been shaded by the ship as it might be and i had found a species of protection in her presence but the whole truth now stood before me even a moderate breeze would raise a sea that could not fail to break over the staging and which must sweep everything away the spars had a specific lightness it is true and they would never sink or if they did sink it would only be at the end of ages when saturated with water and covered with barnacles but on the other hand they possessed none of the buoyancy of a vessel and could riot rise above the rolling waters sufficiently to clear their breakers  these were not comfortable reflections they pressed on my mind even while engaged at my morning devotions after performing in the best manner i could this neverceasing duty i ate a little though i must admit it was with a small appetite then i made the best stowage i could of my effects and rigged and stepped the mast hoisting the sail as a signal to any vessel that might appear i expected wind ere long nor was i disappointed a moderate breeze springing up from the northwest about nine oclock this air was an immense relief to me in more ways than one it cooled my person which was suffering from the intense heat of a summers sun beating directly on a boundless expanse of water and it varied a scene that otherwise possessed an oppressively wearisome sameness unfortunately this breeze met me in the bows for i had stepped my mast in the foremast lashed it against the bottom of the top which it will be remembered was now perpendicular and stayed it to the mastheads and deadeyes of the topmast rigging all of which remained as when erect though now floating on the water i intended the fractured part of the foremast for my cutwater and of course had to ware ship before i could gather any way this single manoeuvre occupied a quarter of an hour my braces tacks and sheets not working particularly well at the end of that time however i got round and laid my yard square    chapter xxiii     there was speech in their dumbness language in their very gesture   they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed or one destroyed a   notable passion of wonder appeared in them but the wisest beholder   that knew no more but seeing could not say if the importance were joy   or sorrowbut in the extremity of the one it must needs be    winters tale   as soon as the raft got fairly before the wind and the breeze had freshened i had an opportunity of ascertaining what it would do the royal was a large one and it stood well i had brought a logline and the slowglass with me as well as my quadrant slate c and began to think of keeping a reckoning i had supposed the ship to be when it fell calm about two hundred miles from the land and i knew her to be in latitude 48° 37 the logline told me the raft moved through the water all that forenoon at the rate of about half a knot in the hour and could i keep on for fifteen or sixteen days in a straight course i might yet hope to get ashore i was not so weak however as to expect any such miracle to be wrought in my favour though had i been in the trades the thing might have occurred by cutting adrift the two yards or by getting them fore and aft in a line with the water my rate of sailing might be doubled and i began seriously to think of effecting this great change cut the yards adrift i did not like to do their support in keeping me out of water being very important by hauling on the lift i did get them in a more oblique position and in a measure thus lessened their resistance to the element i thought that even this improvement made a difference of half a knot in my movement nevertheless it was tedious work to be a whole hour in going less than a single mile when two hundred remained to be travelled and the risks of the ocean were thus constantly impending over one  what a day was that it blew pretty fresh at one time and i began to tremble for my staging or deck which got washed several times though the topsailyard made for it a sort of lee and helped to protect it towards the decline of the day the wind went down and at sunset everything was as tranquil as it had been the previous evening i thought i might have been eight or nine miles from the spot where the dawn went down without computing the influence of the currents which may have set me all that distance back again or so much further ahead for anything i knew of the matter at sunset i took an anxious survey of the horizon to see if any sail were in sight but nothing was visible  another tranquil night gave me another tranquil nights rest i call the last tranquil as it proved to be in one sense though i was sorely troubled with dreams had i been suffering for nourishment i certainly should have dreamed of food but such not being the case my thoughts took the direction of home and friends much of the time i lay half asleep and half awake then my mind would revert to my sister to lucy to mr hardinge and to clawbonnywhich i fancied already in the possession of john wallingford who was triumphing in his ownership and the success of his arts then i thought lucy had purchased the place and was living there with andrew drewett in a handsome new house built in the modern taste by modern taste i do not mean one of the greciantemple school as i do no think that even all the vagaries of a diseased imagination that was suffering under the calamities of shipwreck could induce me to imagine lucy hardinge silly enough to desire to live in such a structure  towards morning i fell into a doze the fourth or fifth renewal of my slumbers that night and i remember that i had that sort of curious sensation which apprises us itself it was a dream in the course of the events that passed through my mind i fancied i overheard marble and neb conversing their voices were low and solemn as i thought and the words so distinct that i still remember every syllable  no neb said marble or seemed to say in a most sorrowful tone one i had never heard him use even in speaking of his hermitage there is little hope for miles now i felt as if the poor boy was lost when i saw him swept away from me by them bloody spars striking adrift and set him down as one gone from that moment youve lost an a no 1 master mister neb i can tell you and you may sarve a hundred before you fall in with his like agin  i nebber sarve anoder gentleum misser marble returned the black dat as sartain as gospel i born in e wallingford family and i lib an die in e same family or i dont want to lib and die at all my real name be wallingford dough folk do call me clawbonny  ay and a slim family its got to be rejoined the mate the nicest and the handsomest and the most virtuous young woman in all york state is gone out of it first i knew but little of her but how often did poor miles tell me all about her and how he loved her and how she loved him and the like of all that as is becoming and something in the way that i love little kitty my niece you know neb only a thousand times more and hearing so much of a person is all the same or even better than to know them up and down if a body wants to feel respect with all his heart secondly as a person would say now theres miles lost too for the ship is sartainly gone down neb otherwise she would have been seen floating hereabouts and we may log him as a man lost overboard  prhaps not misser marble said the negro masser mile swim like a fish and he isnt the gentleum to give up as soon as trouble come prhaps he swimming about all dis time  miles could do all that man could do neb but he cant swim two hundred milesa south seaman might do something like that i do suppose but theyre onaccountably webfooted no no neb i fear we shall have to give him up providence swept him away from us like and weve lost him ahs mewell i loved that boy better even than a yankee loves cucumbers  this may be thought an odd comparison to cross a drowsy imagination but it was one marble often made and if eating the fruit morning noon and night will vindicate its justice the mate stood exonerated from everything like exaggeration  ebbry body lub masser mile said the warmhearted neb or i thought he so said i nebber see dat we can go home to good old masser hardinge and tell him how we lose masser mile  it will be a hard job neb but i greatly fear it must be done however we will now turn in and try to catch a nap for the wind will be rising one of these times and then we shall have need of keeping our eyes wide open  after this i heard no more but every word of that which i have related sounded as plainly in my ears as if the speakers were within fifty feet of me i lay in the same state some time longer endeavouring as i was curious myself of catching or fancying more words from those i loved so well but no more came then i believe i fell into a deeper sleep for i remember no more for hours  at dawn i awoke the care on my mind answering for a call this time i did not wait for the sun to shine in my eyes but of the two i rather preceded than awaited the return of the light on standing erect i found the sea as tranquil as it had been the previous night and there was an entire calm it was still so dusky that a little examination was necessary to be certain nothing was near the horizon was scarcely clear though making my first look towards the east objects were plainest in that quarter of the ocean i then turned slowly round examining the vast expanse of water as i did so until my back was towards the approaching light and i faced the west i thought i saw a boat within ten yards of me at first i took it for illusion and rubbed my eyes to make sure that i was awake there it was however and another look satisfied me it was my own launch or that in which poor neb had been carried overboard what was more it was floating in the proper manner appeared buoyant and had two masts rigged it is true that it looked dusky as objects appear just at dawn but it was sufficiently distinct i could not be mistaken it was my own launch thus thrown within my reach by the mercy of divine providence  this boat then had survived the gale and the winds and currents had brought it and the raft together what had become of neb he must have rigged the masts for none were stepped of course when the boat was in the chocks masts and sails and oars were always kept in the boat it is true but the first could not be stepped without hands a strange wild feeling came over me as a man might be supposed to yield to the appearance of supernatural agencies and almost without intending it i shouted boat ahoy  yo hoy answered marblewho hails  the form of the mate appeared rising in the boat at the next instant neb stood at his side the conversation of the previous night had been real and those whom i had mourned as lost stood within thirty feet of me hale hearty and unharmed the boat and raft had approached each other in the darkness and as i afterwards learned the launch having fanned along for several hours of the night stopped for want of wind nearly where i now saw her and where the dialogue part of which i overheard while half asleep had taken place had the launch continued on its course only ten yards further it would have hit the foretopmast that attraction of which i have already spoken probably kept the boat and raft near each other throughout the night and quite likely had been slowly drawing them together while we slept  it would not be easy to say which party was the most astonished at this recognition there was marble whom i had supposed washed off the raft safe in the launch and here was i whom the other two had thought to have gone down in the ship safe on the raft we appeared to have changed places without concert and without expectation of ever again meeting though ignorant of the means through which all this had been brought about i very well know what we did as soon as each man was certain that he saw the other standing before him in the flesh we sat down and wept like three children then neb too impatient to wait for marbles movements threw himself into the sea and swam to the raft when he got on the staging the honest fellow kissed my hands again and again blubbering the whole time like a girl of three or four years of age this scene was interrupted only by the expostulations and proceedings of the mate  whats this youre doing you bloody nigger cried marble desarting your station and leaving me here alone to manage this heavy launch by myself it might be the means of losing all hands of us again should a hurricane spring up suddenly and wreck us over again  the truth was marble began to be ashamed of the weakness he had betrayed and was ready to set upon anything in order to conceal it neb put an end to this sally however by plunging again into the water and swimming back to the boat as readily as he had come to the raft  ay here you are neb niggerlike and not knowing whether to stay or to go growled the mate busy the whole time in shipping two oars you put me in mind of a great singer i once heard in liverpool a chap that would keep shaking and quavering at the end of a varse in such a style that he sometimes did not know whether to let go or to hold on it is onbecoming in men to forget themselves neb if we have found him we thought to be lost it is no reason for desarting our stations or losing our witsmiles my dear boy springing on the raft and sending neb adrift again all alone by the backward impetus of the leapmiles my dear boy god be praised for this squeezing both my hands as in a vicei dont know how it isbut ever since i ve fallen in with my mother and little kitty ive got to be womanish i suppose its what you call domestic affection  here marble gave in once more blubbering just as hard as neb himself had done  a few minutes later all three began to know what we were about the launch was hauled up alongside of the stage and we sat on the latter relating the manner in which each of us had been saved first then as to neb i have already told the mode in which the launch was swept overboard and i inferred its loss from the violence of the tempest and the height of the seas that were raging around us it is true neither marble nor i saw anything of the launch after it sunk behind the first hill of water to leeward for we had too much to attend to on board the ship to have leisure to look about us but it seems the black was enabled to maintain the boat the right side up and by bailing to keep her afloat he drove to leeward of course and the poor fellow described in vivid terms his sensations as he saw the rate at which he was driving away from the ship and the manner in which he lost sight of her remaining spars as soon as the wind would permit however he stepped the masts and set the two luggs closereefed making stretches of three or four miles in length to windward this timely decision was the probable means of saving all our lives in the course of a few hours after he had got the boat under command he caught a glimpse of the foreroyalmasts sticking out from the cap of a sea and watching it eagerly he next perceived the whole of the raft as it came up on the same swell with marble halfdrowned lashed to the top it was quite an hour before neb could get near enough to the raft or spars to make marble conscious of his presence and sometime longer ere he could get the sufferer into the boat this rescue did not occur one minute too soon for the mate admitted to me he was half drowned and that he did not think he could have held out much longer when neb took him into the boat  as for food and water they fared well enough a breaker of fresh water was kept in each boat by my standing orders and it seems that the cook who was a bit of an epicure in his way was in the habit of stowing a bag of bread and certain choice pieces of beef and pork in the bows of the launch for his own special benefit all these neb had found somewhat the worse for saltwater it is true but still in a condition to be eaten there was sufficient in the launch therefore when we thus met to sustain marble and neb in good heart for a week  as soon as the mate was got off the raft he took direction of the launch unluckily he made a long stretch to the northward intending to tack and cross what he supposed must have been the position of the ship and come to my relief while the launch was thus working its way to windward i fell in with and took possession of the raft as has been described marbles calculation was a good one in the main but it brought him near the dawn the night she sank and the raft and boat were both too low to be seen at any distance the one from the other it is probable we were not more than ten or twelve miles asunder the most of the day i was on the raft marble putting up his helm to cross the supposed position of the ship about three in the afternoon this brought him down upon the raft about midnight when the conversation i have related took place within a few yards of me neither party having the least notion of the proximity of the other  i was touched by the manner in which marble and neb spoke of my supposed fate neither seemed to remember that he was washed away from a ship but appeared to fancy that i was abandoned alone on the high seas in a sinking vessel while i had been regretting their misfortunes they had both thought of me as the party to be pitied each fancying his own fortune more happy than mine in a word their concern for me was so great that they altogether forgot to dwell on the hardships and dangers of their own particular cases i could not express all i felt on the occasion but the events of that morning and the feelings betrayed by my two old shipmates made an impression on my heart that time has not nor ever can efface most men who had been washed overboard would have fancied themselves the suffering party but during the remainder of the long intercourse that succeeded both marble and neb always alluded to this occurrence as if i were the person lost and rescued  we were an hour or more intently occupied in these explanations before either recollected the future then i felt it was time to have some thought for our situation which was sufficiently precarious as it was though marble and neb made light of any risks that remained to be run i was saved as it might be by a miracle and that was all that they could remember just then but a breeze sprang up from the eastward as the sun appeared and the agitation of the raft soon satisfied me that my berth would have been most precarious had i not been so providentially relieved it is true marble made light of the present state of things which compared to those into which he had been so suddenly launchedwithout food water or provisions of any sortwas a species of paradise nevertheless no time was to be wasted and we had a long road to travel in the boat ere we could deem ourselves in the least safe  my two associates had got the launch in as good order as circumstances would allow but it wanted ballast to carry sail hard and they had felt this disadvantage particularly neb when he first got the boat on a wind i could understand by his account of the difficulties and dangers he experiencedthough it came out incidentally and without the smallest design to magnify his own meritsthat nothing but his undying interest in me could have prevented him from running off before the wind in order to save his own life an opportunity now offered to remedy this evil and we went to work to transfer all the effects i had placed on the stage to the launch they made a little cargo that gave her stability at once as soon as this was done we entered the boat made sail and hauled close on a wind under reefed luggs it beginning to blow smartly in puffs  i did not part from the raft without melancholy regrets the materials of which it was composed were all that now remained of the dawn then the few hours of jeopardy and loneliness i had passed on it were not to be forgotten they still recur vividly to my thoughts with deep and i trust profitable reflections the first hour after we cast off we stood to the southward the wind continuing to increase in violence and the sea to get up until it blew too fresh for the boat to make any headway or even to hold her own against it marble thought he might do better on the other tackhaving some reason to suppose there was a current setting to the southward and eastwardand we wore round after standing to the northward for a sufficient length of time we again fell in with the spars a proof that we were doing nothing towards working our way to windward i determined at once to make fast to them and use them as a sort of floating anchor so long as the foul wind lasted we had some difficulty in effecting this object but we finally succeeded in getting near enough under the lee of the top to make fast to one of its eyeboltsusing a bit of small hawser that was in the boat for that purpose the boat was then dropped a sufficient distance to leeward of the spars where it rode head to sea like a duck this was a fortunate expedient as it came on to blow hard and we had something very like a little gale of wind  as soon as the launch was thus moored we found its advantage it shipped no more water or very little and we were not compelled to be on the lookout for squalls which occurred every ten or fifteen minutes with a violence that it would not do to trifle with the weather thickened at these moments and there were intervals of half an hour at a time when we could not see a hundred yards from the boat on account of the drizzling misty rain that filled the atmosphere there we sat conversing sometimes of the past sometimes of the future a bubble in the midst of the raging waters of the atlantic filled with the confidence of seamen with the stout boat we possessed the food and water we had i do not think either now felt any great concern for his fate it being possible in moderate weather to run the launch far enough to reach an english port in about a week favoured by even a tolerably fair wind the object might be effected in even two or three days  i take it for granted miles marble remarked as we pursued our discourse that your insurance will completely cover your whole loss you did not forget to include freight in the risks  so far from this moses i believe myself to be nearly or quite a ruined man the loss of the ship is unquestionably owing to the act of the speedy united to our own in setting those englishmen adrift on the ocean no insurers will meet a policy that has thus been voided  ah the blackguardsthis is worse than i had thoughtbut you can always make a harbour at clawbonny  i was on the point of explaining to marble how i stood in relation to the paternal acres when a sort of shadow was suddenly cast on the boat and i fancied the rushing of the water seemed to be increased at the same instant we all three sat with our faces to leeward and all turned them to windward under a common impulse a shout burst from marbles throat and a sight met my eyes that caused the blood to rush in a torrent through my heart literally within a hundred feet of us was a large ship ploughing the ocean with a furrow that rose to her hawseholes and piling before her in her track a mound of foam as she came down upon us with topmast and lower studdingsails setovershadowing the sea like some huge cloud there was scarcely time for more than a glance ere this ship was nearly upon us as she rose on a swell her black sides came up out of the ocean glittering and dripping and the tine of frowning guns seemed as if just lacquered neb was in the bow of the launch while i was in the stern my arm was extended involuntarily or instinctively would be the better word to avert the danger when it seemed to me that the next send of the ship would crush us beneath the bright copper of her bottom without nebs strength and presence of mind we had been lost beyond a hope for swimming up to the spars against the sea that was on would have been next to hopeless and even if there without food or water our fate would have been sealed but neb seized the hawser by which we were riding and hauled the launch ahead her length or more before the frigates larboard boweranchor settled down in a way that menaced crushing us as it was i actually laid a hand on the muzzle of the third gun while the ship went foaming by at the next instant she was past and we were safe then all three of us shouted together until that moment none in the frigate were aware of our vicinity but the shout gave the alarm and as the ship cleared us her taffrail was covered with officers among them was one greyheaded man whom i recognised by his dress for the captain he made a gesture turning an arm upward and i knew an order was given immediately after by the instantaneous manner in which the taffrail was cleared  by george exclaimed marble i had a generalizing time of it for half a dozen seconds miles  there was more risk i answered than time to reflect on it however the ship is about to roundto and we shall be picked up at last let us thank god for this  it was indeed a beautiful sight for a seaman to note the manner in which that old captain handled his vessel although we found the wind and sea too much for a boat that had to turn to windward neither was of much moment to a stout frigate that carried fifty guns and which was running off with the wind on her quarter  she was hardly past us when i could see preparations making to take in canvass at the instant she overshadowed us with her huge wings this vessel had topgallantsails set with two topmast and a lower studdingsail besides carrying the leeclew of her mainsail down and the other customary cloth spread up went her mainsail almost as soon as the captain made the signal with his arm then all three of the topgallantsails were flying at the same moment presently the yards were alive with men and the loose canvass was rolled up and the gaskets passed while this was doing down came all the studdingsails together much as a bird shuts its wings the booms disappeared immediately after  look at that miles cried the delighted marble although a bloody englishman that chap leaves nothing to be done over again he puts everything in its place like an old woman stowing away her needles and thread ill warrant you the old blade is a keen one  the ship is well handled certainly and her people work like mariners who are trying to save the lives of mariners  while this was passing between us the frigate was stripped to her three topsails spanker jib and forecourse down came her yards next and then they were covered with bluejackets like bees clustering around a hive we had scarcely time to note this ere the men lay in and the yards were up again with the sails reefed this was no sooner done than the frigate which had luffed the instant the steeringsails were in was trimmed close on a wind and began to toss the water over her spritsailyard as she met the waves like one that paid them no heed no sooner was the old seaman who directed all this assured of the strength of the wind he had to meet than down went his mainsail again and the tack was hauled aboard  the stranger was then under the smartest canvass a frigate can carry reefs in her topsails with the courses set her sail could be shortened in an instant yet she was under a press of it more than an ordinary vessel would presume to carry perhaps in so strong a breeze  notwithstanding the great jeopardy from which we had just escaped and the imminent hazard so lately run all three of us watched the movements of the frigate with as much satisfaction as a connoisseur would examine a fine painting even neb let several nigger expressions of pleasure escape him  by the time sail could be shortened and the ship hauled close on a wind the frigate was nearer half than a quarter of a mile off we had to wait therefore until she could beat up to the place where we lay this she soon did making one stretch to the southward until in a line with the boat when she tacked and came toward us with her yards braced up but having the wind nearly abeam as she got within a cableslength both courses were hauled up and left hanging in the brails then the noble craft came rolling by us in the trough passing so near that we might be spoken the old officer stood in the weather gangway with a trumpet and he hailed when near enough to be heard instead of asking questions to satisfy his own curiosity he merely communicated his own intentions  ill heaveto when past you he cried out waring ship to do so you can then drop down under my stern as close as possible and well throw you a rope  i understood the plan which was considerate having a regard to the feebleness of our boats crew and the weight of the boat itself accordingly when she had room enough the frigate wore hauling up close on the other tack and laying her mainyard square as soon as the ship was stationary neb cast off the hawser and marble and he manned two oars we got the boat round without much risk and in less time than it takes to write it were sending down towards the ship at a furious rate i steered and passed so near the frigates rudder that i thought for an instant i had gone too close a rope was hove as we cleared the leequarter of the frigate and the people on board hauled us alongside we caught the manropes and were soon on the quarterdeck a respectablelooking elderly man of a square compact frame and a fine ruddy english face in a postcaptains undress received me with an extended hand and a frank generous hearty manner  you are welcome on board the briton he said warmly and i thank god that he has put it in our power to relieve you your ship must have been lost quite recently as you do not seem to have suffered when you feel equal to it i should like to hear the name of your vessel and the particulars of her disaster i suppose it was in the late blow which was a whacker and did lots of mischief along the coast i see you are americans and that your boat is new york built but all men in distress are countrymen  this was a hearty reception and one i had every reason to extol so long as i stayed with captain rowley as this officer was named i had no reason to complain of any change in his deportment had i been his son he could not have treated me more kindly taking me into his own cabin and giving me a seat at his own table i gave him an outline of what had happened to us not deeming it necessary to relate the affair with the speedy however simply mentioning the manner in which we had escaped from a french privateer and leaving him to infer should he see fit that the rest of our crew had been carried away on that occasion my reserve on the subject of the other capture the reader will at once see was merely a necessary piece of prudent caution  captain rowley had no sooner heard my story which i made as short as possible knowing that marble and neb had been cautioned on the subject than he again took my hand and welcomed me to his ship the mate was sent into the gunroom and recommended to the hospitality of the lieutenants while neb was placed in the care of the cabin servants a short consultation was then held about the boat which it was decided must be sent adrift after its effects were passed out of it the briton having no use for such a launch nor any place to stow it i stood at the gangway and looked with a melancholy eye at this last remnant of the dawn that i ever beheld a large eighty thousand dollars of my property vanishing from the earth in the loss of that ship and her cargo    chapter xxiv      some shout at victorys loud acclaim     some fall that victory to assure   but time divulges that in name     alone our triumphs are secure    duo   the briton had come out of the cove of cork only a few days before and was bound on service with orders to run off to the westward a few hundred miles and to cruise three months in a latitude that might cover the homewardbound running ships from the american provinces of which there were many in that early period of the war this was not agreeable news to us who had hoped to be landed somewhere immediately and who had thought at first on seeing the ship carrying a press of sail to the westward that she might be going to halifax there was no remedy however and we were fain to make the best of circumstances captain rowley promised to put us on board the first vessel that offered and that was as much as we had a right to ask of him  more than two months passed without the britons speaking or even seeing a single sail to these vicissitudes is the seaman subject at one time he is in the midst of craft at another the ocean seems deserted to himself alone captain rowley ascribed this want of success to the fact that the war was inducing the running ships to collect in convoys and that his orders carried him too far north to permit his falling in with the americans bound to and from liverpool whatever may have been the reason however the result was the same to us after the gale of the equinox the briton stood to the southward as far as madeira such a change of ground being included in her instructions and thence after cruising three weeks in the neighbourhood of that island she shaped her course for plymouth in the whole the frigate had at that time broughtto and boarded some thirty sail all of whom were neutrals and not one of whom was bound to a port that would do us any good the ships water getting low we were now compelled to go in and as has been said we made sail to the northward the afternoon of the very day the briton left her second cruising ground a strange ship was seen directly on our course which was pronounced to be a frigate before the sun set  the briton manoeuvred all night to close with the stranger and with success as he was only a league distant and a very little to windward of her when i went on deck early the next morning i found the ship clear for action and a degree of animation pervading the vessel that i had never before witnessed the people were piped to breakfast just as i approached the captain to salute him with a good morning  good morning to you wallingford cried the old man in a cheerful way you are just in time to take a look at yonder frenchman in his glory two hours hence i hope hell not appear quite as much of a beau as he is a this moment shes a noble craft is she not and quite of our own force  as for the last sir i answered there does not seem much to chooseshe is what you call a thirtyeight and mounts fifty guns i dare say is she certainly french  as certainly as this ship is english she can do nothing with our signals and her rig is a character for her whoever saw an englishman with such royalmasts and yards so master wallingford you must consent to take your breakfast an hour earlier than common or go without it altogether ahhere is the steward to say it waits for us  i followed captain rowley to the cabin where i found he had sent for marble to share our meal the kindhearted old gentleman seemed desirous of adding this act of civility to the hundred others that he had already shown us i had received much generous and liberal treatment from captain rowley but never before had he seemed so much disposed to act towards me as a father would act to a son as on that morning  i hope you have done justice to daviss cookery gentlemen he said after the assault on the eatables began to abate a little in ardour for this may be the last opportunity that will offer to enjoy it i am an englishman and have what i hope is a humble confidence in the superiority of an english over a french ship but i very well know we never get even a french ship without working for it and yonder gentleman may not leave us any crockery for tomorrow he evidently means to fight us and i think will do himself credit  i believe you english always go into action against the french with a confidence of victory i remarked  why we have brought our lads up to that feeling certainly though i would not have you fancy i am quite of that way of thinking i am too old and have seen too much service wallingford not to know that every battle is liable to accidents and vicissitudes there is some difference in service i must suppose though not half as much in men as is vulgarly imagined the result is in the hands of god and i do think we are fighting his battles in this fearful war therefore i trust he will take care of us  i was surprised to find captain rowley who was usually cheerful and gay talking in this manner but it did not become me to pursue the subject in a minute or two we rose from table and i heard the order given to the steward to report to the firstlieutenant as soon as the table was cleared away that the cabin bulkheads might be removed marble and i then passed below into a canvass berth that had been made for him where we could consult together without danger of interruption just as we reached the place the drum beat to quarters this carried nearly every one else on deck and left us virtually alone  well miles commenced marble this vyge will beat any other of our vyges and give it fifty we have been twice captured once wrecked have seen a fight and are about to feel another what do you think patriotism and republican vartoo require us to do in such a crisis  this was the first time i had ever heard my mate mention republicanism his habits being certainly as much opposed to liberty as those of napoleon himself although the reader probably will not understand the drift of his question it was not lost on me i answered therefore like one who fully comprehended him  i am afraid moses said i there is very little republicanism in france just now nor do i know that resemblance in governments makes nations friends unless the resemblance be complete i rather think they are more disposed to quarrel about the differences than to allow the merits of the points of affinity as between england and france however since we are at peace with both we americans have nothing to do with their quarrels  i thought that would be your idee miles and yet it would be awkward to be in the midst of a fight and take no part in it id give a hundred dollars to be on board that frenchman this minute  are you so much in love with defeat as to wish to be flogged  i dont know how it is but it goes agin the grain to take sides with a john bull  there is no necessity for taking sides with either though we can remember how these people have saved our lives how kind they have been to us and that we have literally lived three months on their bounty neb im glad to see makes fair weather of it on the berthdeck  ay theres more in that than you dream of perhaps mr clements the firstlieutenant of this ship is a sly one and he thinks more of a good seaman than some priests do of piety if im not greatly misled he intends that neb shant quit this ship till the peace  how they surely cannot pretend that the black is an englishman  there are all kinds of englishmen black and white when seamen grow scarce howsever there is no use in looking out for the worstwe shall know all about it when the ship gets in how are we to behave miles in this here battle it goes agin my feelins to help an englishman and yet an old salt dont like to keep under hatches while powder is burning on deck  it would be wrong for either of us to take any part in the action since we have nothing to do with the quarrel still we may appear on deck unless ordered below and i dare say opportunities will offer to be of use especially in assisting the hurt i shall go on the quarterdeck but i would advise you not to go higher than the gundeck as for neb i shall formally offer his services in helping to carry the wounded down  i understand youwe shall all three sarve in the humane gangwell when a man has no business with any other that may be better than none your standing idle in a fight must be trying work  marble and i conversed a little longer on this subject when a gun fired from the upperdeck gave us notice that the game was about to begin each hastened to his intended post without more words when i reached the quarterdeck everything denoted the eve of a combat the ship was under short canvass the men were at quarters the guns were cast loose and were levelled the tompions were all out shot was distributed about the deck and here and there some old salt of a captain might be seen squinting along his gun as if impatient to begin a silence like that of a deserted church reigned throughout the ship had one been on board her intended adversary at that same instant be would have been deafened by the clamour and confused with the hurried and disorderly manner in which preparations that were long before completed on board the british were still in progress on board the frenchman four years earlier the same want of preparation had given nelson his great victory at the nile the french in order to clear their outer batteries had lumbered those inshore and when half their enemies unexpectedly passed inside they found their ships were not prepared to fire ships that were virtually beaten before they had discharged an effective shot  wallingford said my old friend the captain as soon as i approached him you have nothing to do here it would not be proper for you to take a part in this action and it would be folly to expose yourself without an object  i am quite aware of all this captain rowley but i have thought your kindness to me was so great as to permit me to be a lookeron i may be of some service to the wounded if to nothing else and i hope you think me too much of an officer to get in the way  i am not certain sir i ought to permit anything of the sort returned the old man gravely this fighting is serious business and no one should meddle with it whose duty does not command it of him see here sir pointing at the french frigate which was about two cableslengths distant with her topgallantsails clewed up and the courses in the brails in ten minutes we shall be hard at it and i leave it to yourself to say whether prudence does not require that you shouldgo below  i had expected this and instead of contesting the matter i bowed and walked off the quarterdeck as if about to comply out of sight out of mind i thoughtit would be time enough to go below when i had seen the beginning of the affair in the waist i passed the marines drawn up in military array with their officer as attentive to dressing them in line as if the victory depended on its accuracy on the forecastle i found neb with his hands in his pockets watching the manoeuvres of the french as the cat watches those of the mouse the fellows eye was alive with interest and i saw it was useless to think of sending him below as for the officers they had taken their cue from the captain and only smiled goodnaturedly as i passed them the firstlieutenant however was an exception he never had appeared welldisposed towards us and i make no doubt had i not been so hospitably taken into the cabin we should all have got an earlier taste of his humour  there is too much good stuff in that fellow he drily remarked in passing pointing towards neb at the same time for him to be doing nothing at a moment like this  we are neutrals as respects france mr clements i answered and it would not be right for us to take part in your quarrels i will not hesitate to say however that i have received so much kindness on board the briton that i should feel miserable in not being permitted to share your danger something may turn up that will enable me to be of assistanceay and neb too  the man gave me a keen look muttered something between his teeth and walked aft whither he was proceeding when we met i looked in the direction in which he went and could see he was speaking in a surly way to captain rowley the old gentleman cast a look forward shook a finger at me then smiled in his benevolent way and turned as i thought to look for one of the midshipmen who acted as his aids at that moment the frenchman went in stays delivering his whole broadside from aft forward as the guns bore the shot told on the british spars smartly though only two hulled her as a matter of course this turned the thoughts of captain rowley to the main business in hand and i was forgotten as for neb he immediately made himself useful a shot cut the mainspringstay just above his head and before i had time to speak the fellow seized a stopper and caught one of the ends of the stay applied the stopper and was hard at work in bringing the rope into its proper place and in preparing it again to bear a strain the boatswain applauded his activity sending two or three forecastlemen to help him from that moment neb was as busy as a bee aloft now appearing through openings in the smoke on this yardarm now on that his face on a broad grin whenever business of more importance than common was to be done the briton might have had older and more experienced seamen at work in her rigging that day but not one that was more active more ready when told what to do or more athletic the gaité de coeur with which this black exerted himself in the midst of that scene of strife clamour and bloodshed has always presented itself to my mind as truly wonderful  captain rowley did not alter his course or fire a gun in answer to the salute he received though the two ships were scarcely a cableslength asunder when the frenchman began the briton stood steadily on and the two ships passed each other within pistolshot a minute or two later when we let fly all our larboard guns this was the beginning of the real war and warm enough it was for half an hour or moreour ship coming round as soon as she had fired when the two frigates closed broadside and broadside both running off nearly dead before the wind i do not know how it happened but when the headyards were swung i found myself pulling at the forebrace like a dray horse the masters mate who commanded these braces thanked me for my assistance in a cheerful voice saying well thrash em in an hour captain wallingford this was the first consciousness i had that my hands had entered into the affair at all  i had now an opportunity of ascertaining what a very different thing it is to be a spectator in such a scene from being an actor ashamed of the forgetfulness that had sent me to the brace i walked on the quarterdeck where blood was already flowing freely everybody but myself was at work for life or death in 1803 that mongrel gun the carronade had come into general use and those on the quarterdeck of the briton were beginning to fly round and look their owners in the face when they vomited their contents as they grew warm with the explosion captain rowley clements and the master were all here the first and last attending to the trimming of the sails while the firstlieutenant looked a little after the battery and a little at everything else scarce a minute passed that shot did not strike somewhere though it was principally aloft and the wails of the hurt the revolting part of every serious combat began to mingle in the roar of the contest the english i observed fought sullenly though they fought with all their hearts occasionally a cheer would arise in some part of the ship but these and the cries of the hurt were fire on the briton as well as the manner in which the english repaid all they received while standing near the mainmast in the battery that was not engaged marble made me out in the smoke and cameup to speak to me  them frenchmen are playing their parts like men he said theres a shot just gone through the cooks coppers and another through the boats by the lord harry if the boys on this deck do not bestir themselves we shall get licked i wouldnt be licked by a frenchman on any account mileseven little kitty would point her finger at me  we are only passengers you know moses and can have little concern with victory or defeat so long as the striped and starred bunting has nothing to do with the credit of the thing  i am not so sure of that milesi do not like being flogged even as a passenger there just look at that now two or three more such raps and half our guns will be silenced  two shot had come in together as marble thus interrupted himself one of them knocking away the side of a port while the other laid four men of its gun on the deck this gun was on the point of being discharged as the injury was inflicted but the loss of its captain prevented it from being fired the lieutenant of the division caught the match from the fallen seaman gave it a puff with his breath and applied it to the priming as the gun came leaping in the lieutenant turned his head to see where he could best find men to supply the place of those who had been killed or wounded his eyes fell on us he asked no questions but merely looked in our direction  ay ay sir said marble stripping off his jacket and taking the tobacco from his mouth in one momentjust hold on till im ready  i scarce knew whether to remonstrate or not but hard at it he went and delighted by his zeal the officer clapped him on the back leaving him to act as captain of the gun afraid the contagion might extend to myself i turned ascended the ladder and was immediately on the quarterdeck again here i found old captain rowley with his hat off cheering his menthe frenchmans maintopmast having just gone over his side it was not a time to make my report nor was any needed just then so i walked aft as far as the taffrail in order to get out of the way and to make my observations as much removed from the smoke as possible this was the only opportunity i enjoyed of noting the relative positions as well as conditions of the two vessels  the briton had suffered heavily aloft but all her principal spars still stood on the other hand her antagonist had lost both main and mizentopmasts and her fire had materially slackened within the last fifteen minutes she was falling more under a quarterraking fire too from her peoples losing command of their ship the two frigates having some time before come by the windthe englishman a little on the frenchmans weatherquarter as is usual in a heavy cannonade and a moderate breeze the wind had died away or become neutralized by the concussions of the guns and neither combatant moved much from the position he occupied still the briton had her yards knowingly braced while those of her enemy were pretty much at sixes and sevens under such circumstances it was not difficult to predict the result of the engagement more especially as the spirits of the britons seemed to be rising with the duration of the combat  i was still making my observations when i heard the crack of a shot and the ripping of plank on the forward part of the quarterdeck a little group collected around a falling man and i thought i caught a glimpse of captain rowleys uniform and epaulettes in the sufferer in an instant i was on the spot sure enough there was my old friend grievously wounded clements was also there catching my eye he observed  as you are doing nothing sir will you assist in carrying captain rowley below  i did not like the manner in which this was said nor the expression of the firstlieutenants eye while saying it they seemed to me to add i shall now command this ship and we shall see if new lords dont produce new laws i complied however of course and aided by two of his own servants i got the poor old man into the gunroom the instant the surgeon cast his eyes on the injuries i saw by his countenance there was no hope his words soon confirmed the bad news  the captain cannot live half an hour this gentleman said to me aside and all we can do will be to give him what he asks for at present he is stupified by the shock of the blow but in a few minutes he will probably ask for water or wine and water i wish sir you would indulge him in his wishes for you can have no duty to call you on deck this will be a lucky hit for clements who will run off with more than half the credit of the battle though i fancy the frenchman has as much as he wants already  and so it turned out literally in the end about twenty minutes after i went below during which time the briton did most of the fighting we heard the cheer of victory on deck these sounds appeared to cause the wounded man to revive  what means that wallingford he asked in a stronger voice than i could have thought it possible for him to use what do these cheers mean my young friend  they mean captain rowley that you have conqueredthat you are master of the french frigate  masteram i master of my own life of what use is victory to me now i shall diedie soon wallingford and there will be an end of it all my poor wife will call this a melancholy victory  alas what i could say these words were only too true as respects himself and i dare say as respected his wife also die he did and in my presence and that calmly with all his senses about him but i could see he had his doubts whether a little lustre like that which attended his end was fulfilling all the objects of his being the near view of death places a man on a moral eminence whence he commands prospects before and behind on each side and on every side enabling him to overlook the whole scene of life from its commencement to its close and to form an opinion of his own place in a drama that is about to close like many of those who exhibit themselves for our amusement and to purchase our applause he is only too apt to quit the stage less satisfied with his own performances than the thoughtless multitude who regarding merely the surfaces of things are too often loudest in their approbation when there is the least to praise  i shall pass over the next ten days with a very brief allusion to their events the first proof i had of mr clements being commanding officer was my being transferred from the cabin to the gunroom it is true there was no want of space in my new apartment for officering and manning the prize had left several staterooms vacant in the britons gunroom which fell to the shares of the french prisoners and myself poor captain rowley was preserved in spirits and then things went on pretty much as before with the exception that our crippled condition and reduced crew rendered us no longer anxious to fall in with frenchmen i may say in this place also that now the excitement which had carried him away was gone marble was profoundly ashamed of the part he had taken in the late affair he had fought under english colours once more and though i seldom dared to allude to the thing it is my opinion he heartily regretted his conduct to his dying day as for neb all seemed right enough in his eyes for though he well understood the distinctions between flags and countries he always imagined it a duty to stick by the craft in which he happened to be  ten days after i had been living under the régime of new lords and new laws we fell in with a frigate in the chops of the channel and exchanged signals with her the reader will judge of marbles and my dissatisfaction when we heard it announced that the ship which was then fast approaching us was the speedy there was no help for it however she was already within gunshot and soon roundedto within hail of the briton which ship had hoveto to wait for her in a few minutes lord harry dermond in person was alongside of us in a boat to show his orders to captain rowley and report himself as the junior captain i could not quit the quarterdeck from a desire to ascertain if possible what had become of sennit and his companions though prudence dictated concealment  clements met the young nobleman at the gangway and apologizing for not going on board the speedy on account of the state of his boats reported the late action and its results lord harry then found himself the senior instead of the junior commander and he immediately began to ask questions he was in the midst of these interrogatories when his eye suddenly fell on me he and clements were walking on the quarterdeck together and i had gone into the gangway to escape his notice when this unexpected recognition took place it occurred as the two were turning in their walk and were so near me that i could hear what was said between them  who have you there leaning against the cutter mr clements demanded the captain of the speedy its a face i knowsome old shipmate of mine i fancy  i rather think not my lordits ayankee we picked up at sea in a boat a captain wallingford of the american ship dawn his vessel foundered in a gale and all hands were lost but this gentleman his mate and a negro we have had them on board now more than three months  a long low whistle escaped from lord harry dermond who immediately walked up to me raised his hat and commenced a very disagreeable sort of a dialogue by sayingyour servant mr wallingford we meet under very unusual circumstances and somewhat often the last time was at a rather interesting moment to me and one in which i was so much engaged that i had not leisure properly to pay my respects to you mr clements i have a little business to transact with this gentleman and must ask the favour of your company and his for a few minutes in your cabin  no objection could be raised to this request and i followed the two officers into the britons cabin     chapter xxv      o i hae scarce to lay me on   if kingly fields were ance my ain   wi the moorcock on the mountainbree   but hardship naer can daunton me    scottish song   there was an air of cool deliberation about lord harry dermond which satisfied me i should have to pass through a trying ordeal and i prepared myself for the occasion nothing was said until all three of us were in the aftercabin when clements and his visiter took seats on the sofa and a motion was made to me to occupy a chair then lord harry dermond commenced the discourse in a manner more serious than i could have wished  mr wallingford he said there is little need of preliminaries between you and me i recollected your ship when the black prince and speedy were in the act of closing with the frenchmen three months since and i need scarcely say that the manner in which she got back to the place where i then saw her requires an explanation at your hands  it shall be given to you my lord believing you had no right to send in the dawn and knowing that a detention of any length would prove my ruin i regained possession of my own by the best means that offered  this is at least frank sir you mean to be understood that you rose on my people in the night murdered them and that you subsequently lost your vessel from a want of force to take care of her  this is partly true and partly a mistake i certainly should not have lost my ship had i been as stronghanded in the gale in which she was destroyed as she was the day she left home and she would have been as stronghanded in that gale had we never fallen in with the speedy  which is an indirect manner of saying that the wreck was owing to us  i shall very directly say that i think it was though by indirect means  well sir on that point it is not probable we shall ever agree you cannot suppose that the servants of the king of great britain will submit to your american mode of construing public law but will easily understand that we leave such matters to our own admiralty judges it is a matter of more moment to me just now to ascertain what has become of the officers and men that were put in charge of your ship i saw the vessel some time after i put mr sennit and his party on board you in your possession that we ascertained by means of our glasses and you now admit that you retook your vessel from these men what has become of the prizecrew  i briefly related the manner in which we had regained the possession of the dawn the two english officers listened attentively and i could discern a smile of incredulity on the countenance of clements while the captain of the speedy seemed far from satisfiedthough he was not so much disposed to let his real opinion be known  this is a very wellconcocted and welltold tale my lord said the first with a sneer but i doubt whether it find many believers in the british service  the british service sir i coldly retorted is like all others liable to reverses and accidents  not exactly of this nature mr wallingford you will yourself admit on reflection but i beg pardon my lord this is your affairnot mine and i have been indiscreet in speaking  lord harry dermond looked as if he concurred in this sentiment he had the pride of official rank and that of private rank to the usual degree and did not exactly like the notion that one so much his inferior in both should take an affair so peculiarly his own out of his hands he made a cold acknowledging bow therefore in reply and paused a moment like a man who reflected ere he continued the discourse  you must be aware mr wallingford it is my duty to inquire closely into this matter he at length resumed i am just out of port where my ship has been lying to refit several weeks and it is not probable that either of my officers would be in england without reporting himself had he reached home  it is quite probable my lord that neither has reached home i saw them picked up with my own eyes and by what appeared to me to be an outwardbound west indiaman in that case they have most probably all been carried to one of the west india islands  here clements handed lord harry desmond a paper with something written on it in pencil which the latter read after running his eyes over it the captain nodded his head and the lieutenant quitted the cabin while he was absent my companion in a polite manner gave me the particulars of the combat i had witnessed going so far as to direct my attention to a paper he had brought on board to show to captain rowley and which contained the english official account of the whole affair on glancing at it i saw that the presence of the dawn on that occasion was mentioned in ihe report the name of the ship being given with an allusion that was not very clear to the general reader but which was plain enough to me it was not long however before clements returned and without much ceremony he informed me that the gunroom mess waited my appearance to sit down to dinner on this hint i rose and took my leave though i had time to see marble enter the cabin and neb standing by the scuttlebutt under the charge of the sentinel ere i dipped my head under hatches  the dinner lasted near an hour and lord harry dermond civilly waited all that time before he again summoned me to the cabin i was surprised to find marble in the outercabin neb near the door in waiting and the two officers with pen ink and paper before them where they had been left by me  mr wallingford lord harry commenced i hold it to be no more than fair to let you know that your mates account of the manner in which the speedys people got out of the dawn and your own do not agree in a single particular here is his statement taken down by myself from his own words if you are disposed to hear it i will read you what he says  i do not well see how mr marble can contradict me and tell the truth my lordbut it were better i should hear his statement  i was firstmate of the dawn of new york miles wallingford master and owner captured and ordered in by speedy as known three days after parting company with the frigate with mr sennit as prizemaster captain wallingford and i commenced reasoning with that gentleman on the impropriety of sending in a neutral and breaking up a promising voyage which so overcame the said lieutenant sennit in his mind that he consented to take the ships yawl with a suitable stock of provisions and water and give us up the ship accordingly the boat was lowered properly stowed the most tender anxiety manifested for the party that was to go in her when the english took their leave with tears in their eyes and hearty good wishes for our safe arrival at hamburg  am i to understand you seriously lord harry dermond that my mate has actually given you this account of the affair for fact  most seriously sir i believe he even offered to swear to it though i dispensed with that ceremony here is the statement of the black perhaps you would wish to hear that also  anything my lord it is your pleasure to communicate  nebuchadnezzar clawbonny says he belonged to the dawnwas left in her when captured by speedy and was in her when wrecked captain wallingford ordered mr sennit to quit his ship or he would make him and mr sennit obeyed master miles of course but i will read no more of this as a slaves statement can hardly be relied on perhaps we ought not to have received it mr clements  your pardon my lord it is our duty to protect his majestys subjects in the best mode we can  that may be true sir but certain great principles ought never to be overlooked even when doing our duty you perceive mr wallingford that your companions contradict your own account of this affair and the most unpleasant suspicions are awakened i should never justify myself to my superiors were i to neglect putting you under arrest and carrying you all in for trial  if my companions have been so illjudging as to make the statements you say i can only regret it i have told you the truth and i can add no more as for the future i do not suppose any representation of mine will induce you to change your decision  you carry it off well sir and i hope you will maintain the same appearance of innocence to the end the lives of the kings subjects are not to be taken with impunity nevertheless  nor is the property of an american citizen i trust my lord had i used force to regain my ship and had i thrown the prizecrew into the sea i conceive i would have been doing no more than was my duty  this is well sir and i hope for your sake that an english jury will view the affair in the same light at present prepare to go on board the speedyfor you must not be separated from the important testimony we can find in that ship as for the citizens you mention they are bound to submit to the decision of the admiralty courts and not to take the law into their own hands  we shall see my lord when this case reaches my own country we shall probably hear more of it  i uttered this in a sufficiently magnificent manner and to own the truth i felt a little magnificently at the time i was then young not threeandtwenty and i thought of my country her independence her justice her disposition to do right her determination to submit to no wrongs and her disregard of the expedient when principles were concernedmuch as young people think of the immaculate qualities of their own parents according to the decisions of judges of this latter class there would not be a liar a swindler a cheat or a mercenary scoundrel living but the earth would be filled with so many suffering saints that are persecuted for their virtues according to the notions of most american citizens of my age the very name they bore ought to be a protection to them in any part of the world under the penalty of incurring the republics just indignation how far my anticipations were realized will be seen in the sequeland i beg the american reader in particular to restrain his natural impatience until he can learn the facts in the regular order of the narrative i can safely promise him that should he receive them in the proper spirit with a desire to ascertain truth only and not to uphold bloated and untenable theories he will be a wiser and probably a more modest man for the instruction that is to be thus gleaned from the incidents it will be my painful office to record as for lord harry dermond the threatened indignation of the great american nation gave him very little concern he probably cared a vast deal more for one frown from the admiral who commanded at plymouth than for the virtuous resentment of the president and congress of the united states of america i am writing of the close of the year 1803 it will be remembereda remote period in the history of the great republic though i will not take it on myself to say things have materially altered except it be in the newspapers in this particular interest the order to prepare to quit the briton was repeated and i was dismissed to the outer cabin where was marble while mr clements attempted to shut the door that separated us though from some cause or other he did not exactly effect his object in consequence of this neglect i overheard the following dialogue  i hope my lord said clements you will not think of taking away the mate and the black they are both firstrate men and both well affected to his majestys service the negro was of great use aloft during the late action while the mate fought at a gun like a tiger for the better part of an hour we are somewhat short of hands and i have counted on inducing both these men to enter there is the prizemoney for the frenchman under our lee you know my lord and i have little doubt of succeeding  im sorry duty compels me to take all three clements but ill bear what you say in mind perhaps we can get them to enter on board the speedy you know it  here mr clements discovered that the door was not shut and he closed it tight preventing my hearing any more i now turned to marble whose countenance betrayed the selfreproach he endured at ascertaining the injury he had done by his illjudged artifice i made no reproaches however but squeezed his hand in token of my forgiveness the poor fellow i plainly saw had great difficulty in forgiving himself though he said nothing at the moment  the conference between lord harry dermond and mr clements lasted half an hour at the end of that time both appeared in the forward cabin and i saw by the countenance of the last that he had failed in his object as for us we were transferred with the few articles we possessed to the speedy on board which ship our arrival made as much of a sensation as the discipline of a manofwar would permit i was put in irons the moment we reached the quarterdeck and placed under the charge of a sentinel near the cabindoor some little attention was paid to my comfort it is true and a canvass screen was fitted for me behind which i ate and slept with some sort of retirement my irons were of so large a sort that i found means to take them off and to put them on at pleasure i was disposed to think that the officers were aware of the fact and that the things were used as much for the sake of appearance as for anything else apart from the confinement and the injury done my affairs i had no especial causes of complaint though this imprisonment lasted until the month of april 1804 or quite five months during this time the speedy arrived as far south as the line then she hovered about the canaries and the azores on her way homeward looking in vain for another frenchman i was permitted to take exercise twice a day once in the gangway and once on the gundeck and my table was actually supplied from the cabin on no head had i any other cause to complain than the fact that my ship had been wrongfully seized in the first place and that i was now suffering imprisonment for a crimeif crime indeed it would have beenthat i certainly had not been obliged to commit  during the five months i thus remained a prisoner on the gundeck of the speedy i never exchanged a syllable with either marble or neb i saw them both occasionally employed on duty like the crew and we often exchanged significant looks but never any words occasionally i had a visit from an officer these gentlemen sitting down and conversing with me on general topics evidently to relieve the tedium of my confinement without making any allusion to its cause i cannot say that my health suffered a circumstance that was probably owing to the cleanliness of the ship and the admirable manner in which she was ventilated  at length we went into port carrying with us a french ship from one of the islands to the eastward of the cape as a prize the speedy captured this vessel after a smart chase to the northward of the azores and marble and neb having volunteered to do so were sent on board her as two of the prizecrew that day i got a visit from the purser who was the most attentive of all my acquaintances and i took the liberty of asking him if it were possible my two shipmates had entered into the british service  why not exactly that he said though they seem to like us and we think both will ship rather than lose the prizemoney they might get for their services in the briton your old mate is a prime fellow the master tells me but my lord fancying we might meet some french cruiser in the chops of the channel thought it better to send these two chaps in the prize lest they should take the studs and refuse to fight at the pinch they have done duty they say to keep themselves in good health and we humour them to be frank with you under the notion they may get to like us so well as not to wish to quit us  this gave me an insight into the true state of the case and i felt much easier on the subject that marble ever intended to serve under the british flag i had not supposed for a moment but i was not sure that regret for the blunder he had already made might not lead him into some new mistake of equally serious import under the impression that he was correcting the evil as for neb i knew he would never desert me and i had not from the first felt any other concern on his account than an apprehension his ignorance might be imposed on  the day we anchored in plymouth sound was thick and drizzling with a fresh breeze at southwest the ship cameto just at sunset her prize bringing up a short distance inshore of her as i could see from the port that formed a sort of window to my little canvass stateroom just as the ship was secured lord harry dermond passed into his cabin accompanied by his firstlieutenant and i overheard him say to the latter  by the way mr powlett this prisoner must be removed to some other place in the morning now we are so near the land it is not quite safe to trust him at a port  i was still musing on the purport of this remark when i heard the noise of a boat coming alongside putting my head out of the port i could just see that the prize master of the french ship had come on board and that marble and neb were two of the four men who pulled the oars marble saw me and gave a sign of recognition though it was so dark as to render it difficult to distinguish objects at a trifling distance this sign i returned in a significant manner it was this answering signal from me that induced my mate not to quit the boat and to keep neb with him the other two men were so accustomed to do duty with the americans that they did not scruple to run up the frigates side after their officer eager to get a gossip with their old messmates on the berthdeck almost at the same instant the officer of the deck called out  drop la manerves boat astern out of the way of the captains gig which will be hauling up in a minute  this was on the larboard side it is true but a smart sea slapping against the starboard lord harry was willing to dispense with ceremony in order to escape a wet jacket i cannot tell the process of reasoning that induced me to take the step i did it was however principally owing to the remark i had so lately heard and which brought all the danger of my position vividly to my mind whatever may have been the moving cause i acted as follows  my irons were slipped and i squeezed myself between the gun and the side of the port where i hung by my hands against the ships side i might be seen or i might not caring little for the result i was not seen by any but marble and neb the former of whom caught me by the legs as he passed beneath and whispering to me to lie down in the bottom of the boat he assisted me into the cutter we actually rubbed against the captains gig as it was hauling up to the gangway but no one suspected what had just taken place this gig was the only one of the speedys boats that was in the water at that hour it having just been lowered to carry the captain ashore in another minute we had dropped astern neb holding on by a boathook to one of the rudderchains here we lay until the gig pulled round close to us taking the direction toward the usual landing with the captain of the speedy in her  in two minutes the gig was out of sight and marble whispered to neb to let go his hold this was promptly done when the boat of the prize began to drift from the ship swept by a powerful tide and impelled by a stiff breeze no one paid any heed to us everybodys thoughts being occupied with the shore and the arrival at such a moment the time was fortunate in another particular lord harry dermond was a vigilant and good officer but his firstlieutenant was what is called on board ship a poor devil a phrase that is sufficiently significant and the moment a vigilant captains back is turned there is a certain ease and neglect in a vessel that has an indifferent firstlieutenant every one feels at liberty to do more as he pleases than has been his wont and where there is a divided responsibility of this nature few perform more duty than they can help when the cat is away the mice come out to play  at all events our boat continued to drop astern unobserved until the ship itself became very faintly visible to us i arose as soon as we were fifty feet from the rudder and i assumed the direction of affairs as soon as on my feet there were a mast and a luggsail in the boat and we stepped the former and set the last as soon as far enough from the speedy to be certain we could not be seen putting the helm up sufficiently to bring the wind on the quarter i then stood directly out to sea all this was accomplished in less than five minutes by means of what the french call a sudden inspiration  to be sure our situation was sufficiently awkward now we had obtained something that had the semblance of freedom neither of us had a single shilling of money or an article of clothing but those we wore there was not a mouthful of food of any sort in the boat nor a drop of water the night was lowering and intensely dark and the wind was blowing fresher than was at all desirable for a boat still we determined to persevere and we ran boldly off the land trusting our common fate to providence i hoped we might fall in with some american bound in or out should that fail us france might be reached if we had good luck in the course of less than eightandforty hours  our situation afforded nothing to occupy the mind but anxiety we could not see a hundred yards possessed no compass or any other guide on our way than the direction of the wind and were totally without the means of refreshment or shelter still we managed to sleep by turns each having entire confidence in the skill of both the others in this manner we got through the night feeling no apprehensions of being pursued the darkness affording an effectual cover  when the light returned we discovered nothing in pursuit though the weather was too thick to admit of our seeing any great distance around the boat all the morning we continued running to the northward and eastward under our single lugg reefed only keeping clear of the seas that chased us by dint of good management as for eating or drinking the first was out of the question though we began to make some little provision to slake our thirst by exposing our handkerchiefs to the drizzle in order to wring them when they should become saturated with water the coolness of the weather however and the mist contributed to prevent our suffering much and i do not know that i felt any great desire for either food or water until towards the middle of the day then we began to converse together on the subject of dinner in a jocular way however rather than with any very great longings on the subject while thus employed neb suddenly exclaimed dere a sail  sure enough a ship was meeting us heading up on the larboard tack about westnorthwest as she stretched in towards the english coast i can see that vessel in my minds eye even at this distant day she had two reefs in her topsails with spanker jib and both courses set like a craft that carried convenient rather than urgent canvass her line of sailing would take her about two hundred yards to leeward of us and my first impulse was to luff a second glance showed us she was an english frigate and we doused our lugg as soon as possible our hearts were in our mouths for the next five minutes my eye never turned from that frigate as she hove by us now rising on the summit of a sea now falling gracefully into the trough concealing everything but her spars from sight glad enough were we when she had got so far ahead as to bring us well on her weatherquarter though we did not dare set our sail again until her dark glistening hull with its line of frowning ports was shut up in the cloud of mist leaving the spot on the ocean where she had last been seen as if she were not that was one of those hairbreadth escapes that often occur to men engaged in hazardous undertakings without any direct agency of their own  our next adventure was of a more pleasing character a goodsized ship was made astern coming up channel before the wind and carrying topmast studdingsails she was an american on this point we were all agreed and placing ourselves in her track we ran off on her course knowing that she must be going quite two feet to our one in twenty minutes she passed close to us her officers and crew manifesting the greatest curiosity to learn who and what we were so dexterously did marble manage the boat that we got a rope and hauled alongside without lessening the ships way though she nearly towed us under water in the attempt the moment we could we leaped on deck abandoning the boat to its fate  we had not mistaken the character of the vessel it was a ship from james river loaded with tobacco and bound to amsterdam her master heard our story believed it and felt for us we only remained with him a week however quitting his vessel off the coast of holland to go to hamburg where i fancied my letters would have been sent and whence i knew it would be equally in our power to reach home at hamburg i was fated to meet with disappointment there was not a line for me and we found ourselves without money in a strange place i did not deem it prudent to tell our story but we agreed to ship together in some american and work our way home in the best manner we could after looking about us a little necessity compelled us to enter in the first vessel that offered this was a philadelphia ship called the schuylkill on board which i shipped as secondmate while marble and neb took the berths of foremast jacks no one questioned us as to the past and we had decided among ourselves to do our duty and keep mum we used our own names and that was the extent of our communication on the subject of our true characters  i found it a little hard to descend so much on the ladder of life but an early and capital training enabled me to act dicky over again with some credit and before the ship went to sea our chief mate was discharged for drunkenness and i got a lift marble was put in my place and from that time for the next five months things went on smoothly enough i say five months for instead of sailing for home direct the ship went to spain within the straits for a cargo of barilla which she took up to london where she got a freight for philadelphia we were all a little uneasy at finding that our story with sundry perversions and exaggerations were in the english papers but by the time we reached england it was forgotten having been crowded out by the occurrence of new events of interest at a moment when every week was teeming with incidents that passed into history  nevertheless i was glad when we left england and i once more found myself on the high seas homeward bound my wages had enabled me as well as marble and neb to get new outfits suited to our present stations and we sailed for philadelphia with as good a stock of necessaries as usually fall to the lot of men in our respective positions these were all that remained to me of a ship and cargo that were worth between eighty and ninety thousand dollars  the passage proved to be very long but we reached the capes of the delaware at last on the 7th september 1804 or when i wanted a few weeks of being threeandtwenty i landed on the wharves of what was then the largest town in america a ruined and disappointed man still i kept up my spirits leaving my companions in ignorance of the extent of my misfortunes we remained a few days to discharge the cargo when we were all three paid off neb who had passed on board the schuylkill for a free black brought me his wages and when we had thrown our joint stock into a common bag it was found to amount to the sum of one hundred and thirtytwo dollars with this money then we prepared to turn our faces north marble anxious to meet his mother and little kitty neb desirous of again seeing chloe and i to meet my principal creditor john wallingford and to gain some tidings of mr hardinge and lucy    chapter xxvi            you think ill weep   no ill not weep   i have full cause of weeping but this heart   shall break into a hundred thousand flaws   or ere ill weep    lear   i pass over the manner and time of our being on the road between philadelphia and new york as things belonging to a former age and to be forgotten i will merely say that we travelled the south amboy road and went through a part of the world called featherbed lane that causes my bones to ache even now in recollection at south amboy we got on board a sloop or packet and entered the bay of new york by the passage of the kills landing near whitehall we were superintending the placing of our chests on a cart when some one caught my hand and exclaimed  god bless mecaptain wallingford come to life as i live  it was old jared jones the man who had been miller at clawbonny from my infancy to the day i left home i had supposed him to be at work there still but the look he gave methe tears that i could see were forcing themselves from his eyeshis whole manner indeedgave me at once to understand that all was not right my countenance rather than my tongue demanded an explanation jared understood me and we walked together towards the battery leaving marble and neb to proceed with the luggage to the modest lodgings in which we had proposed to hide ourselves until i had time to look about mea house frequented by moses for many years  you perceive i do not return home jared in precisely the condition in which i went abroad my ship and cargo are both lost and i come among you now a poor man i fear  we were afraid that something of the sort must have happened or such bad news would never have reached clawbonny sir some of your men got back months ago and they brought the tidings that the dawn was captivated by the english from that hour i think mr hardinge gave the matter up the worst news however for usthat of your death exceptedwas that of the mortgage on clawbonny  the mortgage on clawbonny has anything been done in connection with that  lord bless you my dear mr miles it has been foreclosed under the statue i believe they call it and it was advertised to be sold three months then when it was sold how much do you think the place mill and all actually brought just give a guess sir  brought clawbonny is then sold and i am no longer the owner of my fathers house  sold sir and we have been sent adriftniggers and all they said the freedomlaws would soon let all the older blacks be their own masters and as to the young uns why your creditors might sell their times but mr hardinge put the poor critturs into houses near the rectory and they work about among the neighbours until things are settled its to their credit mr miles that not one of em all thinks of runnin away with the feelin thats up in the country consarnin blacks and no master to look arter them every one of em might be off without risk  and chloe my sisters own girl what has become of chloe jared  why i believe miss lucy has tuck her miss lucy is dreadful rich as all allow and she has put it in her fathers power to take care of all the moveables every huff hoof of living thing that was on the place has been put on the wright farm in readiness for their owner should he ever come to claim them  has miss hardinge had the consideration to hire that farm with such an object  they say she has bought it out of the savings of her income it seems she is mistress of her income though under age and this is the use she has made of some of her money  i had supposed she would have been married by this time mr drewett was thought to be engaged to her when i sailed  yes there is much talk about that through the country but they say miss lucy will never marry until she has been of age a few weeks in order that she may do what she pleases with her money afore a husband can lay his hand on it mr rupert is married i spose you heard sirand living away like a nabob with his bride in one of the best houses in town some people say that he has a right in a part of old mrs bradforts estate which he will get as soon as miss lucy comes of age  i did not like to pursue this part of the discourse any further though it was balm to my wounds to hear these tidings of lucy the subject was too sacred however to be discussed with such a commentator and i turned the discourse to clawbonny and the reports that might have circulated there concerning myself green told me all he knew which was briefly as follows  it seems that the secondmate of the dawn and such of her crew as had been put in the speedy and who had not been impressed either in the frigate itself or in england after they were turned ashore had found their way home bringing with them an account of the capture of the ship her extraordinary appearance near the four combatants and their own attempt to escape this last affair in particular had made some noise in the journalsa warm discussion having taken place on the subject of the right of americans to run away with an english manofwars boat under the circumstances in which these poor fellows had found themselves placed in that day parties in america took as lively an interest in the wars of europe as if the country were a belligerent and politicians or quasi statesmen were little more than retailers of the most ultra english and ultra french opinions it was sufficient for the federalists to justify any act if england did it while the democrats had almost as strong a disposition to defend all the enormities which the policy of napoleon led him to commit i say almostfor to deal honestly with posterity i do not think the frenchamerican party was quite as french as the englishamerican party was english these last had returned to their provincial dependence of thought and wellread in the english version of all political and moral truths and little read in those of any other state of society they believed as he who worships at a distance from the shrine is known implicitly to yield his faith the english party had actually a foundation in deeplyrooted opinion and colonial admiration for the ancient seat of power whereas the french owed its existence principally to opposition the alliance of 1778 had some little influence among men old enough to have been active in the events of the revolution it is true but they existed as exceptions even in their own party it was the english feeling that was natural hearty dependent and deep the other having been as has just been stated rooted as much in opposition as in any other soil  the public discussions of the fate of the dawn as a matter of course had drawn much speculation among my acquaintances to my own as month passed after month and no letters reached america the opinion became very general that the vessel was lost at length a ship from jamaica brought in a blind story of the manner in which i had retaken my vessel from sennit and it now being known that we were only four left in the vessel the conjecture was hazarded that we had been wrecked for want of force to take care of the ship and i was set down as a drowned man  shortly after this opinion of my fate became general among my acquaintances john wallingford had appeared at clawbonny he made no change however spoke kindly to every one told the slaves nothing should be altered and gave them every reason to suppose that they would continue under a true wallingford régime it was generally understood he was to be my heir and no one saw any occasion for the acts of violence that succeeded  but two months after john wallingfords visit mr hardinge and all connected with clawbonny had been astounded by the intelligence of the existence of the mortgage a foreclosure under the statute or statue as jared had called it was commenced and a few months later the place was publicly sold at kingston none bidding more than five thousand dollars for it less than a sixth of its worth this sacrifice of real estate however under forced sales was and is common enough in america especially it being generally understood that the creditor is prepared to rise in his bids as necessity presents in my case there was no one to protect my rights mr hardinge having attended the sale prepared to reason with my cousin on the propriety and generosity of his course rather than prepared with good current coin to extinguish the claim john wallingford did not appear however and the sale took place without further competition than one bid of mr hardinges a bid that he was not properly prepared to make but which he hazarded on his knowledge of lucys means and disposition a man of the name of daggett a relative of john wallingfords by his mothers side was the ostensible purchaser and now professed to be the owner of my paternal acres it was he who had taken possession under the purchase had dismissed the negroes and sent off the personal property and he it was who had placed new servants on the farm and in the mill to the surprise of everybody john wallingford had not appeared in the transaction though it was understood he had a legal right to all my remaining effects in the event of my real death no will was proved or produced however nor was anything heard of or concerning my cousin mr daggett was a close and reserved man and nothing could be learned on the subject from him his right to clawbonny could not be disputed and after consulting counsel in the premises mr hardinge himself had been compelled reluctantly to admit it such was the substance of what i gleaned from the miller in a random sort of conversation that lasted an hour of course much remained to be explained but i had learned enough to know that i was virtually a beggar as to means whatever i might be in feeling  when i parted from jared i gave him my address and we were to meet again next day the old man felt an interest in me that was soothing to my feelings and i wished to glean all i could from him more especially concerning lucy and mr hardinge i now followed marble and neb to the boardinghouse one frequented by masters and mates of ships the masters being of the humble class to condescend thus to mingle with their subordinates we consumed the rest of the morning in establishing ourselves in our rooms and in putting on our best roundabouts for i was not the owner of a coat that had skirts to it unless indeed there might be a few old garments of that sort among the effects that had been removed from clawbonny to the wright farm notwithstanding this defect in my wardrobe i would not have the reader suppose i made a mean or a disagreeable appearance on the contrary standing as i did six feel one in my shoes attired in a neat blue roundabout of mates cloth with a pair of quarterdeck trowsers a clean white shirt a black silk handkerchief and a vest of a pretty but modest pattern i was not at all ashamed to be seen i had come from england a country in which clothes are both good and cheap and a trimmerlooking tar than i then was seldom showed himself in the lower part of the town  marble and i had dined and were preparing to sally forth on a walk up broadway when i saw a meagre careworn biliouslooking sort of a person enter the house and proceed towards the bar evidently with an inquiry concerning some of the inmates the bartender pointed at once to me when the stranger approached and with a species of confidence that seemed to proclaim that he fancied news to be the great end of life and that all who were engaged in its dissemination were privileged beings he announced himself as colonel warbler the editor of the new york republican freeman i asked the gentleman into the common sittingroom when the following dialogue took place between us  we have just heard of your arrival captain wallingford commenced the colonel all new york editors of a certain calibre seeming to be exofficio of that bloodandthunder rank and are impatient to place you as it might be rectus in curiâ before the nation your case excited a good deal of feeling some months since and the public mind may be said to be prepared to learn the whole story or in a happy condition to indulge in further excitement if you will have the goodness to furnish me with the outlines sir coolly producing pen ink and paper without further ceremony and preparing to write i promise you that the whole narrative shall appear in the freeman of tomorrow related in a manner of which you shall have no reason to complain the caption is already written and if you please i will read it to you before we go any further then without waiting to ascertain whether i did or did not please to hear him the colonel incontinently commenced reading what he called his caption  in the schuylkill arrived lately at philadelphia came passenger our esteemed fellowcitizen captain miles wallingfordin 1804 everybody had not got to be esquires even the editors not yet assuming that title of gentility ex officio this gentlemans wrongs have already been laid before our readers from his own mouth we learn the following outline of the vile and illegal manner in which he has been treated by an english manofwar called the speedy commanded by a sprig of nobility yclepped lordi have left a blank for the namean account which will awaken in the bosom of every truehearted american sentiments of horror and feelings of indignation at this new instance of british faith and british insolence on the highseas it will be seen by this account that not satisfied with impressing all his crew and in otherwise maltreating them this scion of aristocracy has violated every article of the treaty between the two countries as respects captain wallingford himself and otherwise trodden on every principle of honour in a wordset at naught all the commandments of god we trust there will be found no man or set of men in the country to defend such outrageous conduct and that even the minions of england employed around the federal presses of our country will be ready to join with us on this occasion in denouncing british aggression and british usurpation there sir i trust that is quite to your liking  it is a little ex parte colonel as i have quite as much complaint to make of french as of english aggression having been twice captured once by an english frigate and again by a french privateer i prefer to tell the whole story if i am to tell any of it  certainly sir we wish to relate all the enormities of which these arrogant english were guilty  i believe that in capturing my ship the english commander did me an act of great injustice and was the cause of my ruin  stop sir if you please interrupted colonel warbler writing with rapidity and zeal and thus caused the ruin of an industrious and honest man ay that ends a period beautifullywell sir proceed  but i have no personal ill treatment to complain of and the act of the french was of precisely the same character perhaps worse as i had got rid of the english prizecrew when the frenchman captured us in his turn and prevented our obtaining shelter and a new crew in france colonel warbler listened with cold indifference not a line would he write against the french belonging to a very extensive school of disseminators of news who fancy it is a part of their high vocation to tell just as much or just as little of any transaction as may happen to suit their own purposes i pressed the injuries i had received from the french on my visitor so much the more warmly on account of the reluctance he manifested to publish it but all to no purpose next morning the republican freeman contained just such an account of the affair as comported with the consistency of that independent and manly journal not a word being said about the french privateer while the account of the proceedings of the english frigate was embellished with sundry facts and epithets that must have been obtained from colonel warblers general stock in trade as it was certainly not derived from me  as soon as i got rid of this gentleman which was not long after he discovered my desire to press the delinquency of the french on his notice marble and i left the house on the original design of strolling up broadway and of looking at the changes produced by time we had actually got a square when i felt some one touch my elbow turning i found it was an utter stranger with a very eager wondermongering sort of a countenance and who was a good deal out of breath with running  your pardon sir the bartender of the house where you lodge tells me you are captain wallingford i bowed an assent foreseeing another application for facts  well sir i hope youll excuse the liberty i am taking on account of its object i represent the public which is ever anxious to obtain the earliest information on all matters of general concernment and i feel emboldened by duty to introduce myselfcolonel positive of the federal truth teller a journal that your honoured father once did us the favour to takewe have this moment heard of the atrocities committed on you captain wallingford by a brigand of a french piratical picarooning plundering vagabond reading from what i dare say was another caption prepared for the other side of the question a fresh instance of gallic aggression and republican jacobinical insolence atrocities that are of a character to awaken the indignation of every rightthinking american and which can only find abettors among that portion of the community which possessing nothing is never slow to sympathize in the success of this robber though it be at the expense of american rights and american prosperity  as soon as col positive had read this much he stopped to take breath looking at me as if expecting some exclamations of admiration and delight  i have suffered by means of what i conceive to be a perfectly unauthorized act of a french privateer col positive i replied but this wrong would not have been done me had i not suffered previously by what i conceive to be an equally unjustifiable act of the english frigate the speedy commanded by captain lord harry dermond a son of the irish marquis of thole  bless me sir this is very extraordinary an english frigate did you say it is very unusual for the vessels of that just nation ever to be guilty of an aggression particularly as our common language common descent saxon ancestors and saxon english and all that sort of thing you know operate against it whereas sorry i am to say each new arrival brings us some fresh instance of the atrocities of the myrmidons of this upstart emperor of the french a man sir whose deeds sir have never been paralleled since the day of nero caligula and all the other tyrants of antiquity if you will favour me captain wallingford with a few of the particulars of this last atrocity of bonaparte i promise you it shall be circulated far and near and that in a way to defy the malignant and corrupt perversions of any man or set of men  i had the cruelty to refuse compliance it made no difference however for next day the federal truth teller had an account of the matter that was probably about as accurate as if i had related all the events myself and which was also about as true as most of the jeremiads of the journals that are intended for brilliant effect it was read with avidity by all the federalists of america while its counterpart in the republican freeman passed pari passu through all the democratic papers and was devoured with a similar appetite by the whole of that side of the question this distinction i afterwards ascertained was made by nearly the whole country if a federalist was my auditor he would listen all day to that part of my story which related to the capture by the french privateer while it was vice versâ with the democrats most of the merchants being federalists and the english having so much more connection with my narrative than the french i soon found i was making myself exceedingly unpopular by speaking on the subject at all nor was it long before a story got in circulation that i was nothing but a runaway english deserter myselfi the fifth miles of my name at clawbonny as for marble men were ready to swear he had robbed his captain and got off from an english twodecker only four years before it is unnecessary to tell people of the world the manner in which stories to the prejudice of an unpopular man are fabricated and with what industry they are circulated so i shall leave the reader to imagine what would have been our fate had we not possessed the prudence to cease dwelling on our wrongs instead of thinking of appealing to the authorities of my country for redress i felt myself fortunate in having the whole affair forgotten as soon as possible leaving me some small portion of character  i confess while returning home i had sometimes fancied i might be protected by the country of which i was a native for which i had fought and to which i paid taxes but i was only threeandtwenty and did not then understand the workings of laws particularly in a state of society that submits to have its most important interests under foreign control had i received a wrong from only a frenchman or an englishman i should have fared a little better in appearance at least though my money was irretrievably gone for one political party or the other as the case might have been would have held me up to ex parte sympathy so long as it suited its purposes or until the novelty of some new case offered an inducement to supplant me but i had been wronged by both belligerents and it was soon agreed by mutual consent to drop the whole subject as for redress or compensation i was never fool enough to seek it on the contrary finding how unpopular it made a man among the merchants to prove anything against great britain just at that moment i was wisely silent thus succeeding in saving my character which would otherwise have followed my property as the shortest method of making a troublesome declaimer hold his tongue  most young persons will doubtless hesitate to believe that such a state of things could ever have existed in a nation calling itself independent but in the first place it must be remembered that the passions of factions never leave their followers independent of their artifices and designs and in the next place all who knew the state of this country in 1804 must admit it was not independent in mind of either england or france facts precede thought in everything among us and public opinion was as much in arrears of the circumstances of the country then asasto what shall i liken itwhy as it is today i know no better or truer parallel i make no doubt that the same things would be acted over again were similar wrongs to be committed by the same powerful belligerents  marble was ludicrously enraged at these little instances of the want of true nationality in his countrymen he was not a man to be bullied into holding his tongue and for years afterwards he expressed his opinions on the subject of an americans losing his ship and cargo as i had lost mine without even a hope of redress with a freedom that did more credit to his sense of right than to his prudence as for myself as has just been said i never even attempted to procure justice i knew its utter hopelessness and the dawn and her cargo went with the hundreds of other ships and cargoes that were sunk in the political void created by the declaration of war in 1812  this is an unpleasant subject to me i could gladly have passed it over for it proves that the political association of this country failed in one of the greatest ends of all such associationsbut nothing is ever gained by suppressing truth on such a matter let those who read reflect on the past it may possibly have a tendency to render the future more secure giving to the american citizen in reality some of those rights which it so much accords with our habits to boast of his possessing if concealment did any good i would gladly be silent but diseases in the body politic require a bold and manly treatment even more than those in the physical system i remember the tone of the presses of the trading towns of this country on the subject of the late french treatyone of the most flagitious instances of contempt added to wrong of which history supplies an instance and will own i do not feel much encouraged to hope for any great improvement  after we got rid of colonel no 2 marble and i continued our walk we passed several persons of my acquaintance but not one of them recognised me in my present attire i was not sorry to see this as i was wearied of my story and could gladly remain in a species of incognito for a few days but new york was comparatively a small town in 1804 and everybody knew almost everybodys face who was anybody there was little real hope therefore of my escaping recognition for any great length of time  we strolled up above st pauls then a high quarter of the town and where a few houses had been erected in what was then a new and enlarged style on the stoop of one of these patrician residencesto use a word that has since come much into usei saw a fashionably pressed man standing picking his teeth with the air of its master i had nearly passed this person when an exclamation from him and his calling my mate by name caused me to stop it was rupert  marble my dear fellow why how fare you said our old shipmate descending the steps with an indolent halfcordial halfcondescending manner extending his hand at the same time which moses received and shook heartilythe sight of you reminds me of old times and salt water  mr hardinge answered my mate who knew nothing of ruperts defects beyond his want of aptitude for the sea im heartily glad to fall in with you do your father and handsome sister live here  not they old moses answered rupert still without casting his eyes on me this is my own house in which i shall be very happy to see you and to make you acquainted with my wife who is also an old acquaintance of yoursmiss emily merton that wasthe daughter of gen merton of the british army  blast the british army and blast the british navy too cried marble with more feeling than manners but for the last our old friend miles here would now be a rich man  miles rupert repeated with an astonishment that had more nature in it than had been usual with him of late years this is true then and you have not been lost at sea wallingford  i am living as you may see mr hardinge and glad of this opportunity to inquire after your father and sister  both are well i thank you the old gentleman in particular will be delighted to see you he has felt your misfortunes keenly and did all he could to avert the sad affair about clawbonny you know he could as well raise a million as raise five or ten thousand dollars and poor lucy is still a minor and can only touch her income the savings of which were insufficient just then we did all we could i can assure you wallingford but i was about commencing housekeeping and was in want of cash at the momentand you know how it is under such circumstances poor clawbonny i was exceedingly sorry when i heard of it though they say this mr daggett your successor is going to do wonders with ita capitalist they tell me and able to carry out all his plans  i am glad clawbonny has fallen into good hands since it has passed out of mine good evening mr hardinge i shall take an early opportunity to find your father and to learn the particulars  yes hell be exceedingly glad to see you wallingford and im sure it will always afford me pleasure to aid you in any way i can i fear it must be very low water with you  if having nothing to meet a balance of some twenty or thirty thousand dollars of unpaid debt is what you call low water the tide is out of my pocket certainly but i shall not despair i am young and have a noble manly profession  yes i dare say youll do remarkably well wallingford rupert answered in a patronizing manner you were always an enterprising fellow and one need have no great concern for you it would hardly be delicate to ask you to see mrs hardinge just as you arenot but what you appear uncommonly well in your roundabout but i know precisely how it is with young men when there are ladies in the case and emily is a little overrefined perhaps  yet mrs hardinge has seen me often in a roundabout and passed hours in my company when i have been dressed just as i am at this moment  ay at sea one gets used to everything at sea good evening ill bear you in mind wallingford and may do something for you i am intimate with the heads of all the principal mercantile houses and shall bear you in mind certainly good evening wallingforda word with you marble before we part  i smiled bitterlyand walked proudly from before ruperts door little did i then know that lucy was seated within thirty feet of me listening to andrew drewetts conversation and humour of the mood in which she was listening i shall have occasion to speak presently as for marble when he overtook me i was informed that rupert had stopped him in order to ascertain our addressa piece of condescension for which i had not the grace to be thankful    chapter xxvii      the weary sun hath made a golden set   and by the bright track of his fiery car   gives token of a goodly day tomorrow    shakspeare   i was quite as much surprised at my own manner towards rupert as he could be himself no doubt he ascribed it to my fallen fortune for at the commencement of the interview he was a good deal confused and his confidence rose in proportion as he fancied mine was lessened the moderation i manifested however was altogether owing to lucy whose influence on my feelings never ceased as for marble he thought all was right and was very decided in his approval of ruperts behaviour and appearance  tisnt every man that can make a seaman miles he said for its a gift that comes natrally like singing or ropedancing i dare say rupert will do very well ashore in the gentleman line though hes no great catch afloat as all will admit who ever sailed with him the lad dont want for stuff but its shore stuff ater all and that will never pass muster in blue water i dare say now this imperorgineral bonaparte would make a bloody poor shipmaster if a body was to try him  i made no answer and we strolled on until dark then we returned to our lodgings and turnedin next morning we breakfasted with the rest and i was about to set out in search of a lawyer to take his opinion on the subject of my insurance though i had little or no hope of recovering anything when i was told two gentlemen wished to see me at first sight i fancied that more editors were in quest of news but we were no sooner alone together than one of these persons let me into the secret of his errand in a way that was well enough as respects the suaviter in modo while it could not be said to be in the least deficient in the fortiter in re  i am sorry to say capt wallingford this person commenced that i have a writ to arrest you for a sum that will require very respectable bailno less than sixty thousand dollars  well done my upright cousin i muttered this is losing no time certainly i owe half that money i admit sir if my farm only sold for five thousand dollars as i hear and i suppose i am arrested for the penalty of my bond but at whose suit am i thus pursued  here the second person announced himself as the attorney of the plaintiff excusing his presence on the pretence that he hoped to be of service in amicably arranging the affair  my client is mr thomas daggett of clawbonny ulster county who holds your bonds as the administrator of the estate of the late john wallingford deceased a gentleman to whom i believe you were related  the late john wallingford is my cousin then dead  he departed this life eight months since dying quite unexpectedly letters of administration have been granted to mr daggett who is a son of his mothers sister and a principal heir the party dying intestate it is a great pity that the law excludes you from the succession being as you are of the name  my kinsman gave me reason to think i was to be his heir as it was understood he was to be mine my will in his favour was left in his hands  we are aware of that sir and your death being supposed for a considerable period it was thought your personals would descend to us in part by devise which might have prevented the necessity of taking the unpleasant step to which we are now driven the question was which died first you or your cousin and that fact you will easily understand we had no means of establishing as it is the duty of the administrator compels him to proceed with as little delay as possible  i have no alternative then but to go to gaol i know not the person on earth i can or could ask to become my bail for a sum as large as even that i justly owe to say nothing of the penalty of the bond  i am very sorry to hear this captain wallingford mr meekly the attorney very civilly replied we will walk together leaving the officer to follow perhaps the matter may be arranged amicably  with all my heart sir but before quitting this house i will discharge my bill and communicate my position to a couple of friends who are waiting in the passage  neb was one of these friends for i felt i was fast getting into a condition which rendered the friendship of even my slaves of importance to me that worthy fellow and marble joined us on a signal from me when i simply let them into the secret of my affairs  arrested said moses eyeing the sheriffs officer with sovereign contempt though he was a sturdy fellow and one who had every disposition to do his duty arrested why miles you can handle both these chaps yourself and with nebs and my assistance could work em up into spunyarn without a winch  that may be true moses but i cannot handle the law even with your powerful aid nor should i wish to if i could i am bound to gaol my friendshaving no bailso  bail why ill be your bail and if you want two theres neb  i fancy the gentleman dont much understand being taken on a writ the attorney simpered  i not understand it thats a bloody poor guess of yourn my friendwhen we had the scrape with the hamburghers in philadelphyits now coming thirty years  never mind all that just now moses i wish you to pay my bill here give neb the small bag of my clothes to bring up to the gaol and keep my other effects under your own care of course you will come to see me byand bye but i now order you not to follow us  i then left the house with a rapidity that gave the officer some uneasiness i believe once in the street however my pace became more moderate and dropping alongside of the attorney we fell into discourse on the subject of the arrangement  to be frank with you captain wallingford said meekly my client never expects to recover the full amount of his demand it being understood your personals are now limited to certain jewelry the stock of your late farm a few negroes a sloop some furniture c no sir we do not expect to obtain the whole of our demand certain securities in our hands will extinguish much of it though a large balance will remain  as mr daggett has already got real estate richly worth fiveandthirty thousand dollars and which brings a clear two thousand ayearto say nothing of its advantages as a residencebesides bonds and mortgages for twenty odd thousand more i am fully sensible of his moderation the forty thousand dollars i owed my cousin will be amply repaid to his heirs though i pass my life in jail  you misapprehend the affair entirely mr daggett does not hold clawbonny as administrator at all but as a purchaser under a mortgage sale he did not buy it himself of course but has received a deed from a nephew of his who was a bond fide bidder the amount bidfive thousand two hundred and fifty dollarsis duly endorsed on your bond and you have credit for it if no one bid higher the property had to go  yes sir i very well understand how property goes in the absence of the debtor at forced sales but what is the nature of the proposition you intend to make  mr daggett understands you possess some very valuable pearls that are supposed to be worth one thousand dollars with a good deal of plate c c now he proposes that you assign to the estate he represents all your personals at an appraisal when he will credit you with the amount and suspend proceedings for the balance in a wordgive you time  and what idea has mr daggett of the sum i should thus receive  he is disposed to be liberal and thinks you might get credit for about four thousand dollars  my personal property including the pearls of which you speak quite a thousand dollars worth of plate even at the price of old silver the sloop the stock horses carriages farming utensils and without counting the slaves all of whom i intend to set free if the law will allow it must nearly or quite double that sum sir unless mr daggett is disposed to raise his views of the value of my effects i should prefer to remain in custody and see what i can do by private sale as he will receive every cent of the securities received from my sisters estate quite 22000 and now possesses more than 5000 from clawbonny the balance i shall really owe cannot exceed 13000  were you to confess judgment sir and leave the property under execution  ill do nothing of the sort mr meeklyon that subject my mind is made up one forced sale is quite enough for a novice  we shall soon reach the jail sirperhaps its sight may  it will not sir whenever mr daggett shall be disposed to receive my property at a just valuation i may be ready to arrange the matter with him for i have no disposition to deny the debt or to avoid its payment but as he has adopted his own mode of proceeding i am ready to abide by it good morning mr meekly i see no use in your accompanying me any further  i was thus decided because i saw i had to deal with an extortioner a rogue himself mr daggett was afraid i might get rid of my personal property before he could issue an execution by the regular mode and he anticipated frightening or constraining me into an arrangement it would be my business to disappoint him and i assumed an air of confidence that soon shook off my companion a few minutes later the key of the old stone debtors jail was turned upon me i had a little money and reluctant to be shut up with the company i found in the building i succeeded in procuring a small illfurnished room to myself  these preliminaries were hardly settled when neb was admitted with the bag the poor fellow had been in tears for he not only felt for me but he felt for the disgrace and misfortune which had alighted on the whole clawbonny stock he had yet to learn that the place itself was gone and i shrank from telling him the fact for to his simple mind it would be like forcing body and soul asunder all the negroes considered themselves as a part of clawbonny and a separation must have appeared in their eyes like some natural convulsion neb brought me a letter it was sealed with wax and bore the impression of the hardinge arms there was also an envelop and the address had been written by rupert in short everything about this letter denoted ease fashion fastidiousness and the observance of forms i lost no time in reading the contents which i copy verbatim    broadway wednesday morning    dear wallingford    it has just occurred to me that the enclosed may be of service to you   and i reproach myself for not having bethought me of your probable   necessities when i saw you i regret it is not in my power to ask you to   dine with me en famille today but mrs hardinge has company and   we are engaged out every other day this week i shall fall in with you   again some day however when i hope to be less engaged lucy has just   heard of your safety and arrival and has gone to write a note to my   father who will be glad to learn you are still in the land of the   living the general who lives with us desires to be mentioned and   hopes when he returns to england it may be as your passenger adieu   dear wallingford i shall never forget our boyish pranks which i dare   say sometimes cause you to smile    yours c    rupert hardinge  this letter contained a banknote for twenty dollars yes the man to whom i had given twenty thousand dollars sent me in my distress this generous donation to relieve my wants i need hardly say i sent the banknote back to him by the hands of neb on the instant with a cold note of acknowledgment i had no occasion for his charity at least  i passed a most uncomfortable hour alone after neb was gone then a turnkey came to inform me that a gentleman and ladya clergyman he believedwere in the private parlour and wished to see me it was doubtless mr hardingecould his companion be lucy i was too anxious too eager to lose any time and rushing toward the room was at once admitted there they werelucy and her father neb had seen chloe in calling at ruperts doorhad heard much and told much mr hardinge was on the point of going in quest of me but learning where i was he had barely given his daughter time to put on a hat and shawl and conducting her across the park brought her himself to visit me in prison i saw at a glance that lucy was dreadfully agitated that she was pale though still handsomer than ever and that she was lucy herself in character as in person  miles my dear dear boy cried the good old divine folding me in his arms for this mercy may god alone receive the praise everybody gave you up but lucy and myself and we could not would not believe you too were lost to us for ever  as my former guardian still clasped me to his bosom as if i still remained a child i could perceive that dear lucy was weeping as if ready to break her heart then she looked up and tried to smile though i could see the effort was made solely on my account i caught her extended hand and kissed it over and over again the dear dear girl trembled in every fibre of her body  all my misfortunes are forgotten i cried in finding you thus in finding you unchanged in finding you still lucy hardinge  i scarce knew what i was uttering though i saw lucys face was covered with blushes and that a smile which i found of inexplicable signification now rose readily enough to her beautiful mouth on the whole i think there must have been some eight or ten minutes during which neither of the three knew particularly well what was said or done lucy was both smiles and tears though keen anxiety to know what had occurred and how i came to be in gaol was strongly expressed in her countenance as well as in some of her words as for myself i was beside myself and acted like a fool  after a time we were all seated when i narrated the manner in which i had lost my ship and the reason why clawbonny had been sold and why i supposed i was thus arrested  i am glad my cousin john wallingford had no concern with these transactions though i deeply regret the reason why my bond has passed into other hands it would have rendered my misfortunes still harder to be borne could i suppose that a kinsman had laid so deep a plot to ruin me under the semblance of kindness his death however sets that point at rest  i do not like his talking of making you his heir and neglecting to do it rejoined mr hardinge men should never promise and forget to redeem their words it has a suspicious look  lucy had not spoken the whole time i was relating my story her serene eye beamed on me in a way to betray the interest she felt but not a syllable escaped her until her father had made the observation just given  it is of no moment now she then said what may have been the motive of mr john wallingford with miles i thought him a rough but an honest man but honest men may be pardoned for not foreseeing their own sudden deaths the question now my dear father is how miles can be got out of this wretched place in the shortest possible time  ay miles my dear boy heaven forbid you should sleep in such a spot how shall we go to work  i am afraid sir i shall sleep many nights here the debt i really owe is about thirteen thousand dollars and the writ i believe is issued for the entire penalty of the bond as the motive for arresting me is probably to drive me into a compromise by confessing judgment and giving up my personal property to be sacrificed as clawbonny has been it is not probable that bail for a less amount than the law allows the plaintiff to claim will be received i do not know the man who will become surety for me in that amount  well i know tworupert and myself  the idea of receiving such a favour from rupert was particularly unpleasant to me and i saw by the expression of lucys face that she entered into my feelings  i am afraid sir i said after thanking mr hardinge by a warm pressure of the hand that you are not rich enough the deputy sheriff has told me he has instructions to be rigid about the bail and i apprehend neither you nor rupert can swear he is worth fifty thousand dollars  bless mebless me is that really necessary miles  if required i believe the law insists on security to the amount of the judgment claimed rupert lives largely i see and yet i doubt if he would be willing to swear to that  mr hardinges face became very sorrowful and he paused a moment before answering  i am not in ruperts secrets neither is lucy he then said i hope all is right though the thought that he might possibly play has sometimes crossed my anxious mind he is married to miss merton has purchased and furnished a broadway house and is living at a large rate when i spoke to him on the subject he asked me if i thought english ladies of condition gave empty hands in marriage i dont know how it is my dear miles but i always fancied that the mertons had nothing but the colonels salary to live on  major merton i answered laying an emphasis on the brevet rank the worthy individual actually possessed major merton has told me as much as this himself  mr hardinge actually groaned and i saw that lucy turned pale as death the former had no knowledge of the true character of his son but he had all the apprehensions that a father would naturally feel under such circumstances i saw the necessitynay the humanity of relieving both  you know me too well my dear guardianexcellent lucyto think that i would deliberately deceive either of you what i now tell you is to prevent rupert from being too harshly judged i know whence rupert derived a large sum of money previously to my sailing it was legally obtained and is or was rightfully his i do not say it was large enough long to maintain him in the style in which he lives but it can so maintain him a few years you need fear neither cards nor positive dishonesty rupert has no disposition for either he dislikes the first and is too prudent for the last  god be thanked for this the divine exclaimed devoutly i had really frightened myself with my own folly so so master rupert you have been making money and holding your peace well i like his modesty rupert is clever miles and i trust will one day take an honourable station at the bar his marriage has been a little too early for one of his means perhaps but i feel encouraged now that i find he can make money honourably and legally and justly  i had said nothing of the honourable or the just but what weakness will not parental affection encourage as for lucy her countenance told me she suspected the truth never before had i seen on those usually placid and always lovely features an expression of so much humiliation for a single instant it almost amounted to anguish recovering her selfpossession however she was the first to turn the discourse to its proper channel  all this time we are forgetting miles she said it would seem father that he thinks neither you nor rupert rich enough to be his bailcan i be of any use in this way  lucy spoke firmly and in the manner of one who was beginning to be accustomed to consider herself of some account in the way of money but a bright flush suffused her face as she thus seemed to make herself of more moment than was her wontto pass out of her sex as it might be  a thousand thanks dearest lucy for the offer i said eagerly but could you become my bail i certainly would not permit it it is enough that you come to visit me here without further connecting your name with my debts a minor however cannot become security mr daggett will keep me here a few weeks when he finds i am employing agents to sell my effects i fancy he is sufficiently a rogue himself to apprehend the money will get beyond the reach of his execution and he will offer to compromise once at large i can always go to sea if not as master at least as a mate  had we been as proud as yourself miles clawbonny would have been less dear to us  it is not pride but propriety lucy to prevent you from doing a thing for which there is no necessity and which might subject you to impertinent observations no ill set about disposing of my personal property at once that will soon bring mr daggett to some sense of decency  if a minor cannot be received as bail there is no more to be said lucy answered else would i prove to you miles that i can be as obstinate as you are yourself at all events i can be a purchaser of jewels if wanting a few months of my majority fortunately i have nearly a years income on hand you see mileslucy again blushed brightly though she smiledwhat an accountant i am getting to bebut i can commence at once by purchasing your pearls they are already in my possession for safe keeping and many is the covetous glance they have received from me those precious pearls i think you valued them at three thousand dollars miles lucy continued and my father will at once pay you that sum on my behalf then send for the lawyer of your persecutor for i can call him nothing else and offer to pay that much on his demand provided he will accept my father as bail if he be the son of being you fancy him and so his acts i think prove him to be he will be glad to accept the offer  i was delighted at the readiness of resources this proved in lucy nor was the project in the least unlikely to succeed could i get four or five thousand dollars together i had no doubt daggett would accept mr hardinge for bail as it was only as surety for my appearance in court that was then required and no one could really think i would abscond and leave my old guardian in the lurch still i could not think of thus robbing lucy left to her own sense of propriety i well knew she would never dream of investing so large a sum as the pearls were really worth in ornaments for her person and the pearls were worth but little more than half the sum she had named  this will not do i answered expressing my gratitude with my eyes and no more need be said about it i cannot rob you dearest lucy because you are so ready to submit to be robbed leave me here a few days and mr meekly will come to volunteer a plan of setting me free  i have it exclaimed mr hardinge jumping up and seizing his hat lucy ill be back in fifteen minutes then well bear miles off in triumph to your own house yes yes the scheme cannot fail with a lawyer of any respectability  may i know what it is dear papa lucy asked glancing expressively towards me  why its just this ill go and find the bishop wholl do anything to oblige me and he and ill go in company to this mr meeklys office and pledge our words as divines that miles shall appear in court as the undersheriff told me would be required when all will be settled to our hearts content on my way to the bishops ill just stop in at richard harrisons office and take his opinion in the matter  well sir the notion of seeing richard harrison is a good one he may suggest something in the way of practice that will be useful to us if you could step across the way and get him to pay me a short visit i should be infinitely obliged to you i was about to take his advice on the subject of my insurance when arrested and i wish that point disposed of  mr hardinge listened attentively and then he left the room telling lucy he would be back in a few minutes it might have been an awkward situation for most young ladies thus to be left alone with a prisoner in gaol but lucy was so much accustomed to the intimacy that bound us together i do not think its peculiarities struck her at the moment when her father went out of the room she was in deep thought nor did she appear to rouse herself from it until he had been gone some little time lucy was seated but i had risen to see mr hardinge to the door of the room and was walking slowly back and forth the dear girl arose came to me took one of my hands in both her own and looked anxiously into my face for some little time ere she spoke  miles she said i will say no more of the pearls no more of my own money and will prevent all allusion to ruperts appearing in your behalf if you will accept the bail i can provide for you i know a gentleman who will accept my word as his surety who is rich enough to be received and who is under a deep obligation to you for i have often heard him say as much you may not know how ready he will be to oblige you but i do and i now ask you to give me your word you will not refuse his assistance even though he should be an utter stranger to you  how is it possible lucy that you can have any knowledge of such a person  oh you cannot imagine what a woman of business i am becoming you would not refuse me for your bail were i a man and of age miles  certainly notfeeling as i do towards you lucy i would sooner receive such a favour from you than from any human being but you are not a man thank god nor of age  then promise me the small favour of accepting this service from the person i shall send to you it would break all our hearts to think you were remaining here in gaol while we are living in luxury i will not relinquish your hand till you give me a promise  that look is sufficient lucy i promise all you can ask  so intense had the feelings of the dear girl become that she burst into tears the moment her mind was relieved and covered her face with both hands it was but a passing burst of feeling and a radiant smile soon chased every trace of sorrow from her sweet sweet countenance  now miles i am certain we shall soon have you out of this horrid place she cried and before the execution they tell us of can issue as they call it we shall have time to make some proper arrangement for you i shall be of age by that time and i can at least become your creditor instead of that odious mr daggett you would not hesitate to owe me money miles in preference to him  dearest lucy there is nothing i would not be willing to owe to you and that in preference to any other living creature not even excepting your revered and beloved father  lucy looked deeply gratified and i saw another of those inexplicable smiles lurking around her lovely mouth which almost tempted me to demand an explanation of its meaning ere there was time for this however her countenance became very very sad and she turned her tearful eyes toward me  miles i fear i understood your allusion when you spoke of ruperts money she said i feared poor sainted grace would do this and i knew you would strip yourself of every dollar to comply with her wishes i wonder the idea never occurred to me before but it is so hard to think ill of a brother i ask no questions for i see you are determined not to answer themperhaps have given a pledge to your sister to that effect but we cannot live under this disgrace and the day i am twentyone this grievous grievous wrong must be repaired i know that graces fortune had accumulated to more than twenty thousand dollars and that is a sum sufficient to pay all you owe and to leave you enough to begin the world anew  even were what you fancy true do you think i would consent to rob you to pay ruperts debts  talk not of robbery i could not exist under the degradation of thinking any of us had your money while debt and imprisonment thus hung over you there is but one thing that can possibly prevent my paying you back graces fortune the day i am of age as you will see miles  again that inexplicable smile passed over lucys face and i was resolved to ask its meaning when the approaching footstep of mr hardinge prevented it  mr harrison is not in cried the divine as he entered the room but i left a note for him telling him that his old acquaintance captain wallingford had pressing need of his services he has gone to greenwich to his country place but will be back in the course of the day and i have desired he will come to wall street the instant he can i would not blazon your misfortunes miles but the moment he arrives you shall hear from him he is an old schoolfellow of mine and will be prompt to oblige me now miss lucy i am about to release you from prison i saw a certain mr drewett walking in the direction of wallstreet and had the charity to tell him you would be at home in ten minutes  lucy arose with an alacrity i could hardly forgive the colour deepened on her face and i thought she even hurried her father away in a manner that was scarcely sufficiently reserved ere they left the room however the dear girl took an opportunity to say in a low voice remember miles i hold you strictly to your promise in one hour you shall be free    chapter xxviii      she halfenclosed me in her arms      she pressed me with a meek embrace    and bending back her head looked up      and gazed upon my face    coleridge   i saw no one for the next two hours a window of the parlour where i was permitted to remain overlooked the soidisant parkor rather manhattandisantand it was not long before i caught a glimpse of my mate and neb lying off and on or blockading the jail lest i should be secretly carried to parts unknown or some other great evil should approach me from without what these two honest and affectionate fellows meant by thus maintaining their post i did not know it is true but such was my conjecture at length neb disappeared and was absent an hour when he retained he had a coil of rope over his shoulder when the two took a station at a safe distance from my prison and began to measure off fathoms to cut knot and splice i was amused with their diligence which made no abatement until it was interrupted by myself of the manner in which that was effected i shall have occasion to speak presently  about two hours after i was left by lucy and her father a keeper came to announce another visitor i was expecting my own attorney or mr harrison but the reader will judge of my surprise when andrew drewett entered the room he was accompanied by the jailer who held a letter in his hand and who astounded me by saying  captain wallingford i have instructions here to open the door for youbail has been entered  the jailer disappeared  and this i owe to you mr drewett  i wish i could say as much with all my heart my dear sir andrew replied taking my hand and giving it a warm cordial shake but it would not be strictly true after saving my life i should not have suffered you to lie in jail for want of so small a favour as giving bail for your appearance in court certainly but would and will gladly be your special bail at the proper time let the credit fall however only where it is due miss hardinge asked me to obtain your release and her wishes are second only to my own gratitude  this was said in a frank manly manner and i wondered i had never viewed andrew drewett in a light so favourable before he had improved in person bore himself like a gentleman i now thought and was every way a pleasing wellmannered welldressed and intelligentlooking young man i could do all justice to him but pardon him lucys preference  lucy can never forget our childish intimacy i said a little confused she left me declaring an intention to do something of the sort though i confess i was not exactly prepared for this you are a man to be envied mr drewett if any man on earth is  andrew looked embarrassed he glanced at me coloured turned his look out at the window then by a vast effort seemed to regain his selfcommand  i believe i understand you wallingford he said you mean in being engaged to lucy hardinge  i can mean nothing elseall i hearall i have seenthis last act in particular tells me as much  all have then told you wrong i am not so fortunate as to possess the affections of miss hardinge and no man will gain her hand who does not first obtain her heart ay and her whole heart too  i was astounded what lucy not engaged to drewett not loving him by his own admission not likely to love him i believe andrew had no difficulty in comprehending my feelings in part for he seemed disposed to continue the subject and what was infinitely to his credit to continue it in a way that should leave no unpleasant uncertainty hanging about the real position of the dear girl  it is only quite lately he said that i have seen the great injustice that i and my family have unconsciously committed towards miss hardinge as you are an olda very old friend of hers i will be explicit with you and endeavour in some small degree to excuse myself though i feel that it can never be done fully you tell me that you have heard i was engaged to miss hardinge  unquestionably i think it was the opinion of her own father though he must have believed the promise conditional as lucy never would marry without his approbation  mr hardinge has then been strangely misled it is true mr wallingford that i have long admired miss hardinge and that i offered myself years ago i was refused from the first but lucy had the frankness to own that she was free to dispose of her hand and i persevered contrary to her advice her wishes and i may say her entreaties i think she esteems me and i know she has a strong regard for my mother who is almost as fond of her as i am myself this esteem and regard i hoped might ripen into love and my presumption has brought its own punishment it is now about six monthsi remember it was shortly after we heard of your probable lossthat i had a final conversation with her on the subject when i became convinced my prospects were hopeless since that time i have endeavoured to conquer my passion for love unrequited i suppose you know will not last for ever and i have so far succeeded as to tell you all this without feeling the pain it would once have cost me still i retain the deepest respect for miss hardinge and a single encouraging look would even now recall me i am of opinion however she intends never to marry but let us quit this place which has no longer any claim on you  i was in a state scarcely to know what i did it was comparatively little to me to learn i was free myself after so unexpectedly learning that lucy was also free lucywhom i had for years supposed to be irrevocably engaged and whom i had continued to love even against hope andrew drewett i fancied had never loved as i did or he would not have made the speech he did or his love for lucy had not been a part of his existence from boyhood as mine had certainly been while all these thoughts were passing through my mind i gave a few directions took drewetts arm and hurried out of the gaol  i confess that i respired more freely when i found myself in the open air my companion took my direction and i led him to the spot where marble and neb were still at work on their rope great was their surprise on seeing me at large and i thought the mate looked a little disappointed though he comprehended the matter at once as soon as he saw drewett  if you had only waited till night miles marble said shaking his head as one menaces neb and i would have shown that bloody gaol a seamans fashion of quitting it im almost sorry the occasion is lost for it would have done their stomachs good to wake up at two bells and find their cage empty ive half a mind to ask you to go back boy  but ive no mind to comply with the request so do me the favour to have my bag carried back to our lodgings where i intend to swing my hammock again tonightmr drewett i must hasten to thank her to whom i owe my freedomwill you accompany me  andrew excused himself and receiving my thanks once more we parted with a hearty shake of the hands i then hastened towards wall street and knocked at lucys door there were knockers to good houses in new york in 1804 a vile nuisance having been since well gotten rid of and i knocked at lucys door scarce conscious of the manner in which i had got there it was near the dinnerhour and the footman was demurring about admitting a sailorman who hardly knew what he said when a little scream from chloe who happened to see me soon disposed of my claim for an entrance  masser milemasser milei so graddat feller neb say you come homeoh masser mile now i know dat de rascal at clawbonny get druv off  this speech confident as it was a little cooled my ardour by reminding me i was a beggar in the figurative meaning of the word chloe led the way however and i was soon in the drawingroom and in the presence of the youthful mistress of the house how gloriously beautiful did lucy then appear she had dressed for dinner as usual but it was in the simplest and neatest manner her face was radiant with the pleasure of seeing me where i was and excitement had deepened the colour on her cheeks which were never pale except with emotions as for her eyes i can only describe them by the homely phrase that they danced for joy  now miles she said holding out both hands to meet me this is redeeming your pledge and behaving as you should andrew drewett was delighted with an opportunity of doing something for the man who saved his life and my only fear was of your obstinacy  after all i have heard from andrew drewett beloved lucy you never need fear anything from my obstinacy hereafter he not only has released my body from prison but he has released my spirits from the weight of a mountain by honestly confessing you do not love him  the play of roseate light on an autumnal sky at evening is not more beautiful than the changing tints that passed over lucys beautiful face she did not speak at first but so intent so inquiring was her look while at the same time it was so timid and modest that i scarce needed the question that she finally succeeded in asking  what is it you wish to say miles at length came from her in faltering tones  to ask to be permitted to keep these hands for ever not one lucy one will not satisfy a love like mine a love that has got to be interwoven with my being from having formed a part of my very existence from boyhood yes i ask for both  you have them both dear dear miles and can keep them as long as you please  even while this was in the course of utterance the hands were snatched from me to be applied to their owners face and the dear girl burst into a flood of tears i folded her in my arms seated myself at her side on a sofa and am not ashamed to say that we wept together i shall not reveal all that passed during the next quarter of an hour nor am i quite certain that i could were i to make the attempt but i well recollect my arm was around lucys slender waist at the end of that brief period what was said was not very coherent nor do i know that anybody would care to hear or read it  why have you so long delayed to tell me this miles lucy at length inquired a little reproachfully you who have had so many opportunities and might have known how it would have been received how much misery and suffering it would have saved us both  for that which it has caused you dearest i shall never forgive myself but as for that i have endured it is only too well merited but i thought you loved drewett everybody said you were to marry him even your own father believed and told me as much  poor dear papahe little knew my heart one thing however he did that would have prevented my ever marrying any one miles so long as you lived  heaven for ever bless him for that as well as for all his other good deeds what was it lucy  when we heard of the supposed loss of your ship he believed it but i did not why i did not believe what all around me thought was true is more than i can explain unless providence humanely sustained me by hope but when my father thought you dead in conversing of all your good qualities milesand he loved you almost as well as his daughter  god bless him dear old gentlemanbut what did he tell you lucy  you will never learn if you thus interrupt me miles lucy answered smiling saucily in my face though she permitted me still to hold both her hands as if i had taken possession of them literally with an intent to keep them blushing at the same time as much with happiness i thought as with the innate modesty of her nature have a little patience and i will tell you when my father thought you dead he told me the manner in which you had confessed to him the preference you felt for me and do you can you think after i was thus put in possession of such a secret i could listen to andrew drewett or to any one else  i shall not reveal what followed this speech but i may say that in the course of the next ten minutes lucy mildly reproached me again for having so long delayed my declaration  i knew you so well miles she continued smilingas for blushing that she did nearly the whole of the remainder of the dayi know you so well miles that i am afraid i should have made the declaration myself had you not found your tongue silly fellow how could you suppose i would ever love any but yousee here  she drew the locket i had given her from her dress and placed it in my hands still warm from lying near her heart i had no choice but to kiss lucy again or to kiss this locket and i did both by way of leaving no further grounds for selfreproach i say kiss her again for to own the truth i had already done so many times in that interview  at length chloe put her head in at the door having taken the precaution first to give a gentle tap to inquire if dinner should be served lucy dined at four and it was now drawing toward five  has my father come in demanded the young mistress of her attendant  not yet miss lucy but he nebber tink much of dinner miss lucy maam and masser mile been so long a sailor dat i tink he must be hungry i hear dat he hab berry hard time dis vyge miss lucytoo hard for old masser and missus son  ay you have seen neb if the truth were told miss chloe i cried and he has been charming your ear with othellotales of his risks and hardships to make you love him  i cannot say that chloe actually blushed or if she did the spectators were none the wiser for the weakness but dark as was the skin of this honesthearted girl she had most affectionate feelings and even her features could betray the emotions she entertained  de feller she exclaimedwhat miss lucy please order shall e cook dish up  we will have dinner lucy answered with a smile chloes eyes dancing with a sort of wild delight tell john to serve it mr hardinge will be home soon in all probability we shall be only us three at table  the mentioning of the table caused me to cast an eye at my dress and the sight of my mates attire neat and in truth becoming as it was to one who had no reason to be ashamed of his figure caused me to recollect my poverty and to feel one twinge at the distance that the world might fancy its own opinions placed between us as for birth my own family was too respectable and my education had been too good to leave me now any very keen regrets on such a subject in a state of society like ours but there was truly a wide chasm between the heiress of mrs bradfort and a penniless mate of a ship lucy understood me and slipping her arm through mine she walked into the library saying archly as she drew me gently along  it is a very easy thing miles to get skirts made to your roundabout  no doubt lucy but with whose money i have been in such a tumult of happiness as to have forgotten that i am a beggar that i am not a suitable match for you had i only clawbonny i should feel less humiliated with clawbonny i could feel myself entitled to some portion of the worlds consideration  we were in the library by this time lucy looked at me a moment intently and i could see she was pained at my allusion taking a little key from a cabinet where she kept it she opened a small drawer and showed me the identical gold pieces that had once been in my possession and which i had returned to her after my first voyage to sea i perceived that the pearls she had obtained under graces bequest as well as those which were my own property if i could be said to own anything were kept in the same place holding the gold in the palm of a little hand that was as soft as velvet and as white as ivory she said  you once took all i had miles and this without pretending to more than a brothers love why should you hesitate to do it again now you say you wish to become my husband  precious creature i believe you will cure me of even my silly pride then taking up the pearls i threw them on her neck where they hung in a long chain rivalling the skin with which they came in contacttherei have said these pearls should be an offering to my wife and i now make it though i scarce know how they are to be kept from the grasp of daggett  lucy kissed the pearlsi knew she did not do it on account of any love for themand tears came into her eyes i believe she had long waited to receive this gift in the precise character in which it was now received  thank you dear miles she said you see how freely i accept your gifts and why should you hesitate to receive mine as for this mr daggett it will be easy enough to get rid of his claim i shall be of age before he can bring his cause to trial as i learn then nothing will be easier than for miles wailingford to pay all his debts for by that time all that is now mine will be yours nonothis mr daggett shall not easily rob me of this precious gift  ruperti said by way of getting her answer  rupert will not influence my conduct any further than i shall insist on returning every dollar he has received from you in the name of our sainted grace but i hear my fathers voice and speaking to some other person i had hoped we should dine alone  the door of the library opened and mr hardinge entered followed by a gravelooking elderly man of respectable mien and a manner that denoted one accustomed to deal with matters of weight i knew this person at once to be richard harrison then one of the most distinguished lawyers of america and the gentleman to whom i had been carried by john wallingford when the latter pressed me to make my will mr harrison shook me cordially by the hand after saluting lucy whom he knew intimately i saw at once that something unusual was working in his mind this highly respectable advocate was a man of method and of great coolness of manner in the management of affairs and he proceeded to business at once using very little circumlocution  i have been surprised to hear that my worthy client and friend mr john wailingford is dead he observed i do not know how his decease should have escaped my notice in the papers unless it were owing to a pretty severe illness i suffered myself about the time it occurred my good friend mr hardinge told it to me for the first time only half an hour since  it is true sir i answered i understand my kinsman died eight months since  and he held your bond for forty thousand dollars at the time he died  i regret to say he did a bond secured by a mortgage on my paternal place clawbonny which has since been sold by virtue of the power contained in the clauses under the statute and sold for a song less than a fourth of its value  and you have been arrested at the suit of the administrator for the balance due on the bond  i have sir and am liberated on general bail only within an hour or two  well sir all these proceedings can be and must be set aside i have already given instructions to prepare an application to the chancellor for an injunction and unless your kinsmans administrator is a great dunce you will be in peaceable possession of clawbonny again in less than a monthif a moderately sensible man in less than twentyfour hours  you would not raise hopes that are idle mr harrison yet i do not understand how all this well can be  your kinsman mr john wallingford who was a much esteemed client of mine made a will which will i drew myself and which will being left in my possession for that purpose i now put in your hands as his sole executor by that will you will perceive that he especially forgives you the debt of forty thousand dollars and releases the claim under the mortgage but this is not all after giving some small legacies to a few of his female relatives he has left you the residuary legatee and i know enough of his affairs to be certain that you will receive an addition to your estate of more than two hundred thousand dollars john wallingford was a character but he was a moneymaking character had he lived twenty years longer he would have been one of the richest men in the state he had laid an excellent foundation but he died too soon to rear the golden structure  what a change of circumstances was here i was not only virtually released from debt but had clawbonny restored to me and was master of all i had ever owned my earnings and the money invested in the dawn excepted this last was irretrievably gone it was true but in its place i had the ample legacy of john wallingford as a compensation this legacy consisted of a large sum in the three per cents which then sold at about sixty but were subsequently paid off at par of good bank and insurance stocks bonds and mortgages and a valuable and productive real property in the western part of the state with several buildings in town in a word i was even richer than lucy and no longer need consider myself as one living on her generosity it is not difficult to believe i was made supremely happy by this news and i looked to lucy for sympathy as for the dear girl herself i do believe she felt anything but pleasure at this new accession of riches for she had a deep satisfaction in thinking that it was in her power to prove to me how completely i possessed her confidence by placing all she had in my hands nevertheless she loved clawbonny as well as i did myself and my restoration to the throne of my fathers was a subject of mutual delight  mr harrison went on to say that he had ascertained daggett was in town to conduct the expected arrangement with me on the subject of my personals and that he had already sent a messenger to his attorney to let the existence of the will be known he had consequently strong hopes of arranging matters in the course of the next twentyfour hours we were still at table in effect when the messenger came to let us know an interview was appointed at the office of this eminent counsel and we all adjourned to that place lucy excepted as soon as the cloth was removed for in that day cloths were always removed at the office we found mr daggett whom i now saw for the first time and his legal adviser already waiting for us one glance sufficed to let us into the secret of the consternation both were in for the lawer had committed himself in the course of the proceedings he had had an agency in conducting almost as much as his client  this is strange news to us mr harrison the attorney commenced though your character and reputation i will confess make it look serious is there no mistake in the matter sir  none whatever mr meekly if you will have the goodness to read this will sir you will perceive that the facts have been truly laid before your client and as to the authenticity of the document i can only say it was not only drawn up by myself under precise instructions from mr wallingfordwhich instructions i still possess in his own handwritingbut the will was copied by my client as well as signed and sealed in my presence as one of the witnesses so far as relates to the personals this will would be valid though not signed by the testator supposing no other will to exist but i flatter myself you will find everything correct as to forms  mr meekly read the will aloud from beginning to end and in returning it to me he cast a very giveitupsort of look at daggett the latter inquired with some anxiety  is there any schedule of the property accompanying the will  there is sir returned mr harrison and directions on it where to find the certificates of stock and all the other evidences of debtssuch as bonds and mortgages of the last several are in my own possession i presume the bond of this mr wallingford was kept by the testator himself as a sort of family thing  well sir you will find that none of the stock has been touched and i confess this bond with a few notes given in genessee is all that i have been able to find we have been surprised at discovering the assets to be so small  so much the better for you mr daggett knowing what i do i shall only give up the assets i hold to the executor and heir your letters of administration will be set aside as a matter of course even should you presume to oppose uswhich i should hardly think advisable  we shall not attempt it mr harrison meekly said hastily and we expect equal liberality from your client  so much for having a firstrate lawyer and a man of character on my side daggett gave the whole thing up on the spotreconveying to me clawbonny before he quitted though the sale would unquestionably be set aside and subsequently was set aside by means of an amicable suit a great deal remained to be done however and i was obliged to tear myself away from lucy in order to do it probate of the will was to be made in the distant county of genesseeand distant it was from new york in 1804 the journey that could be made to day in about thirty hours took me ten days and i spent near a month in going through the necessary forms and in otherwise settling my affairs at the west as that part of the state was then called the time however was not wasted below mr hardinge took charge of everything at clawbonny and lucys welcome lettersthree of which reached me weeklyinformed me that everything was reestablished in the house on the farm and at the mill the wallingford was set running again and all the oxen cows horses hogs c c were living in their old haunts the negroes were reinstated and clawbonny was itself again the only chants made wore for the better the occasion having been improved to paint and newvamp the house which mr daggetts parsimony had prevented him from defacing by modern alterations in a word masser mile was alone wanting to make all at the farm happy chloe had communicated her engagement to miss lucy and it was understood neb and his master were to be married about the same time as for moses he had gone up to willow cove on a leave of absence a letter received from him which now lies before me will give a better account of his proceedings and feelings than i can write myself it was in the following words viz    willow cove sept 18th 1804    captain wallingford    dear sir and my dear mileshere i have been moored head and starn   these ten days as comfortable as heart could wish in the bosom of my   family the old woman was right down glad to see me and she cried like   an alligator when she heard my story as for kitty she cried and she   laughed in the bargain but that young bright whom you may remember we   fell in with in our cruise after old van tassel has fairly hauled   alongside of my niece and she does little but laugh from morning to   night its bloody hard to lose a niece in this way just as a man finds   her but mother says i shall gain a nephew by the trade    now for old van tassel the lord will never suffer rogues to prosper   in the long run mother found the old rascals receipt given to my   father for the money years and years ago and sending for a hudson   lawyer they made the miserly cheat off with his hatches and hoist out   cargo enough to square the yards so mother considers the thing as   settled at last but i shall always regard the account as open until i   have threshed the gentleman to my hearts content the old woman got the   cash in hard dollars not understanding paper and i wasnt in the house   ten minutes before the good old soul roused a stocking out of a   drawer and began to count out the pieces to pay me off so you see   miles ive stepped into my estate again as well as yourself as for   your offer to pay me wages for the whole of last vygethis word   marble could only spell as he pronounced itits generous and thats   a good deal in these bloody dishonest times but ill not touch a   copper when a ships lost the wages are lost with her and thats law   and reason it would be hard on a marchant to have to pay wages for work   done on board a craft thats at the bottom of the ocean so no more on   that pint which well consider settled    i am delighted to learn you are to be married as soon as you get back   to clawbonny was i in your place and saw such a nice young woman   beckoning me into port id not be long in the offing thank you   heartily for the invitation to be one of the bridesmaids which is an   office my dear miles i covet and shall glory in i wish you to drop   me a line as to the rigging proper for the occasion for i would wish to   be dressed as much like the rest of the bridesmaids as possible   uniformity being always desirable in such matters a wedding is a   wedding and should be dealt with as a wedding so waiting for further   orders i remain your friend and old shipmate to command    moses van dusen marble  i do not affirm that the spelling of this letter was quite as accurate as that given in this copy but the epistle was legible and evidently gave marble a great deal of trouble as for the letters of dear lucy i forbear to copy any they were like herself however ingenuous truthful affectionate and feminine among other things she informed me that our union was to take place in st michaels that i was to meet her at the rectory and that we might proceed to clawbonny from the churchdoor she had invited rupert and emily to be present but the health of the last would prevent their accepting the invitation major or general merton as he was universally called in new york had the gout and could not be there and i was asked if it would not be advisable under all the circumstances to have the affair as private as possible my answer conveyed a cheerful compliance and a week after that was despatched i left the genessee country having successfully completed all my business no one opposed me and so far from being regarded as an intruder the world thought me the proper heir of my cousin    chapter xxix      i calmed her fears and she was calm     and told her love with virgin pride   and so i won my genevieve     my bright and beauteous bride    coleridge   by arrangement i stopped at the willow cove to pick up marble i found the honest fellow happy as the day was long but telling fearfully long and wonderful yarns of his adventures to the whole country round my old mate was substantially a man of truth but he did love to astonish knownothings he appears to have succeeded surprisingly well for the dutchmen of that neighbourhood still recount anecdotes of the achievements and sufferings of captain marvel as they usually call him though they have long ceased to think the country belongs to the united provinces  moses was glad to see me and after passing a night in the cottage of his mother we proceeded towards clawbonny in a conveyance that had been sent to willow cove to meet me it was a carriage of my own one of my own negroes acting as driver i knew the old team and will acknowledge that tears forced themselves to my eyes as i thus saw myself as it might be reinstated in my own the same feeling came powerfully over me as we drove to the summit of an elevation in the road that commanded a view of the vale and buildings of clawbonny what a moment was that in my existence i cannot say that i was born to wealth even as wealth was counted among us sixty years since but i was born to a competency until i lost my ship i had never known the humiliating sensations of poverty and the feeling that passed over my heart when i first heard that clawbonny was sold has left an impression that will last for life i looked at the houses as i passed them in the streets and remembered that i was houseless i did not pass a shop in which clothes were exposed without remembering that were my debts paid i should literally be without a coat to my back now i had my own once more and there stood the home of my ancestors for generations looking comfortable and respectable in the midst of a most inviting scene of rural quiet and loveliness the very fields seemed to welcome me beneath its roof there is no use in attempting to conceal what happened and i will honestly relate it  the road made a considerable circuit to descend the hill while a footpath led down the declivity by a shorter cut which was always taken by pedestrians making an incoherent excuse to moses and telling him to wait for me at the foot of the hill i sprang out of the carriage leaped a fence and i may add leaped out of sight in order to conceal my emotion i was no sooner lost to view than seating myself on a fragment of rock i wept like a child how long i sat there is more than i can say but the manner in which i was recalled from this paroxysm of feeling will not soon be forgotten a little hand was laid on my forehead and a soft voice uttered the word miles so near me that at the next instant i held lucy in my arms the dear girl had walked to the hill as she afterwards admitted in the expectation of seeing me pass on to clawbonny and comprehending my feelings and my behaviour could not deny herself the exquisite gratification of sharing in my emotions  it is a blessed restoration to your rights dear miles lucy at length said smiling through her tears your letters have told me that you are rich but i would rather you had clawbonny and not a cent besides than without this place you had the riches of the wealthiest man in the country yours it should have been at all events could my means have compassed it  and this lucy without my becoming your husband do you mean  lucy blushed brightly though i cannot say the sincere ingenuous girl ever looked embarrassed in avowing her preference for me after a moments pause she smiled and answered my question  i have not doubted of the result since my father gave me an account of your feelings towards me she said and that you will remember was before mr daggett had his sale women have more confidence in the affections than men i fear at least with us they are more engrossing concerns than with youfor we live for them altogether whereas you have the world constantly to occupy your thoughts i have never supposed miles wallingford would become the husband of any but lucy hardinge except on one occasion and then only for a very short period and ever since i have thought on such subjects at all i have known that lucy hardinge would nevercould never be the wife of any one but miles wallingford  and that one exception dearestthat very short period having confessed so much i am eager to know all  lucy became thoughtful and she moved the grass at her feet with the end of her parasol ere she replied  the one exception was emily merton and the short period terminated when i saw you together in your own house when i first saw emily merton i thought her more worthy of your love than i could possibly be and i fancied it impossible that you could have lived so long in a ship together without discovering each others merits but when i was placed with you both under the same roof i soon ascertained that while your imagination had been a little led aside your heart was always true to me  is this possible lucy are women really so much more discriminating so much more accurate in their opinions than us men while i was ready to hang myself for jealousy of andrew drewett did you really know that my heart was entirely yours  i was not without misgivings miles and sometimes those that were keenly painful but on the whole i will not say i felt my power but that i felt we were dear to each other  did you never suppose as your excellent father has done that we were too much like brother and sister to become loverstoo much accustomed to be dear to each other as children to submit to passion for that which i feel for you lucy i do not pretend to dignify with the name of esteem and respect and affectionit is a passion that will form the misery or happiness of my life  lucy smiled archly and again the end of her parasol played with the grass that grew around the rock on which we were seated  how could i think this for you she said when i had a contrary experience of my own constantly present miles i saw that you thought there was some difference of condition between us silly fellow and i felt persuaded you had only your own diffidence to overcome to tell your own story  and knowing and seeing all this cruel lucy why did you suffer years of cruel cruel doubt to hang over me  was it a womans part to speak miles i endeavoured to act naturallybelieve i did act naturallyand i left the rest to god blessed be his mercy i am rewarded  i folded lucy to my heart and passing a moment of sweet sympathy in the embrace we both began to talk of other things as if mutually conscious that our feelings were too highwrought for the place in which we were i inquired as to the condition of things at clawbonny and was gratified with the report everybody expected me i had no tenantry to come forth to meet menor were american tenants much addicted to such practices even when they were to be found though the miserable sophistry on the subject of landlord and tenantone of the most useful and humanizing relations of civilized lifedid not then exist among us that i am sorry to find is now getting into vogue in that day it was not thought liberty to violate the fair covenants of a lease and attempts to cheat a landed proprietor out of his rights were called cheating as they ought to beand they were called nothing else  in that day a lease in perpetuity was thought a more advantageous bargain for the tenant than a lease for a year or a term of years and men did not begin to reason as if one indulgence gave birth to a right to demand more in that day paying rent in chickens and wood and work was not fancied to be a remnant of feudality but it was regarded as a favour conferred on him who had the privilege and even now nine countrymen in ten endeavour to pay their debts in everything they can before they resort to the purse in that day the audacious sophism of calling land a monopoly in a country that probably possesses more than a hundred acres for every living soul within its limits was not broached and in that day knots of men did not set themselves up as special representatives of the whole community and interpret the laws in their own favour as if they were the first principles of the entire republic but my pen is running away with me and i must return to lucy a crisis is at hand and we are about to see the laws triumphant or acts of aggression that will far outdo all that has hitherto rested on the american name as connected with a want of faith in pecuniary transactions  should i ever continue these adventures occasions may offer to draw certain pictures of the signs of the times signs that have an ominous aspect as regards real liberty by substituting the most fearful of all tyrannies the spurious in its place god alone knows for what we are reserved but one thing is certainthere must be a serious movement backward or the nation is lost  i had no tenantry to come out and meet me but there were the blacks it is true the law was on the point of liberating these slaves leaving a few of the younger to serve for a term of years that should requite their owners for the care of their infancies and their educations but this law could not effect an immediate change in the condition of the clawbonnys the old ones did not wish to quit me and never did while it took years to loosen the tie which bound the younger portion of them to me and mine at this hour near twenty of them are living round me in cottages of mine and the service of my kitchen is entirely conducted by them lucy prepared me for a reception by these children of africa even the outcasts having united with the rest to do honour to their young master honour is not the word there was too much heart in the affair for so cold a term the negro whatever may be his faults almost always possessing an affectionate heart  at length i remembered marble and taking leave of lucy who would not let me accompany her home i threw myself down the path and found my mate cogitating in the carnage at the foot of the hill  well miles you seem to value this land of yours as a seaman does his ship cried moses before i had time to apologize for having kept him so long waiting howsomever i can enter into the feelin and a blessed one it is to get a respondentia bond off of land that belonged to a fellers grandfather next thing to being a bloody hermit i hold is to belong to nobody in a crowded world and i would not part with one kiss from little kitty or one wrinkle of my mothers for all the desert islands in the ocean come sit down now my ladwhy you look as red as a rosebud and as if you had been running up and down hill the whole time youve been absent  it is sharp work to come down such a hill as this on a trot well here i am at your side what would you wish to know  why lad ive been thinkin since you were away of the duties of a bridesmaidto his dying day moses always insisted he had acted in this capacity at my weddingfor the time draws near and i wouldnt wish to discredit you on such a festivity in the first place how am i to be dressed ive got the posy you mentioned in your letter stowed away safe in my trunk kitty made it for me last week and a goodlooking posy it was the last time i saw it  did you think of the breeches  ay ayi have them too and what is more ive had them bent somehow or other miles running under bare poles does not seem to agree with my build if theres time i should like to have a couple of bonnets fitted to the articles  those would be gaiters moses and i never heard of a bridesmaid in breeches and gaiters no youll be obliged to come out like evervbody else  well i care less for the dress than i do for the behaviour shall i be obliged to kiss miss lucy  no not exactly miss lucy but mrs bridei believe it would not be a lawful marriage without that  heaven forbid that i should lay a straw in the way of your happiness my dear boy but youll make a signal for the proper time to clear ship thenyou know i always carry a quid  i promised not to desert him in his need and moses became materially easier in his mind i do not wish the reader to suppose my mate fancied he was to act in the character of a woman at my nuptials but simply that he was to act in the character of a bridesmaid the difficulties which beset him will be best explained by his last remark on this occasion and with which i shall close this discourse had i been brought up in a decent family he said instead of having been set afloat on a tombstone matrimony wouldnt have been such unknown seas to me but you know how it is miles with a fellow that has no relations he may laugh and sing and make as much noise as he pleases and try to make others think hes in good company the whole time but after all hes nothing but a sort of bloody hermit thats travelling through life all the same as if he was left with a few pigs on a desert island makebelieve is much made use of in this world but it wont hold out to the last now of all mortal beings that i ever met with youve fallen in with her that has least of it theres some makebelieve about you miles as when you looked so bloody unconcerned all the time you were ready to die of love as i now larn for the young woman youre about to marry and mother has a little of it dear old soul when she says shes perfectly satisfied with the son the lord has given her for im not so blasted virtuous but i might be better and little kitty has lots of it when she pretends she would as soon have one kiss from me as two from young bright but as for lucy hardinge i will say that i never saw any more makebelieve about her than was becoming in a young woman  this speech proved that moses was a man of observation others might have drawn seemingly nicer shades of character but this sincerity of feeling truth of conduct and singleness of purpose formed the distinguishing traits of lucys virtues i was excessively gratified at finding that marble rightly appreciated one who was so very very dear to me and took care to let him know as much as soon as he had made his speech  we were met by the negroes at the distance of half a mile from the house neb acted as master of the ceremonies or commodore would be the better word for he actually carried a bit of swallowtail bunting that was borrowed from the sloop and there was just as much of ocean in the symbols used as comported with the honours manifested to a seaman old cupid carried the wallingfords ensign and a sort of harlequinade had been made out of marlinspikes serving mallets sailmakers palms and fids the whole was crowned with a plug of tobacco though i never used the weed except in segars neb had seen processions in town as well as in foreign countries and he took care that the present should do himself no discredit it is true that he spoke to me of it afterwards as a nigger procession and affected to hold it cheap but i could see that the fellow was as much pleased with the conceits he had got up for the occasion as he was mortified at the failure of the whole thing the failure happened in this wise no sooner did i approach near enough to the elder blacks to have my features fairly recognised than the women began to blubber and the men to toss their arms and shout masser mile masser mile thereby throwing everything into confusion at once placing feeling uppermost at the expense of law and order  to descend from the stilts that seemed indispensable to do credit to nebs imagination the manner in which i was received by these simpleminded beings was infinitely touching all the old ones shook hands with me while the younger of both sexes kept more aloof until i went to each in succession and went through the ceremony of my own accord as for the boys they rolled over on the grass while the little girls kept making curtsies and repeating welcome home to clawbonny masser mile my heart was full and i question if any european landlord ever got so warm a reception from his tenantry as i received from my slaves  and welcome i was indeed to clawbonny and most welcome was clawbonny to me in 1804 new york had still some new york feeling left in the state strangers had not completely overrun her as has since happened and new york names were honoured new york feelings had some place among us life homes firesides and the graves of our fathers not yet being treated as so many incidents in some new speculation men then loved the paternal roof and gardens lawns orchards and churchyards were regarded as something other than levels for railroads and canals streets for villages or public promenades to be called batteries or parks as might happen to suit aldermanic ambition or editorial privilege  mr hardinge met me at the gate of the little lawn took me in his arms and blessed me aloud we entered the house in silence when the good old man immediately set about showing me by ocular proof that everything was restored as effectually as i was restored myself venus accompanied us relating how dirty she had found this room how much injured that and otherwise abusing the daggetts to my hearts content their reign had been short however and a wallingford was once more master of the five structures of clawbonny i meditated a sixth even that day religiously preserving every stone that had been already laid however in my minds intention  the next day was that named by lucy as the one in which she would unite herself to me for ever no secret was made of the affair but notice had been duly given that all at clawbonny might be present i left home at ten in the morning in a very handsome carriage that had been built for the occasion accompanied by moses attired as a bridesmaid it is true his dumpy squarebuilt frame rather caricatured the shorts and silk stockings and as we sat side by side in this guise i saw his eye roaming from his own limbs to mine the peculiarity of mosess toilette was that which all may observe in men of his stamp who come out in full dress the clothes a good deal more than fit them everything is as tight as the skin and the wearer is ordinarily about as awkward in his movements and sensations as if he had gone into society in puris naturalibus that moses felt the embarrassment of this novel attire was sufficiently apparent by his looks and movements to say nothing of his speech  miles i do suppose he remarked as we trotted along that them that havent had the advantage of being brought up at home never get a fair growth now heres these legs of mine theres plenty of them but they ought to have been put in a stretcher when i was a youngster instead of being left to run about a hospital well ill sail under bare poles this once to oblige you bridemaid fashion but this is the first and last time i do such a thing dont forget to make the signal when im to kiss miss lucy  my thoughts were not exactly in the vein to enjoy the embarrassment of moses and i silenced him by promising all he asked we were not elegant enough to meet at the church but i proceeded at once to the little rectory where i found the good divine and my lovely bride had just completed their arrangements and lovely indeed was lucy in her simple but beautiful bridal attire she was unattended had none of those gay appliances about her that her condition might have rendered proper and which her fortune would so easily have commanded yet it was impossible to be in her presence without feeling the influence of her virgin mien and simple elegance her dress was a spotless but exquisitely fine india muslin well made and accurately fitting and her dark glossy hair was embellished only by one comb ornamented with pearls and wearing the usual veil as for her feet and hands they were more like those of a fairy than of one human while her countenance was filled with all the heartfelt tenderness of her honest nature around her ivory throat and over her polished shoulders hung my own necklace of pearls strung as they had been on board the crisis giving her bust an air of affluent decoration while it told a long story of distant adventure and of wellrequited affection  we had no bridesmaids marble excepted no groomsmen no other attendants than those of our respective households no person had been asked to be present for we felt that our best friends were with us when we had these dependants around us at one time i had thought of paying drewett the compliment of desiring him to be a groomsman but lucy set the project at rest by quaintly asking me how i should like to have been his attendant with the same bride as for rupert i never inquired how he satisfied the scruples of his father though the old gentleman made many apologies to me for his absence i was heartily rejoiced indeed he did not appear and i think lucy was so also  the moment i appeared in the little drawingroom of the rectory which lucys money and taste had converted into a very pretty but simple room my bright and beauteous bride arose and extended to me her longloved hand the act itself natural and usual as it was was performed in a way to denote the frankness and tenderness of her character her colour went and came a little but she said nothing without resuming her seat she quietly placed an arm in mine and turned to her father as much as to say we were ready mr hardinge led the way to the church which was but a step from the rectory and in a minute or two all stood ranged before the altar with the divine in the chancel the ceremony commenced immediately and in less than five minutes i folded lucy in my arms as my wife we had gone into the vestryroom for this part of the affair and there it was that we received the congratulations of those humble darkcoloured beings who then formed so material a portion of nearly every american family of any means  i wish you great joy and ebbery sort of happiness masser mile said old venus kissing my hand though i insisted it should be my face as had often been her practice twenty years before ah dis was a blessed day to old masser and missus could dey saw it but and i wont speak of anoder blessed saint dat be in heaven and you too my dear young missus now we all so grad it be you for we did tink a one time dat would nebber come to pass  lucy laid her own little white velvetlike hand with the wedding ring on its fourth finger into the middle of venuss hard and horny palm in the sweetest manner possible reminding all around her that she was an old friend and that she knew all the good qualities of every one who pressed forward to greet her and to wish her happiness  as soon as this part of the ceremony was over we repaired to the rectory where lucy changed her wedding robe for what i fancied was one of the prettiest demitoilette dresses i ever saw i know i am now speaking like an old fellow whose thoughts revert to the happier scenes of youth with a species of dotage but it is not often a man has an opportunity of pourtraying such a bride and wife as lucy hardinge on this occasion she removed the comb and veil as not harmonizing with the dress in which she reappeared but the necklace was worn throughout the whole of that blessed day as soon as my bride was ready mr hardinge lucy moses and myself entered the carriage and drove over to clawbonny thither all lucys wardrobe had been sent an hour before under chloes superintendence who had barely returned to the church in time to witness the ceremony  one of the most precious moments of my life was that in which i folded lucy in my arms and welcomed her to the old place as its mistress  we came very near losing it love i whispered but it is now ours unitedly and we will be in no hurry to turn our backs on it  this was in a têteatête in the family room whither i had led lucy feeling that this little ceremony was due to my wife everything around us recalled former scenes and tears were in the eyes of my bride as she gently extricated herself from my arms  let us sit down a moment miles and consult on family affairs now we are here she said smiling it may be early to begin but such old acquaintances have no need of time to discover each others wishes and good and bad qualities i agree with you heart and mind in saying we will never turn our backs on clawbonnydear dear clawbonny where we were children together miles where we knew so well and loved so well our departed graceand i hope and trust it will ever be our principal residence the countryhouse i inherit from mrs bradfort is better suited to modern tastes and habits perhaps but it can never be one half so dear to either of us i would not speak to you on this subject before miles because i wished first to give you a husbands just control over me and mine in giving you my hand but now i may and will suggest what has been passing in my mind on this subject riversedgeso was mrs bradforts countryhouse calledis a good residence and is sufficiently well furnished for any respectable family rupert and emily must live somewhere and i feel certain it cannot long be in broadway now i have thought i would reserve riversedge for their future use they can take it immediately as a summer residence for i prize one hour passed here more than twentyfour hours passed there  what rebeleven should i choose to dwell in your westchester house  you will be here miles and it is on your account that clawbonny is so dear to me the place is yoursi am yoursand all your possessions should go together  thank you dearest but will rupert be able to keep up a town and country house  the first not long for a certainty how long you know better than i when i have been your wife halfadozen years perhaps you will think me worthy of knowing the secret of the money he actually has  this was said pleasantly but it was not said without anxiety i reflected on the conditions of my secresy grace wished to keep the facts from lucy lest the noblehearted sister should awaken a feeling in the brother that might prevent her bequest from being carried into effect then she did not think lucy would ever become my wife and circumstances were changed while there was no longer a reason for concealing the truth from the present applicant at least i communicated all that had passed on the subject to mydeeplyinterested listener lucy received the facts with sorrow though they were no more than she had expected to learn  i should be covered with shame were i to hear this from any other than you miles she answered after a thoughtful pause but i know your nature too well not to feel certain that the sacrifice scarce cost you a thought and that you regretted ruperts selfforgetfulness more than the loss of the money i confess this revelation has changed all my plans for the future so far as they were connected with my brother  in what manner dearest let nothing that has happened to me influence your decisions  in so much as it affects my views of ruperts character it must miles i had intended to divide mrs bradfords fortune equally with my brother had i married any man but you i should have made this a condition of our union but you i know so well and so well know i could trust that i have found a deep satisfaction in placing myself as it might be in your power i know that all my personal property is already yours without reserve and that i can make no disposition of the real even after i come of age without your consent but i had that faith in you as to believe you would let me do as i pleased  have it still love i have neither need nor wish to interfere  no miles it would be madness to give property to one of such a character if you approve i will make rupert and emily a moderate quarterly allowance with which having the use of my countryplace they may live respectably further than that i should consider it wrong to go  it is scarcely necessary to say how much i approved of this decision or the applause i lavished on the warmhearted donor the sum was fixed at two thousand dollars a year before we left the room and the result was communicated to rupert by lucy herself in a letter written the very next day  our weddingdinner was a modest but a supremely happy meal and in the evening the blacks had a ball in a large laundry that stood a little apart and which was well enough suited to such a scene our quiet and simple festivities endured for several days the uner of neb and chloe taking place very soon after our own marriage and coming in good time to furnish an excuse for dancing the week fairly out  marble got into trowsers the day after the ceremony and then he entered into the frolic with all his heart on the whole he was relieved from being a bridesmaida sufficiently pleasant thingbut having got along so well with lucy he volunteered to act in the same capacity to chloe the offer was refused however in the following classical language  no misser marble colour is colour returned chloe yous white and wes black mattermony is a berry solemn occerpashun and there mustnt be no improper jokes at my uner with neb clawbonny    chapter xxx     this disease is beyond my practice yet i have known those which have   walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds    macbeth   the honeymoon was passed at clawbonny and many many other honeymoons that have since succeeded it i never saw a man more delighted than mr hardinge was at finding me actually his soninlaw i really believed he loved me more than he did rupert though he lived and died in ignorance of his own sons true character it would have been cruel to undeceive him and nothing particular ever occurred to bring about an éclaircissement ruperts want of principle was a negative rather than an active quality and was only rendered of account by his vanity and selfishness selfindulgence was all he aimed at and he was much too selfindulgent and shrewd to become an active rogue he would have spent lucys and my joint fortunes had they been put at his control but as they never were he was fain to limit his expenditures to such sums as we saw fit to give him with certain extra allowances extorted by his debts our intercourse was very much restricted to visits of ceremony at least on my part though lucy saw him oftener and no allusion was ever made to the past i called him mr hardinge and he called me mr wallingford rupert and miles were done with for ever between us i may as well dispose of the history of this person and his wife at once for i confess it gives me pain to speak of them even at this distance of time  rupert lived but four years after my marriage to his sister as soon as he found it necessary to give up the broadway house he accepted the use of riversedge and his sisters 2000 ayear with gratitude and managed to get along on that sum apparently down to the hour of his death it is true that i paid his debts without lucys knowledge twice in that short period and i really think he was sensible of his errors to a certain extent before his eyes were closed he left one child a daughter who survived him only a few months major mertons complaints had carried him off previously to this between this old officer and myself there had ever existed a species of cordiality and i do believe he sometimes remembered his various obligations to me and marble in a proper temper like most officials of free governments he left little or nothing behind him so that mrs hardinge was totally dependent on her late husbands friends for a support during her widowhood emily was one of those semiworldly characters that are not absolutely wanting in good qualities while there is always more or less of a certain disagreeable sort of calculation in all they do ruperts personal advantages and agreeable manners had first attracted her and believing him to be mrs bradforts heir she had gladly married him i think she lived a disappointed woman after her fathers death and i was not sorry when she let us know that she was about to change her condition as it is termed in widows parlance by marrying an elderly man who possessed the means of giving her all that money can bestow with this second or according to venuss nomenclature stephusband she went to europe and there remained dying only three years ago an amply endowed widow we kept up a civil sort of intercourse with her to the last actually passing a few weeks with her some fifteen years since in a house halfbarn halfcastle that she called a palace on one of the unrivalled lakes of italy as la signora montiera montier she was sufficiently respected finishing her career as a dowager of good reputation and who loved the pomps and vanities of this wicked world i endeavoured in this last meeting to bring to her mind divers incidents of her early life but with a singular want of success they had actually passed so far as her memory was concerned into the great gulf of time keeping company with her sins and appeared to be entirely forgot nevertheless la signora was disposed to treat me and view me with consideration as soon as she found me living in credit with money horses and carriages at command and to forget that i had been only a skipmaster she listened smilingly and with patience to what i dare say were my prolix narratives though her own recollections were so singularly impaired she did remember something about the wheelbarrow and the canal in hyde park but as for the voyage across the pacific most of the incidents had passed out of her mind to do her honour lucy wore the pearls on an occasion in which she gave a little festa to her neighbours and i ascertained she did remember them she even hinted to one of her guests in my hearing that they had been intended for her originally but we cannot command the impulses of the heart you know câra mia she added with a very selfcomplacent sort of a sigh  what of all this the cidevant emily was no more than a summary of the feelings interests and passions of millions living and dying in a narrow circle erected by her own vanities and embellished by her own contracted notions of what is the end and aim of human existence and within a sphere that she fancied respectable and refined  as for the race of the clawbonnys all the elderly members of this extensive family lived and died in my service or it might be better to say i lived in theirs venus saw several repetitions of her own charms in the offspring of neb and chloe though she pertinaciously insisted to the last that cupid as a stephusband had no legitimate connection with any of the glistening thicklipped chubby set but even closer family ties than those which bound my slaves to me are broken by the pressure of human institutions the conscript fathers of new york had long before determined that domestic slavery should not continue within their borders and one by one these younger dependants dropped off to seek their fortunes in town or in other portions of the state until few were left beside neb his consort and their immediate descendants some of these last still cling to me the parents having instilled into the children in virtue of their example and daily discourse feelings that set at naught the innovations of a changeable state of society with them clawbonny is still clawbonny and i and mine remain a race apart in their perception of things i gave neb and chloe their freedompapers the day the faithful couple were married and at once relieved their posterity from the servitude of eightandtwenty and fiveandtwenty years according to sex that might otherwise have hung over all their elder children until the law by a general sweep manumitted everybody these papers neb put in the bottom of his tobaccobox not wishing to do any discredit to a gift from me and there i accidentally saw them in rags seventeen years later not having been opened or seen by a soul as i firmly believe in all that time it is true the subsequent legislation of the state rendered all this of no moment but the procedure showed the character and disposition of the man demonstrating his resolution to stick by me to the last he has had no intention to free me whatever may have been my plans for himself and his race  i never had more than one conversation with either neb or his wife on the subject of wages and then i discovered how tender a thing it was with the fellow to place him on a level with the other hired people of my farm and household  i woner what i done masser mile dat you want to pay me wages like a hired man said neb halfdisposed to resent and halfdisposed to grieve at the proposal i was born in de family and it seem to me dat quite enough but if dat isnt enough i went to sea wid you masser mile de fuss day you go and i go ebbery time since  these words uttered a little reproachfully disposed of the matter from that hour to this the subject of wages has never been broached between us when neb wants clothes he goes and gets them and they are charged to masser mile when he wants money he comes and gets it never manifesting the least shame or reluctance but asking for all he has need of like a man chloe does the same with lucy whom she regards in addition to her having the honour to be my wife as a sort of substitute for miss grace with this honest couple mr and mrs miles wallingford of clawbonny and riversedge and union place are still nothing but masser mile and miss lucyand i once saw an english traveller take out her notebook and write something very funny i dare say when she heard chloe thus address the mother of three fine children who were hanging around her knee and calling her by that the most endearing of all appellations chloe was indifferent to the note of the traveller however still calling her mistress miss lucy though the last is now a grandmother  as for the children of the house of nebuchadnezzar truth compels me to say that they have been largely influenced by the spirit of the age and that they look on the relation that existed for more than a century between the wallingfords and the clawbonnys with eyes somewhat different from those of their parents they have begun to migrate and i am not sorry to see them go notwithstanding the tie will not be wholly broken so long as any of the older stock remain tradition leaving many of its traces among them not one has ever left my rule without my consent and i have procured places for them all as ambition or curiosity has carried them into the world  as for this new spirit of the age that is doing so much among us i am not twaddler enough to complain of all change for i know that many of these changes have had the most beneficial effects i am far from thinking that domestic slavery as it once existed at clawbonny is a picture of domestic slavery as it existed throughout the land but i do believe that the institution as it was formerly known in new york was quite as much to the disadvantage of the white man as to that of the black there was always something of the patriarchal character in one of our households previously to the change in the laws and the relation of master and slave in old permanent families in which plenty was no stranger had ever more or less of that which was respectable and endearing it is not so much in relation to the abolition spirit if it would only confine its exertions to communities over which it may happen to possess some right of control that i feel alarmed as in reference to a certain spirit which appears to think there always must be more and more change and that in connection with any specific interest whatever may have been its advancement under previous régimes nothing in social life being fully developed according to the creed of these movement philosophers now in my view of the matter the two most dangerous of all parties in a state are that which sets up conservatism as its standard and that which sets up progress the one is for preserving things of which it would be better to be rid while the other crushes all that is necessary and useful in its headlong course i now speak of these opposing principles as they are marshalled in parties opposition giving pertinacity and violence to each no sane man can doubt that in the progress of events much is produced that ought to be retained and much generated that it would be wiser to reject he alone is the safe and wise legislator who knows how and when to make the proper distinctions as for conservatism lafayette once characterized it excellently well in one of his happiest hits in the tribune gentlemen talk of the just medium juste milieu he said as if it embraced a clear political creed we all know what the just medium is as relates to any particular question it is simply the truth as it is connected with that question but when gentlemen say that they belong to the juste milieu as a party and that they intend to steer a middle course in all the public events of the day they remind me of a case like thisa man of exaggerated notions lays down the proposition that four and four make ten another of more discretion and better arithmetic combats this idea by maintaining that four and four make only eight whereupon your gentleman of the juste milieu finds himself obliged to say messieurs you are equally in the wrong the truth never lies in extremes and four and four make nine  what is true of conservatism as a principle is still more true as to the movement for it often happens in morals as well as in physics that the remedy is worse than the disease the great evil of europe in connection with interests of this nature arises from facts that have little or no influence here there radical changes have been made the very base of the social edifice having been altered while much of the ancient architecture remains in the superstructure where this is the case some errors may be pardoned in the artisans who are for reducing the whole to the simplicity of a single order but among ourselves the man who can see no end to anything earthly ever maintaining that the best always lies beyond if he live long enough to succeed may live long enough to discover that truth is always on an eminence and that the downward course is only too easy to those who rush in so headlong a manner at its goal as to suffer the impetus of the ascent to carry them past the apex a social fact cannot be carried out to demonstration like a problem in euclid the ramifications being so infinite as to reduce the results to something very like a conclusion from a multitude of interests  it is next incumbent to speak of marble he passed an entire month at clawbonny during which time he and neb rigged the grace and lucy seven different ways coming back to that in which they found her as the only rig in which she would sail no bad illustration by the way of what is too often the winding up of experiments in overdone political movements moses tried shooting which he had heard belonged to a country life and he had a sort of design to set up as a fourth or fifth class country gentleman but his legs were too short to clamber over high railfences with any comfort and he gave up the amusement in despair in the course of a trial of ten days he brought in three robins a small squirrel and a crow maintaining that he had also wounded a pigeon and frightened a whole flock of quails i have often bagged ten brace of woodcocks of a morning in the shootinggrounds of clawbonny and as many quails in their season  six weeks after our marriage lucy and i paid willow cove a visit where we passed a very pleasant week to my surprise i received a visit from squire van tassel who seemed to bear no malice marble made peace with him as soon as he paid back the amount of his fathers bond principal and interest though he always spoke of him contemptuously to me in private i must confess i was astonished at the seemingly forgiving temper of the old usurer but i was then too young to understand that there are two principles that govern mens conduct as regards their associations the one proceeding from humility and christian forgiveness and the other from an indifference to what is right i am afraid the last produces more of what is called a forgiving temper than the first men being often called vindictive when they are merely honest  marble lost his mother about a twelvemonth after we returned from our unfortunate voyage in the dawn a month or two earlier he lost his niece little kitty by a marriage with the son of neighbour bright after this he passed much of his time at clawbonny making occasional visits to us in chamber street in the winter i say in chamber street as trade soon drove us out of lucys town residence in wall street the lot on which the last once stood is still her property and is a small fortune of itself i purchased and built in chamber street in 1805 making an excellent investment in 1825 we went into bleecker street a mile higher up town in order to keep in the beau quartier and i took advantage of the scarcity of money and low prices of 1839 to take up new ground in union place very nearly a league from the point where lucy commenced as a housekeeper in the good and growing town of manhattan  after marble found himself an orphan again he complained that he was little better off than a bloody hermit at willow cove and began to talk about seeing the world all of a sudden he made his appearance at clawbonny bag and baggage and announced an intention to look for a mates berth in some east indiaman i heard his story kept him a day or two with me while i superintended the masons who were building my addition to the house which was then nearlycompleted and then we proceeded to town in company i took moses to the shipyards and carried him on board a vessel that was just receiving her spars she was coppered and copperfastened a no 1 of liveoak frame and southern pine decks c asking him how he liked her he hoped she had a good name why she is called the smudge i answered i hope you fancy it moses jerked a finger over his shoulder as much as to say he understood me and inquired where i intended to send the craft to canton with you for master i saw that my old mate was touched with this proof of confidence and that his selfesteem had so much risen with the discovery of his origin that he made no objections to the trust i did not intend to go regularly into commerce but i kept the smudge running many years always under marble and made a vast deal of money by her once she went to europe lucy and i going in her as passengers this was after the death of my dear old guardian who made such an end as became his virtuous and christian life we that is lucy and i remained abroad several years returning home in the smudge on the last voyage she ever made as belonging to me neb had often been out in the ship just to vary the scene and he came to havre in her as a matter of course when masser mile miss lucy and their two young massers and two young missuses were ready to come home i was a good deal shocked at meeting my old friend moses on this occasion for he was breaking up fast being now hard on upon seventy a time of life when most seamen are unfit for their calling moses however had held on with a determination to convey us all back to clawbonny three days after we had sailed the man of stone had to give up and take to his berth i saw that his days were numbered and felt it to be a duty to let him know his real situation it was an unpleasant office but became less so by the resigned and manly manner in which the invalid heard me it was only when i ceased speaking that he made an attempt to reply  i have known that the vyge of life was pretty near up miles he then answered for many a day when the timbers complain and the new treenails hit only decayed wood it is time to think of breaking up the hull for the crafts copper and old iron ive pretty much worn out the smudge and the smudge has pretty much worn out me i shall never see ameriky and i now give up charge of the craft to you she is your own and nobody can take better care of her i own i should like to be cased in something that once belonged to her theres the bulkhead that was taken down to alter the staterooms for your familyit would make as comfortable a coffin as a body could want  i promised the old man all should be done as he desired after a short pause it struck me the present might be a favourable moment to say a ward on the subject of the future marble was never a vicious man nor could he be called a particularly wicked man as the world goes he was thoroughly honest after making a few allowances for the peculiar opinions of seamen and his sins were principally those of omission but of religious instruction he had literally known none in early life that which he had picked up in his subsequent career was not of the most orthodox character i had often thought marble was well disposed on such subjects but opportunity was always wanting to improve this hopeful disposition accordingly i now spoke plainly to him and i could see his still keen eyes turned wistfully towards me more than once as he listened with an absorbed attention  ay ay miles he answered when i was through this may all be true enough but its rather late in the day for me to go to school ive heard most of it before in one shape or another but it always came so much in scraps and fragments that before i could bend one idee on to another so as to make any useful gear of the whole some of the pieces have slipped through my fingers howsever ive been hard at work at the good book the whole of this vyge and you know its been a long one and i must say that ive picked up a good deal that seems to me to be of the right quality now i always thought it was one of the foolishest things a man could do to forgive ones enemies my rule having been to return broadside for broadside as you must pretty well know but i now see that it is more like a kind natur to pardon than to revenge  my dear moses this is a very hopeful frame of mind carry out this feeling in all things leaning on the saviour alone for your support and your dying hour may well be the happiest of your life  theres that bloody smudge notwithstanding i hardly think it will be expected of me to look upon him as anything but a longshore pirate and a fellow to be disposed of in the shortest way possible as for old van tassel hes gone to square the yards in a part of the univarse where all his tricks will be known and i hold it to be onreasonable to carry spite agin a man beyond the grave i rather think i have altogether forgiven him though to speak the truth he desarved a ropesending  i understood marble much better than he understood himself he felt the sublime beauty of the christian morality but at the same time he felt there were certain notions so rooted in his own heart that it exceeded his power to extract them as for smudge his mind had its misgivings concerning the propriety of his own act and with the quickness of his nature sought to protest itself against its own suggestions by making an exception of that wretch as against the general mandates of god van tassel he probably could in a manner pardon the mischief having been in a measure repaired though it was a forgiveness that was strangely tinctured with his own deep contempt for the meanness of the transgressor  our conversation lasted a long time at length lucy joined in it when i thought it wisest to leave the old tar in the hands of one so well fitted by nature and education to be the instrument under the providence of god of bringing him to a more healthful view of his condition i had the ship to take care of and this was a good excuse for not interfering much with what passed between the dying man and her who might almost be termed his ministering angel i overheard many of their conferences and was present at some of their prayers as were my sons and daughters being thus enabled to understand the progress that was made and the character of the whole procedure  it was an admirable sight truly to see that still lovely woman using all the persuasion of her gentle rhetoric all the eloquence of her warm feelings and just mind devoting herself for days and days to the labour of leading such a spirit as that of marbles to entertain just and humble views of his own relation to the creator and his son the saviour of men i will not say that complete success crowned the pious efforts of the singlehearted woman it was my blessed fortune to call my wife this perhaps was not to be expected it required a power exceeding hers to guide the human heart at seventy after a seamans life to a full repentance of its sins but by the grace of god so much seemed to be accomplished as to give us all reason to hope that the seed had taken root and that the plant might grow under the guidance of that spirit in whose likeness the most lowly of the race has been created  the passage was long but very tranquil and there was ample time for all that has been related the ship was still to the eastward of the grand banks when marble ceased to converse much though it is evident his thoughts were intently musing he fell away fast and i began to look forward to his final departure as an event that might occur at any hour he did not seem to suffer but his hold of life gradually gave way and the spirit was about to take its departure purely on account of the decayed condition of the earthly tenement in which it had so long dwelt as the stork finally deserts the tottering chimney  about a week after this change my son miles came to me on deck and informed me his dear mother desired to see me in the cabin on going below i was met by lucy with a face that denoted how solemn she felt was the character of the intelligence she had to communicate  the moment is at hand dear miles she saidour old friend is about to be called away  i felt a pang at this speech though i had long expected the result many of the earlier and more adventurous years of my life passed rapidly in review before me and i found the image of the dying man blended with nearly all whatever may have been his peculiarities to me he had always been true from the hour when i first shipped as a runaway boy on board the john down to that hour moses marble had proved himself a firm and disinterested friend to miles wallingford  is he conscious i asked anxiously when i last saw him i thought his mind wandered a little  perhaps it did but he is now more collected if not entirely so there is reason to think he has at length felt some of the influence of the redeemers sacrifice for the last week the proofs of this have been increasing  no more passed between lucy and me on the subject at that time but i entered the cabin in which the cot of marble had been slung it was a spacious airy room for a ship one that had been expressly fitted by my orders for the convenience of lucy and her two daughters but which those dear selfdenying creatures had early and cheerfully given up to the possession of their old friend  as yet i have not particularly spoken of these two girls the eldest of whom was named grace and the youngest lucy at that time the first was just fifteen while her sister was two years younger by a singular coincidence grace resembled the women of my family most while the latter the dear ingenuous frank pretty little thing had so much likeness to her mother when at the same time of life that i often caught her in my arms and kissed her as she uttered some honest sentiment or laughed joyously and melodiously as had been the practice of her who bore her twenty years before on those occasions lucy would smile and sometimes a slight blush would suffuse her face for i could see she well understood the impulse which would so suddenly carry me off to the days of my boyhood and boyish affection  on the present solemn occasion both the girls were in the cabin struggling to be calm and doing all that lay in their power to solace the dying man grace the oldest was the most active and efficient of course her tender years inducing diffidence in her sister still that little image of her mother could not be kept entirely in the background when the heart and the desire to be useful were urging her to come out of herself in order to share in her sisters duties  i found marble quite sensible and the anxious manner in which he slowly examined all the interested faces that were now gathered about his bed proved how accurately he noted the present and the absent twice did he go over us all ere he spoke in the husky tones that usually precede death  call neb he saidtook leave of my mates and of all the rest of the men yesterday but i consider neb as one of the family miles and left him for the last  this i knew to be true though i purposely absented myself from a scene that i well understood would have to be repeated in my case neb was summoned accordingly not a syllable being uttered among us until the black stood just without the circle of my own wife and children moses watched the arrangement jealously and it seems he was dissatisfied at seeing his old shipmate keeping so much aloof at that solemn and absorbing moment  you are but a nigger i know neb the old seaman got out but your heart would do honour to a king its next to miless and thats as much as can be said of any mans come nearer boy none here will grudge you the liberty  little lucy drew back in an instant and fairly pulled neb into the place she herself had just before occupied  bless you for that young un said marble i didnt know your mother when she was of your age but i can see that one catblock is not more like another than you are like what she was at your age keep that likeness up my dear and then your father will be as happy and fortunate in his darter as he has been in his wife well nobody desarves his luck better than milesprovidential luck i mean my dear madam wallingford interpreting a sorrowful expression of lucys eyes aright for thanks to your teaching i now understand there is a divine director of all our fortins whether ashore or afloat black or white  there is not a sparrow falls captain marble said the gentle earnest voice of my wife that he does not note it  yes so i understand it now though once i thought little of such things thus when we were wracked in the dawn neb it was by gods will and with a design like to bring us three all on to our present fortin and present frame of mind should i ever use the word luck agin which i may be likely enough to do from habit you are all to understand i mean what i call providential luck yes madam wallingford i comprehend it parfectly and shall never forget your kindness which has been to me the best turn of providential luck that has ever happened ive sent for you neb to have a parting word and to give you the advice of an old man before i quit this world altogether  neb began to twist his fingers and i could see tears glistening in his eyes for his attachment to marble was of very long standing and of proof when men have gone through together as much as we three had experienced in company indeed the most trifling griefs of everyday life get to appear so insignificant that our connection seems to be one of a nature altogether stronger than the commoner ties  yes sah capin marble sah what please to be your wish sah asked the negro struggling to subdue his grief  to say a few words of advice neb to take leave of my friends and then to be struck off the shipping articles of life old age and hard sarvice neb has made me veer cable to the better end the stopper is working loose and a few more surges will leave the hulk adrift the case is different with you who are in your primeand a prime chap be you on a yard or at the wheel my parting advice to you neb is to hold out as youve begun i dont say youre without failins what nigger is but youre a good fellow and as sartain to be found in your place as the pumps in the first place youre a married man and though your wife is only a negress shes your wife and you must stick to her through thick and thin take your master as an example and obsarve how he loves and cherishes your mistress here lucy pressed gently closer to my side and then as to your children bring em up according to the advice of madam wallingford you can never sail under better instructions than hern as i know by experience be particular to make that hector of yours knock off from swearing hes begun and whats begun in sin is pretty sartain to have an indin talk to him first and if that wont do ropesend it out of him theres great vartue in ratlin stuff among boys as for yourself neb hold on as you have begun and the lord will have marcy on you before the vyge is up  here marble ceased from exhaustion though he made a sign to neb not to move as he had more to say after resting a little he felt under his pillow whence he produced a very old tobaccobox fumbled about until he had opened it took a small bite and shut the box again all this was done very slowly and with the uncertain feeble movements of a dying man when the lid was replaced marble held the box towards neb and resumed his address  use that for my sake neb he said it is full of excellent tobacco and the box has the scent of thirty years in itthat being the time it has sailed in my company that box has been in nine fights seven wracks and has seen more boatsarvice than most london watermen or any whitehaller of em all among other explites it has been round the world four times besides having run the straits of magellan in the dark as might be as your master and you know as well as i do take that box therefore lad and be particular always to put none but the best of pigtail in itfor its used to that only and now neb a word about a little duty youre to do for me when you get in ask your master first for leave and then go up to willow cove and carry my blessin to kitty and her children its easy done if a man sets about it in the right spirit all you have to do is to go up to the cove and say that i prayed to god to bless em all before i died do you think you can remember that  i try capin marble sahyes sah i try all i can dough im no scholar  perhaps you had better confide this office to me said the musical voice of my wife  marble was pleased and he seemed every way disposed to accept the offer  i didnt like to trouble you so much he answered though i feel grateful for the offer well then neb you may leave the blessin unsaid as your mistress is so kindhold on a bit you can give it to chloe and her little family all but hector i meanbut not to him unless he knocks off swearing as soon as he does that why let him have his share now neb give me your hand good bye boy youve been true to me and god bless you for it you are but a nigger i know but theres one in whose eyes your soul is as precious as that of many a prince and priest  neb shook hands with his old commander broke out of the circle rushed into the steerage and blubbered like a baby in the meantime marble paused to recover his own selfpossession which had been a little disturbed by the feeling manifested by the black as soon as he felt himself a little composed he hunted about his cot until he found two small paper boxes each of which contained a very pretty ring that it seemed he had purchased for this express purpose when last in port these rings he gave to my daughters who received the presents sobbing though with strong natural exhibitions of the friendly sentiments they entertained for him  your father and i have gone through many hardships and trials together he said and i love you all even more than i love my own relations i hope this is not wrong madam wallingford for its out of my power to help it ive already given my keepsakes to the boys and to your parents and i hope all of you will sometimes remember the poor old seadog that god in his wisdom threw like a waif in your way that he might be benefited by your society theres your polar star young uns pointing to my wife keep god in mind always and give to this righteous woman the second place in your hearts not that i say a word or think anything agin your father whos a glorious fellow in his way but ater all young women should copy ater their mothers when theyve such a mother as yourn the best of fathers fallin far astern in gentleness and other vartues  the girls wept freely and marble after waiting a few minutes took a solemn leave of all my children desiring everybody but lucy and myself to quit the cabin an hour passed in discourse with us two during which moses frequently exhorted me to give ear to the pious counsels of my wife for he manifested much anxiety for the future welfare of my soul  ive generalized a great deal over that affair of smudge the whole of this vyge he continued and ive had sore misgivings consarning the explite madam wallingford however has eased my mind on that score by showing me how to lay the burthen of this with all the rest of the load of my sins on the love of christ i am resigned to go miles for it is time and im getting to be useless its wicked to wish to run a ship after her frame has worked loose and nothing now fastens me to life but you i own its hard to part and my mind has had some weakness on the matter however miles my dear boy for boy you are still in my eyes there is comfort in looking ahead go by your wifes rules and when the vyge is up we shall all find ourselves in the same haven  it gives me much happiness moses to find you in this frame of mind i answered since you must quit us you will not leave one behind of the name of wallingford that will not rejoice at this prospect for the future as for your sins god has both the power and the will to lighten you of their weight when he finds you disposed to penitence and to make use of the mediation of his blessed son if there is anything you desire to have done hereafter this is a very proper time to let me know it  ive made a will miles and youll find it in my desk there are some trifles given to you and yourn but you want not gold and the rest all goes to kitty and her children there is a pint however on which my mind is very ondetarmined and i will now lay it before you dont you think it more becoming for a seaman to be buried in blue water than to be tuckd up in a churchyard i do not like tombstones having had too much of them in arly youth and feel as if i want searoom what is your opinion miles  decide for yourself your wishes will be our law  then roll me up in my cot and launch me overboard in the old way i have sometimes thought it might be well to lie at my mothers side but shell excuse an old tar for preferring blue water to one of your country churchyards  after this i had several interviews with the old man though he said nothing more on the subject of his interment that of his property or that of his departure lucy read the bible to him two or three times every day and she prayed with him often on one occasion i heard a low sweet voice near his cot and taking a look ascertained it was my little pet my daughter lucy then only thirteen reading a second time a chapter that her mother had gone through only an hour before with some of her own remarks the comments were wanting now but the voice had the same gentle earnestness the same sweet modulations and the same impressive distinctness as that of the mother  marble lived until we had passed within the gulfstream dying easily and without a groan with all my family neb and the firstmate assembled near his cot the only thing that marked his end was a look of singular significance that he cast on my wife not a minute before he breathed his last there he lay the mere vestige of the robust hardy seaman i had once known a child in physical powers and about to make the last great change material as were the alterations in the man from what he had been when in his pride i thought the spiritual or intellectual part of his being was less to be recognised than the bodily certainly that look was full of resignation and hope and we had reason to believe that this rude but honest creature was spared long enough to complete the primary object of his existence  in obedience to his own earnest request though sorely against the feelings of my wife and daughters i buried the body of my old friend in the ocean six days before we made the land  and now it remains only to speak of lucy i have deferred this agreeable duty to the last passing over long years that were pregnant with many changes in order to conclude with this delightful theme  the first few years of my married life were years of bliss to me i lived under a constant sense of happiness a happiness that man can derive only from a union with a woman of whom his reason and principles as much approve as his tastes and passion cherish i do not mean to be understood that the years which have succeeded were a whit less happy for in a certain sense they have been more so and have gone on increasing in happiness down to the present hour but because time and use finally so far accustomed me to this intimate connection with purity virtue female disinterestedness and feminine delicacy that i should have missed them as things incorporated with my very existence had i been suddenly deprived of my wife quite as much as in the first years of my married life i enjoyed them as things hitherto unknown to me  as i ride over the fields of clawbonny even at this day i recall with tranquil delight and i trust with humble gratitude the manner in which those blessed early years of our marriage passed that was the period when every thought of mine was truly shared by lucy she accompanied me in my daily rides or drives and listened to every suggestion that fell from my lips with kind interest and the most indulgent attention rendering me back thought for thought feeling for feeling laugh for laugh and occasionally tear for tear not an emotion could become aroused in my breast that it did not meet with its reflection in hers or a sense of the ludicrous be awakened that her keen but chastened humour did not increase its effect by sympathy those were the years in which were planned and executed the largest improvements for the buildings pleasuregrounds and fields of clawbonny we built extensively not only outhouses and stables better suited to our present means and more enlarged mode of living than those which existed in my fathers time but as has been stated before we added to the dwelling preserving its pleasing confusion and irregularity of architecture after passing the first summer which succeeded our marriage in this manner i told lucy it was time to stop building and improving my own place in order that some attention might be bestowed on that she had inherited from mrs bradfort and which was also old family property  do not think of it miles she said keep riversedge in good order and no more rupert who was then living and in possession will see that nothing goes to waste but clawbonny dear clawbonny is the true home of a wallingfordand i am now a wallingford you will remember should this precious boy of ours live to become a man and marry the old westchester property can be used by him until we are ready to give him up possession here  this plan has not been literally carried out for miles my eldest son lives with us at clawbonny in the summer and his noisy boys are at this moment playing a game of ball in a field that has been expressly devoted to their amusements  the period which succeeded the first halfdozen years of my union with lucy was not less happy than the first had been though it assumed a new character our children then came into the account not as mere playthings and little beings to be most tenderly loved and cared for but as creatures that possess the image of god in their souls and whose future characters in a measure depended on our instruction the manner in which lucy governed her children and led them by gentle means to virtue and truth has always been a subject of the deepest admiration and gratitude with me her rule has been truly one of love i do not know that i ever heard her voice raised in anger to any human being much less to her own offspring but whenever reproof has come it has come in the language of interest and affection more or less qualified by severity as circumstances may have required the result has been all that our fondest hopes could have led us to anticipate  when we travelled it was with all our young people and a new era of happiness heightened by the strongest domestic affection opened on us all who have seen the world have experienced the manner in which our intellectual existences as it might be expand but no one who has not experienced it can tell the deep heartfelt satisfaction there is in receiving this enlargement of the moral creature in close association with those we love most on earth the manner in which lucy enjoyed all she saw and learned on our first visit to the other hemisphere her youngest childall four of our children were born within the first eight years of our marriageher youngest child was then long past its infancy and she had leisure to enjoy herself in increasing the happiness of her offspring she had improved her mind by reading and her historical lore in particular was always ready to be produced for the common advantage there was no ostentation in this but everything was produced just as if each had a right to its use then it was i felt the immense importance of having a companion in an intellectual sense in a wife lucy had always been intelligent but i never fully understood her superiority in this respect until we travelled together amid the teeming recollections and scenes of the old world that america is the greatest country of ancient or modern times i shall not deny everybody says it and what everybody says must be true nevertheless i will venture to hint that cæteris paribus and where there is the disposition to think at all the intellectual existence of every american who goes to europe is more than doubled in its intensity this is the country of action not of thought or speculation men follow out their facts to results instead of reasoning them out then the multiplicity of objects and events that exist in the old countries to quicken the powers of the mind has no parallel here it is owing to this want of the present and the past which causes the american the moment he becomes speculative to run into the future that future promises much and in a degree may justify the weakness let us take heed however that it do not lead to disappointment  after all i have found lucy the most dear to me and the most valuable companion since we have both passed the age of fifty air is not more transparent than her pure mind and i ever turn to it for counsel sympathy and support with a confidence and reliance that experience could alone justify as we draw nearer to the close of life i find my wife gradually loosening the ties of this world her love for her husband and children excepted and fastening her looks on a future world in thus accomplishing with a truth and nature that are unerringly accurate the great end of her being nothing repulsive nothing that is in the least tinctured with bigotry and nothing that is even alienated from the affections or her duties in life is mingled with her devotion my family like its female head has ever been deeply impressed by religion but it is religion in its most pleasing aspect religion that has no taint of puritanism and in which sin and innocent gaiety are never confounded it is the most cheerful family of my acquaintance and this i must implicitly believe solely because in addition to the bounties it enjoys under the blessing of god it draws the just distinction between those things that the word of god has prohibited and those which come from the excited and exaggerated feelings of a class of theologians who constantly preaching the doctrine of faith have regulated their moral discipline solely as if in their hearts they placed all their reliance on the efficacy of a school of good works that has had its existence in their own diseased imaginations i feel the deepest gratitude to lucy for having enstilled the most profound sense of their duties into our children while they remain totally free from cant and from those exaggerations and professions which so many mistake for piety of purer emanation  some of my readers may feel a curiosity to know how time has treated us elderly people for elderly we have certainly become as for myself i enjoy a green old age and i believe look at least ten years younger than i am this i attribute to temperance and exercise lucy was positively an attractive woman until turned of fifty retaining even a good deal of her bloom down to that period of life i think her handsome still and old neb when in a flattering humour is apt to speak of either of my daughters as his handsome young missus and of my wife as his handsome ole missus  and why should not lucy hardinge continue to retain many vestiges of those charms which rendered her so lovely in youth ingenuous pure of mind sincere truthful placid and just the soul could scarcely fail to communicate some of its blessed properties to that countenance which even now so sensitively reflects its best impulses i repeat lucy is still handsome and in my eyes even her charming daughters are less fair that she has so long been and is still my wife forms not only the delight but the pride of my life it is a blessing for which i am not ashamed to say i daily render thanks to god on my knees   the end
