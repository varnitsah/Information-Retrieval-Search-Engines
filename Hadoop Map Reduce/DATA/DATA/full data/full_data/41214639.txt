41214639	alfred tennyson  by andrew lang     introduction    in writing this brief sketch of the life of tennyson and this attempt to appreciate his work i have rested almost entirely on the biography by lord tennyson with his kind permission and on the text of the poems  as to the life doubtless current anecdotes not given in the biography are known to me and to most people  but as they must also be familiar to the author of the biography i have not thought it desirable to include what he rejected  the works of the localisers i have not read  tennyson disliked these researches as a rule and they appear to be unessential and often hazardous  the professed commentators i have not consulted  it appeared better to give ones own impressions of the poems unaffected by the impressions of others except in one or two cases where matters of fact rather than of taste seemed to be in question  thus on two or three points i have ventured to differ from a distinguished living critic and have given the reasons for my dissent  professor bradleys commentary on in memoriam 1 came out after this sketch was in print  many of the comments cited by mr bradley from his predecessors appear to justify my neglect of these curious inquirers the difficulties which they raise are not likely as a rule to present themselves to persons who read poetry for human pleasure  i have not often dwelt on parallels to be found in the works of earlier poets  in many cases tennyson deliberately reproduced passages from greek latin and old italian writers just as virgil did in the case of homer theocritus apollonius rhodius and others there are doubtless instances in which a phrase is unconsciously reproduced by automatic memory from an english poet  but i am less inclined than mr bradley to think that unconscious reminiscence is more common in tennyson than in the poets generally  i have not closely examined keats and shelley for example to see how far they were influenced by unconscious memory  but scott confessedly was apt to reproduce the phrases of others and once unwittingly borrowed from a poem by the valet of one of his friends  i believe that many of the alleged borrowings in tennyson are either no true parallels at all or are the unavoidable coincidences of expression which must inevitably occur  the poet himself stated in a lively phrase his opinion of the hunters after parallels and i confess that i am much of his mind  they often remind me of mr punchs parody on an unfriendly review of alexander smith    most women have no character at all pope no character that servant woman asked smith   i have to thank mr edmund gosse and mr vernon rendall for their kindness in reading my proofsheets  they have saved me from some errors but i may have occasionally retained matter which for one reason or another did not recommend itself to them  in no case are they responsible for the opinions expressed or for the critical estimates  they are those of a tennysonian and no doubt would be other than they are if the writer were younger than he is  it does not follow that they would necessarily be more correct though probably they would be more in vogue  the point of view must shift with each generation of readers as ideas or beliefs go in or out of fashion are accepted rejected or rehabilitated  to one age tennyson may seem weakly superstitious to another needlessly sceptical  after all what he must live by is not his opinions but his poetry  the poetry of milton survives his ideas whatever may be the fate of the ideas of tennyson his poetry must endure    chapter iboyhoodcambridgeearly poems    the life and work of tennyson present something like the normal type of what in circumstances as fortunate as mortals may expect the life and work of a modern poet ought to be  a modern poet one says because even poetry is now affected by the division of labour  we do not look to the poet for a large share in the practical activities of existence  we do not expect him like aeschylus and sophocles theognis and alcaeus to take a conspicuous part in politics and war or even as in the age of anne to shine among wits and in society life has become perhaps too specialised for such multifarious activities  indeed even in ancient days as a celtic proverb and as the picture of life in the homeric epics prove the poet was already a man apartnot foremost among statesmen and rather backward among warriors  if we agree with a not unpopular opinion the poet ought to be a kind of titanic force wrecking himself on his own passions and on the nature of things as did byron burns marlowe and musset  but tennysons career followed lines really more normal the lines of the life of wordsworth wisdom and selfcontrol directing the course of a long sane sound and fortunate existence  the great physical strength which is commonly the basis of great mental vigour was not ruined in tennyson by poverty and passion as in the case of burns nor in forced literary labour as in those of scott and dickens  for long he was poor like wordsworth and southey but never destitute  he made his early effort  he had his time of great sorrow and trial and apparent failure  with practical wisdom he conquered circumstances he became eminent he outlived reaction against his genius he died in the fulness of a happy age and of renown  this fullorbed life with not a few years of sorrow and stress is what nature seems to intend for the career of a divine minstrel  if tennyson missed the one crowded hour of glorious life he had not to be content in an age without a name  it was not tennysons lot to illustrate any modern theory of the origin of genius  born in 1809 of a lincolnshire family long connected with the soil but inconspicuous in history tennyson had nothing celtic in his blood as far as pedigrees prove  this is unfortunate for one school of theorists  his mother genius is presumed to be derived from mothers had a genius merely for moral excellence and for religion  she is described in the poem of isabel and was a remarkable and saintly woman  in the male line the family was not as the families of genius ought to be brief of life and unhealthy  the tennysons never die said the sister who was betrothed to arthur hallam  the father a clergyman was says his grandson a man of great ability and his excellent library was an element in the education of his family  my father was a poet tennyson said and could write regular verse very skilfully  in physical type the sons were tall strong and unusually dark tennyson when abroad was not taken for an englishman at home strangers thought him foreign  most of the children had the temperament and several of the sons had some of the accomplishments of genius  whence derived by way of heredity is a question beyond conjecture for the fathers accomplishment was not unusual  as walton says of the poet and the angler they were born to be so we know no more  the region in which the paternal hamlet of somersby lies a land of quiet villages large fields grey hillsides and noble talltowered churches on the lower slope of a lincolnshire wold does not appear to have been rich in romantic legend and tradition  the folklore of lincolnshire of which examples have been published does seem to have a peculiar poetry of its own but it was rather the humorous than the poetical aspect of the countrypeople that tennyson appears to have known  in brief we have nothing to inform us as to how genius came into that generation of tennysons which was born between 1807 and 1819  a source and a cause there must have been but these things are hidden except from popular science  precocity is not a sign of genius but genius is perhaps always accompanied by precocity  this is especially notable in the cases of painting music and mathematics but in the matter of literature genius may chiefly show itself in acquisition as in sir walter scott who when a boy knew much but did little that would attract notice  as a child and a boy young tennyson was remarked both for acquisition and performance  his own reminiscences of his childhood varied somewhat in detail  in one place we learn that at the age of eight he covered a slate with blank verse in the manner of jamie thomson the only poet with whom he was then acquainted  in another passage he says the first poetry that moved me was my own at five years old  when i was eight i remember making a line i thought grander than campbell or byron or scott  i rolled it out it was this    with slaughterous sons of thunder rolled the flood    great nonsense of course but i thought it fine  it was fine and was thoroughly tennysonian  scott campbell and byron probably never produced a line with the qualities of this nonsense verse  before i could read i was in the habit on a stormy day of spreading my arms to the wind and crying out i hear a voice thats speaking in the wind and the words far far away had always a strange charm for me  a late lyric has this overword far far away  a boy of eight who knew the contemporary poets was more or less precocious  tennyson also knew pope and wrote hundreds of lines in popes measure  at twelve the boy produced an epic in scotts manner of some six thousand lines  he never felt himself more truly inspired for the sense of inspiration as the late mr myers has argued in an essay on the mechanism of genius has little to do with the actual value of the product  at fourteen tennyson wrote a drama in blank verse  a chorus from this play as one guesses a piece from an unpublished drama written very early is published in the volume of 1830   the varied earth the moving heaven    the rapid waste of roving sea the fountainpregnant mountains riven    to shapes of wildest anarchy by secret fire and midnight storms    that wander round their windy cones   these lines are already tennysonian  there is the classical transcript the varied earth daedala tellus  there is the geological interest in the forces that shape the hills  there is the use of the favourite word windy and later in the piece    the troublous autumns sallow gloom   the young poet from boyhood was original in his manner  byron made him blase at fourteen  then byron died and tennyson scratched on a rock byron is dead on a day when the whole world seemed darkened for me  later he considered byrons poetry too much akin to rhetoric  byron is not an artist or a thinker or a creator in the higher sense but a strong personality he is endlessly clever and is now unduly depreciated  he did give the world another heart and new pulses and so we are kept going  but he was dominated by byron till he was seventeen when he put him away altogether  in his boyhood despite the sufferings which he endured for a while at school at louth despite bullying from big boys and masters tennyson would shout his verses to the skies  well arthur i mean to be famous he used to say to one of his brothers  he observed nature very closely by the brook and the thundering sea shores  he was never a sportsman and his angling was in the manner of the lover of the millers daughter  he was seventeen 1826 when poems by two brothers himself and his brother frederick was published with the date 1827  these poems contain as far as i have been able to discover nothing really tennysonian  what he had done in his own manner was omitted being thought too much out of the common for the public taste  the young poet had already saving commonsense and understood the public  fragments of the true gold are found in the volume of 1830 others are preserved in the biography  the ballad suggested by the bride of lammermoor was not unworthy of beddoes and that novel one cannot but think suggested the opening situation in maud where the hero is a modern master of ravenswood in his relation to the rich interloping family and the beautiful daughter  to this point we shall return  it does not appear that tennyson was conscious in maud of the suggestion from scott and the coincidence may be merely accidental  the lovers tale published in 1879 was mainly a work of the poets nineteenth year  a few copies had been printed for friends  one of these with errors of the press and without the intended alterations was pirated by an unhappy man in 1875  in old age tennyson brought out the work of his boyhood  it was written before i had ever seen shelley though it is called shelleyan he said and indeed he believed that his work had never been imitative after his earliest efforts in the manner of thomson and of scott  the only things in the lovers tale which would suggest that the poet here followed shelley are the italian scene of the story the character of the versification and the extraordinary luxuriance and exuberance of the imagery 2  as early as 1868 tennyson heard that written copies of the lovers tale were in circulation  he then remarked as to the exuberance of the piece  allowance must be made for abundance of youth  it is rich and full but there are mistakes in it    the poem is the breath of young love  how truly tennysonian the manner is may be understood even from the opening lines full of the original cadences which were to become so familiar   here far away seen from the topmost cliff filling with purple gloom the vacancies between the tufted hills the sloping seas hung in midheaven and half way down rare sails white as white clouds floated from sky to sky   the narrative in parts one and two which alone were written in youth is so choked with images and descriptions as to be almost obscure  it is the story practically of a love like that of paul and virginia but the love is not returned by the girl who prefers the friend of the narrator  like the hero of maud the speaker has a period of madness and illusion while the third part the golden suppersuggested by a story of boccaccio and written in maturity is put in the mouth of another narrator and is in a different style the discarded lover visiting the vault which contains the body of his lady finds her alive and restores her to her husband  the whole finished legend is necessarily not among the authors masterpieces  but perhaps not even keats in his earliest work displayed more of promise and gave more assurance of genius  here and there come turns and phrases all the charm of all the muses which remind a reader of things later well known in pieces more mature  such lines are       strange to me and sweet sweet through strange years   and    like to a lowhung and a fiery sky hung round with ragged rims and burning folds   and    like sounds without the twilight realm of dreams which wander round the bases of the hills   we also note close observation of nature in the curious phrase    cries of the partridge like a rusty key turned in a lock   of this kind was tennysons adolescent vein when he left      the poplars four that stood beside his fathers door   the somersby brook and the mills and granges the seas of the lincolnshire coast and the hills and dales among the wolds for cambridge  he was well read in old and contemporary english literature and in the classics  already he was acquainted with the singular trancelike condition to which his poems occasionally allude a subject for comment later  he matriculated at trinity with his brother charles on february 20 1828 and had an interview of a not quite friendly sort with a proctor before he wore the gown  that tennyson should go to cambridge not to oxford was part of the nature of things by which cambridge educates the majority of english poets whereas oxford has only turned out a fewlike shelley  at that time as in macaulays day the path of university honours at cambridge lay through mathematics and except for his prize poem in 1829 tennyson took no honours at all  his classical reading was pursued as literature not as a course of grammar and philology  no english poet at least since milton had been better read in the classics but tennysons studies did not aim at the gaining of academic distinction  his aspect was such that thompson later master of trinity on first seeing him come into hall said that man must be a poet  like byron shelley and probably coleridge tennyson looked the poet that he was  six feet high broadchested stronglimbed his face shakespearian and with deep eyelids his forehead ample crowned with dark wavy hair his head finely poised  not much is recorded of tennyson as an undergraduate  in our days efforts would have been made to enlist so promising a recruit in one of the college boats but rowing was in its infancy  it is a peculiarity of the universities that little flocks of men of unusual ability come up at intervals together breaking the monotony of idlers prize scholars and honours men  such a group appeared at balliol in matthew arnolds time and rather later at various colleges in the dawn of preraphaelitism  the tennysonsalfred frederick and charleswere members of such a set  there was arthur hallam son of the historian from eton there was spedding the editor and biographer of bacon milnes lord houghton blakesley dean of lincoln thompson merivale trench a poet and later archbishop of dublin brookfield buller and after tennyson the greatest thackeray a contemporary if not an apostle  charles bullers like hallams was to be an unfulfilled renown  of hallam whose name is for ever linked with his own tennyson said that he would have been a great man but not a great poet he was as near perfection as mortal man could be  his scanty remains are chiefly notable for his divination of tennyson as a great poet for the rest we can only trust the author of in memoriam and the verdict of tradition  the studies of the poet at this time included original composition in greek and latin verse history and a theme that he alone has made poetical natural science  all poetry has its roots in the age before natural science was more than a series of naturemyths  the poets have usually like keats regretted the days when   there was an awful rainbow once in heaven   when the hills and streams were not yet dispeopled of their dreams tennyson on the other hand was already finding material for poetry in the world as seen through microscope and telescope and as developed through aeonian processes of evolution  in a notebook mixed with greek is a poem on the moonnot the moon of selene the orbed maiden but of astronomical science  in memoriam recalls the conversations on labour and politics discussions of the age of the reform bill of rickburning expected to make taters cheaper and of catholic emancipation also the emancipation of such negroes as had not yet tasted the blessings of freedom  in politics tennyson was what he remained a patriot a friend of freedom a foe of disorder  his politics he said were those of shakespeare bacon and every sane man  he was one of the society of apostles and characteristically contributed an essay on ghosts  only the preface survives  it is not written in a scientific style but bids us not assume that any vision is baseless  perhaps the author went on to discuss veridical hallucinations but his ideas about these things must be considered later  it was by his fathers wish that tennyson competed for the english prize poem  the theme timbuctoo was not inspiring  thackeray wrote a good parody of the ordinary prize poem in popes metre   i see her sons the hill of glory mount and sell their sugars on their own account prone to her feet the prostrate nations come sue for her rice and barter for her rum   tennysons work was not much more serious  he merely patched up an old piece in blank verse on the battle of armageddon  the poem is not destitute of tennysonian cadence and ends not inappropriately with all was night  indeed all was night   an ingenious myth accounts for tennysons success  at oxford says charles wordsworth the author was more likely to have been rusticated than rewarded  but already 1829 arthur hallam told mr gladstone that tennyson promised fair to be the greatest poet of our generation perhaps of our century  in 1830 tennyson published the first volume of which he was sole author  brownings pauline was of the year 1833  it was the very dead hours of the muses  the great mr murray had ceased as one despairing of song to publish poetry  bulwer lytton in the preface to paul clifford 1830 announced that poetry with every other form of literature except the novel was unremunerative and unread coleridge and scott were silent  indeed sir walter was near his death wordsworth had shot his bolt though an arrow or two were left in the quiver  keats shelley and byron were dead milmans brief vogue was departing  it seemed as if novels alone could appeal to readers so great a change in taste had been wrought by the sixteen years of waverley romances  the slim volume of tennyson was naturally neglected though leigh hunt reviewed it in the tatler hallams comments in the englishmans magazine though enthusiastic as was right and natural were judicious  the author imitates no one  coleridge did not read all the book but noted things of a good deal of beauty  the misfortune is that he has begun to write verses without very well understanding what metre is  as tennyson said in 1890 so i an old man who get a poem or poems every day might cast a casual glance at a book and seeing something which i could not scan or understand might possibly decide against the book without further consideration  as a rule the said books are worthless  the number of versifiers makes it hard indeed for the poet to win recognition  one little new book of rhyme is so like another and almost all are of so little interest  the rare book that differs from the rest has a bizarrerie with its originality and in the poems of 1830 there was assuredly more than enough of the bizarre  there were no hyphens in the double epithets and words like tendriltwine seemed provokingly affected  a kind of lusciousness like that of keats when under the influence of leigh hunt may here and there be observed  such faults as these catch the indifferent eye when a new book is first opened and the volume of 1830 was probably condemned by almost every reader of the previous generation who deigned to afford it a glance  out of fiftysix pieces only twentythree were reprinted in the two volumes of 1842 which won for tennyson the general recognition of the world of letters  five or six of the pieces then left out were added as juvenilia in the collected works of 1871 1872  the whole mass deserves the attention of students of the poets development  this early volume may be said to contain in the germ all the great original qualities of tennyson except the humour of his rural studies and the elaboration of his idylls  for example in mariana we first note what may be called his perfection and accomplishment the very few alterations made later are verbal  the moated grange of mariana in measure for measure and her mood of desertion and despair are elaborated by a precision of truth and with a perfection of harmony worthy of shakespeare himself and minutely studied from the natural scenes in which the poet was born  if these verses alone survived out of the wreck of victorian literature they would demonstrate the greatness of the author as clearly as do the fragments of sappho  isabel a study of the poets mother is almost as remarkable in its stately dignity while recollections of the arabian nights attest the power of refined luxury in romantic description and herald the unmatched beauty of the lotoseaters the poet again is a picture of that which tennyson himself was to fulfil and oriana is a revival of romance and of the ballad not limited to the ballad form as in its prototype helen of kirkconnell curious and exquisite experiment in metre is indicated in the leonine elegiacs in claribel and several other poems  qualities which were not for long to find public expression speculative powers brooding in various moods on ultimate and insoluble questions were attested by the mystic and supposed confessions of a secondrate sensitive mind not in unity with itself an unlucky title of a remarkable performance  in this the most agitated of all his poems we find the soul urging onward   thro utter dark a fullsaild skiff unpiloted i the echoing dance of reboant whirlwinds   and to the question why not believe then we have as answer a simile of the sea which cannot slumber like a mountain tarn or   draw down into his vexed pools all that blue heaven which hues and paves   the tranquil inland mere 3  the poet longs for the faith of his infant days and of his mother    thy mild deep eyes upraised that knew the beauty and repose of faith and the clear spirit shining thro   that faith is already shaken and the long struggle for belief has already begun  tennyson according to matthew arnold was not un esprit puissant other and younger critics who have attained to a cockcertain mood of negation are apt to blame him because in fact he did not finally agree with their opinions  if a man is necessarily a weakling or a hypocrite because after trying all things he is not an atheist or a materialist then the reproach of insincerity or of feebleness of mind must rest upon tennyson  but it is manifest that almost in boyhood he had already faced the ideas which to one of his character almost meant despair  he had not kept his eyes closed  to his extremely selfsatisfied accusers we might answer in lines from this earliest volume the mystic   ye scorn him with an undiscerning scorn ye cannot read the marvel in his eye the still serene abstraction   he would behold   one shadow in the midst of a great light one reflex from eternity on time one mighty countenance of perfect calm awful with most invariable eyes   his mystic of these boyish years       often lying broad awake and yet remaining from the body and apart in intellect and power and will hath heard time flowing in the middle of the night and all things creeping to a day of doom   in this poem never republished by the author is an attempt to express an experience which in later years he more than once endeavoured to set forth in articulate speech an experience which was destined to colour his finial speculations on ultimate problems of god and of the soul  we shall later have to discuss the opinion of an eminent critic mr frederic harrison that tennysons ideas theological evolutionary and generally speculative followed rather than created the current ideas of his time  the train of thought in in memoriam writes mr harrison is essentially that with which ordinary english readers had been made familiar by f d maurice professor jowett dr martineau ecce homo hypatia  of these influences only maurice and maurice only orally could have reached the author of the mystic and the supposed confessions  ecce homo hypatia mr jowett were all in the bosom of the future when in memoriam was written  now the mystic and the supposed confessions are prior to in memoriam earlier than 1830  yet they already contain the chief speculative tendencies of in memoriam the growing doubts caused by evolutionary ideas then familiar to tennyson though not to ordinary english readers the longing for a return to childlike faith and the mystical experiences which helped tennyson to recover a faith that abode with him  in these things he was original  even as an undergraduate he was not following a train of thought made familiar by authors who had not yet written a line and by books which had not yet been published  so much then of the poet that was to be and of the philosopher existed in the little volume of the undergraduate  in the mystic we notice a phrase two words long which was later to be made familiar daughters of time divinely tall reproduced in the picture of helen   a daughter of the gods divinely tall    and most divinely fair   the reflective pieces are certainly of more interest now though they seem to have satisfied the poet less than the gallery of airy fairy lilians adelines rosalinds and eleanores   daughters of dreams and of stories   like   faustine fragoletta dolores felise and yolande and juliette   cambridge which he was soon to leave did not satisfy the poet oxford did not satisfy gibbon or later shelley and young men of genius are not in fact usually content with universities which perhaps are doing their best but are neither governed nor populated by minds of the highest and most original class      you that do profess to teach and teach us nothing feeding not the heart   the universities in fact teach a good deal of that which can be learned but the best things cannot be taught  the universities give men leisure books and companionship to learn for themselves  all tutors cannot be and at that time few dreamed of being men like jowett and t h green gamaliels at whose feet undergraduates sat with enthusiasm did eagerly frequent like omar khayyam  in later years tennyson found closer relations between dons and undergraduates and recorded his affection for his university  she had supplied him with such companionship as is rare and permitted him to catch the blossom of the flying terms even if tutors and lecturers were creatures of routine terriblement enfonces dans la matiere like the sire of madelon and cathos that honourable citizen  tennyson just missed by going down a visit of wordsworth to cambridge  the old enthusiast of revolution was justifying passive obedience  thirty years had turned the almost jacobin into an almost jacobite  such is the triumph of time  in the summer of 1830 tennyson with hallam visited the pyrenees  the purpose was politicalto aid some spanish rebels  the fruit is seen in oenone and mariana in the south  in march 1831 tennyson lost his father  he slept in the dead mans bed earnestly desiring to see his ghost but no ghost came  you see he said ghosts do not generally come to imaginative people a remark very true though ghosts are attributed to imagination whatever causes these phantasms it is not the kind of phantasia which is consciously exercised by the poet  coleridge had seen far too many ghosts to believe in them and coleridge and donne apart with the hallucinations of goethe and shelley who met themselves what poet ever did see a ghost  one who saw tennyson as he wandered alone at this period called him a mysterious being seemingly lifted high above other mortals and having a power of intercourse with the spirit world not granted to others  but it was the world of the poet not of the medium  the tennysons stayed on at the parsonage for six years  but anticipating their removal arthur hallam in 1831 dealt in prophecy about the identification in the district of places in his friends poemscritic after critic will trace the wanderings of the brook asin fact critic after critic has done  tennyson dislikedthese localisers  the poets walks were shared by arthur hallam then affianced to his sister emily    chapter iipoems of 18311833    by 1832 most of the poems of tennysons second volume were circulating in ms among his friends and no poet ever had friends more encouraging  perhaps bards of today do not find an eagerness among their acquaintance for effusions in manuscript or in proof sheets  the charmed volume appeared at the end of the year dated 1833 and hallam denounced as infamous lockharts review in the quarterly  infamous or not it is extremely diverting  how lockhart could miss the great and abundant poetry remains a marvel  ten years later the scorpion repented and invited sterling to review any book he pleased for the purpose of enabling him to praise the two volumes of 1842 which he did gladly  lockhart hated all affectation and preciosity of which the new book was not destitute  he had been among wordsworths most ardent admirers when wordsworth had few but the memories of the war with the cockney school clung to him the war with leigh hunt and now he gave himself up to satire  probably he thought that the poet was a member of a london clique  there is really no excuse for lockhart except that he did repent that much of his banter was amusing and that above all his censures were accepted by the poet who altered later many passages of a fine absurdity criticised by the infamous reviewer  one could name great prosewriters historians who never altered the wondrous errors to which their attention was called by critics  prosewriters have been more sensitively attached to their glaring blunders in verifiable facts than was this very sensitive poet to his occasional lapses in taste  the lady of shalott even in its early form was more than enough to give assurance of a poet  in effect it is even more poetical in a mysterious way if infinitely less human than the later treatment of the same or a similar legend in elaine  it has the charm of coleridge and an allegory of the fatal escape from the world of dreams and shadows into that of realities may have been really present to the mind of the young poet aware that he was living in phantasy  the alterations are usually for the better  the daffodil is not an aquatic plant as the poet seems to assert in the first form    the yellowleaved waterlily the green sheathed daffodilly tremble in the water chilly    round about shalott   nobody can prefer to keep   though the squally east wind keenly blew with folded arms serenely by the water stood the queenly    lady of shalott   however stoical the lady may have been the reader is too seriously sympathetic with her inevitable discomfort    all raimented in snowy white that loosely flew   as she was  the original conclusion was distressing we were dropped from the airs of mysterious romance   they crossed themselves their stars they blest knight minstrel abbot squire and guest there lay a parchment on her breast that puzzled more than all the rest    the wellfed wits at camelot   hitherto we have been puzzled but as with the sublime incoherences of a dream  now we meet wellfed wits who say bless my stars as perhaps we should also have done in the circumstancesa dead lady arriving in a very cold east wind alone in a boat for her blood was frozen slowly as was natural granting the weather and the ladys airy costume  it is certainly matter of surprise that the young poets vision broke up in this humorous manner  and after all it is less surprising that the scorpion finding such matter in a new little book by a new young man was more sensitive to the absurdity than to the romance  but no lover of poetry should have been blind to the almost flawless excellence of mariana in the south inspired by the landscape of the provencal tour with arthur hallam in consequence of lockharts censures or in deference to the maturer taste of the poet the millers daughter was greatly altered before 1842  it is one of the earliest if not the very earliest of tennysons domestic english idylls poems with conspicuous beauties but not without sacrifices to that muse of the home affections on whom sir barnes newcome delivered his famous lecture  the seventh stanza perhaps hardly deserved to be altered as it is so as to bring in minnows where fish had been the reading and where trout would best recall an english chalk stream  to the angler the rising trout which left the poet cold is at least as welcome as the reflex of a beauteous form  every woman seems an angel at the waterside said that good old angler now with god thomas todd stoddart and so the long and listless boy found it to be  it is no wonder that the mother was slowly brought to yield consent to my desire  the domestic affections in fact do not adapt themselves so well to poetry as the passion unique in tennyson of fatima  the critics who hunt for parallels or plagiarisms will note    o love o fire once he drew with one long kiss my whole soul thro my lips   and will observe mr brownings      once he kissed my soul out in a fiery mist   as to oenone the scenery of that earliest of the classical idylls is borrowed from the pyrenees and the tour with hallam  it is possible that the poem may have been suggested by beatties judgment of paris says mr collins it is also possible that the tale which      quintus calaber somewhat lazily handled of old   may have reached tennysons mind from an older writer than beattie he is at least as likely to have been familiar with greek myth as with the lamented minstrel  the form of 1833 greatly altered in 1842 contained such unlucky phrases as cedar shadowy and snowycoloured marblecold violeteyedeasy spoils of criticism  the alterations which converted a beautiful but faulty into a beautiful and flawless poem perhaps obscure the significance of oenones i will not die alone which in the earlier volume directly refers to the foreseen end of all as narrated in tennysons late piece the death of oenone  the whole poem brings to mind the glowing hues of titian and the famous homeric lines on the divine wedlock of zeus and hera  the allegory or moral of the palace of art does not need explanation not many of the poems owe more to revision  the early stanza about isaiah with fierce ezekiel and eastern confutzee did undeniably remind the reader as lockhart said of the groves of blarney   with statues gracing that noble place in    all haythen goddesses most rare petrarch plato and nebuchadnezzar    all standing naked in the open air   in the early version the soul being too much up to date   lit white streams of dazzling gas   like sir walter scott at abbotsford   thus her intense untold delight in deep or vivid colour smell and sound    was flattered day and night   lockhart was not fond of sir walters experiments in gas the smell gave him no deep untold delight and his infamous review was biassed by these circumstances  the volume of 1833 was in nothing more remarkable than in its proof of the manysidedness of the author  he offered mediaeval romance and classical perfection touched with the romantic spirit and domestic idyll of which the may queen is probably the most popular example  the mysterious being conversant with the spiritual world might have been expected to disdain topics well within the range of eliza cook  he did not despise but elevated them and thereby did more to introduce himself to the wide english public than he could have done by a century of fatimas or lotoseaters  on the other hand a taste more fastidious or more perverse will scarcely be satisfied with pathos which in process of time has come to seem obvious  the pathos of early death in the prime of beauty is less obvious in homer where achilles is to be the victim or in the laments of the anthology where we only know that the dead bride or maiden was fair but the poor may queen is of her nature rather commonplace   that good man the clergyman has told me words of peace   strikes a note rather resembling the tennysonian parody of wordsworth    a mr wilkinson a clergyman   the lotoseaters of course is at the opposite pole of the poets genius  a few plain verses of the odyssey almost bald in their reticence are the point de repere of the most magical vision expressed in the most musical verse  here is the languid charm of spenser enriched with many classical memories and pictures of natural beauty gorgeously yet delicately painted  after the excision of some verses rather fantastical in 1842 the poem became a flawless masterpieceone of the eternal possessions of song  on the other hand the opening of the dream of fair women was marred in 1833 by the grotesque introductory verses about a man that sails in a balloon  young as tennyson was these freakish passages are a psychological marvel in the work of one who did not lack the saving sense of humour  the poet wafted on the wing and pinion that the theban eagle bear cannot conceivably be likened to an aeronaut waving flags out of a balloonexcept in a spirit of selfmockery which was not tennysons  his remarkable selfdiscipline in excising the fantastic and superfluous and reducing his work to its classical perfection of thought and form is nowhere more remarkable than in this magnificent vision  it is probably by mere accidental coincidence of thought that in the verses to j s james spedding tennyson reproduces the noble speech on the warriors death which sir walter scott places in the lips of the great dundee  it is the memory which the soldier leaves behind him like the long train of light that follows the sunken sun that is all that is worth caring for the light which lingers eternally on the hills of atholl tennysons lines are a close parallel   his memory long will live alone    in all our hearts as mournful light that broods above the fallen sun    and dwells in heaven half the night   though tennyson disliked the exhibition of the chips of the workshop we have commented on them on the early readings of the early volumes  they may be regarded more properly as the sketches of a master than as chips and do more than merely engage the idle curiosity of the fanatics of first editions  they prove that the poet was studious of perfection and wisely studious for his alterations unlike those of some authors were almost invariably for the better the saner the more mature in taste  the early readings are also worth notice because they partially explain by their occasionally fantastic and humourless character the lack of early and general recognition of the poets genius  the native prejudice of mankind is not in favour of a new poet  of new poets there are always so many most of them bad that nature has protected mankind by an armour of suspiciousness  the world and lockhart easily found good reasons for distrusting this new claimant of the ivy and the bays  moreover since about 1814 there had been a reaction against new poetry  the market was glutted  scott had set everybody on reading and too many on writing novels  the great reaction of the century against all forms of literature except prose fiction had begun  near the very date of tennysons first volume bulwer lytton as we saw had frankly explained that he wrote novels because nobody would look at anything else  tennyson had to overcome this universal or all but universal indifference to new poetry and after being silent for ten years overcome it he dida remarkable victory of art and of patient courage  times were even worse for poets than today  three hundred copies of the new volume were sold but tennysons friends were not puffers in league with pushing publishers  meanwhile the poet in 1833 went on quietly and undefeated with his work  he composed the gardeners daughter and was at work on the morte darthur suppressed till the ninth year on the horatian plan many poems were produced and even written out which a number of his pieces never were and were left in manuscript till they appeared in the biography  most of these are so little worthy of the author that the marvel is how he came to write themin what uninspired hours unlike wordsworth he could weed the tares from his wheat  his studies were in greek german italian history a little and chemistry botany and electricitycrossgrained muses these last  it was on september 15 1833 that arthur hallam died  unheralded by sign or symptom of disease as it was the news fell like a thunderbolt from a serene sky  tennysons and hallams love had been passing the love of women  a blow like this drives a man on the rocks of the ultimate the insoluble problems of destiny  is this the end  nourished as on the milk of lions on the elevating and strengthening doctrines of popular science trained from childhood to forego hope and attend evening lectures the young critics of our generation find tennyson a weakling because he had hopes and fears concerning the ultimate renewal of what was more than half his life his friendship   that faith i fain would keep    that hope ill not forego eternal be the sleep     unless to waken so   wrote lockhart and the verses echoed ceaselessly in the widowed heart of carlyle  these men it is part of the duty of critics later born to remember were not children or cowards though they dreamed and hoped and feared  we ought to make allowance for failings incident to an age not yet fully enlightened by popular science and still undivorced from spiritual ideas that are as old as the human race and perhaps not likely to perish while that race exists  now and then even scientific men have been mistaken especially when they have declined to examine evidence as in this problem of the transcendental nature of the human spirit they usually do  at all events tennyson was unconvinced that death is the end and shortly after the fatal tidings arrived from vienna he began to write fragments in verse preluding to the poem of in memoriam  he also began in a mood of great misery the two voices or thoughts of a suicide  the poem seems to have been partly done by september 1834 when spedding commented on it and on the beautiful sir galahad intended for something of a male counterpart to st agnes  the morte darthur tennyson then thought the best thing i have managed lately  very early in 1835 many stanzas of in memoriam had taken form  i do not wish to be dragged forward in any shape before the reading public at present wrote the poet when he heard that mill desired to write on him  his oenone he had brought to its new perfection and did not desire comments on work now several years old  he also wrote his ulysses and his tithonus  if ever the term morbid could have been applied to tennyson it would have been in the years immediately following the death of arthur hallam  but the application would have been unjust  true the poet was living out of the world he was unhappy and he was as people say doing nothing  he was so poor that he sold his chancellors prize gold medal and he did not      scan his whole horizon in quest of what he could clap eyes on   in the way of moneymaking which another poet describes as the normal attitude of all men as well as of pirates  a careless observer would have thought that the poet was dawdling  but he dwelt in no castle of indolence he studied he composed he corrected his verses  like sir walter in liddesdale he was making himsel a the time  he did not neglect the movements of the great world in that dawn of discontent with the philosophy of commercialism  but it was not his vocation to plunge into the fray and on to platforms  it is a very rare thing anywhere especially in england for a man deliberately to choose poetry as the duty of his life and to remain loyal as a consequence to the bride of st francispoverty  this loyalty tennyson maintained even under the temptation to make money in recognised ways presented by his newborn love for his future wife miss emily sellwood  they had first met in 1830 when she a girl of seventeen seemed to him like a dryad or an oread wandering here  but admiration became the affection of a lifetime when tennyson met miss sellwood as bridesmaid to her sister the bride of his brother charles in 1836  the poet could not afford to marry and like the hero of locksley hall he may have asked himself what is that which i should do  by 1840 he had done nothing tangible and lucrative and correspondence between the lovers was forbidden  that neither dreamed of tennysons deserting poetry for a more normal profession proved of great benefit to the world  the course is one which could only be justified by the absolute certainty of possessing genius    chapter iii18371842    in 1837 the tennysons left the old rectory till 1840 they lived at high beech in epping forest and after a brief stay at tunbridge wells went to boxley near maidstone  it appears that at last the poet had beat his music out though his friends still tried to cheer him  but the man who wrote ulysses when his grief was fresh could not be suspected of declining into a hypochondriac  if i mean to make my mark at all it must be by shortness he said at this time for the men before me had been so diffuse and most of the big things except king arthur had been done  the age had not la tete epique  poe had announced the paradox that there is no such thing as a long poem and even in dealing with arthur tennyson followed the example of theocritus in writing not an epic but epic idylls  long poems suit an age of listeners for which they were originally composed or of leisure and few books  at present epics are read for dutys sake not for the only valid reason for human pleasure in fitzgeralds phrase  between 1838 and 1840 tennyson made some brief tours in england with fitzgerald and coming from coventry wrote godiva  his engagement with miss sellwood seemed to be adjourned sine die as they were forbidden to correspond  by 1841 tennyson was living at mablethorpe on the lincolnshire coast working at his volumes of 1842 much urged by fitzgerald and american admirers who had heard of the poet through emerson  moxon was to be the publisher himself something of a poet but early in 1842 he had not yet received the ms  perhaps emerson heard of tennyson through carlyle who says sterling said more in your praise than in any ones except cromwell and an american backwoodsman who has killed thirty or forty people with a bowieknife  carlyle at this time was much attached to lockhart editor of the quarterly review and it may have been carlyle who converted lockhart to admiration of his old victim  carlyle had very little more appreciation of keats than had byron or in early days lockhart and it was probably as much the man of heroic physical mould a lifeguardsman spoilt by making poetry and the unaffected companion over a pipe as the poet that attracted him in tennyson  as we saw when the two triumphant volumes of 1842 did appear lockhart asked sterling to review whatever book he pleased meaning the poems in the quarterly  the praise of sterling may seem lukewarm to us especially when compared with that of spedding in the edinburgh  but sterling and lockhart too were obliged to gang warily  lockhart had to his constant annoyance a partner mr croker and i have heard from the late dean boyle that mr croker was much annoyed by even the mild applause yielded in the quarterly to the author of the morte darthur  while preparing the volumes of 1842 at boxley tennysons life was divided between london and the society of his brotherinlaw mr edmund lushington the great greek scholar and professor of greek at glasgow university  there was in mr lushingtons personal aspect and noble simplicity of manner and character something that strongly resembled tennyson himself  among their common friends were lord houghton monckton milnes mr lear of the book of nonsense with such a pencil such a pen mr venables who at school modified the profile of thackeray and lord kelvin  in town tennyson met his friends at the cock which he rendered classic among them were thackeray forster maclise and dickens  the times were stirring social agitation and carol philosophy in dickens with growls from carlyle marked the period  there was also a kind of optimism in the air a prophetic optimism not yet fulfilled   fly happy happy sails and bear the press   that mission no longer strikes us as exquisitely felicitous  the mission of the cross and of the missionaries means international complications and the markets of the golden year are precisely the most fruitful causes of wars and rumours of wars      sea and air are dark with great contrivances of power   tennysons was not an unmitigated optimism and had no special confidence in   the herd wild hearts and feeble wings    that every sophister can lime   his political poetry in fact was very unlike the socialist chants of mr william morris or songs before sunrise  he had nothing to say about   the blood on the hands of the king    and the lie on the lips of the priest   the hands of presidents have not always been unstained nor are statements of a mythical nature confined to the lips of the clergy the poet was anxious that freedom should broaden down but slowly not with indelicate haste  persons who are more in a hurry will never care for the political poems and it is certain that tennyson did not feel sympathetically inclined towards the iberian patriot who said that his darling desire was to cut the throats of all the cures like some covenanters of old  mais vous connaissez mon coeurand a pretty black one it is thought young tennyson so cautious in youth during his pyrenean tour with hallam in 1830 tennyson could not become a convinced revolutionary later  we must accept him with his limitations  nor must we confuse him with the hero of his locksley hall one of the most popular and most parodied of the poems of 1842  full of beautiful images and confusions of a wasted youth a youth dramatically conceived and in no way autobiographical  in so marvellous a treasure of precious things as the volumes of 1842 perhaps none is more splendid perfect and perdurable than the morte darthur  it had been written seven years earlier and pronounced by the poet not bad  tennyson was never perhaps a very deep arthurian student  a little cheap copy of malory was his companion 4  he does not appear to have gone deeply into the french and german literature of the subject  malorys compilation 1485 from french and english sources with the mabinogion of lady charlotte guest sufficed for him as materials  the whole poem enshrined in the memory of all lovers of verse is richly studded as the hilt of excalibur with classical memories  a faint homeric echo it is not nor a virgilian echo but the absolute voice of old romance a thing that might have been chanted by   the lonely maiden of the lake   when   nine years she wrought it sitting in the deeps upon the hidden bases of the hills   perhaps the most exquisite adaptation of all are the lines from the odyssey    where falls not hail nor rain nor any snow   softly through the flutes of the grecians came first these elysian numbers then through lucretius then through tennysons own lucretius then in mr swinburnes atalanta in calydon   lands indiscoverable in the unheardof west round which the strong stream of a sacred sea rolls without wind for ever and the snow there shows not her white wings and windy feet nor thunder nor swift rain saith anything nor the sun burns but all things rest and thrive   so fortunate in their transmission through poets have been the lines of the ionian father of the rest the greatest of them all  in the variety of excellences which marks tennyson the new english idylls of 1842 hold their prominent place  nothing can be more exquisite and more english than the picture of the garden that i love  theocritus cannot be surpassed but the idyll matches to the seventh of his where it is most closely followed and possesses such a picture of a girl as the sicilian never tried to paint  dora is another idyll resembling the work of a wordsworth in a clime softer than that of the fells  the lays of edwin morris and edward bull are not among the more enduring of even the playful poems  the st simeon stylites appears made to the hand of the author of men and women rather than of tennyson  the grotesque vanity of the anchorite is so remote from us that we can scarcely judge of the truth of the picture though the east has still her parallels to st simeon  from the almost perhaps quite incredible ascetic the poet lightly turns to society verse lifted up into the air of poetry in the charm of the talking oak and the happy flitting sketches of actual history and thence to the strength and passion of love and duty  shall            sin itself be found the cloudy porch oft opening on the sun   that this is the province of sin is a pretty popular modern moral but honour is the better part and here was a poet who had the courage to say so though to be sure the words ring strange in an age when highly respectable matrons assure us that passion like charity covers a multitude of sins  love and duty we must admit is early victorian  the ulysses is almost a rival to the morte darthur  it is of an early date after arthur hallams death and thackeray speaks of the poet chanting his   great achilles whom we knew   as if he thought that this was in cambridge days  but it is later than these  tennyson said ulysses was written soon after arthur hallams death and gave my feeling about the need of going forward and braving the struggle of life perhaps more simply than anything in in memoriam  assuredly the expression is more simple and more noble and the personal emotion more dignified for the classic veil when the plaintive pessimist proud of the title as the living skeleton said when they showed him tells us that not to have been born is best we may answer with ulysses       life piled on life were all too little   the ulysses of tennyson of course is dantes ulysses not homers odysseus who brought home to ithaca not one of his mariners  his last known adventure the journey to the land of men who knew not the savour of salt odysseus was to make on foot and alone so spake the ghost of tiresias within the poplar pale of persephone  the two voices expresses the contest of doubts and griefs with the spirit of endurance and joy which speaks alone in ulysses  the man who is unhappy but does not want to put an end to himself has certainly the better of the argument with the despairing voice  the arguments of that barren voice are indeed remarkably deficient in cogency and logic if we can bring ourselves to strip the discussion of its poetry  the original title thoughts of a suicide was inappropriate  the suicidal suggestions are promptly faced and confuted and the mood of the author is throughout that of one who thinks life worth living   whatever crazy sorrow saith no life that breathes with human breath has ever truly longd for death  tis life whereof our nerves are scant oh life not death for which we pant more life and fuller that i want   this appears to be a satisfactory reply to the persons who eke out a livelihood by publishing pessimistic books and hooting as the great alexandre dumas says at the great drama of life  with the daydream of the sleeping beauty tennyson again displays his matchless range of powers  verse of society rises into a charmed and musical fantasy passing from the berlinwool work of the period   take the broidery frame and add a crimson to the quaint macaw   into the enchanted land of the fable  princes immortal princesses eternally young and fair  the st agnes and sir galahad companion pieces contain the romance as st simeon stylites shows the repulsive side of asceticism for the saint and the knight are young beautiful and eager as st theresa in her childhood  it has been said i do not know on what authority that the poet had no recollection of composing sir galahad any more than scott remembered composing the bride of lammermoor or thackeray parts of pendennis the haunting of tennysons mind by the arthurian legends prompted also the lovely fragment on the queens last maying sir launcelot and queen guinevere a thing of perfect charm and music  the ballads of lady clare and the lord of burleigh are not examples of the poet in his strength for his power and fantasy we must turn to the vision of sin where the early passages have the languid voluptuous music of the lotoseaters with the ethical element superadded while the portion beginning    wrinkled ostler grim and thin   is in parts reminiscent of burnss jolly beggars  in break break break we hear a note prelusive to in memoriam much of which was already composed  the poems of 1842 are always vocal in the memories of all readers of english verse  none are more familiar at least to men of the generations which immediately followed tennysons  fitzgerald was apt to think that the poet never again attained the same level and i venture to suppose that he never rose above it  for fitzgeralds opinion right or wrong it is easy to account  he had seen all the pieces in manuscript they were his cherished possession before the world knew them  cest mon homme he might have said of tennyson as boileau said of moliere  before the public awoke fitzgerald had discovered tennyson and that at the age most open to poetry and most enthusiastic in friendship  again the poems of 1842 were short while the princess maud and the idylls of the king were relatively long and with in memoriam possessed unity of subject they lacked the rich the unexampled variety of topic treatment and theme which marks the poems of 1842  these were all reasons why fitzgerald should think that the two slim green volumes held the poets work at its highest level  perhaps he was not wrong after all    chapter iv1842848the princess    the poems and such criticisms as those of spedding and sterling gave tennyson his place  all the world of letters heard of him dean bradley tells us how he took oxford by storm in the days of the undergraduateship of clough and matthew arnold  probably both of these young writers did not share the undergraduate enthusiasm  mr arnold we know did not reckon tennyson un esprit puissant  like wordsworth who thought tennyson decidedly the first of our living poets    he has expressed in the strongest terms his gratitude to my writings arnold was no fervent admirer of his contemporaries besides if tennysons work is a criticism of life the moral criticism so far was hidden in flowers like the sword of aristogiton at the feast  but on the whole tennyson had won the young men who cared for poetry though sir robert peel had never heard of him  and to win the young as theocritus desired to do is more than half the battle  on september 8 1842 the poet was able to tell mr lushington that 500 of my books are sold according to moxons brother i have made a sensation  the sales were not like those of childe harold or marmion but for some twenty years new poetry had not sold at all  novels had come in about 1814 and few wanted or bought recent verse  but carlyle was converted  he spoke no more of a spoiled guardsman  if you knew what my relation has been to the thing called english poetry for many years back you would think such a fact his pleasure in the book surprising carlyle had been living as mrs carlyle too well knew in oliver cromwell a hero who probably took no delight in lycidas or comus in lovelace or carew  i would give all my poetry to have made one song like that said tennyson of lovelaces althea  but noll would have disregarded them all alike and carlyle was full of the spirit of the protector  to conquer him was indeed a victory for tennyson while dickens not a reading man expressed his earnest and sincere homage  but tennyson was not successful in the modern way  nobody interviewed him  his photograph of course with disquisitions on his pipes and slippers did not adorn the literary press  his literary income was not magnified by pennyaliners  he did not become a lion he never would roar and shake his mane in drawing rooms  lockhart held that society was the most agreeable form of the stage  the dresses and actresses incomparably the prettiest  but tennyson liked society no better than did general gordon  he had friends enough and no desire for new acquaintances  indeed his fortune was shattered at this time by a strange investment in wood carving by machinery  ruskin had only just begun to write and wood carving by machinery was still deemed an enterprise at once philanthropic and aesthetic  my fathers worldly goods were all gone says lord tennyson  the poets health suffered extremely  he tried a fashionable cure at cheltenham where he saw miracles of healing but underwent none  in september 1845 peel was moved by lord houghton to recommend the poet for a pension 200 pounds annually  i have done nothing slavish to get it  i never even solicited for it either by myself or others  like dr johnson he honourably accepted what was offered in honour  for some reason many persons who write in the press are always maddened when such good fortune however small however well merited falls to a brother in letters  they of course were causelessly bitter  let them rave  if few of the rewards of literary success arrived the penalties at once began and only ceased with the poets existence  if you only knew what a nuisance these volumes of verse are  rascals send me theirs per post from america and i have more than once been knocked up out of bed to pay three or four shillings for books of which i cant get through one page for of all books the most insipid reading is secondrate verse  would that versifiers took the warning  tennyson had not sent his little firstlings to coleridge and wordsworth  they are only the hopeless rhymers who bombard men of letters with their lyrics and tragedies  mr browning was a sufferer  to one young twitterer he replied in the usual way  the bard wrote acknowledging the letter but asking for a definite criticism  i do not think myself a shakespeare or a milton but i know i am better than mr coventry patmore or mr austin dobson  mr browning tried to procrastinate  he was already deeply engaged with earlier arrivals of volumes of song  the poet was hurt not angry he had expected other things from mr browning  he ought to know his duty to youth  at the intercession of a relation mr browning now did his best and the minstrel satisfied at last repeated his conviction of his superiority to the authors of the angel in the house and beau brocade  probably no man not even mr gladstone ever suffered so much from minstrels as tennyson  he did not suffer them gladly  in 1846 the poems reached their fourth edition  sir edward bulwer lytton bitten by what fly who knows attacked tennyson in the new timon a forgotten satire  we do not understand the ways of that generation  the cheap and spiteful genre of satire its forged morality its sham indignation its appeal to the apelike passions has gone out  lytton had suffered many things not in verse from jeames yellowplush  i do not know that he hit back at thackeray but he passed it on to thackerays old college companion  tennyson for once replied in punch  the verses were sent thither by john forster the answer was one of magnificent contempt  but he soon decided that   the noblest answer unto such is perfect stillness when they brawl   long afterwards the poet dedicated a work to the son of lord lytton he replied to no more satirists 5  our difficulty of course is to conceive such an attack coming from a man of lyttons position and genius  he was no hungry hack and could and did do infinitely better things than stand in a false following of pope  probably lytton had a false idea that tennyson was a rich man a branch of his family being affluent and so resented the little pension  the poet was so far from rich in 1846 and even after the publication of the princess that his marriage had still to be deferred for four years  on reading the princess afresh one is impressed despite old familiarity with the extraordinary influence of its beauty  here are indeed the best words best placed and that curious felicity of style which makes every line a marvel and an eternal possession  it is as if tennyson had taken the advice which keats gave to shelley load every rift with ore  to choose but one or two examples how the purest and freshest impression of nature is recreated in mind and memory by the picture of melissa with      all her thoughts as fair within her eyes as bottom agates seen to wave and float in crystal currents of clear morning seas   the lyric tears idle tears is far beyond praise  once read it seems like a thing that has always existed in the world of poetic archetypes and has now been not so much composed as discovered and revealed  the many pictures and similitudes in the princess have a magical gorgeousness         from the illumined hall long lanes of splendour slanted oer a press of snowy shoulders thick as herded ewes and rainbow robes and gems and gemlike eyes and gold and golden heads they to and fro fluctuated as flowers in storm some red some pale   the small sweet idyll from   a volume of the poets of her land   pure theocritus  it has been admirably rendered into greek by mr gilbert murray  the exquisite beauties of style are not less exquisitely blended in the confusions of a dream for a dream is the thing most akin to the princess  time does not exist in the realm of gama or in the ideal university of ida  we have a bookless north severed but by a frontier pillar from a golden and learned south the arts from architecture to miniaturepainting are in their highest perfection while knights still tourney in armour and the quarrel of two nations is decided as in the gentle and joyous passage of arms at ashby de la zouche  such confusions are purposefully dreamlike  the vision being a composite thing as dreams are haunted by the modern scene of the holiday in the park the gallant glorious chronicle the abbey and that old crusading knight austere sir ralph  the seven narrators of the scheme are like the split personalities of dreams and the whole scheme is of great technical skill  the earlier editions lacked the beautiful songs of the ladies and that additional trait of dream the strange trance like seizures of the prince  fallings from us vanishings in wordsworthian phrase instances of dissociation in modern psychological terminology  tennyson himself like shelley and wordsworth had experience of this kind of dreaming awake which he attributes to his prince to strengthen the shadowy yet brilliant character of his romance  it is a thing of normal and natural points de repere of daylight suggestion touched as with the magnifying and intensifying elements of haschishbegotten phantasmagoria  in the same way opium raised into the region of brilliant vision that passage of purchas which coleridge was reading before he dreamed kubla khan  but in tennyson the effects were deliberately sought and secured   one might conjecture though lord tennyson says nothing on the subject that among the suggestions for the princess was the opening of loves labours lost  here the king of navarre devises the college of recluses which is broken up by the arrival of the princess of france rosaline and the other ladies   king  our court shall be a little academe still and contemplative in living art you three biron domain and longaville have sworn for three years term to live with me my fellowscholars and to keep those statutes    biron  that is to live and study here three years but there are other strict observances as not to see a woman in that term    reads  that no woman shalt come within a mile of my court hath this been proclaimed long  four days ago biron  lets see the penalty  reads  on pain of losing her tongue   the princess then arrives with her ladies as the prince does with cyril and florian as charles did with buckingham in spain  the conclusion of shakespeare is tennysons conclusion    we cannot cross the cause why we are born   the later poet reverses the attitude of the sexes in loves labours lost  it is the women who make and break the vow and the women in the princess insist on the grand epic homicidal scenes while the men are debarred more or less from a sportive treatment of the subject  the tavern catch of cyril the laughable pursuit of the prince by the feminine proctors the draggled appearance of the adventurers in female garb are concessions to the humour of the situation  shakespeare would certainly have given us the song of cyril at the picnic and comic enough the effect would have been on the stage  it may be a gross employment but the princess with the pretty chorus of girl undergraduates   in colours gayer than the morning mist   went reasonably well in opera  merely considered as a romantic fiction the princess presents higher proofs of original narrative genius than any other such attempt by its author  the poem is far from being deficient in that human interest which shelley said that it was as vain to ask from him as to seek to buy a leg of mutton at a ginshop  the characters the protagonists with cyril melissa lady blanche the child aglaia king gama the other king arac and the heros motherbeautifully studied from the mother of the poetare all sufficiently human  but they seem to waver in the magic air as all the golden autumn woodland reels athwart the fires of autumn leaves  for these reasons and because of the designed fantasy of the whole composition the princess is essentially a poem for the true lovers of poetry of spenser and of coleridge  the serious motive the question of woman her wrongs her rights her education her capabilities was not in the air in 1847  to be sure it had often been in the air  the alexandrian platonists the renaissance even the age of anne had their emancipated and learned ladies  early greece had sappho corinna and erinna the first the chief of lyric poets even in her fragments the two others applauded by all hellas  the french revolution had begotten mary wollstonecraft godwin and her vindication of the rights of women and in france george sand was prominent and emancipated enough while the poet wrote  but the question of love apart george sand was very very woman shining as a domestic character and fond of needlework  england was not excited about the question which has since produced so many disputants inevitably shrill and has not been greatly meddled with by women of genius george eliot or mrs oliphant  the poem in the public indifference as to feminine education came rather prematurely  we have now ladies colleges not in haunts remote from man but by the sedged banks of cam and cherwell  there have been no revolutionary results  no boys have spied these chaste nests with echoing romantic consequences  the beauty and splendour of the princesss university have not arisen in light and colour and it is only at st andrews that girls wear the academic and becoming costume of the scarlet gown  the real is far below the ideal but the real in 1847 seemed eminently remote or even impossible  the learned princess herself was not on our level as to knowledge and the past of womankind  she knew not of their masterly position in the law of ancient egypt  gynaeocracy and matriarchy the woman the head of the savage or prehistoric group were things hidden from her she glanced at the lycian custom but not at the pictish a custom which would have suited george sand to a marvel  she maligned the hottentots   the highest is the measure of the man and not the kaffir hottentot malay   the hottentots had long ago anticipated the princess and her shrill modern sisterhood  if we take the greeks or even ourselves we may say with dampier 1689 the hodmadods though a nasty people yet are gentlemen to these as regards the position of women  let us hear mr hartland  in every hottentots house the wife is supreme her husband poor fellow though he may wield wide power and influence out of doors at home dare not even take a mouthful of sourmilk out of the household vat without her permission    the highest oath a man can take is to swear by his eldest sister and if he abuses this name he forfeits to her his finest goods and sheep  however in 1847 england had not yet thought of imitating the hodmadods  consequently and by reason of the purely literary and elaborately fantastical character of the princess it was not of a nature to increase the poets fame and success  my book is out and i hate it and so no doubt will you tennyson wrote to fitzgerald who hated it and said so  like carlyle i gave up all hopes of him after the princess indeed it was not apt to conciliate carlyle none of the songs had the old champagne flavour said fitz and lord tennyson adds nothing either by thackeray or by my father met fitzgeralds approbation unless he had first seen it in manuscript this prejudice was very human  lord tennyson remarks as to the poets meaning in this work born too early that the sooner woman finds out before the great educational movement begins that woman is not undeveloped man but diverse the better it will be for the progress of the world  but probably the educational movement will not make much difference to womankind on the whole  the old platonic remark that woman does the same things as man but not so well will eternally hold good at least in the arts and in letters except in rare cases of genius a new jeanne darc the most signal example of absolute genius in history will not come again and the ages have waited vainly for a new sappho or a new jane austen  literature poetry painting have always been fields open to woman  but two names exhaust the roll of women of the highest rank in letterssappho and jane austen  and when did woman ever yet invent  in arts of government elizabeth had courage and just saving sense enough to yield to cecil at the eleventh hour and escape the fate of her sister and her foe the beautiful unhappy queen who told her ladies that she dared to look on whatever men dared to do and herself would do it if her strength so served her 6  the foundress of the babylonian walls is a myth the rhodope that built the pyramid is not a creditable myth for exceptions to knoxs monstrous regiment of women we must fall back on the palmyrene that fought aurelian and the revered name of the greatest of english queens victoria  thus history does not encourage the hope that a manlike education will raise many women to the level of the highest of their sex in the past or even that the enormous majority of women will take advantage of the opportunity of a manlike education  a glance at the numerous periodicals designed for the reading of women depresses optimism and the princesss prophecy of   two plummets dropped for one to sound the abyss of science and the secrets of the mind   is not near fulfilment  fortunately the sex does not love the metaphysics and perhaps has not yet produced even a manual of logic  it must suffice man and woman to      walk this world yoked in all exercise of noble end   of a more practical character while woman is at liberty      to live and learn and be all that not harms distinctive womanhood   this was the conclusion of the poet who had the most chivalrous reverence for womanhood  this is the eirenicon of that old strife between the women and the menthat war in which both armies are captured  it may not be acceptable to excited lady combatants who think man their foe when the real enemy is what porson damned the nature of things  a new poem like the princess would soon reach the public of our day so greatly increased are the uses of advertisement  but the princess moved slowly from edition to revised and improved edition bringing neither money nor much increase of fame  the poet was living with his family at cheltenham where among his new acquaintances were sydney dobell the poet of a few exquisite pieces and f w robertson later so popular as a preacher at brighton  meeting him for the first time and knowing robertsons wish to pluck the heart from my mystery from pure nervousness i would only talk of beer this kind of shyness beset tennyson  a lady tells me that as a girl and a very beautiful girl she and her sister and a third nec diversa met the poet and expected high discourse  but his speech was all of that wingless insect which gets there all the same according to an american lyrist the insect which fills mrs carlyles letters with bulletins of her success or failure in domestic campaigns  tennyson kept visiting london where he saw thackeray and the despair of carlyle and at bath house he was too modest to be introduced to the great duke whose requiem he was to sing so nobly  oddly enough douglas jerrold enthusiastically assured tennyson at a dinner of a society of authors that you are the one who will live  to that end humanly speaking he placed himself under the celebrated dr gully and his watercure a foible of that period  in 1848 he made a tour to king arthurs cornish bounds and another to scotland where the pass of brander disappointed him  perhaps he saw it on a fine day and like glencoe it needs tempest and mist lit up by the white fires of many waterfalls  by bonny doon he fell into a passion of tears for he had all of keatss sentiment for burns there never was immortal poet if he be not one  of all english poets the warmest in the praise of burns have been the two most unlike himselftennyson and keats  it was the songs that tennyson preferred wordsworth liked the cottars saturday night    chapter vin memoriam    in may 1850 a few copies of in memoriam were printed for friends and presently the poem was published without authors name  the pieces had been composed at intervals from 1833 onwards  it is to be observed that the section about evolution was written some years before 1844 when the ingenious hypotheses of robert chambers in vestiges of creation were given to the world and caused a good deal of talk  ten years again after in memoriam came darwins origin of species  these dates are worth observing  the theory of evolution of course in a rude mythical shape is at least as old as the theory of creation and is found among the speculations of the most backward savages  the arunta of central australia a race remote from the polite have a hypothesis of evolution which postulates only a few rudimentary forms of life a marine environment and the minimum of supernormal assistance in the way of stimulating the primal forms in the direction of more highly differentiated developments  the rudimentary forms inapertwa were in reality stages in the transformation of various plants and animals into human beings     they had no distinct limbs or organs of sight hearing or smell  they existed in a kind of lumps and were set free from the cauls which enveloped them by two beings called ungambikula a word which means out of nothing or self existing  men descend from lower animals thus evolved 7  this example of the doctrine of evolution in an early shape is only mentioned to prove that the idea has been familiar to the human mind from the lowest known stage of culture  not less familiar has been the theory of creation by a kind of supreme being  the notion of creation however up to 1860 held the foremost place in modern european belief  but lamarck the elder darwin monboddo and others had submitted hypotheses of evolution  now it was part of the originality of tennyson as a philosophic poet that he had brooded from boyhood on these early theories of evolution in an age when they were practically unknown to the literary and were not patronised by the scientific world  in november 1844 he wrote to mr moxon i want you to get me a book which i see advertised in the examiner  it seems to contain many speculations with which i have been familiar for years and on which i have written more than one poem  this book was vestiges of creation  these poems are the stanzas in in memoriam about the greater ape and about nature as careless of the type  all shall go  the poetic and philosophic originality of tennyson thus faced the popular inferences as to the effect of the doctrine of evolution upon religious beliefs long before the world was moved in all its deeps by darwins origin of species  thus the geological record is inconsistent we learned with the record of the first chapters of genesis  if man is a differentiated monkey and if a monkey has no soul or future life which is taken for granted where are mans titledeeds to these possessions  with other difficulties of an obvious kind these presented themselves to the poet with renewed force when his only chance of happiness depended on being able to believe in a future life and reunion with the beloved dead  unbelief had always existed  we hear of atheists in the rig veda  in the early eighteenth century in the age of swift    men proved as sure as gods in gloucester that moses was a great impostor   distrust of moses increased with the increase of hypotheses of evolution  but what english poet before tennyson ever attempted to lay the spectres of the mind ever faced worldold problems in their most recent aspects  i am not acquainted with any poet who attempted this task and whatever we may think of tennysons success i do not see how we can deny his originality  mr frederic harrison however thinks that neither the theology nor the philosophy of in memoriam are new original with an independent force and depth of their own  they are exquisitely graceful re statements of the theology of the broad churchman of the school of f d maurice and jowetta combination of maurices somewhat illogical piety with jowetts philosophy of mystification  the piety of maurice may be as illogical as that of positivism is logical and the philosophy of the master of balliol may be whatever mr harrison pleases to call it  but as jowetts earliest work except an essay on etruscan religion is of 1855 one does not see how it could influence tennyson before 1844  and what had the duke of argyll written on these themes some years before 1844  the late duke to whom mr harrison refers in this connection was born in 1823  his philosophic ideas if they were to influence tennysons in memoriam must have been set forth by him at the tender age of seventeen or thereabouts  mr harrisons sentence is but does in memoriam teach anything or transfigure any idea which was not about that time the time of writing was mainly 18331840 common form with f d maurice with jowett c kingsley f robertson stopford brooke mr ruskin and the duke of argyll bishops westcott and boyd carpenter  the dates answer mr harrison  jowett did not publish anything till at least fifteen years after tennyson wrote his poems on evolution and belief  dr boyd carpenters works previous to 1840 are unknown to bibliography  f w robertson was a young parson at cheltenham ruskin had not published the first volume of modern painters  his oxford prize poem is of 1839  mr stopford brooke was at school  the duke of argyll was being privately educated  and so with the rest except the contemporary maurice  how can mr harrison say that in the time of in memoriam tennyson was in touch with the ideas of herschel owen huxley darwin and tyndall 8  when tennyson wrote the parts of in memoriam which deal with science nobody beyond their families and friends had heard of huxley darwin and tyndall they had not developed much less had they published their general ideas  even in his journal of the cruise of the beagle darwins ideas were religious and he naively admired the works of god  it is strange that mr harrison has based his criticism and his theory of tennysons want of originality on what seems to be a historical error  he cites parts of in memoriam and remarks no one can deny that all this is exquisitely beautiful that these eternal problems have never been clad in such inimitable grace    but the train of thought is essentially that with which ordinary english readers have been made familiar by f d maurice professor jowett ecce homo hypatia and now by arthur balfour mr drummond and many valiant companies of septem why septem contra diabolum  one must keep repeating the historical verity that the ideas of in memoriam could not have been made familiar by authors who had not yet published anything or by books yet undreamed of and unborn such as ecce homo and jowetts work on some of st pauls epistles  if these books contain the ideas of in memoriam it is by dint of repetition and borrowing from in memoriam or by coincidence  the originality was tennysons for we cannot dispute the evidence of dates  when one speaks of originality one does not mean that tennyson discovered the existence of the ultimate problems  but at cambridge 18281830 he had voted no in answer to the question discussed by the apostles is an intelligible intelligent first cause deducible from the phenomena of the universe 9  he had also propounded the theory that the development of the human body might possibly be traced from the radiated vermicular molluscous and vertebrate organisms thirty years before darwin published the origin of species  to be concerned so early with such hypotheses and to face in poetry the religious or irreligious inferences which may be drawn from them decidedly constitutes part of the poetic originality of tennyson  his attitude as a poet towards religious doubt is only so far not original as it is part of the general reaction from the freethinking of the eighteenth century  men had then been freethinkers avec delices  it was a joyous thing to be an atheist or something very like one at all events it was glorious to be emancipated  many still find it glorious as we read in the tone of mr huxley when he triumphs and tramples over pious dukes and bishops  shelley said that a certain schoolgirl would make a dear little atheist  but by 18281830 men were less joyous in their escape from all that had hitherto consoled and fortified humanity long before he dreamed of in memoriam in the poems chiefly lyrical of 1830 tennyson had written    yet said i in my morn of youth the unsunnd freshness of my strength when i went forth in quest of truth it is mans privilege to doubt       ay me  i fear all may not doubt but everywhere some must clasp idols  yet my god whom call i idol  let thy dove shadow me over and my sins be unrememberd and thy love enlighten me  oh teach me yet somewhat before the heavy clod weighs on me and the busy fret of that sharpheaded worm begins in the gross blackness underneath  oh weary life oh weary death oh spirit and heart made desolate oh damned vacillating state   now the philosophy of in memoriam may be indeed is regarded by robust firstrate and far from sensitive minds as a damned vacillating state  the poet is not so imbued with the spirit of popular science as to be sure that he knows everything  knows that there is nothing but atoms and ether with no room for god or a soul he is far from that happy cockcertainty and consequently is exposed to the contempt of the cockcertain  the poem says mr harrison has made tennyson the idol of the anglican clergymanthe world in which he was born and the world in which his life was ideally passed the idol of all cultured youth and of all aesthetic women  it is an honourable post to fillthat of idol  the argument of in memoriam apparently is    that we should faintly trust the larger hope that i think is not the argument not the conclusion of the poem but is a casual expression of one mood among many moods  the argument and conclusion of in memoriam are the argument and conclusion of the life of tennyson and of the love of tennyson that immortal passion which was a part of himself and which if aught of us endure is living yet and must live eternally  from the record of his life by his son we know that his trust in the larger hope was not faint but strengthened with the years  there are said to have been less hopeful intervals  his faith is of course no argument for othersat least it ought not to be  we are all the creatures of our bias our environment our experience our emotions  the experience of tennyson was unlike the experience of most men  it yielded him subjective grounds for belief  he opened a path unto many like yama the vedic being who discovered the way to death  but tennysons path led not to death but to life spiritual and to hope and he did give a new impulse to the thought of his age as other great poets have done  of course it may be an impulse to wrong thought  as the philosophical australian black said we shall know when we are dead  mr harrison argues as if unlike tennyson byron wordsworth shelley and burns produced original ideas fresh from their own spirit and not derived from contemporary thinkers  i do not know what original ideas these great poets discovered and promulgated their ideas seem to have been in the air  these poets made them current coin  shelley thought that he owed many of his ideas to godwin a contemporary thinker  wordsworth has a debt to plato a thinker not contemporary  burnss democratic independence was in the air and had been in scotland since elder remarked on it in a letter to ingles in 1515  it is not the ideas it is the expression of the ideas that marks the poet  tennysons ideas are relatively novel though as old as plotinus for they are applied to a novel or at least an unfamiliar mental situation  doubt was abroad as it always is but for perhaps the first time since porphyry wrote his letter to abammon the doubters desired to believe and said lord help thou my unbelief  to robust not sensitive minds very much in unity with themselves the attitude seems contemptible or at best decently futile  yet i cannot think it below the dignity of mankind conscious that it is not omniscient  the poet does fail in logic in memoriam cxx when he says    let him the wiser man who springs    hereafter up from childhood shape    his action like the greater ape but i was born to other things   i am not well acquainted with the habits of the greater ape but it would probably be unwise and perhaps indecent to imitate him even if we also are his offspring  we might as well revert to polyandry and paint because our celtic or pictish ancestors if we had any practised the one and wore the other  however petulances like the verse on the greater ape are rare in in memoriam  to declare that i would not stay in life if science proves us to be cunning casts in clay is beneath the courage of the stoical philosophy  theologically the poem represents the struggle with doubts and hopes and fears which had been with tennyson from his boyhood as is proved by the volume of 1830  but the doubts had exerted probably but little influence on his happiness till the sudden stroke of loss made life for a time seem almost unbearable unless the doubts were solved  they were solved or stoically set aside in the ulysses written in the freshness of grief with the conclusion that we must be         strong in will to strive to seek to find and not to yield   but the gnawing of grief till it becomes a physical pain the fever fits of sorrow the aching desiderium bring back in many guises the old questions  these require new attempts at answers and are answered the sad mechanic exercise of verse allaying the pain this is the genesis of in memoriam not originally written for publication but produced at last as a monument to friendship and as a book of consolation  no books of consolation can console except by sympathy and in in memoriam sympathy and relief have been found and will be found by many  another we feel has trodden our dark and stony path has been shadowed by the shapes of dread which haunt our valley of tribulation  a mind almost infinitely greater than ours has been our fellowsufferer  he has emerged from the darkness of the shadow of death into the light whither as it seems to us we can scarcely hope to come  it is the sympathy and the example i think not the speculations mystical or scientific which make in memoriam in more than name a book of consolation  even in hours of the sharpest distress when its technical beauties and wonderful pictures seem shadowy and unreal like the yellow sunshine and the woods of that autumn day when a man learned that his friend was dead  no it was not the speculations and arguments that consoled or encouraged us we did not listen to tennyson as to mr frederic harrisons glorified anglican clergyman  we could not murmur like the queen of the may    that good man the laureate has told tis words of peace   what we valued was the poets companionship  there was a young reader to whom all along the valley came as a new poem in a time of recent sorrow   the twoandthirty years were a mist that rolls away   said the singer of in memoriam and in that hour it seemed as if none could endure for twoandthirty years the companionship of loss  but the years have gone by and have left      ever young the face that dwells with reason cloisterd in the brain 10   in this way to many in memoriam is almost a lifelong companion  we walk with greatheart for our guide through the valley perilous  in this respect in memoriam is unique for neither to its praise nor dispraise is it to be compared with the other famous elegies of the world  these are brief outbursts of griefreal as in the hopeless words of catullus over his brothers tomb or academic like miltons lycidas  we are not to suppose that milton was heartbroken by the death of young mr king or that shelley was greatly desolated by the death of keats with whom his personal relations had been slight and of whose poetry he had spoken evil  he was nobly stirred as a poet by a poets deathlike mr swinburne by the death of charles baudelaire but neither shelley nor mr swinburne was lamenting dimidium animae suae or mourning for a friend         dear as the mother to the son more than my brothers are to me   the passion of in memoriam is personal is acute is lifelong and thus it differs from the other elegies  moreover it celebrates a noble object and thus is unlike the ambiguous affection real or dramatic which informs the sonnets of shakespeare  so the poem stands alone cloistered not fiery with indignation not breaking into actual prophecy like shelleys adonais not capable by reason even of its meditative metre of the organ music of lycidas  yet it is not to be reckoned inferior to these because its aim and plan are other than theirs   it is far from my purpose to class tennyson or to dispute about his relative greatness when compared with wordsworth or byron coleridge shelley or burns  he rated one song of lovelace above all his lyrics and in fact could no more have written the cavaliers to althea from prison than lovelace could have written the morte darthur  it is not reasonable it is not fair says mr harrison after comparing in memoriam with lycidas to compare tennyson with milton and it is not reasonable to compare tennyson with any poet whatever  criticism is not the construction of a class list  but we may reasonably say that in memoriam is a noble poem an original poem a poem which stands alone in literature  the wonderful beauty ever fresh howsoever often read of many stanzas is not denied by any critic  the marvel is that the same serene certainty of art broods over even the stanzas which must have been conceived while the sorrow was fresh  the second piece   old yew which graspest at the stones   must have been composed soon after the stroke fell  yet it is as perfect as the proem of 1849  as a rule the poetical expression of strong emotion appears usually to clothe the memory of passion when it has been softened by time  but here already the rhythm phrasing and articulation are entirely faultless exquisitely clear melodious and rare 11  it were superfluous labour to point at special beauties at the exquisite rendering of nature and copious commentaries exist to explain the course of the argument if a series of moods is to be called an argument  one may note such a point as that xiv where the poet says that were he to meet his friend in life   i should not feel it to be strange   it may have happened to many to mistake for a section of a second the face of a stranger for the face seen only in dreams and to find that the recognition brings no surprise  pieces of a character apart from the rest and placed in a designed sequence are xcii xciii xcv  in the first the poet says    if any vision should reveal    thy likeness i might count it vain    as but the canker of the brain yea tho it spake and made appeal  to chances where our lots were cast    together in the days behind    i might but say i hear a wind of memory murmuring the past  yea tho it spake and bared to view    a fact within the coming year    and tho the months revolving near should prove the phantomwarning true  they might not seem thy prophecies    but spiritual presentiments    and such refraction of events as often rises ere they rise   the author thus shows himself difficile as to recognising the personal identity of a phantasm nor is it easy to see what mode of proving his identity would be left to a spirit  the poet therefore appeals to some perhaps less satisfactory experience   descend and touch and enter hear    the wish too strong for words to name    that in this blindness of the frame my ghost may feel that thine is near   the third poem is the crown of in memoriam expressing almost such things as are not given to man to utter      and all at once it seemd at last the living soul was flashd on mine  and mine in this was wound and whirld    about empyreal heights of thought    and came on that which is and caught the deep pulsations of the world  aeonian music measuring out    the steps of timethe shocks of chance     the blows of death  at length my trance was cancelld stricken thro with doubt  vague words but ah how hard to frame    in mattermoulded forms of speech    or evn for intellect to reach thro memory that which i became   experiences like this subjective and not matter for argument were familiar to tennyson  jowett said he was one of those who though not an upholder of miracles thought that the wonders of heaven and earth were never far absent from us  in the mystic tennyson when almost a boy had shown familiarity with strange psychological and psychical conditions  poems of much later life also deal with these and more or less consciously his philosophy was tinged and his confidence that we are more than cunning casts in clay was increased by phenomena of experience which can only be evidence for the mystic himself if even for him  but this dim aspect of his philosophy of course is to the greeks foolishness  his was a philosophy of his own not a philosophy for disciples and those that eddy round and round  it was the sum of his reflection on the mass of his impressions  i have shown by the aid of dates that it was not borrowed from huxley mr stopford brooke or the late duke of argyll  but no doubt many of the ideas were in the air and must have presented themselves to minds at once of religious tendency and attracted by the evolutionary theories which had always existed as floating speculations till they were made current coin by the genius and patient study of darwin  that tennysons opinions between 1830 and 1840 were influenced by those of f d maurice is reckoned probable by canon ainger author of the notice of the poet in the dictionary of national biography  in the life of maurice tennyson does not appear till 1850 and the two men were not at cambridge together  but maurices ideas as they then existed may have reached tennyson orally through hallam and other members of the trinity set who knew personally the author of letters to a quaker however this is no question of scientific priority  to myself it seems that tennyson beat his music out for himself as perhaps most people do  like his own sir percivale i know not all he meant  among the opinions as to in memoriam current at the time of its publication lord tennyson notices those of maurice and robertson they thought that the poet had made a definite step towards the unification of the highest religion and philosophy with the progressive science of the day  neither science nor religion stands still neither stands now where it then did  conceivably they are travelling on paths which will ultimately coincide but this opinion of course must seem foolishness to most professors of science bishop westcott was at cambridge when the book appeared  he is one of mr harrisons possible sources of tennysons ideas  he recognised the poets splendid faith in the face of every difficulty in the growing purpose of the sum of life and in the noble destiny of the individual man  ten years later professor henry sidgwick a mind sufficiently sceptical found in some lines of in memoriam the indestructible and inalienable minimum of faith which humanity cannot give up because it is necessary for life and which i know that i at least so far as the man in me is deeper than the methodical thinker cannot give up  but we know that many persons not only do not find an irreducible minimum of faith necessary for life but are highly indignant and contemptuous if any one else ventures to suggest the logical possibility of any faith at all  the mass of mankind will probably never be convinced unbelievers nay probably the backward or forward swing of the pendulum will touch more convinced belief  but there always have been since the rishis of india sang superior persons who believe in nothing not materialwhatever the material may be  tennyson was it is said impatient of these esprits forts and they are impatient of him it is an error to be impatient  we know not whither the logos may lead us or later generations and we ought not to be irritated with others because it leads them into what we think the wrong path  it is unfortunate that a work of art like in memoriam should arouse theological or antitheological passions  the poet only shows us the paths by which his mind travelled  they may not be the right paths nor is it easy to trace them on a philosophical chart  he escaped from doubting castle  others may take that for a hermitage and be happy enough in the residence  we are all determined by our bias tennysons is unconcealed  his poem is not a tract  it does not aim at the conversion of people with the contrary bias it is irksome in writing about a poet to be obliged to discuss a philosophy which certainly is not stated in the manner of spinoza but is merely the equilibrium of contending forces in a single mind  the most famous review of in memoriam is that which declared that these touching lines evidently come from the full heart of the widow of a military man  this is only equalled if equalled by a recent critique which treated a fresh edition of jane eyre as a new novel not without power in parts and showing some knowledge of yorkshire local colour    chapter viafter in memoriam    on june 13 tennyson married at shiplake the object of his old longtried and constant affection  the marriage was still imprudenteight years of then uncontested supremacy in english poetry had not brought a golden harvest  mr moxon appears to have supplied 300 pounds in advance of royalties  the sum so contemptible in the eyes of firstrate modern novelists was a competence to tennyson added to his little pension and the epaves of his patrimony  the peace of god came into my life when i married her he said in later days  the poet made a charming copy of verses to his friend the rev mr rawnsley who tied the knot as he and his bride drove to the beautiful village of pangbourne  thence they went to the stately clevedon court the seat of sir abraham elton hard by the church where arthur hallam sleeps  the place is very ancient and beautiful and was a favourite haunt of thackeray  they passed on to lynton and to glastonbury where a collateral ancestor of mrs tennysons is buried beside king arthurs grave in that green valley of avilion among the appleblossoms  they settled for a while at tent lodge on coniston water in a land of hospitable marshalls  after their return to london on the night of november 18 tennyson dreamed that prince albert came and kissed him and that he himself said very kind but very german which was very like him  next day he received from windsor the offer of the laureateship  he doubted and hesitated but accepted  since wordsworths death there had as usual been a good deal of banter about the probable new laureate  examples of competitive odes exist in bon gaultier  that by tennyson is anacreontic but he was not really set on kissing the maids of honour as he is made to sing  rogers had declined on the plea of extreme old age but it was worthy of the great and good queen not to overlook the nestor of english poets  for the rest the queen looked for a name bearing such distinction in the literary world as to do credit to the appointment  in the previous century the great poets had rarely been laureates  but since sir walter scott declined the bays in favour of southey for whom again the tale of bricks in the way of odes was lightened and when wordsworth succeeded southey the office became honourable  tennyson gave it an increase of renown while though in itself of merely nominal value it served his poems to speak profanely as an advertisement  new editions of his books were at once in demand while few readers had ever heard of mr browning already his friend and already author of men and women  the laureateship brought the poet acquainted with the queen who was to be his debtor in later days for encouragement and consolation  to his laureateship we owe among other good things the stately and moving ode on the death of the duke of wellington a splendid heroic piece unappreciated at the moment  but tennyson was of course no birthday poet  since the exile of the house of stuart our kings in england have not maintained the old familiarity with many classes of their subjects  literature has not been fashionable at court and tennyson could in no age have been a courtier  we hear the complaint every now and then that official honours are not conferred except the laureateship on men of letters  but most of them probably think it rather distinguished not to be decorated or to carry titles borne by many deserving persons unvisited by the muses  even the appointment to the bays usually provokes a great deal of jealous and spiteful feeling which would only be multiplied if official honours were distributed among men of the pen  perhaps tennysons laurels were not for nothing in the chorus of dispraise which greeted the ode on the duke of wellington and maud  the year 1851 was chiefly notable for a tour to italy made immortal in the beautiful poem of the daisy in a measure of the poets own invention  the next year following on the coup detat and the rise of the new french empire produced patriotic appeals to britons to guard their own which to a great extent former alien owners had been unsuccessful in guarding from britons  the tennysons had lost their first child at his birth  perhaps he is remembered in the grandmother the babe had fought for his life  in august 1852 the present lord tennyson was born and mr maurice was asked to be godfather  the wellington ode was of november and was met by the almost universal depreciation of the presswhy except because as i have just suggested tennyson was laureate it is impossible to imagine  the verses were worthy of the occasion  more they could not be  in the autumn of 1853 the poet visited ardtornish on the sound of mull a beautiful place endeared to him who now writes by the earliest associations  it chanced to him to pass his holidays there just when tennyson and mr palgrave had leftmr tinsmith and mr pancake as robert the boatman a very black celt called them being then nine years of age i heard of a poets visit and asked a real poet like sir walter scott with whom i then supposed that the muse had gone away  oh not like sir walter scott of course my mother told me with loyalty unashamed  one can think of the poet as mrs sellar his hostess describes him beneath the limes of the avenue at acharn planted mrs sellar says by a cousin of flora macdonald  i have been told that the lady who planted the lilies if not the limes was the famed jacobite miss jennie cameron mentioned in tom jones  an english engraving of 1746 shows the prince between these two beauties flora and jennie  no one says mrs sellar could have been more easy simple and delightful and indeed it is no marvel that in her society and that of her husband the greek professor and her cousin miss cross and in such scenes he blossomed out in the most genial manner making us all feel as if he were an old friend  in november tennyson took a house at farringford as it was beautiful and far from the haunts of men  there he settled to a country existence in the society of his wife his two children the second lionel being in 1854 the baby and there he composed maud while the sound of the guns in practice for the war of the crimea boomed from the coast  in may tennyson saw the artists of schools oddly various who illustrated his poems  millais rossetti and holman hunt gave the tone to the art but mr horsley creswick and mulgrave were also engaged  while maud was being composed tennyson wrote the charge of the light brigade a famous poem not in a manner in which he was born to excelat least in my poor opinion  some one had blundered and that line was the first fashioned and the keynote of the poem but after all blundered is not an exquisite rhyme to hundred  the poem in any case was most welcome to our army in the crimea and is a spirited piece for recitation  in january 1855 maud was finished in april the poet copied it out for the press and refreshed himself by reading a very different poem the lady of the lake  the author sir walter had suffered like the hero of maud by an unhappy love affair which just faintly colours the lady of the lake by a single allusion in the description of fitzjamess dreams   thenfrom my couch may heavenly might chase that worst phantom of the night  again returned the scenes of youth of confident undoubting truth again his soul he interchanged with friends whose hearts were long estranged they come in dim procession led the cold the faithless and the dead as warm each hand each brow as gay as if they parted yesterday and doubt distracts him at the view  oh were his senses false or true dreamed he of death or broken vow or is it all a vision now   we learn from lady louisa stuart to whom scott read these lines that they referred to his lost love  i cite the passage because the extreme reticence of scott in his undying sorrow is in contrast with what tennyson after reading the lady of the lake was putting into the mouth of his complaining lover in maud  we have no reason to suppose that tennyson himself had ever to bewail a faithless love  to be sure the hero of locksley hall is in this attitude but then locksley hall is not autobiographical  less dramatic and impersonal in appearance are the stanzas    come not when i am dead    to drop thy foolish tears upon my grave   and   child if it were thine error or thy crime    i care no longer being all unblest   no biographer tells us whether this was a personal complaint or a mere set of verses on an imaginary occasion  in in memoriam tennyson speaks out concerning the loss of a friend  in maud as in locksley hall he makes his hero reveal the agony caused by the loss of a mistress  there is no reason to suppose that the poet had ever any such mischance but many readers have taken locksley hall and maud for autobiographical revelations like in memoriam  they are on the other hand imaginative and dramatic  they illustrate the pangs of disappointed love of woman pangs more complex and more rankling than those inflicted by death  in each case however the poet who has sung so nobly the happiness of fortunate wedded loves has chosen a hero with whom we do not readily sympathisea hamlet in miniature   with a heart of furious fancies   as in the old mad song  this choice thanks to the popular misconception did him some harm  as a monodramatic idyll a romance in many rich lyric measures maud was at first excessively unpopular  tennysons maud is tennysons maudlin said a satirist and morbid mad rampant and rabid bloodthirstiness of soul were among the amenities of criticism  tennyson hated war but his hero at least hopes that national union in a national struggle will awake a nobler than the commercial spirit  into the rights and wrongs of our quarrel with russia we are not to go  tennyson rightly or wrongly took the part of his country and must thole the feud of those highsouled citizens who think their country always in the wrongas perhaps it very frequently is  we are not to expect a tranquil absence of bias in the midst of military excitement when very laudable sentiments are apt to misguide men in both directions in any case political partisanship added to the enemies of the poem which was applauded by henry taylor ruskin george brimley and jowett while mrs browning sent consoling words from italy  the poem remained a favourite with the author who chose passages from it often when persuaded to read aloud by friends and modern criticism has not failed to applaud the splendour of the verse and the subtlety of the mad scenes the passion of the love lyrics  these merits have ceased to be disputed but though a loyal tennysonian i have never quite been able to reconcile myself to maud as a whole  the hero is an unwholesome young man and not of an original kind  he is un beau tenebreux of 1830  i suppose it has been observed that he is merely the master of ravenswood in modern costume and without lady ashton  her part is taken by mauds brother  the situations of the hero and of the master whose acquaintance thackeray never renewed after he lost his hat in the kelpie flow are nearly identical  the families and fathers of both have been ruined by the gray old wolf and by sir william ashton representing the house of stair  both heroes live dawdling on hard by their lost ancestral homes  both fall in love with the daughters of the enemies of their houses  the loves of both are baffled and end in tragedy  both are concerned in a duel though the master on his way to the ground stables his steed in the kelpie flow and the wooer in maud shoots lucy ashtons brotheri mean the brother of maudthough duelling in england was out of date  then comes an interval of madness and he recovers amid the patriotic emotions of the illfated crimean expedition  both lovers are gloomy though the master has better cause for the tennysonian hero is more comfortably provided for than edgar with his man and maid his caleb and mysie finally both the bride of lammermoor which affected tennyson so potently in boyhood   a merry merry bridal a merry merry day   and maud excel in passages rather than as wholes  the hero of maud with his clandestine wooing of a girl of sixteen has this apology that the match had been as it were predestined and desired by the mother of the lady  still the brother did not ill to be angry and the peevishness of the hero against the brother and the parvenu lord and rival strikes a jarring note  in england at least the general sentiment is opposed to this moody introspective kind of young man of whom tennyson is not to be supposed to approve  we do not feel certain that his man and maid were ever ready to slander and steal  that seems to be part of his jaundiced way of looking at everything and everybody  he has even a bad word for the mangod of modern days    the man of science himself is fonder of glory and vain an eye wellpractised in nature a spirit bounded and poor   rien nest sacre for this cynic who thinks himself a stoic  thus maud was made to be unpopular with the authors countrymen who conceived a prejudice against mauds lover described by tennyson as a morbid poetic soul    an egotist with the makings of a cynic that he is raised to sanity still in tennysons words by a pure and holy love which elevates his whole nature the world failed to perceive especially as the sanity was only a brief lucid interval tempered by hanging about the garden to meet a girl of sixteen unknown to her relations  tennyson added that different phases of passion in one person take the place of different characters to which critics replied that they wanted different characters if only by way of relief and did not care for any of the phases of passion the learned monsieur janet has maintained that love is a disease like another and that nobody falls in love when in perfect health of mind and body  this theory seems open to exception but the hero of maud is unhealthy enough  at best and last he only helps to give a martial force a sendoff   i stood on a giant deck and mixed my breath with a loyal people shouting a battlecry   he did not go out as a volunteer and probably the crimean winters brought him back to his original estate of cynical gloomand very naturally  the reconciliation with life is not like the reconciliation of in memoriam  the poem took its rise in old lines and most beautiful lines which tennyson had contributed in 1837 to a miscellany   o that twere possible    after long grief and pain to find the arms of my true love    round me once again   thence the poet working back to find the origin of the situation encountered the ideas and the persons of maud  i have tried to state the sources in the general mind of the general dislike of maud  the public driving at practice disapproved of the criticism of life in the poem confused the suffering narrator with the author and neglected the poetry  no modern poem said jowett contains more lines that ring in the ears of men  i do not know any verse out of shakespeare in which the ecstacy of love soars to such a height  with these comments we may agree yet may fail to follow jowett when he says no poem since shakespeare seems to show equal power of the same kind or equal knowledge of human nature  shakespeare could not in a narrative poem have preferred the varying passions of one character to the characters of many persons  tennyson was nettled at first his son says by these captious remarks of the indolent reviewers but afterwards he would take no notice of them except to speak of them in a halfpitiful half humorous halfmournful manner  the besetting sin and error of the critics was of course to confound tennysons hero with himself as if we confused dickens with pip  like aurora leigh lucile and other works maud is under the disadvantage of being practically a novel of modern life in verse criticised as a tale of modern life and it was criticised in that character it could not be very highly esteemed  but the essence of maud of course lies in the poetical vehicle  nobody can cavil at the impressiveness of the opening stanzas    i hate the dreadful hollow behind the little wood   with the keynotes of colour and of desolation struck the lips of the hollow dabbled with bloodred heath the redribbd ledges and the flying gold of the ruind woodlands and the contrast in the picture of the child maud    maud the delight of the village the ringing joy of the hall   the poem abounds in lines which live in the memory as in the vernal description    a million emeralds break from the rubybudded lime   and the voice heard in the garden singing   a passionate ballad gallant and gay   as lovelaces althea and the lines on the faroff waving of a white hand betwixt the cloud and the moon  the lyric of   birds in the high hallgarden    when twilight was falling maud maud maud maud    they were crying and calling   was a favourite of the poet  what birds were these he is said to have asked a lady suddenly when reading to a silent company  nightingales suggested a listener who did not probably remember any other fowl that is vocal in the dusk  no they were rooks answered the poet  come into the garden maud is as fine a lovesong as tennyson ever wrote with a triumphant ring and a soaring exultant note  then the poem drops from its height like a lark shot high in heaven tragedy comes and remorse and the beautiful interlude of the      lovely shell small and pure as a pearl   then follows the exquisite   o that twere possible   and the dull consciousness of the poem of madness with its dumb gnawing confusion of pain and wandering memory the hero being finally left in the authors words sane but shattered  tennysons letters of the time show that the critics succeeded in wounding him  it was not a difficult thing to do  maud was threatened with a broadside from that pompholygous broadblown apollodorus the gifted x  people who have read aytouns diverting firmilian where apollodorus plays his part and who remember gifted gilfillan in waverley know who the gifted x was  but x was no great authority south of tay  despite the almost unanimous condemnation by public critics the success of maud enabled tennyson to buy farringford so he must have been better appreciated and understood by the world than by the reviewers  in february 1850 tennyson returned to his old arthurian themes the only big thing not done for milton had merely glanced at arthur dryden did not   raise the table round again   and blackmore has never been reckoned adequate  vivien was first composed as merlin and nimue and then geraint and enid was adapted from the mabinogion the welsh collection of marchen and legends things of widely different ages now rather celtic or brythonic now amplifications made under the influence of mediaeval french romance enid was finished in wales in august and tennyson learned welsh enough to be able to read the mabinogion which is much more of welsh than many arthurian critics possess  the two first idylls were privately printed in the summer of 1857 being very rare and much desired of collectors in this embryonic shape  in july guinevere was begun in the middle with arthurs valedictory address to his erring consort  in autumn tennyson visited the late duke of argyll at inveraray  he was much attached to the dukeunlike professor huxley  their love of nature the duke being as keeneyed as the poet was shortsighted was one tie of union  the indian mutiny or at least the death of havelock was the occasion of lines which the author was too wise to include in any of his volumes  the poem on lucknow was of later composition  guinevere was completed in march 1858 and tennyson met mr swinburne then very young  what i particularly admired in him was that he did not press upon me any verses of his own  tennyson would have found more to admire if he had pressed for a sight of the verses  neither he nor mr matthew arnold was very encouraging to young poets  they had no sons in apollo like ben jonson  but both were kept in a perpetual state of apprehension by the army of versifiers who send volumes by post to whom that can only be said what tennyson did say to one of them as an amusement to yourself and your friends the writing it verse is all very well  it is the friends who do not find it amusing while the stranger becomes the foe  the psychology of these pests of the muses is bewildering  they do not seem to read poetry only to write it and launch it at unoffending strangers  if they bought each others books all of them could afford to publish  the master of balliol the most adviceful man if one may use the term of his age appears to have advised tennyson to publish the idylls at once  there had been years of silence since maud and the master suspected that mosquitoes reviewers were the cause there is a note needed to show the good side of human nature and to condone its frailties which thackeray will never strike  to others it seems that thackeray was eternally striking this note  at that time in general lambert his wife and daughters not to speak of other characters in the virginians  who does not condone the frailties of captain costigan and f b and the chevalier strong in any case tennyson took his own time he was 1858 only beginning elaine  there is no doubt that tennyson was easily pricked by unsympathetic criticism even from the most insignificant source and as he confessed he received little pleasure from praise  all authors without exception are sensitive  a sturdier author wrote that he would sometimes have been glad to meet his assailant where the muircock was bailie  we know how testily wordsworth replied in defence to the gentlest comments by lamb  the master of balliol kept insisting as to the critics their power is not really great     one drop of natural feeling in poetry or the true statement of a single new fact is already felt to be of more value than all the critics put together  yet even critics may be in the right and of all great poets tennyson listened most obediently to their censures as we have seen in the case of his early poems his prolonged silences after the attacks of 1833 and 1855 were occupied in work and reflection  achilles was not merely sulking in his tent as some of his friends seem to have supposed  an epic in a series of epic idylls cannot be dashed off like a romantic novel in rhyme and tennysons method was always one of waiting for maturity of conception and execution  mrs tennyson doubtless by her lords desire asked the master then tutor of balliol to suggest themes  old age was suggested and is treated in the grandmother  other topics were not handled  i hold most strongly said the master that it is the duty of every one who has the good fortune to know a man of genius to do any trifling service they can to lighten his work  to do every service in his power to every man was the masters lifelong practice  he was not much at home his letters show with burns to whom he seems to have attributed john anderson my jo john while he tells an anecdote of burns composing tam o shanter with emotional tears which if true at all is true of the making of to mary in heaven  if burns wept over tam o shanter the tears must have been tears of laughter  the first four idylls of the king were prepared for publication in the spring of 1859 while tennyson was at work also on pelleas and ettarre and the tristram cycle  in autumn he went on a tour to lisbon with mr f t palgrave and mr craufurd grove  returning he fell eagerly to reading an early copy of darwins origin of species the crown of his own early speculations on the theory of evolution your theory does not make against christianity he asked darwin later 1868 who replied no certainly not  but darwin has stated the waverings of his own mind in contact with a topic too high for a priori reasoning and only to be approached if at all on the strength of the scientific method applied to facts which science so far neglects or denies or explains away rather than explains  the idylls unlike maud were well received by the press better by the public and best of all by friends like thackeray the duke of argyll the master of balliol and clough while ruskin showed some reserve  the letter from thackeray i cannot deny myself the pleasure of citing from the biography  it was written in an ardour of claret and gratitude but posted some six weeks later   folkestone september 36 onslow square october  my dear old alfredi owe you a letter of happiness and thanks sir about three weeks ago when i was ill in bed i read the idylls of the king and i thought oh i must write to him now for this pleasure this delight this splendour of happiness which i have been enjoying  but i should have blotted the sheets tis ill writing on ones back  the letter full of gratitude never went as far as the postoffice and how comes it now  dabord a bottle of claret  the landlord of the hotel asked me down to the cellar and treated me  then afterwards sitting here an old magazine frasers magazine 1850 and i come on a poem out of the princess which says i hear the horns of elfland blowing blowingno its the horns of elfland faintly blowing i have been into my bedroom to fetch my pen and it has made that blot and reading the lines which only one man in the world could write i thought about the other horns of elfland blowing in full strength and arthur in gold armour and guinevere in gold hair and all those knights and heroes and beauties and purple landscapes and misty gray lakes in which you have made me live  they seem like facts to me since about three weeks ago three weeks or a month was it when i read the book  it is on the table yonder and i dont like somehow to disturb it but the delight and gratitude  you have made me as happy as i was as a child with the arabian nightsevery step i have walked in elfland has been a sort of paradise to me  the landlord gave two bottles of his claret and i think i drank the most and here i have been lying back in the chair and thinking of those delightful idylls my thoughts being turned to you  what could i do but be grateful to that surprising genius which has made me so happy  do you understand that what i mean is all true and that i should break out were you sitting opposite with a pipe in your mouth  gold and purple and diamonds i say gentlemen and glory and love and honour and if you havent given me all these why should i be in such an ardour of gratitude  but i have had out of that dear book the greatest delight that has ever come to me since i was a young man to write and think about it makes me almost young and this i suppose is what im doing like an afterdinner speech  psi thought the grandmother quite as fine  how can you at 50 be doing things as well as at 35  october 16thi should think six weeks after the writing of the above  the rhapsody of gratitude was never sent and for a peculiar reason just about the time of writing i came to an arrangement with smith  elder to edit their new magazine and to have a contribution from t was the publishers and editors highest ambition  but to ask a man for a favour and to praise and bow down before him in the same page seemed to be so like hypocrisy that i held my hand and left this note in my desk where it has been lying during a little french italianswiss tour which my girls and their papa have been making  meanwhile s e  co have been making their own proposals to you and you have replied not favourably i am sorry to hear but now there is no reason why you should not have my homages and i am just as thankful for the idylls and love and admire them just as much as i did two months ago when i began to write in that ardour of claret and gratitude  if you cant write for us you cant  if you can by chance some day and help an old friend how pleased and happy i shall be  this however must be left to fate and your convenience  i dont intend to give up hope but accept the good fortune if it comes  i see one two three quarterlies advertised today as all bringing laurels to laureatus  he will not refuse the private tribute of an old friend will he  you dont know how pleased the girls were at kensington tother day to hear you quote their fathers little verses and he too i daresay was not disgusted  he sends you and yours his very best regards in this most heartfelt and artless  note of admiration always yours my dear alfred w m thackeray   naturally this letter gave tennyson more pleasure than all the converted critics with their favourable reviews  the duke of argyll announced the conversion of macaulay  the master found elaine the fairest sweetest purest love poem in the english language  as to the whole the allegory in the distance greatly strengthens also elevates the meaning of the poem  ruskin like some other critics felt the art and finish in these poems a little more than i like to feel it  yet guinevere and elaine had been rapidly written and little corrected  i confess to the opinion that what a man does most easily is as a rule what he does best  we know that the art and finish of shakespeare were spontaneous and so were those of tennyson  perfection in art is sometimes more sudden than we think but then the long preparation for itthat unseen germination that is what we ignore and forget but he wisely kept his pieces by him for a long time restudying them with a fresh eye  the unreality of the subject also failed to please ruskin as it is a stumblingblock to others  he wanted poems on the living present a theme not selected by homer shakespeare spenser milton virgil or the greek dramatists except among surviving plays in the persae of aeschylus  the poet who can transfigure the hot present is fortunate but most and the greatest have visited the cool quiet purlieus of the past    chapter viithe idylls of the king    the idylls may probably be best considered in their final shape they are not an epic but a series of heroic idyllia of the same genre as the heroic idyllia of theocritus  he wrote long after the natural age of national epic the age of homer  he saw the later literary epic rise in the argonautica of apollonius rhodius a poem with many beauties if rather an archaistic and elaborate revival as a whole  the time for long narrative poems theocritus appears to have thought was past and he only ventured on the heroic idyllia of heracles and certain adventures of the argonauts  tennyson too from the first believed that his pieces ought to be short therefore though he had a conception of his work as a whole a conception long mused on and sketched in various lights he produced no epic only a series of epic idyllia  he had a spiritual conception an allegory in the distance an allegory not to be insisted upon though its presence was to be felt  no longer as in youth did tennyson intend merlin to symbolise the sceptical understanding as if one were to break into blank the gospel of herr kant or poor guinevere to stand for the blessed reformation or the table round for liberal institutions  mercifully tennyson never actually allegorised arthur in that fashion  later he thought of a musical masque of arthur and sketched a scenario  finally tennyson dropped both the allegory of liberal principles and the musical masque in favour of the series of heroic idylls  there was only a parabolic drift in the intention  there is no single fact or incident in the idylls however seemingly mystical which cannot be explained without any mystery or allegory whatever  the idylls ought to be read and the right readers never dream of doing anything else as romantic poems just like brownings childe roland in which the wrong readers the members of the browning society sought for mystic mountains and marvels  yet tennyson had his own interpretation a dream of man coming into practical life and ruined by one sin  that was his interpretation or allegory in the distance  people may be heard objecting to the suggestion of any spiritual interpretation of the arthur legends and even to the existence of elementary morality among the arthurian knights and ladies  there seems to be a notion that bold bawdry and open manslaughter as roger ascham said are the staple of tennysons sources whether in the mediaeval french the welsh or in malorys compilation chiefly from french sources  tennyson is accused of bowdlerising these and of introducing gentleness courtesy and conscience into a literature where such qualities were unknown  i must confess myself ignorant of any early and popular or primitive literature in which human virtues and the human conscience do not play their part  those who object to tennysons handling of the great arthurian cycle on the ground that he is too refined and too moral must either never have read or must long have forgotten even malorys romance  thus we read in a recent novel that lancelot was an homme aux bonnes fortunes whereas lancelot was the most loyal of lovers  among other critics mr harrison has objected that the arthurian world of tennyson is not quite an ideal world  therein lies the difficulty  the scene though not of course historic has certain historic suggestions and characters  it is not apparent who the historic characters are for the real arthur is but a historic phantasm  but then in the midst of so much realism the knights from arthur downwards talk and act in ways with which we are familiar in modern ethical and psychological novels but which are as impossible in real mediaeval knights as a bengal tiger or a polar bear would be in a drawingroom  i confess to little acquaintance with modern ethical novels but real mediaeval knights and still more the knights of mediaeval romance were capable of very ethical actions  to halt an army for the protection and comfort of a laundress was a highly ethical action  perhaps sir redvers buller would do it  bruce did  mr harrison accuses the ladies of the idylls of soulbewildering casuistry like that of women in middlemarch or helbeck of bannisdale  now i am not reminded by guinevere and elaine and enid of ladies in these ethical novels but the women of the mediaeval cours damour the originals from whom the old romancers drew were nothing if not casuists  spiritual delicacy as they understood it was their delight  mr harrison even argues that malorys men lived hotblooded lives in fierce times before an idea had arisen in the world of reverencing conscience leading sweet lives and so on  but he admits that they had fantastic ideals of honour and love  as to fantastic that is a matter of opinion but to have ideals and to live in accordance with them is to reverence conscience which the heroes of the romances are said by mr harrison never to have had an idea of doing  they are denied even amiable words and courtliness need one say that courtliness is the dominant note of mediaeval knights in history as in romance  with discourtesy froissart would head the count of crimes  after a battle he says scots knights and english would thank each other for a good fight not like the germans  and now i dare say said malorys sir ector thou sir lancelot wast the curtiest knight that ever bare shield    and thou wast the meekest man and the gentlest that ever ate in hall among ladies  observe sir lancelot in the difficult pass where the lily maid offers her love  jesu defend me for then i rewarded your father and your brother full evil for their great goodness    but because fair damsel that ye love me as ye say ye do i will for your good will and kindness show you some goodness    and always while i live to be your true knight  here are amiable words and courtesy  i cannot agree with mr harrison that malorys book is merely a fierce lusty epic  that was not the opinion of its printer and publisher caxton  he produced it as an example of the gentle and virtuous deeds that some knights used in these days    noble and renowned acts of humanity gentleness and chivalry  for herein may be seen noble chivalry courtesy humanity friendliness love cowardice murder hate virtue and sin  do after the good and leave the evil  in reaction against the boldfaced heroines and sensual amours of some of the old french romances an ideal of exaggerated asceticism of stainless chastity notoriously pervades the portion of malorys work which deals with the holy grail  lancelot is distraught when he finds that by dint of enchantment he has been made false to guinevere book xi chap viii  after his dreaming vision of the holy grail with the reproachful voice sir lancelot said my sin and my wickedness have brought me great dishonour    and now i see and understand that my old sin hindereth and shameth me  he was human the lancelot of malory and fell to his old love again with a heavy heart and with long penance at the end  how such good knights can be deemed conscienceless and void of courtesy one knows not except by a survival of the puritanism of ascham  but tennyson found in the book what is in the bookhonour conscience courtesy and the hero    whose honour rooted in dishonour stood and faith unfaithful kept him falsely true   malorys book which was tennysons chief source ends by being the tragedy of the conscience of lancelot  arthur is dead or in avalon he groweth old  the queen and lancelot might sing as lennox reports that queen mary did after darnleys murder    weel is me for i am free   why took they not their pastime  because conscience forbade and guinevere sends her lover far from her and both die in religion thus malorys fierce lusty epic is neither so lusty nor so fierce but that it gives tennyson his keynote  the sin that breaks the fair companionship and is bitterly repented  the knights are almost too polite to kill each other the critic urges  in malory they are sometimes quite too polite to kill each other  sir darras has a bloodfeud against sir tristram and sir tristram is in his dungeon  sir darras said wit ye well that sir darras shall never destroy such a noble knight as thou art in prison howbeit that thou hast slain three of my sons whereby i was greatly aggrieved  but now shalt thou go and thy fellows     all that ye did said sir darras was by force of knighthood and that was the cause i would not put you to death book ix chap xl  tennyson is accused of emasculating the fierce lusty epic into a moral lesson as if it were to be performed in a drawingroom by an academy of young ladiespresided over i daresay by anglican clergymen  i know not how any one who has read the morte darthur can blame tennyson in the matter  let malory and his sources be blamed if to be moral is to be culpable  a few passages apart there is no coarseness in malory that there are conscience courtesy sweet lives keeping down the base in man amiable words and all that tennyson gives and in mr harrisons theory gives without authority in the romance my quotations from malory demonstrate  they are chosen at a casual opening of his book  that there had not arisen in the world the idea of reverencing conscience before the close of the fifteenth century ad is an extraordinary statement for a critic of history to offer  mr harrison makes his protest because in the conspiracy of silence into which tennysons just fame has hypnotised the critics it is bare honesty to admit defects  i think i am not hypnotised and i do not regard the idylls as the crown of tennysons work  but it is not his defect to have introduced generosity gentleness conscience and chastity where no such things occur in his sources take sir darras  his position is that of priam when he meets achilles who slew his sons except that priam comes as a suppliant sir darras has tristram in his hands and may slay him  he is too polite as mr harrison says  he is too good a christian or too good a gentleman  one would not have given a tripod for the life of achilles had he fallen into the hands of priam  but between 1200 bc or so and the date of malory new ideas about living sweet lives had arisen  where and when do they not arise  a british patrol fired on certain swazis in time of truce  their lieutenant who had been absent when this occurred rode alone to the stronghold of the swazi king sekukoeni and gave himself up expecting death by torture  go sir said the king we too are gentlemen  the idea of a sweet life of honour had dawned even on sekukoeni  it lights up malorys romance and is reflected in tennysons idylls doubtless with some modernism of expression  that the idylls represent no real world is certain  that tennyson modernises and moralises too much i willingly admit what i deny is that he introduces gentleness courtesy and conscience where his sources have none  indeed this is not a matter of critical opinion but of verifiable fact  any one can read malory and judge for himself  but the world in which the idylls move could not be real for more than a thousand years different races different ages had taken hold of the ancient celtic legends and spiritualised them after their own manner and moulded them to their own ideals  there may have been a historical arthur comes britanniae after the roman withdrawal  ye amherawdyr arthur the emperor arthur may have lived and fought and led the brythons to battle  but there may also have been a brythonic deity or culture hero of the same or of a similar name and myths about him may have been assigned to a real arthur  again the arthur of the old welsh legends was by no means the blameless kingeven in comparatively late french romances he is not blameless  but the process of idealising him went on  still incomplete in malorys compilation where he is often rather otiose and far from royal  tennyson for his purpose completed the idealisation  as to guinevere she was not idealised in the old welsh rhyme    guinevere giant ogurvans daughter naughty young more naughty later   of lancelot and her passion for him the old welsh has nothing to say  probably chretien de troyes by a happy blunder or misconception gave lancelot his love and his preeminent part lancelot was confused with peredur and guinevere with the lady of whom peredur was in quest  the elaine who becomes by lancelot the mother of galahad was lancelots rightful consort as one recognises in her name that of elen the empress whom the story of peredur lancelot by the confusion gives that hero to wife  the second elaine the maid of astolat is another refraction from the original elen  as to the grail it may be a christianised rendering of one or another of the magical and mystic caldrons of welsh or irish legend there is even an apparent celtic source of the mysterious fisher king of the grail romance 12  a sketch of the evolution of the arthurian legends might run thus  sixth to eighth century growth of myth about an arthur real or supposed to be real  tenth century the duchies of normandy and brittany are in close relations by the eleventh century normans know celtic arthurian stories  after 1066 normans in contact with the celtic peoples of this island are in touch with the arthur tales  11301145 works on arthurian matter by geoffrey of monmouth  1155 waces french translation of geoffrey  11501182 chretien de troyes writes poems on arthurian topics  french prose romances on arthur from say 1180 to 1250  those romances reach wales and modify in translations the original welsh legends or in part supplant them  amplifications and recastings are numerous  in 1485 caxton publishes malorys selections from french and english sources the whole being tennysons main source le mort darthur 13   thus the arthur stories originally celtic originally a mass of semipagan legend myth and marchen have been retold and rehandled by norman englishman and frenchman taking on new hues expressing new idealsreligious chivalrous and moral  any poet may work his will on them and tennysons will was to retain the chivalrous courtesy generosity love and asceticism while dimly or brightly veiling or illuminating them with his own ideals  after so many processes from folktale to modern idyll the arthurian world could not be real and real it is not  camelot lies out of space out of time though the colouring is mainly that of the later chivalry and the gleam on the hues is partly derived from celtic fancy of various dates and is partly tennysonian  as the idylls were finally arranged the first the coming of arthur is a remarkable proof of tennysons ingenuity in construction  tales about the birth of arthur varied  in malory uther pendragon the bretwalda in later phrase of britain besieges the duke of tintagil who has a fair wife ygerne in another castle  merlin magically puts on uther the shape of ygernes husband and as her husband she receives him  on that night arthur is begotten by uther and the duke of tintagil his mothers husband is slain in a sortie uther weds ygerne both recognise arthur as their child  however by the celtic custom of fosterage the infant is intrusted to sir ector as his dalt or fosterchild and uther falls in battle  arthur is later approven king by the adventure of drawing from the stone the magic sword that no other king could move  this adventure answers to sigmunds drawing the sword from the branstock in the volsunga saga now men stand up and none would fain be the last to lay hand to the sword apparently stricken into the pillar by woden  but none who came thereto might avail to pull it out for in nowise would it come away howsoever they tugged at it but now up comes sigmund king volsungs son and sets hand to the sword and pulls it from the stock even as if it lay loose before him  the incident in the arthurian as in the volsunga legend is on a par with the golden bough in the sixth book of the aeneid  only the predestined champion such as aeneas can pluck or break or cut the bough       ipse volens facilisque sequetur si te fata vocant   all this ancient popular element in the arthur story is disregarded by tennyson  he does not make uther approach ygerne in the semblance of her lord as zeus approached alcmena in the semblance of her husband amphitryon  he neglects the other ancient test of the proving of arthur by his success in drawing the sword  the poets object is to enfold the origin and birth of arthur in a spiritual mystery  this is deftly accomplished by aid of the various versions of the tale that reach king leodogran when arthur seeks the hand of his daughter guinevere for arthurs title to the crown is still disputed so leodogran makes inquiries  the answers first leave it dubious whether arthur is son of gorlois husband of ygerne or of uther who slew gorlois and married her   enforced she was to wed him in her tears   the celtic custom of fosterage is overlooked and merlin gives the child to anton not as the customary dalt but to preserve the babe from danger  queen bellicent then tells leodogran from the evidence of bleys merlins master in necromancy the story of arthurs miraculous advent   and down the wave and in the flame was borne a naked babe and rode to merlins feet who stoopt and caught the babe and cried the king here is an heir for uther   but merlin when asked by bellicent to corroborate the statement of bleys merely   answerd in riddling triplets of old time   finally leodograns faith is confirmed by a vision  thus doubtfully amidst rumour and portent cloud and spiritual light comes arthur  from the great deep he comes and in as strange fashion at the end to the great deep he goesa king to be accepted in faith or rejected by doubt  arthur and his ideal are objects of belief  all goes well while the knights hold that   the king will follow christ and we the king in whom high god hath breathed a secret thing   in history we find the same situation in the france of 1429    the king will follow jeanne and we the king   while this faith held all went well when the king ceased to follow the spell was brokenthe maid was martyred  in this sense the poet conceives the coming of arthur a sign to be spoken against a test of high purposes a belief redeeming and ennobling till faith fails and the little rift within the lute the love of lancelot and guinevere makes discord of the music  as matter of legend it is to be understood that guinevere did not recognise arthur when first he rode below her window    since he neither wore on helm or shield the golden symbol of his kinglihood   but lancelot was sent to bring the bride       and returnd among the flowers in may with guinevere   then their long love may have begun as in the story of tristram sent to bring yseult to be the bride of king mark  in malory however lancelot does not come on the scene till after arthurs wedding and return from his conquering expedition to rome  then lancelot wins renown wherefore queen guinevere had him in favour above all other knights and in certain he loved the queen again above all other ladies damosels of his life  lancelot as we have seen is practically a french creation adopted to illustrate the chivalrous theory of love with its bitter fruit  though not of the original celtic stock of legend sir lancelot makes the romance what it is and draws down the tragedy that originally turned on the sin of arthur himself the sin that gave birth to the traitor modred  but the mediaeval romancers disguised that form of the story and the process of idealising arthur reached such heights in the middle ages that tennyson thought himself at liberty to paint the flos regum the blameless king  he followed the brut ab arthur  in short god has not made since adam was the man more perfect than arthur this is remote from the arthur of the oldest celtic legends but justifies the poet in adapting arthur to the ideal hero of the idylls   ideal manhood closed in real man rather than that grey king whose name a ghost streams like a cloud manshaped from mountainpeak and cleaves to cairn and cromlech still or him of geoffreys book or him of malleors one touched by the adulterous finger of a time that hovered between war and wantonness and crownings and dethronements   the poetical beauties of the coming of arthur excel those of gareth and lynette  the sons of lot and bellicent seem to have been originally regarded as the incestuous offspring of arthur and his sister the wife of king lot  next it was represented that arthur was ignorant of the relationship  mr rhys supposes that the mythical scandal still present in malory as a sin of ignorance arose from blending the celtic arthur as culture hero with an older divine personage such as zeus who marries his sister hera  marriages of brother and sister are familiar in the egyptian royal house and that of the incas  but the poet has a perfect right to disregard a scandalous myth which obviously crystallised later about the figure of the mythical celtic arthur was an incongruous accretion to his legend  gareth therefore is merely arthurs nephew not son in the poem as are gawain and the traitor modred  the story seems to be rather mediaeval french than celtica mingling of the spirit of fabliau and popular fairy tale  the poet has added to its lightness almost frivolity the description of the unreal city of camelot built to music as when   ilion like a mist rose into towers   he has also brought in the allegory of death which when faced proves to be a blooming boy behind the mask  the courtesy and prowess of lancelot lead up to the later development of his character  in the marriage of geraint a rumour has already risen about lancelot and the queen darkening the court and presaging   the worlds loud whisper breaking into storm   for this reason geraint removes enid from camelot to his own land the poet thus early leading up to the sin and the doom of lancelot but this motive does not occur in the welsh story of enid and geraint which tennyson has otherwise followed with unwonted closeness  the tale occurs in french romances in various forms but it appears to have returned by way of france and coloured with french influences to wales where it is one of the later mabinogion the characters are celtic and nud father of edyrn geraints defeated antagonist appears to be recognised by mr rhys as the celtic zeus  the manners and the tournaments are french  in the welsh tale geraint and enid are bedded in arthurs own chamber which seems to be a symbolic commutation of the jus primae noctis a custom of which the very existence is disputed  this unseemly antiquarian detail of course is omitted in the idyll  an abstract of the welsh tale will show how closely tennyson here follows his original  news is brought into arthurs court of the appearance of a white stag  the king arranges a hunt and guinevere asks leave to go and watch the sport  next morning she cannot be wakened though the tale does not aver like the idyll that she was   lost in sweet dreams and dreaming of her love for lancelot   guinevere wakes late and rides through a ford of usk to the hunt geraint follows a goldenhilted sword was at his side and a robe and a surcoat of satin were upon him and two shoes of leather upon his feet and around him was a scarf of blue purple at each corner of which was a golden apple   but guinevere lay late into the morn lost in sweet dreams and dreaming of her love for lancelot and forgetful of the hunt but rose at last a single maiden with her took horse and forded usk and gaind the wood there on a little knoll beside it stayd waiting to hear the hounds but heard instead a sudden sound of hoofs for prince geraint late also wearing neither huntingdress nor weapon save a goldenhilted brand came quickly flashing thro the shallow ford behind them and so gallopd up the knoll a purple scarf at either end whereof there swung an apple of the purest gold swayd round about him as he gallopd up to join them glancing like a dragonfly in summer suit and silks of holiday   the encounter with the dwarf the lady and the knight follows  the prose of the mabinogi may be compared with the verse of tennyson   geraint said gwenhwyvar knowest thou the name of that tall knight yonder  i know him not said he and the strange armour that he wears prevents my either seeing his face or his features go maiden said gwenhwyvar and ask the dwarf who that knight is  then the maiden went up to the dwarf and the dwarf waited for the maiden when he saw her coming towards him  and the maiden inquired of the dwarf who the knight was  i will not tell thee he answered  since thou art so churlish as not to tell me said she i will ask him himself  thou shalt not ask him by my faith said he  wherefore said she  because thou art not of honour sufficient to befit thee to speak to my lord  then the maiden turned her horses head towards the knight upon which the dwarf struck her with the whip that was in his hand across the face and the eyes until the blood flowed forth  and the maiden through the hurt she received from the blow returned to gwenhwyvar complaining of the pain  very rudely has the dwarf treated thee said geraint i will go myself to know who the knight is  go said gwenhwyvar and geraint went up to the dwarf  who is yonder knight said geraint  i will not tell thee said the dwarf  then will i ask him himself said he  that wilt thou not by my faith said the dwarf thou art not honourable enough to speak with my lord  said geraint i have spoken with men of equal rank with him  and he turned his horses head towards the knight but the dwarf overtook him and struck him as he had done the maiden so that the blood coloured the scarf that geraint wore  then geraint put his hand upon the hilt of his sword but he took counsel with himself and considered that it would be no vengeance for him to slay the dwarf and to be attacked unarmed by the armed knight so he returned to where gwenhwyvar was      and while they listend for the distant hunt and chiefly for the baying of cavall king arthurs hound of deepest mouth there rode full slowly by a knight lady and dwarf whereof the dwarf laggd latest and the knight had vizor up and showd a youthful face imperious and of haughtiest lineaments and guinevere not mindful of his face in the kings hall desired his name and sent her maiden to demand it of the dwarf who being vicious old and irritable and doubling all his masters vice of pride made answer sharply that she should not know then will i ask it of himself she said nay by my faith thou shalt not cried the dwarf thou art not worthy evn to speak of him and when she put her horse toward the knight struck at her with his whip and she returnd indignant to the queen whereat geraint exclaiming surely i will learn the name made sharply to the dwarf and askd it of him who answerd as before and when the prince had put his horse in motion toward the knight struck at him with his whip and cut his cheek the princes blood spirted upon the scarf dyeing it and his quick instinctive hand caught at the hilt as to abolish him but he from his exceeding manfulness and pure nobility of temperament wroth to be wroth at such a worm refraind from evn a word   the selfrestraint of geraint who does not slay the dwarf      from his exceeding manfulness and pure nobility of temperament   may appear too polite and too much in accord with the still undiscovered idea of leading sweet lives  however the uninvented idea does occur in the welsh original  then geraint put his hand upon the hilt of his sword but he took counsel with himself and considered that it would be no vengeance for him to slay the dwarf while he also reflects that he would be attacked unarmed by the armed knight  perhaps tennyson may be blamed for omitting this obvious motive for selfrestraint  geraint therefore follows the knight in hope of finding arms and arrives at the town all busy with preparations for the tournament of the sparrowhawk  this was a challenge sparrowhawk  the knight had won it twice and if he won it thrice it would be his to keep  the rest in the tale is exactly followed in the idyll  geraint is entertained by the ruined yniol the youth bears the costrel full of good purchased mead the ruined earl not brewing for himself and enid carries the manchet bread in her veil old and beginning to be worn out  all tennysons own is the beautiful passage       and while he waited in the castle court the voice of enid yniols daughter rang clear thro the open casement of the hall singing and as the sweet voice of a bird heard by the lander in a lonely isle moves him to think what kind of bird it is that sings so delicately clear and make conjecture of the plumage and the form so the sweet voice of enid moved geraint and made him like a man abroad at morn when first the liquid note beloved of men comes flying over many a windy wave to britain and in april suddenly breaks from a coppice gemmd with green and red and he suspends his converse with a friend or it may be the labour of his hands to think or say there is the nightingale so fared it with geraint who thought and said here by gods grace is the one voice for me   yniol frankly admits in the tale that he was in the wrong in the quarrel with his nephew  the poet however gives him the right as is natural  the combat is exactly followed in the idyll as is geraints insistence in carrying his bride to court in her faded silks  geraint however leaves court with enid not because of the scandal about lancelot but to do his duty in his own country  he becomes indolent and uxorious and enid deplores his weakness and awakes his suspicions thus   and one morning in the summer time they were upon their couch and geraint lay upon the edge of it  and enid was without sleep in the apartment which had windows of glass  and the sun shone upon the couch  and the clothes had slipped from off his arms and his breast and he was asleep  then she gazed upon the marvellous beauty of his appearance and she said alas and am i the cause that these arms and this breast have lost their glory and the warlike fame which they once so richly enjoyed  and as she said this the tears dropped from her eyes and they fell upon his breast  and the tears she shed and the words she had spoken awoke him and another thing contributed to awaken him and that was the idea that it was not in thinking of him that she spoke thus but that it was because she loved some other man more than him and that she wished for other society and thereupon geraint was troubled in his mind and he called his squire and when he came to him go quickly said he and prepare my horse and my arms and make them ready  and do thou arise said he to enid and apparel thyself and cause thy horse to be accoutred and clothe thee in the worst ridingdress that thou hast in thy possession  and evil betide me said he if thou returnest here until thou knowest whether i have lost my strength so completely as thou didst say  and if it be so it will then be easy for thee to seek the society thou didst wish for of him of whom thou wast thinking  so she arose and clothed herself in her meanest garments  i know nothing lord said she of thy meaning neither wilt thou know at this time said he      at last it chanced that on a summer morn they sleeping each by either the new sun beat thro the blindless casement of the room and heated the strong warrior in his dreams who moving cast the coverlet aside and bared the knotted column of his throat the massive square of his heroic breast and arms on which the standing muscle sloped as slopes a wild brook oer a little stone running too vehemently to break upon it and enid woke and sat beside the couch admiring him and thought within herself was ever man so grandly made as he then like a shadow past the peoples talk and accusation of uxoriousness across her mind and bowing over him low to her own heart piteously she said     o noble breast and allpuissant arms am i the cause i the poor cause that men reproach you saying all your force is gone i am the cause because i dare not speak and tell him what i think and what they say and yet i hate that he should linger here i cannot love my lord and not his name far liefer had i gird his harness on him and ride with him to battle and stand by and watch his mightful hand striking great blows at caitiffs and at wrongers of the world far better were i laid in the dark earth not hearing any more his noble voice not to be folded more in these dear arms and darkend from the high light in his eyes than that my lord thro me should suffer shame am i so bold and could i so stand by and see my dear lord wounded in the strife or maybe pierced to death before mine eyes and yet not dare to tell him what i think and how men slur him saying all his force is melted into mere effeminacy o me i fear that i am no true wife     half inwardly half audibly she spoke and the strong passion in her made her weep true tears upon his broad and naked breast and these awoke him and by great mischance he heard but fragments of her later words and that she feard she was not a true wife and then he thought in spite of all my care for all my pains poor man for all my pains she is not faithful to me and i see her weeping for some gay knight in arthurs hall then tho he loved and reverenced her too much to dream she could be guilty of foul act right thro his manful breast darted the pang that makes a man in the sweet face of her whom he loves most lonely and miserable at this he hurld his huge limbs out of bed and shook his drowsy squire awake and cried my charger and her palfrey then to her i will ride forth into the wilderness for tho it seems my spurs are yet to win i have not falln so low as some would wish and thou put on thy worst and meanest dress and ride with me  and enid askd amazed if enid errs let enid learn her fault but he i charge thee ask not but obey then she bethought her of a faded silk a faded mantle and a faded veil and moving toward a cedarn cabinet wherein she kept them folded reverently with sprigs of summer laid between the folds she took them and arrayd herself therein remembering when first he came on her drest in that dress and how he loved her in it and all her foolish fears about the dress and all his journey to her as himself had told her and their coming to the court   tennysons   arms on which the standing muscle sloped as slopes a wild brook oer a little stone running too vehemently to break upon it   is suggested perhaps by theocritusthe muscles on his brawny arms stood out like rounded rocks that the winter torrent has rolled and worn smooth in the great swirling stream idyll xxii  the second part of the poem follows the original less closely  thus limours in the tale is not an old suitor of enid edyrn does not appear to the rescue certain cruel games veiled in a magic mist occur in the tale and are omitted by the poet gwyffert petit so called by the franks whom the cymry call the little king in the tale is not a character in the idyll and generally the gross celtic exaggerations of geraints feats are toned down by tennyson in other respects as when geraint eats the mowers dinner the tale supplies the materials  but it does not dwell tenderly on the reconciliation  the tale is more or less in the vein of patient grizel and he who told it is more concerned with the fighting than with amoris redintegratio and the sufferings of enid  the idyll is enriched with many beautiful pictures from nature such as this   but at the flash and motion of the man they vanishd panicstricken like a shoal of darting fish that on a summer morn adown the crystal dykes at camelot come slipping oer their shadows on the sand but if a man who stands upon the brink but lift a shining hand against the sun there is not left the twinkle of a fin betwixt the cressy islets white in flower so scared but at the motion of the man fled all the boon companions of the earl and left him lying in the public way   in balin and balan tennyson displays great constructive power and remarkable skill in moulding the most recalcitrant materials  balin or balyn according to mr rhys is the belinus of geoffrey of monmouth whose name represents the celtic divinity described in latin as apollo belenus or belinus 14  in geoffrey belinus euphemerised or reduced from god to hero has a brother brennius the celtic bran king of britain from caithness to the humber belinus drives bran into exile  thus it is seen that belinus or balyn was mythologically speaking the natural enemy as apollo belinus the radiant god of the dark divinity bran or balan  if this view be correct the two brothers answer to the good and bad principles of myths like that of the huron iouskeha the sun and anatensic the moon or rather taouiscara and iouskeha the hostile brothers black and white 15  these mythical brethren are in malory two knights of northumberland balin the wild and balan their adventures are mixed up with a hostile lady of the lake whom balin slays in arthurs presence with a sword which none but balin can draw from sheath and with an evil blackfaced knight garlon invisible at will whom balin slays in the castle of the knights brother king pellam  pursued from room to room by pellam balin finds himself in a chamber full of relics of joseph of arimathea there he seizes a spear the very spear with which the roman soldier pierced the side of the crucified and wounds pellam  the castle falls in ruins through that dolorous stroke  pellam becomes the maimed king who can only be healed by the holy grail  apparently celtic myths of obscure antiquity have been adapted in france and interwoven with fables about joseph of arimathea and christian mysteries  it is not possible here to go into the complicated learning of the subject  in malory balin after dealing the dolorous stroke borrows a strange shield from a knight and thus accoutred meets his brother balan who does not recognise him  they fight both die and are buried in one tomb and galahad later achieves the adventure of winning balins sword  thus endeth the tale of balyn and of balan two brethren born in northumberland good knights says malory simply and unconscious of the strange mythological medley under the coat armour of romance  the materials then seemed confused and obdurate but tennyson works them into the course of the fatal love of lancelot and guinevere and into the spiritual texture of the idylls  balin has been expelled from court for the wildness that gives him his name balin le sauvage  he had buffeted a squire in hall  he and balan await all challengers beside a well  arthur encounters and dismounts them balin devotes himself to selfconquest  then comes tidings that pellam of old leagued with lot against arthur has taken to religion collects relics claims descent from joseph of arimathea and owns the sacred spear that pierced the side of christ  but garlon is with him the knight invisible who appears to come from an irish source or at least has a parallel in irish legend  this garlon has an unknightly way of killing men by viewless blows from the rear  balan goes to encounter garlon  balin remains learning courtesy modelling himself on lancelot and gaining leave to bear guineveres crown matrimonial for his cognisancewhich of course balan does not know    as golden earnest of a better life   but balin sees reason to think that lancelot and guinevere love even too well      then chanced one morning that sir balin sat closebowerd in that garden nigh the hall a walk of roses ran from door to door a walk of lilies crost it to the bower and down that range of roses the great queen came with slow steps the morning on her face and all in shadow from the counter door sir lancelot as to meet her then at once as if he saw not glanced aside and paced the long white walk of lilies toward the bower followd the queen sir balin heard her prince art thou so little loyal to thy queen as pass without good morrow to thy queen to whom sir lancelot with his eyes on earth fain would i still be loyal to the queen yea so she said but so to pass me by  so loyal scarce is loyal to thyself whom all men rate the king of courtesy let be  ye stand fair lord as in a dream     then lancelot with his hand among the flowers yeafor a dream  last night methought i saw that maiden saint who stands with lily in hand in yonder shrine  all round her prest the dark and all the light upon her silver face flowd from the spiritual lily that she held lo these her emblems drew mine eyesaway for see how perfectpure  as light a flush as hardly tints the blossom of the quince would mar their charm of stainless maidenhood     sweeter to me she said this garden rose deephued and manyfolded sweeter still the wildwood hyacinth and the bloom of may prince we have riddn before among the flowers in those fair daysnot all as cool as these tho seasonearlier  art thou sad or sick our noble king will send thee his own leech  sick or for any matter angerd at me     then lancelot lifted his large eyes they dwelt deeptranced on hers and could not fall  her hue changed at his gaze  so turning side by side they past and balin started from his bower     queen subject but i see not what i see damsel and lover hear not what i hear my father hath begotten me in his wrath i suffer from the things before me know learn nothing am not worthy to be knight a churl a clown and in him gloom on gloom deepend  he sharply caught his lance and shield nor stayd to crave permission of the king but mad for strange adventure dashd away   balin is disillusioned his faith in the ideal is shaken if not shattered  he rides at adventure  arriving at the halfruined castle of pellam that dubious devotee he hears garlon insult guinevere but restrains himself  next day again insulted for bearing the crown scandalous on his shield he strikes garlon down is pursued seizes the sacred spear and escapes  vivien meets him in the woods drops scandal in his ears and so maddens him that he defaces his shield with the crown of guinevere  her song and her words         this fire of heaven this old sunworship boy will rise again and beat the cross to earth and break the king and all his table   might be forced into an allegory of the revived pride of life at the renaissance and after  the maddened yells of balin strike the ear of balan who thinks he has met the foul knight garlon that   tramples on the goodly shield to show his loathing of our order and the queen   they fight fatally wound and finally recognise each other  balan trying to restore balins faith in guinevere who is merely slandered by garlon and vivien  balin acknowledges that his wildness has been their common bane and they die either locked in eithers arms  there is nothing in malory nor in any other source so far as i am aware which suggested to tennyson the clou of the situationthe use of guineveres crown as a cognisance by balin  this device enables the poet to weave the rather confused and unintelligible adventures of balin and balan into the scheme and to make it a stage in the progress of his fable  that balin was reckless and wild malory bears witness but his endeavours to conquer himself and reach the ideal set by lancelot are tennysons addition with all the tragedy of balins disenchantment and despair  the strange fantastic house of pellam full of the most sacred things   in which he scarce could spy the christ for saints   yet sheltering the human fiend garlon is supplied by malory whose predecessors probably blended more than one myth of the old cymry into the romance washed over with christian colouring  as malory tells this part of the tale it is perhaps more strange and effective than in the idyll  the introduction of vivien into this adventure is wholly due to tennyson  her appearance here leads up to her triumph in the poem which follows merlin and vivien  the nature and origin of merlin are something of a mystery  hints and rumours of merlin as of arthur stream from hill and grave as far north as tweedside  if he was a historical person myths of magic might crystallise round him as round virgil in italy  the process would be the easier in a country where the practices of druidry still lingered and revived after the retreat of the romans the mediaeval romancers invented a legend that merlin was a virgin born child of satan  in tennyson he may be guessed to represent the fabled esoteric lore of old religions with their vague pantheisms and such magic as the tapas of brahmanic legends  he is wise with a riddling evasive wisdom  the builder of camelot the prophet a shadow of druidry clinging to the christian king  his wisdom cannot avail him  if he beholds his own mischance with a glassy countenance he cannot avoid his shapen fate  he becomes assotted of vivien and goes openeyed to his doom  the enchantress vivien is one of that dubious company of ladies of the lake now friendly now treacherous  probably these ladies are the fairies of popular celtic tradition taken up into the more elaborate poetry of cymric literature and mediaeval romance  mr rhys traces vivien or nimue or nyneue back through a series of palaeographic changes and errors to rhiannon wife of pwyll a kind of lady of the lake he thinks but the identification is not very satisfactory  vivien is certainly one of the damsels of the lake in malory and the damsels of the lake seem to be lake fairies with all their beguilements and strange unstable loves  and always merlin lay about the lady to have her maidenhood and she was ever passing weary of him and fain would have been delivered of him for she was afraid of him because he was a devils son     so by her subtle working she made merlin to go under that stone to let her wit of the marvels there but she wrought so there for him that he came never out for all the craft he could do  and so she departed and left merlin  the sympathy of malory is not with the enchanter  in the idylls as finally published vivien is born on a battlefield of death with a nature perverted and an instinctive hatred of the good  wherefore she leaves the court of king mark to make mischief in camelot  she is in fact the ideal minx a character not elsewhere treated by tennyson      she hated all the knights and heard in thought their lavish comment when her name was named for once when arthur walking all alone vext at a rumour issued from herself of some corruption crept among his knights had met her vivien being greeted fair would fain have wrought upon his cloudy mood with reverent eyes mockloyal shaken voice and flutterd adoration and at last with dark sweet hints of some who prized him more than who should prize him most at which the king had gazed upon her blankly and gone by but one had watchd and had not held his peace it made the laughter of an afternoon that vivien should attempt the blameless king and after that she set herself to gain him the most famous man of all those times merlin who knew the range of all their arts had built the king his havens ships and halls was also bard and knew the starry heavens the people calld him wizard whom at first she playd about with slight and sprightly talk and vivid smiles and faintlyvenomd points of slander glancing here and grazing there and yielding to his kindlier moods the seer would watch her at her petulance and play evn when they seemd unloveable and laugh as those that watch a kitten thus he grew tolerant of what he half disdaind and she perceiving that she was but half disdaind began to break her sports with graver fits turn red or pale would often when they met sigh fully or allsilent gaze upon him with such a fixt devotion that the old man tho doubtful felt the flattery and at times would flatter his own wish in age for love and half believe her true  for thus at times he waverd but that other clung to him fixt in her will and so the seasons went   vivien is modern enoughif any type of character is modern  at all events there is no such blanche amory of a girl in the old legends and romances  in these merlin fatigues the lady by his love she learns his arts and gets rid of him as she can  his forebodings in the idyll contain a magnificent image      there lay she all her length and kissd his feet as if in deepest reverence and in love a twist of gold was round her hair a robe of samite without price that more exprest than hid her clung about her lissome limbs in colour like the satinshining palm on sallows in the windy gleams of march and while she kissd them crying trample me dear feet that i have followd thro the world and i will pay you worship tread me down and i will kiss you for it he was mute so dark a forethought rolld about his brain as on a dull day in an ocean cave the blind wave feeling round his long seahall in silence   we think of the blinded cyclops groping round his cave like the blind wave feeling round his long seahall  the richness the many shining contrasts and immortal lines in vivien seem almost too noble for a subject not easily redeemed and the picture of the ideal court lying in full corruption  next to elaine jowett wrote that he admired vivien the most the naughty one which seems to me a work of wonderful power and skill  it is most elegant and fanciful  i am not surprised at your delilah beguiling the wise man she is quite equal to it  the dramatic versatility of tennysons genius his power of creating the most various characters is nowhere better displayed than in the contrast between the vivien and the elaine  vivien is a type her adventure is of a nature which he has not elsewhere handled  thackeray who admired the idylls so enthusiastically might have recognised in vivien a character not unlike some of his own as dark as becky sharp more terrible in her selfishness than that beatrix esmond who is still a paragon and in her creators despite a queen of hearts in elaine on the other hand tennyson has drawn a girl so innocently passionate and told a tale of love that never found his earthly close so delicately beautiful that we may perhaps place this idyll the highest of his poems on love and reckon it the gem of the idylls the central diamond in the diamond crown  reading elaine once more after an interval of years one is captivated by its grace its pathos its nobility  the poet had touched on some unidentified form of the story long before in the lady of shalott that poem had the mystery of romance but in human interest could not compete with elaine if indeed any poem of tennysons can be ranked with this matchless idyll  the mere invention and as we may say charpentage are of the first order  the materials in malory though beautiful are simple and left a field for the poets invention 16  arthur with the scots and northern knights means to encounter all comers at a whitsuntide tourney  guinevere is ill and cannot go to the jousts while lancelot makes excuse that he is not healed of a wound  wherefore the king was heavy and passing wroth and so he departed towards winchester  the queen then blamed lancelot people will say they deceive arthur  madame said sir lancelot i allow your wit it is of late come that ye were wise  in the idyll guinevere speaks as if their early loves had been as conspicuous as according to george buchanan were those of queen mary and bothwell lancelot will go to the tourney and despite guineveres warning will take part against arthur and his own fierce northern kinsmen he rides to astolatthat is gylfordwhere arthur sees him  he borrows the blank shield of sir torre and the company of his brother sir lavaine  elaine cast such a love unto sir lancelot that she would never withdraw her love wherefore she died  at her prayer and for better disguise as he had never worn a ladys favour lancelot carried her scarlet pearlembroidered sleeve in his helmet and left his shield in elaines keeping  the tourney passes as in the poem gawain recognising lancelot but puzzled by the favour he wears  the wounded lancelot thought to do what he might while he might endure  when he is offered the prize he is so sore hurt that he takes no force of no honour  he rides into a wood where lavaine draws forth the spear  lavaine brings lancelot to the hermit once a knight  i have seen the day says the hermit i would have loved him the worse because he was against my lord king arthur for some time  i was one of the fellowship of the round table but i thank god now i am otherwise disposed  gawain seeking the wounded knight comes to astolat where elaine declares he is the man in the world that i first loved and truly he is the last that ever i shall love  gawain on seeing the shield tells elaine that the wounded knight is lancelot and she goes to seek him and lavaine  gawain does not pay court to elaine nor does arthur rebuke him as in the poem  when guinevere heard that lancelot bore another ladys favour she was nigh out of her mind for wrath and expressed her anger to sir bors for gawain had spoken of the maid of astolat  bors tells this to lancelot who is tended by elaine but i well see said sir bors by her diligence about you that she loveth you entirely  that me repenteth said sir lancelot said sir bors sir she is not the first that hath lost her pain upon you and that is the more pity  when lancelot recovers and returns to astolat she declares her love with the frankness of ladies in mediaeval romance  have mercy upon me and suffer me not to die for thy love  lancelot replies with the courtesy and the offers of service which became him  of all this said the maiden i will none for but if ye will wed me or be my paramour at the least wit you well sir lancelot my good days are done  this was a difficult pass for the poet living in other days of other manners  his art appears in the turn which he gives to elaines declaration      but when sir lancelots deadly hurt was whole to astolat returning rode the three there morn by morn arraying her sweet self in that wherein she deemd she lookd her best she came before sir lancelot for she thought if i be loved these are my festal robes if not the victims flowers before he fall and lancelot ever prest upon the maid that she should ask some goodly gift of him for her own self or hers and do not shun to speak the wish most near to your true heart such service have ye done me that i make my will of yours and prince and lord am i in mine own land and what i will i can then like a ghost she lifted up her face but like a ghost without the power to speak and lancelot saw that she withheld her wish and bode among them yet a little space till he should learn it and one morn it chanced he found her in among the garden yews and said delay no longer speak your wish seeing i go today  then out she brake going and we shall never see you more and i must die for want of one bold word speak  that i live to hear he said is yours then suddenly and passionately she spoke i have gone mad  i love you  let me die ah sister answerd lancelot what is this and innocently extending her white arms your love she said your loveto be your wife and lancelot answerd had i chosen to wed i had been wedded earlier sweet elaine but now there never will be wife of mine no no she cried i care not to be wife but to be with you still to see your face to serve you and to follow you thro the world and lancelot answerd nay the world the world all ear and eye with such a stupid heart to interpret ear and eye and such a tongue to blare its own interpretationnay full ill then should i quit your brothers love and your good fathers kindness  and she said not to be with you not to see your face  alas for me then my good days are done   so she dies and is borne down thames to london the fairest corpse and she lay as though she had smiled  her letter is read  ye might have showed her said the queen some courtesy and gentleness that might have preserved her life and so the two are reconciled  such in brief is the tender old tale of true love with the shining courtesy of lavaine and the father of the maid who speak no word of anger against lancelot  for since first i saw my lord sir lancelot says lavaine i could never depart from him nor nought i will if i may follow him  she doth as i do  to the simple and moving story tennyson adds by way of ornament the diamonds the prize of the tourney and the manner of their finding      for arthur long before they crownd him king roving the trackless realms of lyonnesse had found a glen gray boulder and black tarn a horror lived about the tarn and clave like its own mists to all the mountain side for here two brothers one a king had met and fought together but their names were lost and each had slain his brother at a blow and down they fell and made the glen abhorrd and there they lay till all their bones were bleachd and lichend into colour with the crags and he that once was king had on a crown of diamonds one in front and four aside and arthur came and labouring up the pass all in a misty moonshine unawares had trodden that crownd skeleton and the skull brake from the nape and from the skull the crown rolld into light and turning on its rims fled like a glittering rivulet to the tarn and down the shingly scaur he plunged and caught and set it on his head and in his heart heard murmurs lo thou likewise shalt be king   the diamonds reappear in the scene of guineveres jealousy      all in an oriel on the summer side vineclad of arthurs palace toward the stream they met and lancelot kneeling utterd queen lady my liege in whom i have my joy take what i had not won except for you these jewels and make me happy making them an armlet for the roundest arm on earth or necklace for a neck to which the swans is tawnier than her cygnets  these are words your beauty is your beauty and i sin in speaking yet o grant my worship of it words as we grant grief tears  such sin in words perchance we both can pardon  but my queen i hear of rumours flying thro your court our bond as not the bond of man and wife should have in it an absoluter trust to make up that defect  let rumours be when did not rumours fly these as i trust that you trust me in your own nobleness i may not well believe that you believe     while thus he spoke half turnd away the queen brake from the vast orielembowering vine leaf after leaf and tore and cast them off till all the place whereon she stood was green then when he ceased in one cold passive hand received at once and laid aside the gems there on a table near her and replied     it may be i am quicker of belief than you believe me lancelot of the lake our bond is not the bond of man and wife this good is in it whatsoeer of ill it can be broken easier  i for you this many a year have done despite and wrong to one whom ever in my heart of hearts i did acknowledge nobler  what are these diamonds for me they had been thrice their worth being your gift had you not lost your own to loyal hearts the value of all gifts must vary as the givers  not for me for her for your new fancy  only this grant me i pray you  have your joys apart i doubt not that however changed you keep so much of what is graceful  and myself would shun to break those bounds of courtesy in which as arthurs queen i move and rule so cannot speak my mind  an end to this a strange one yet i take it with amen so pray you add my diamonds to her pearls deck her with these tell her she shines me down an armlet for an arm to which the queens is haggard or a necklace for a neck o as much faireras a faith once fair was richer than these diamondshers not mine  nay by the mother of our lord himself or hers or mine mine now to work my will  she shall not have them        saying which she seized and thro the casement standing wide for heat flung them and down they flashd and smote the stream then from the smitten surface flashd as it were diamonds to meet them and they past away then while sir lancelot leant in half disdain at love life all things on the window ledge close underneath his eyes and right across where these had fallen slowly past the barge whereon the lily maid of astolat lay smiling like a star in blackest night   this affair of the diamonds is the chief addition to the old tale in which we already see the curse of lawless love fallen upon the jealous queen and the longenduring lancelot  this is not the first time said sir lancelot that ye have been displeased with me causeless but madame ever i must suffer you but what sorrow i endure i take no force that is i disregard  the romance and the poet in his own despite cannot but make lancelot the man we love not arthur or another  human nature perversely sides with guinevere against the blameless king      she broke into a little scornful laugh arthur my lord arthur the faultless king that passionate perfection my good lord  but who can gaze upon the sun in heaven he never spake word of reproach to me he never had a glimpse of mine untruth he cares not for me  only here today there gleamd a vague suspicion in his eyes some meddling rogue has tamperd with himelse rapt in this fancy of his table round and swearing men to vows impossible to make them like himself  but friend to me he is all fault who hath no fault at all for who loves me must have a touch of earth the low sun makes the colour  i am yours not arthurs as ye know save by the bond   it is not the beautiful queen who wins us our hearts are with the innocence of love in elaine  but lancelot has the charm that captivated lavaine and tennysons arthur remains   the moral child without the craft to rule else had he not lost me   indeed the romance of malory makes arthur deserve the pretty popular name such manhood earns by his conduct as regards guinevere when she is accused by her enemies in the later chapters  yet malory does not finally condone the sin which baffles lancelots quest of the holy grail  tennyson at first was in doubt as to writing on the grail for certain respects of reverence  when he did approach the theme it was in a method of extreme condensation  the romances on the grail outrun the length even of mediaeval poetry and prose  they are exceedingly confused as was natural if that hypothesis which regards the story as a christianised form of obscure celtic myth be correct  sir percivales sister in the idyll has the first vision of the grail   sweet brother i have seen the holy grail for waked at dead of night i heard a sound as of a silver horn from oer the hills blown and i thought it is not arthurs use to hunt by moonlight and the slender sound as from a distance beyond distance grew coming upon meo never harp nor horn nor aught we blow with breath or touch with hand was like that music as it came and then streamd thro my cell a cold and silver beam and down the long beam stole the holy grail rosered with beatings in it as if alive till all the white walls of my cell were dyed with rosy colours leaping on the wall and then the music faded and the grail past and the beam decayd and from the walls the rosy quiverings died into the night so now the holy thing is here again among us brother fast thou too and pray and tell thy brother knights to fast and pray that so perchance the vision may be seen by thee and those and all the world be heald   galahad son of lancelot and the first elaine who became lancelots mistress by art magic then vows himself to the quest and after the vision in hall at camelot the knights except arthur follow his example to arthurs grief  ye follow wandering fires  probably or perhaps the poet indicates dislike of hasty spiritual enthusiasms of seeking for a sign and of the mysticism which betokens want of faith  the middle ages more than many readers know were ages of doubt  men desired the witness of the senses to the truth of what the church taught they wished to see that naked child of the romance smite himself into the wafer of the sacrament the author of the imitatio christi discourages such vain and too curious inquiries as helped to rend the church and divided christendom into hostile camps  the quest of the actual grail was a knightly form of theological research into the unsearchable undertaken often in a secular spirit of adventure by sinful men the poets heart is rather with human things      o brother askd ambrosiusfor in sooth these ancient booksand they would win theeteem only i find not there this holy grail with miracles and marvels like to these not all unlike which oftentime i read who read but on my breviary with ease till my head swims and then go forth and pass down to the little thorpe that lies so close and almost plasterd like a martins nest to these old wallsand mingle with our folk and knowing every honest face of theirs as well as ever shepherd knew his sheep and every homely secret in their hearts delight myself with gossip and old wives and ills and aches and teethings lyingsin and mirthful sayings children of the place that have no meaning half a league away or lulling random squabbles when they rise chafferings and chatterings at the marketcross rejoice small man in this small world of mine yea even in their hens and in their eggs   this appears to be tennysons original reading of the quest of the grail  his own mysticism which did not strive or cry or seek after marvels though marvels might come unsought is expressed in arthurs words      and spake i not too truly o my knights was i too dark a prophet when i said to those who went upon the holy quest that most of them would follow wandering fires lost in the quagmirelost to me and gone and left me gazing at a barren board and a lean orderscarce returnd a tithe  and out of those to whom the vision came my greatest hardly will believe he saw another hath beheld it afar off and leaving human wrongs to right themselves cares but to pass into the silent life and one hath had the vision face to face and now his chair desires him here in vain however they may crown him otherwhere     and some among you held that if the king had seen the sight he would have sworn the vow not easily seeing that the king must guard that which he rules and is but as the hind to whom a space of land is given to plow who may not wander from the allotted field before his work be done but being done let visions of the night or of the day come as they will and many a time they come until this earth he walks on seems not earth this light that strikes his eyeball is not light this air that smites his forehead is not air but visionyea his very hand and foot  in moments when he feels he cannot die and knows himself no vision to himself nor the high god a vision nor that one who rose again  ye have seen what ye have seen     so spake the king  i knew not all he meant   the closing lines declare as far as the poet could declare them these subjective experiences of his which in a manner rarely parallelled coloured and formed his thought on the highest things he introduces them even into this poem on a topic which because of its sacred associations he for long did not venture to touch  in pelleas and ettarrewhich deals with the sorrows of one of the young knights who fill up the gaps left at the round table by the mischances of the questit would be difficult to trace a celtic original  for malory not celtic legend supplied tennyson with the germinal idea of a poem which in the romance has no bearing on the final catastrophe  pelleas a king of the isles loves the beautiful ettarre a great lady and for her wins at a tourney the prize of the golden circlet  but she hates and despises him and sir gawain is a spectator when as in the poem the felon knights of ettarre bind and insult their conqueror pelleas  gawain promises to win the love of ettarre for pelleas and as in the poem borrows his arms and horse and pretends to have slain him  but in place of turning ettarres heart towards pelleas gawain becomes her lover and pelleas detecting them asleep lays his naked sword on their necks he then rides home to die but nimue vivien the lady of the lake restores him to health and sanity  his fever gone he scorns ettarre who by nimues enchantment now loves him as much as she had hated him  pelleas weds nimue and ettarre dies of a broken heart  tennyson of course could not make nimue his vivien do anything benevolent  he therefore closes his poem by a repetition of the effect in the case of balin  pelleas is driven desperate by the treachery of gawain the reported infidelity of guinevere and the general corruption of the ideal  a shadow falls on lancelot and guinevere and modred sees that his hour is drawing nigh  in spite of beautiful passages this is not one of the finest of the idylls save for the study of the fierce hateful and beautiful grande dame ettarre  the narrative does little to advance the general plot  in the original of malory it has no connection with the lancelot cycle except as far as it reveals the treachery of gawain the gay and fairspoken light of love brother of the traitor modred  a simpler treatment of the theme may be read in mr swinburnes beautiful poem the tale of balen  it is in the last tournament that modred finds the beginning of his opportunity  the brief life of the ideal has burned itself out as the year in its vernal beauty when arthur came is burning out in autumn  the poem is purposely autumnal with the autumn not of mellow fruitfulness but of the flying gold of the ruined woodlands and the dank odours of decay  in that miserable season is held the tourney of the dead innocence with the bloodred prize of rubies with a wise touch tennyson has represented the court as fallen not into vice only and crime but into positive vulgarity and bad taste the tournament is a carnival of the smart and the thirdrate courtesy is dead even tristram is brutal and in iseult hatred of her husband is as powerful as love of her lover  the satire strikes at england where the world has never been corrupt with a good grace it is a passage of arms neither gentle nor joyous that lancelot presides over      the sudden trumpet sounded as in a dream to ears but halfawaked then one low roll of autumn thunder and the jousts began and ever the wind blew and yellowing leaf and gloom and gleam and shower and shorn plume went down it  sighing weariedly as one who sits and gazes on a faded fire when all the goodlier guests are past away sat their great umpire looking oer the lists he saw the laws that ruled the tournament broken but spake not once a knight cast down before his throne of arbitration cursed the dead babe and the follies of the king and once the laces of a helmet crackd and showd him like a vermin in its hole modred a narrow face  anon he heard the voice that billowd round the barriers roar an oceansounding welcome to one knight but newlyenterd taller than the rest and armourd all in forest green whereon there tript a hundred tiny silver deer and wearing but a hollyspray for crest with everscattering berries and on shield a spear a harp a bugletristramlate from overseas in brittany returnd and marriage with a princess of that realm isolt the whitesir tristram of the woods  whom lancelot knew had held sometime with pain his own against him and now yearnd to shake the burthen off his heart in one full shock with tristram evn to death  his strong hands gript and dinted the gilt dragons right and left until he groand for wrathso many of those that ware their ladies colours on the casque drew from before sir tristram to the bounds and there with gibes and flickering mockeries stood while he mutterd craven crests  o shame what faith have these in whom they sware to love the glory of our round table is no more     so tristram won and lancelot gave the gems not speaking other word than hast thou won art thou the purest brother  see the hand wherewith thou takest this is red to whom tristram half plagued by lancelots languorous mood made answer ay but wherefore toss me this like a dry bone cast to some hungry hound let be thy fair queens fantasy  strength of heart and might of limb but mainly use and skill are winners in this pastime of our king my handbelike the lance hath dript upon it  no blood of mine i trow but o chief knight right arm of arthur in the battlefield great brother thou nor i have made the world be happy in thy fair queen as i in mine     and tristram round the gallery made his horse caracole then bowd his homage bluntly saying fair damsels each to him who worships each sole queen of beauty and of love behold this day my queen of beauty is not here and most of these were mute some angerd one murmuring all courtesy is dead and one the glory of our round table is no more     then fell thick rain plume droopt and mantle clung and pettish cries awoke and the wan day went glooming down in wet and weariness but under her black brows a swarthy one laughd shrilly crying praise the patient saints our one white day of innocence hath past tho somewhat draggled at the skirt  so be it the snowdrop only flowering thro the year would make the world as blank as wintertide comelet us gladden their sad eyes our queens and lancelots at this nights solemnity with all the kindlier colours of the field   arthurs last victory over a robber knight is ingloriously squalid      he ended  arthur knew the voice the face wellnigh was helmethidden and the name went wandering somewhere darkling in his mind and arthur deignd not use of word or sword but let the drunkard as he stretchd from horse to strike him overbalancing his bulk down from the causeway heavily to the swamp fall as the crest of some slowarching wave heard in dead night along that tableshore drops flat and after the great waters break whitening for half a league and thin themselves far over sands marbled with moon and cloud from less and less to nothing thus he fell headheavy then the knights who watchd him roard and shouted and leapt down upon the falln there trampled out his face from being known and sank his head in mire and slimed themselves nor heard the king for their own cries but sprang thro open doors and swording right and left men women on their sodden faces hurld the tables over and the wines and slew till all the rafters rang with womanyells and all the pavement streamd with massacre then echoing yell with yell they fired the tower which half that autumn night like the live north redpulsing up thro alioth and alcor made all above it and a hundred meres about it as the water moab saw come round by the east and out beyond them flushd the long low dune and lazyplunging sea   guinevere is one of the greatest of the idylls  malory makes lancelot more sympathetic his fight unarmed in guineveres chamber against the felon knights is one of his most spirited scenes  tennyson omits this and omits all the unpardonable behaviour of arthur as narrated in malory  critics have usually condemned the last parting of guinevere and arthur because the king doth preach too much to an unhappy woman who has no reply  the position of arthur is not easily redeemable  it is difficult to conceive that a noble nature could be or should be blind so long he does rehabilitate his queen in her own selfrespect perhaps by assuring her that he loves her still   let no man dream but that i love thee still   had he said that one line and no more we might have loved him better  in the idylls we have not malorys last meeting of lancelot and guinevere one of the scenes in which the wandering composite romance ends as nobly as the iliad  the passing of arthur except for a new introductory passage of great beauty and appropriateness is the morte darthur first published in 1842   so all day long the noise of battle rolld among the mountains by the winter sea   the year has run its course spring summer gloomy autumn and dies in the mist of arthurs last wintry battle in the west    and the new sun rose bringing the new year   the splendid and sombre procession has passed leaving us to muse as to how far the poet has fulfilled his own ideal  there could be no new epic  he gave a chain of heroic idylls  an epic there could not be for the iliad and odyssey have each a unity of theme a narrative compressed into a few days in the former in the latter into forty days of time  the tragedy of arthurs reign could not so be condensed and tennyson chose the only feasible plan  he has left a work not absolutely perfect indeed but such as he conceived after many tentative essays and such as he desired to achieve  his fame may not rest chiefly on the idylls but they form one of the fairest jewels in the crown that shines with unnumbered gems each with its own glory    chapter viiienoch arden  the dramas    the success of the first volume of the idylls recompensed the poet for the slings and arrows that gave maud a hostile welcome  his next publication was the beautiful tithonus a fit pendant to the ulysses and composed about the same date 183335  a quarter of a century ago tennyson dates it writing in 1860 to the duke of argyll  he had found it when ferreting among my old books he said in search of something for thackeray who was establishing the cornhill magazine  what must the wealth of the poet have been who possessing tithonus in his portfolio did not take the trouble to insert it in the volumes of 1842  nobody knows how many poems of tennysons never even saw pen and ink being composed unwritten and forgotten  at this time we find him recommending mr brownings men and women to the duke who like many tennysonians does not seem to have been a ready convert to his great contemporary  the duke and duchess urged the laureate to attempt the topic of the holy grail but he was not in the mood  indeed the vision of the grail in the early sir galahad is doubtless happier than the allegorical handling of a theme so obscure remote and difficult in the idylls  he wrote his boadicea a piece magnificent in itself but of difficult popular access owing to the metrical experiment  in the autumn of 1860 he revisited cornwall with f t palgrave mr val prinsep and mr holman hunt  they walked in the rain saw tintagel and the scilly isles and were feted by an enthusiastic captain of a little river steamer who was more interested in mr tinman and mr pancake than the celtic boatman of ardtornish  the winter was passed at farringford and the northern farmer was written there a lincolnshire reminiscence in the february of 1861  in autumn the pyrenees were visited by tennyson in company with arthur clough and mr dakyns of clifton college  at cauteretz in august and among memories of the old tour with arthur hallam was written all along the valley  the ways however in auvergne were foul and the diet unhappy  the dedication of the idylls was written on the death of the prince consort in december and in january 1862 the ode for the opening of an exhibition  the poet was busy with his fisherman enoch arden  the volume was published in 1864 and lord tennyson says it has been next to in memoriam the most popular of his fathers works  one would have expected the one volume containing the poems up to 1842 to hold that place  the new book however mainly dealt with english contemporary and domestic themesthe poetry of the affections  an old woman a district visitor reported regarded enoch arden as more beautiful than the other tracts which were read to her  it is indeed a tender and touching tale based on a folkstory which tennyson found current in brittany as well as in england  nor is the unseen and unknown landscape of the tropic isle less happily created by the poets imagination than the familiar english cliffs and hazel copses      the mountain wooded to the peak the lawns and winding glades high up like ways to heaven the slender cocos drooping crown of plumes the lightning flash of insect and of bird the lustre of the long convolvuluses that coild around the stately stems and ran evn to the limit of the land the glows and glories of the broad belt of the world all these he saw but what he fain had seen he could not see the kindly human face nor ever hear a kindly voice but heard the myriad shriek of wheeling oceanfowl the leaguelong roller thundering on the reef the moving whisper of huge trees that branchd and blossomd in the zenith or the sweep of some precipitous rivulet to the wave as down the shore he ranged or all day long sat often in the seawardgazing gorge a shipwreckd sailor waiting for a sail no sail from day to day but every day the sunrise broken into scarlet shafts among the palms and ferns and precipices the blaze upon the waters to the east the blaze upon his island overhead the blaze upon the waters to the west then the great stars that globed themselves in heaven the hollowerbellowing ocean and again the scarlet shafts of sunrisebut no sail   aylmers field somewhat recalls the burden of maud the curse of purseproud wealth but is too gloomy to be a fair specimen of tennysons art  in sea dreams first published in 1860 the awful vision of crumbling faiths is somewhat out of harmony with its environment      but round the north a light a belt it seemd of luminous vapour lay and ever in it a low musical note swelld up and died and as it swelld a ridge of breaker issued from the belt and still grew with the growing note and when the note had reachd a thunderous fulness on those cliffs broke mixt with awful light the same as that living within the belt whereby she saw that all those lines of cliffs were cliffs no more but huge cathedral fronts of every age grave florid stern as far as eye could see one after one  and then the great ridge drew lessening to the lessening music back and past into the belt and swelld again slowly to music  ever when it broke the statues king or saint or founder fell then from the gaps and chasms of ruin left came men and women in dark clusters round some crying set them up they shall not fall and others let them lie for they have falln and still they strove and wrangled  and she grieved in her strange dream she knew not why to find their wildest wailings never out of tune with that sweet note and ever as their shrieks ran highest up the gamut that great wave returning while none markd it on the crowd broke mixt with awful light and showd their eyes glaring and passionate looks and swept away the men of flesh and blood and men of stone to the waste deeps together        then i fixt my wistful eyes on two fair images both crownd with stars and high among the stars  the virgin mother standing with her child high up on one of those dark minsterfronts  till she began to totter and the child clung to the mother and sent out a cry which mixt with little margarets and i woke and my dream awed me wellbut what are dreams   the passage is rather fitted for a despairing mood of arthur in the idylls than for the wife of the city clerk ruined by a pious rogue  the lucretius later published is beyond praise as a masterly study of the great roman sceptic whose heart is at eternal odds with his epicurean creed  nascent madness or fever of the brain drugged by the blundering love philtre is not more cunningly treated in the mad scenes of maud  no prose commentary on the de rerum natura however long and learned conveys so clearly as this concise study in verse the sense of magnificent mingled ruin in the mind and poem of the roman  the experiments in quantity were perhaps suggested by mr matthew arnolds lectures on the translating of homer  mr arnold believed in a translation into english hexameters  his negative criticism of other translators and translations was amusing and instructive  he had an easy game to play with the yankeedoodle metre of f w newman the ponderous blank verse of cowper the tripping and clipping couplets of pope the elizabethan fantasies of chapman  but mr arnolds hexameters were neither musical nor rapid  they only exhibited a new form of failure  as the prince of abyssinia said to his tutor enough you have convinced me that no man can be a poet so mr arnold went some way to prove that no man can translate homer  tennyson had the lowest opinion of hexameters as an english metre for serious purposes   these lame hexameters the strongwingd music of homer   lord tennyson says german hexameters he disliked even more than english  indeed there is not much room for preference  tennysons alcaics milton were intended to follow the greek rather than the horatian model and resulted at all events in a poem worthy of the mightymouthd inventor of harmonies  the specimen of the iliad in blank verse beautiful as it is does not somehow reproduce the music of homer  it is entirely tennysonian as in   rolld the rich vapour far into the heaven   the reader in that one line recognises the voice and trick of the english poet and is far away from the chian   as when in heaven the stars about the moon look beautiful when all the winds are laid and every height comes out and jutting peak and valley and the immeasurable heavens break open to their highest and all the stars shine and the shepherd gladdens in his heart so many a fire between the ships and stream of xanthus blazed before the towers of troy a thousand on the plain and close by each sat fifty in the blaze of burning fire and eating hoary grain and pulse the steeds fixt by their cars waited the golden dawn   this is excellent is poetry escapes the conceits of pope who never wrote with his eye on the object but is pure tennyson  we have not yet probably we never shall have an adequate rendering of the iliad into verse and prose translations do not pretend to be adequate  when parents and dominies have abolished the study of greek something it seems will have been lost to the world something which even tennyson could not restore in english  he thought blank verse the proper equivalent but it is no equivalent one even prefers his own prose   nor did paris linger in his lofty halls but when he had girt on his gorgeous armour all of varied bronze then he rushed thro the city glorying in his airy feet  and as when a stallkept horse that is barleyfed at the manger breaketh his tether and dasheth thro the plain spurning it being wont to bathe himself in the fairrunning river rioting and reareth his head and his mane flieth back on either shoulder and he glorieth in his beauty and his knees bear him at the gallop to the haunts and meadows of the mares so ran the son of priam paris from the height of pergamus all in arms glittering like the sun laughing for lightheartedness and his swift feet bare him   in february 1865 tennyson lost the mother whose portrait he drew in isabela thing enskied and sainted  in the autumn of 1865 the tennysons went on a continental tour and visited waterloo weimar and dresden in september they entertained emma i queen of the sandwich islands  the months passed quietly at home or in town  the poet had written his lucretius and to please sir george grove wrote the song of the wrens for music  tennyson had not that positive aversion to music which marked dr johnson victor hugo theophile gautier and some other poets  nay he liked beethoven which places him higher in the musical scale than scott who did not rise above a border lilt or a jacobite ditty  the wren songs entitled the window were privately printed by sir ivor guest in 1867 were set to music by sir arthur sullivan and published by strahan in december 1870  a puppet tennyson called the songbook whose only merit is perhaps that it can dance to mr sullivans instrument  i am sorry that my puppet should have to dance at all in the dark shadow of these days the siege of paris but the music is now completed and i am bound by my promise  the verses are described as partly in the old style but the true old style of the elizabethan and cavalier days is lost  in the summer of 1867 the tennysons moved to a farmhouse near haslemere at that time not a centre of literary londoners  sandy soil and heatherscented air allured them and the result was the purchase of land and the building of aldworth mr knowles being the architect  in autumn tennyson visited lyme regis and like all other travellers thither made a pilgrimage to the cobb sacred to louisa musgrove  the poet now began the study of hebrew having a mind to translate the book of job a vision unfulfilled  in 1868 he thought of publishing his boyish piece the lovers tale but delayed  an anonymously edited piracy of this and other poems was perpetrated in 1875 limited at least nominally to fifty copies  in july longfellow visited tennyson  the longfellows and he talked much of spiritualism for he was greatly interested in that subject but he suspended his judgment and thought that if in such manifestations there is anything pucks not the spirits of dead men reveal themselves  this was southeys suggestion as regards the celebrated disturbances in the house of the wesleys  wit might have much to say wisdom little said sam wesley  probably the talk about david dunglas home the medium then in vogue led to the discussion of spiritualism  we do not hear that tennyson ever had the curiosity to see home whom mr browning so firmly detested  in september the holy grail was begun  it was finished in about a week  it came like a breath of inspiration  the subject had for many years been turned about in the poets mind which of course was busy in these years of apparent inactivity  at this time august 1868 tennyson left his old publishers the moxons for mr strahan who endured till 1872  then he was succeeded by messrs h s king  co who gave place 1879 to messrs kegan paul  co while in 1884 messrs macmillan became and continue to be the publishers  a few pieces except lucretius macmillans magazine may 1868 unimportant appeared in serials  very early in 1869 the coming of arthur was composed while tennyson was reading brownings the ring and the book  he and his great contemporary were on terms of affectionate friendship though tennyson perhaps appreciated less of browning than browning of tennyson  meanwhile old fitz kept up a fire of unsympathetic growls at browning and all his works  i have been trying in vain to read it the ring and the book and yet the athenaeum tells me it is wonderfully fine  fitzgeralds ply had been taken long ago he wanted verbal music in poetry no exorbitant desire while in browning carmina desunt  perhaps too a personal feeling as if browning was tennysons rival affected the judgment of the author of omar khayyam  we may almost call him the author  the holy grail with the smaller poems such as lucretius was published at the end of 1869  fitzgerald appears to have preferred the northern farmer the substantial roughspun nature i knew to all the visionary knights in the airy quest  to compare  obviously browning with tennyson was to compare an old jews curiosity shop with the phidian marbles  tennysons poems being clear to the bottom as well as beautiful do not seem to cockney eyes so deep as muddy waters  in november 1870 the last tournament was begun it was finished in may 1871  conceivably the vulgar scandals of the last days of the french imperial regime may have influenced tennysons picture of the corruption of arthurs court but the empire did not begin like the round table with aspirations after the ideal  in the autumn of the year tennyson entertained and was entertained by mr huxley  in their ideas about ultimate things two men could not vary more widely but each delighted in the others society  in the spring of 1872 tennyson visited paris and the ruins of the louvre  he read victor hugo and alfred de musset whose comedies he admired  the little that we hear of his opinion of the other great poet runs to this effect victor hugo is an unequal genius sometimes sublime he reminds one that there is but one step between the sublime and the ridiculous but the example by which tennyson illustrated this was derived from one of the poets novels  in these we meet not only the sublime and the ridiculous but passages which leave us in some perplexity as to their true category  one would have expected hugos lyrics to be tennysons favourites but only gastibelza is mentioned in that character  at this time tennyson was vexed by   art with poisonous honey stolen from france   a phrase which cannot apply to hugo  meanwhile gareth was being written and the knights song for the coming of arthur  gareth and lynette with minor pieces appeared in 1872  balin and balan was composed later to lead up to vivien to which perhaps balin and balan was introduction sufficient had it been the earlier written but the idylls have already been discussed as arranged in sequence the completion of the idylls with the patriotic epilogue was followed by the offer of a baronetcy  tennyson preferred that he and his wife should remain plain mr and mrs though i hope that i have too much of the oldworld loyalty not to wear my ladys favours against all comers should you think that it would be more agreeable to her majesty that i should do so  the idylls ended tennyson in 1874 began to contemplate a drama choosing the topic perhaps neither popular nor in an aristotelian sense tragic of mary tudor  this play was published and put on the stage by sir henry irving in 1875  harold followed in 1876 the cup in 1881 at the lyceum the promise of may at the globe in 1882 becket in 1884 with the foresters in 1892  it seems best to consider all the dramatic period of tennysons work a period reached so strangely late in his career in the sequence of the plays  the task is one from which i shrink as conscious of entire ignorance of the stage and of lack of enthusiasm for the drama  great dramatic authors have almost invariably had long practical knowledge of the scenes and of what is behind them  shakespeare and his contemporaries moliere and his contemporaries had lived their lives on the boards and in the foyer actors themselves or in daily touch with actors and actresses  in the present day successful playwrights appear to live much in the world of the players  they have practical knowledge of the conventions and conditions which the stage imposes neither browning nor mr swinburne to take great names has had it seems much of this practical and daily experience their dramas have been acted but rarely if at all and many examples prove that neither poetical genius nor the genius for prose fiction can enable men to produce plays which hold their own on the boards  this may be the fault of public taste or partly of public taste partly of defect in practical knowledge on the side of the authors  of the stage by way of practice tennyson had known next to nothing yet his dramas were written to be acted and acted some of them were for himself he was aware says his biographer that he wanted intimate knowledge of the mechanical details necessary for the modern stage although in early and middle life he had been a constant playgoer and would keenly follow the action of a play criticising the characterisation incidents scenic effects situations language and dramatic points  he was quite prepared to be edited for acting purposes by the players  miss mary anderson says that he was ready to sacrifice even his most beautiful lines for the sake of a real dramatic effect  this proved unusual commonsense in a poet  modern times and manners are notoriously unfavourable to the serious drama  in the age of the greek tragedians as in the days of eliza and our james reading was not very common and life was much more passed in public than among ourselves when people go to the play for light recreation or to be shocked  so various was the genius of tennyson that had he devoted himself early to the stage and had he been backed by a manager with the enterprise and intelligence of sir henry irving it is impossible to say how much he might have done to restore the serious drama  but we cannot regret that he was occupied in his prime with other things nor can we expect to find his noblest and most enduring work in the dramatic experiments of his latest years it is notable that in his opinion the conditions of the dramatic art are much more complex than they were  for example we have the star system which tends to allot what is or was technically styled the fat to one or two popular players  now a poet like tennyson will inevitably distribute large quantities of what is most excellent to many characters and the consequent difficulties may be appreciated by students of our fallen nature  the poet added that to be a firstrate historical playwright means much more work than formerly seeing that exact history has taken the part of the chance chronicle  this is a misfortune  the dramas of the attic stage with one or two exceptions are based on myth and legend not on history and even in the persae grounded on contemporary events aeschylus introduced the ghost of darius not vouched for by exact history  let us conceive shakespeare writing macbeth in an age of exact history  hardly any of the play would be left  fleance and banquo must go  duncan becomes a young man and far from gracious  macbeth appears as the defender of the legitimist prince lulach against duncan a usurper lady macbeth is a pattern to her sex and her lord is a clement and sagacious ruler  the witches are ruled out of the piece difficulties arise about the english aid to malcolm  history in fact declines to be dramatic  liberties must be taken  in his plays of the mary stuart cycle mr swinburne telescopes the affair of darnley into that of chastelard which was much earlier  he makes mary beaton in love with chastelard a kind of avenging fate who will never leave the queen till her head falls at fotheringay though in fact after a flirtation with randolph mary beaton married ogilvy of boyne really in love with lady bothwell and not one of the four maries was at fotheringay  an artist ought to be allowed to follow legend of its essence dramatic or to manipulate history as he pleases  our modern scrupulosity is pedantic  but tennyson read a long list of books for his queen mary though it does not appear that he made original researches in mss  these labours occupied 1874 and 1875  yet it would be foolish to criticise his queen mary as if we were criticising exact history  the plays the thing  the poet thought that bloody mary had been harshly judged by the verdict of popular tradition  so have most characters to whom popular dislike affixes the popular epithetbloody claverse bloody mackenzie bloody balfour  mary had the courage of the tudors  she edified all around her by her cheerfulness her piety and her resignation to the will of providence in her last days lingard  camden calls her a queen never praised enough for the purity of her morals her charity to the poor she practised as a district visitor and her liberality to the nobles and the clergy she was pious merciful pure and ever to be praised if we overlook her erroneous opinions in religion says godwin  she had been grievously wronged from her youth upwards  in elizabeth she had a sister and a rival a constant intriguer against her and a kinswoman far from amiable  despite the kindness and attention of philip lingard affairs of state demanded his absence from england  the disappointment as to her expected child was cruel  she knew that she had become unpopular and she could not look for the success of her church to which she was sincerely attached  m auguste filon thought that queen mary might secure dramatic rank for tennyson if a great actress arose who conceived a passion for the part of mary  but that was not to be expected  mary was middle aged plain and in aspect now terrible now rueful  no great actress will throw herself with passion into such an ungrateful part throughout all history tennyson said there was nothing more mournful than the final tragedy of this woman  mournful it is but not tragic  there is nothing grand at the close as when mary stuart conquers death and evil fame redeeming herself by her courage and her calm and extending over unborn generations that witchery which her enemies dreaded more than an army with banners  moreover popular tradition can never forgive the fires of smithfield  it was mary tudors misfortune that she had the power to execute on a great scale that faculty of persecution to the death for which her presbyterian and other protestant opponents pined in vain  mr froude says of her for the first and last time the true ultramontane spirit was dominant in england the genuine conviction that as the orthodox prophets and sovereigns of israel slew the worshippers of baal so were catholic rulers called upon as their first duty to extirpate heretics as the enemies of god and man that was precisely the spirit of knox and other presbyterian denouncers of death against idolaters catholics  but the scottish preachers were always thwarted  mary and her advisers had their way as earlier latimer had preached against sufferers at the stake  to the stake which he feared so greatly cranmer had sent persons not of his own fleeting shade of theological opinion  these men had burned anabaptists but all that is lightly forgotten by protestant opinion  under mary whoever may have been primarily responsible cranmer and latimer were treated as they had treated others  moreover some two hundred poor men and women had dared the fiery death  the persecution was on a scale never forgiven or forgotten since mary began cerdonibus esse timenda  mary was not essentially inclement  despite renard the agent of the emperor she spared that lord of fluff and feather courtenay and she spared elizabeth  lady jane she could not save the girl who was a queen by grace of god and of her own royal nature  but mary will never be pardoned by england  few men or women have lived less capable of doing knowingly a wrong thing says mr froude a great admirer of tennysons play  yet taking mr froudes own view marys abject and superannuated passion for philip her ecstasies during her supposed pregnancy the forlorn hours when she would sit on the ground with her knees drawn to her face with all her symptoms of hysterical derangement leave little room as we think of her for other feelings than pity  unfortunately feelings of pity for a person so distraught so sourly treated by fortune do not suffice for tragedy when we contemplate antigone or oedipus it is not with a sentiment of pity struggling against abhorrence  for these reasons the play does not seem to have a good dramatic subject  the unity is given by mary herself and her fortunes and these are scarcely dramatic  history prevents the introduction of philip till the second scene of the third act  his entrance is manque he merely accompanies cardinal pole who takes command of the scene and philip does not get in a word till after a long conversation between the queen and the cardinal  previously philip had only crossed the stage in a procession yet when he does appear he is bereft of prominence  the interest as regards him is indicated in act i scene v by marys kissing his miniature  her blighted love for him is one main motive of the tragedy but his own part appears too subordinate in the play as published  the interest is scattered among the vast crowd of characters and mr r h hutton remarked at the time that he remains something of a cold cruel and sensual shadow  we are more interested in wyatt cranmer gardiner and others or at least their parts are more interesting  yet in no case does the interest of any character except of mary and elizabeth remain continuous throughout the play  tennyson himself thought that the real difficulty of the drama is to give sufficient relief to its intense sadness    nothing less than the holy calm of the meek and penitent cranmer can be adequate artistic relief but not much relief can be drawn from a man about to be burned alive and history does not tempt us to keen sympathy with the recanting archbishop at least if we agree with macaulay rather than with froude  i venture to think that historical tradition as usual offered a better motive than exact history  following tradition we see in mary a cloud of hateful gloom from which england escapes into the glorious dawn of the gospel light and of elizabeth who might be made a triumphantly sympathetic character  that is the natural and popular course which the drama might take  but tennysons history is almost critical and scientific  points of difficult and debated evidence as to elizabeths part in wyatts rebellion are discussed there is no contest of day and darkness of truth and error  the characters are in that perplexed condition about creeds which was their actual state after the political and social and religious chaos produced by henry viii  gardiner is a catholic but not an ultramontane lord william howard is a catholic but not a fanatic we find a truculent anabaptist or socialist and a citizen whose pride is his moderation  the native uncritical tendency of the drama is to throw up hats and halloo for elizabeth and an open bible  in place of this cecil delivers a wellconsidered analysis of the character of elizabeth      eliz  god guide me lest i lose the way exit elizabeth    cecil  many points weatherd many perilous ones at last a harbour opens but therein sunk rocksthey need fine steeringmuch it is to be nor mad nor

sane to the heart of hera tudor schoold by the shadow of deatha boleyn too glancing across the tudornot so well   this is excellent as historical criticism in the favourable sense but the drama by its nature demands something not critical but triumphant and onesided  the character of elizabeth is one of the best in the play as her soliloquy act iii scene v is one of the finest of the speeches  we see her courage her coquetry her dissimulation her arrogance  but while this is the true elizabeth it is not the idealised elizabeth whom english loyalty created lived for and died for  mr froude wrote you have given us the greatest of all your works an opinion which the world can never accept you have reclaimed one more section of english history from the wilderness and given it a form in which it will be fixed for ever no one since shakespeare has done that  but mr froude had done it and tennysons reading of the section is mainly that of mr froude mr gladstone found that cranmer and gardiner are still in a considerable degree mysteries to me  a mystery cranmer must remain perhaps the crowds and voices are not the least excellent of the characters tennysons humour finding an opportunity in them and in joan and tib  his idyllic charm speaks in the words of lady clarence to the fevered queen and there is dramatic genius in her reply      mary  what is the strange thing happiness  sit down here tell me thine happiest hour    lady clarence  i will if that may make your grace forget yourself a little there runs a shallow brook across our field for twenty miles where the black crow flies five and doth so bound and babble all the way as if itself were happy  it was maytime and i was walking with the man i loved i loved him but i thought i was not loved and both were silent letting the wild brook speak for ustill he stoopd and gatherd one from out a bed of thick forgetmenots lookd hard and sweet at me and gave it me i took it tho i did not know i took it and put it in my bosom and all at once i felt his arms about me and his lips     mary  o god  i have been too slack too slack there are hot gospellers even among our guards  nobles we dared not touch  we have but burnt the heretic priest workmen and women and children wet famine ague fever storm wreck wrath  we have so playd the coward but by gods grace well follow philips leading and set up the holy office heregarner the wheat and burn the tares with unquenchable fire   the conclusion in the acting edition printed in the biography appears to be an improvement on that in the text as originally published  unhappy as the drama essentially is the welcome which mr browning gave both to the published work and to the acted playa complete success  conception execution the whole and the parts i see nowhere the shadow of a faultoffers relief in actual human nature  he is the greatestbrained poet in england tennyson said on a later occasion  violets fade he has given me a crown of gold  before writing harold 1876 the poet studied many recent plays and reread aeschylus and sophocles  for history he went to the bayeux tapestry the roman de rou lord lytton and freeman students of a recent controversy will observe that following freeman he retains the famous palisade so grievously battered by the axestrokes of mr horace round  harold is a piece more compressed and much more in accordance with the traditions of the drama than queen mary  the topic is tragic indeed  the sorrow being that of a great man a great king the bulwark of a people that fell with his fall  moreover as the topic is treated the play is rich in the irony usually associated with the name of sophocles victory comes before a fall  harold like antigone is torn between two dutieshis oath and the claims of his country  his ruin comes from what aristotle would call his greek text which cannot be reproduced his fault in swearing the oath to william  the hero himself recking little after a superstitious moment of the concealed relics over which he swore deems his offence to lie in swearing a vow which he never meant to keep  the persuasions which urge him to this course are admirably presented  england edith his brothers freedom were at stake  casuistry or even law would have absolved him easily an oath taken under duresse is of no avail  but harolds honour rooted in dishonour stood and he cannot so readily absolve himself  bruce and the bishops who stood by bruce had no such scruples  they perjured themselves often on the most sacred relics especially the bishops  but harold rises above the mediaeval and magical conception of the oath and goes to his doom conscious of a stain on his honour of which only a deeper stain that of falseness to his country could make him clean  this is a truly tragic stroke of destiny  the heros character is admirably noble patient and simple  the confessor also is as true in art as to history and his vision of the fall and rise of england is a noble passage  in aldwyth we have something of vivien with a grain of conscience and the part of edith swansneck has a restrained and classic pathos in contrast with the melancholy of wulfnoth  the piece as the poet said is a tragedy of doom of deepening and darkening omens as in the odyssey and njals saga  the battle scene with the choruses of the monks makes a noble close  fitzgerald remained loyal but it was to a fairy prince who came from other skies than these rainy ones and the wretched critics as g h lewes called them seem to have been unfriendly  in fact besides the innate wretchedness of all critics they grudged the time and labour given to the drama in an undramatic age  harold had not what fitzgerald called the old champagne flavour of the vintage of 1842  becket was begun in 1876 printed in 1879 and published in 1884 before that date in 1880 tennyson produced one of the volumes of poetry which was more welcome than a play to most of his admirers the intervening years passed in the isle of wight at aldworth in town and in summer tours were of no marked biographical interest the poet was close on three score and tenhe reached that limit in 1879  the days darkened around him as darken they must  in the spring of 1879 he lost his favourite brother himself a poet of original genius charles tennyson turner  in may of the same year he published the lovers tale which has been treated here among his earliest works  his hours and to some extent his meals were regulated by sir andrew clark  he planted trees walked read loitered in his garden and kept up his old friendships while he made that of the great gordon  compliments passed between him and victor hugo who had entertained lionel tennyson in paris and wrote je lis avec emotion vos vers superbes cest un reflet de gloire que vous menvoyez  mr matthew arnolds compliment was very like mr arnolds humour  your father has been our most popular poet for over forty years and i am of opinion that he fully deserves his reputation  such was mats sublime waggery  tennyson heaped coals of fire on the other poet bidding him as he liked to be bidden to write more poetry not prose things  tennyson lived much in the society of browning and george eliot and made the acquaintance of renan  in december 1879 mr and mrs kendal produced the falcon which ran for sixtyseven nights it is an exquisite little poem in action as fanny kemble said  during a continental tour tennyson visited catulluss sirmio  here he made his frater ave atque vale and the poet composed his beautiful salutation to the   tenderest of roman poets nineteen hundred years ago   in 1880 ballads and other poems proved that like titian the great poet was not to be defeated by the years  the first quarrel was in his most popular english style  rizpah deserved and received the splendid panegyric of mr swinburne  the revenge is probably the finest of the patriotic pieces and keeps green the memory of an exploit the most marvellous in the annals of english seamen  the village wife is a pendant worthy of the northern farmer  the poem in the childrens hospital caused some irritation at the moment but there was only one opinion as to the defence of lucknow and the beautiful retelling of the celtic voyage of maeldune  the fragment of homeric translation was equally fortunate in choice of subject and in rendering  in the end of 1880 the poet finished the cup which had been worked on occasionally since he completed the falcon in 1880  the piece was read by the author to sir henry irving and his company and it was found that the manuscript copy needed few alterations to fit it for the stage  the scenery and the acting of the protagonists are not easily to be forgotten  the play ran for a hundred and thirty nights  sir henry irving had thought that becket then unpublished would prove too expensive and could only be a succes destime tennyson had found out that the worst of writing for the stage is you must keep some actor always in your mind  to this necessity authors like moliere and shakespeare were of course resigned and familiar they knew exactly how to deal with all their means  but this part of the business of playwriting must always be a cross to the poet who is not at one with the world of the stage  in the cup miss ellen terry made the strongest impression her part being noble and sympathetic while sir henry irving had the ungrateful part of the villain  to be sure he was a villain of much complexity and tennyson thought that his subtle blend of roman refinement and intellectuality and barbarian selfsatisfied sensuality was not hit off  synorix is in fact halfgreek halfcelt with a roman education and the blend is rather too remote for successful representation  the traditional villain from iago downwards is not apt to utter such poetry as this   o thou that dost inspire the germ with life the child a thread within the house of birth and give him limbs then air and send him forth the glory of his fatherthou whose breath is balmy wind to robe our bills with grass and kindle all our vales with myrtleblossom and roll the golden oceans of our grain and sway the long grapebunches of our vines and fill all hearts with fatness and the lust of plentymake me happy in my marriage   the year 1881 brought the death of another of the old cambridge friends james spedding the biographer of bacon and carlyle also died a true friend if rather intermittent in his appreciation of poetry  the real carlyle did appreciate it but the carlyle of attitude was too much of the iron covenanter to express what he felt the poem despair irritated the earnest and serious readers of know nothing books  the poem expressed dramatically a mood like another a human mood not so very uncommon  a man ruined in this worlds happiness curses the faith of his youth and the unfaith of his reading and reflection and tries to drown himself  this is one conclusion of the practical syllogism and it is a free country however there were freethinkers who did not think that tennysons kind of thinking ought to be free  other earnest persons objected to first drink a health in the refashioned song of hands all round they might have remembered a royal health drunk in water an hour before the drinkers swept mackay down the pass of killiecrankie  the poet did not specify the fluid in which the toast was to be carried and the cup might be that which cheers but not inebriates  the common cup as the remonstrants had to be informed has in all ages been the sacred symbol of unity  the promise of may was produced in november 1882 and the poet was once more so unfortunate as to vex the susceptibilities of advanced thinkers  the play is not a masterpiece and yet neither the gallery gods nor the marquis of queensberry need have felt their withers wrung  the hero or villain edgar is a perfectly impossible person and represents no kind of political social or economical thinker  a man would give all other bliss and all his worldly wealth for this to waste his whole strength in one kick upon this perfect prig  he employs the arguments of evolution and so forth to justify the seduction of a little girl of fifteen and later by way of making amends proposes to commit incest by marrying her sister there have been evolutionists to be sure who believed in promiscuity like mr edgar as preferable to monogamy  but this only proves that an evolutionist may fail to understand evolution  there be also such folk as stevenson calls squirradicalssquires who say that the land is the peoples  probably no advocate of promiscuity and no squirradical was present at the performances of the promise of may  but people of advanced minds had got it into their heads that their doctrines were to be attacked so they went and made a hubbub in the sacred cause of freedom of thought and speech  the truth is that controversial topics political topics ought not to be brought into plays much less into sermons  tennyson meant edgar for nothing thorough nothing sincere  he is that venomous thing the prigscoundrel  he does not suit the stage and his place if anywhere is in the novel  advocates of marriage with a deceased wifes sister might have applauded edgar for wishing to marry the sister of a mistress assumed to be deceased but no other party in the state wanted anything except the punching of edgars head by farmer dobson  in 1883 died edward fitzgerald the most kind loyal and as he said crotchety of old and dear cambridge friends  he did not live to see the delightful poem which tennyson had written for him  in almost his latest letter he had remarked superfluously that when he called the task of translating the agamemnon work for a poet he was not thinking of mr browning  in the autumn of 1883 tennyson was taken with mr gladstone by sir donald currie for a cruise round the west coast of scotland to the orkneys and to copenhagen  the people of kirkwall conferred on the poet and the statesman the freedom of the burgh and mr gladstone in an interesting speech compared the relative chances of posthumous fame of the poet and the politician  pericles is not less remembered than sophocles though shakespeare is more in mens minds than cecil much depends as far as the statesmen are considered on contemporary historians  it is thucydides who immortalises pericles  but it is improbable that the things which mr gladstone did and attempted will be forgotten more rapidly than the conduct and characters of say burleigh or lethington  in 1884 after this voyage with its royal functions and celebrations at copenhagen a peerage was offered to the poet  he did not want to alter his plain mr and he must have known that whether he accepted or refused the chorus of blame would be louder than that of applause  scott had desired such grinning honour as sir walter hath the title went well with the old name and pleased his love of old times  tennyson had been blamed by literary men for thrice evading a baronetcy and he did not think that a peerage would make smooth the lives of his descendants  but he concluded why should i be selfish and not suffer an honour as gladstone says to be done to literature in my name  politically he thought that the upper house while it lasts partly supplied the place of the american referendum  he voted in july 1884 for the extension of the franchise and in november stated his views to mr gladstone in verse in prose he wrote to mr gladstone i have a strong conviction that the more simple the dealings of men with men as well as of man with man arethe better a sentiment which perhaps did not always prevail with his friend  the poets reflections on the horror of gordons death are not recorded  he introduced the idea of the gordon home for boys and later supported it by a letter have we forgotten gordon to the daily telegraph  they who cannot forget gordon must always be grateful to tennyson for providing this opportunity of honouring the greatest of an illustrious clan and of helping in their degree a scheme which was dear to the heroic leader  the poet very naturally was most averse to personal appearance in public matters  mankind is so fashioned that the advice of a poet is always regarded as unpractical and is even apt to injure the cause which he advocates  happily there cannot be two opinions about the right way of honouring gordon  tennysons poem the fleet was also in harmony with the general sentiment  in the last month of 1884 becket was published  the theme of fair rosamund had appealed to the poet in youth and he had written part of a lyric which he judiciously left unpublished  it is given in his biography  in 1877 he had visited canterbury and had traced the steps of becket to his place of slaughter in the cathedral  the poem was printed in 1879 but not published till seven years later  in 1879 sir henry irving had thought the play too costly to be produced with more than a succes destime but in 1891 he put it on the stage where it proved the most successful of modern poetic dramas  as published it is obviously far too long for public performance  it is not easy to understand why dramatic poets always make their works so much too long  the drama seems by its very nature to have a limit almost as distinct as the limit of the sonnet  it is easy to calculate how long a play for the stage ought to be and we might think that a poet would find the natural limit serviceable to his art for it inculcates selection conciseness and concentration but despite these advantages of the natural form of the drama modern poets at least constantly overflow their banks  the author ruit profusus and the manager has to reduce the piece to feasible proportions such as it ought to have assumed from the first  becket has been highly praised by sir henry irving himself for its moments of passion and pathos    which when they exist atone to an audience for the endurance of long acts  but why should the audience have such long acts to endure  the reader one fears is apt to use his privilege of skipping  the long speeches of walter map and the immense period of margery tempt the student to exercise his agility  a chronicle play has the privilege of wandering but becket wanders too far and too long  the political details of the quarrel between church and state with its domestic and international complexities are apt to fatigue the attention  inevitable and insoluble as the situation was neither protagonist is entirely sympathetic whether in the play or in history  the struggle in becket between his love of the king and his duty to the church or what he takes to be his duty is nobly presented and is truly dramatic while there is grotesque and terrible relief in the banquet of the beggars  in the scene of the assassination the poet never stoops his wing and there are passages of tender pathos between henry and rosamund while beckets keen memories of his early days just before his death are moving      becket  i once was out with henry in the days when henry loved me and we came upon a wildfowl sitting on her nest so still i reachd my hand and touchd she did not stir the snow had frozen round her and she sat stonedead upon a heap of icecold eggs look how this love this mother runs thro all the world god madeeven the beastthe bird    john of salisbury  ay still a lover of the beast and bird but these armd menwill you not hide yourself perchance the fierce de brocs from saltwood castle to assail our holy mother lest she brood too long oer this hard egg the world and send her whole hearts heat into it till it break into young angels  pray you hide yourself    becket  there was a little fairhaird norman maid lived in my mothers house  if rosamund is the worlds rose as her name imports hershe was the worlds lily    john of salisbury  ay and what of her    becket  she died of leprosy   but the part of rosamund her innocent ignorance especially is not very readily intelligible not quite persuasive and there is almost a touch of the burlesque in her unexpected appearance as a monk  to weave that old and famous story of love into the terribly complex political intrigue was a task almost too great  the character of eleanor is perhaps more successfully drawn in the prologue than in the scene where she offers the choice of the dagger or the bowl and is interrupted in a startlingly unexpected manner by the archbishop himself  the opportunities for scenic effects are magnificent throughout and must have contributed greatly to the success on the stage  still one cannot but regard the published becket as rather the marble from which the statue may be hewn than as the statue itself  there are fine scenes powerful and masterly drawing of character in henry eleanor and becket but there is a want of concentration due perhaps to the long period of time covered by the action  so at least it seems to a reader who has admitted his sense of incompetency in the dramatic region  the acuteness of the poets power of historical intuition was attested by mr j r green and mr bryce  one cannot imagine said mr bryce a more vivid a more perfectly faithful picture than it gives both of henry and thomas  tennysons portraits of these two go beyond and perfect history  the poets sympathy ought perhaps to have been if not with the false and ruffianly henry at least with henrys side of the question  for tennyson had made harold leave      to england my legacy of war against the pope from child to child from pope to pope from age to age till the sea wash her level with her shores or till the pope be christs    chapter ixlast years    the end of 1884 saw the publication of tiresias and other poems dedicated to my good friend robert browning and opening with the beautiful verses to one who never was mr brownings friend edward fitzgerald  the volume is rich in the best examples of tennysons later work  tiresias the monologue of the aged seer blinded by excess of light when he beheld athene unveiled and under the curse of cassandra is worthy of the author who in youth wrote oenone and ulysses  possibly the verses reflect tennysons own sense of public indifference to the voice of the poet and the seer  but they are of much earlier date than the year of publication      for when the crowd would roar for blood for war whose issue was their doom to cast wise words among the multitude was flinging fruit to lions nor in hours of civil outbreak when i knew the twain would each waste each and bring on both the yoke of stronger states was mine the voice to curb the madness of our cities and their kings    who ever turnd upon his heel to hear my warning that the tyranny of one was prelude to the tyranny of all my counsel that the tyranny of all led backward to the tyranny of one    this power hath workd no good to aught that lives   the conclusion was a favourite with the author and his blank verse never reached a higher strain         but for me i would that i were gatherd to my rest and mingled with the famous kings of old on whom about their oceanislets flash the faces of the godsthe wise mans word here trampled by the populace underfoot there crownd with worshipand these eyes will find the men i knew and watch the chariot whirl about the goal again and hunters race the shadowy lion and the warriorkings in height and prowess more than human strive again for glory while the golden lyre is ever sounding in heroic ears heroic hymns and every way the vales wind clouded with the grateful incensefume of those who mix all odour to the gods on one far height in one farshining fire   then follows the pathetic piece on fitzgeralds death and the prayer not unfulfilled             that when i from hence    shall fade with him into the unknown my close of earths experience    may prove as peaceful as his own   the ancient sage with its lyric interludes is one of tennysons meditations on the mystery of the world and of existence  like the poet himself the sage finds a gleam of light and hope in his own subjective experiences of some unspeakable condition already recorded in in memoriam  the topic was one on which he seems to have spoken to his friends with freedom   and more my son for more than once when i sat all alone revolving in myself the word that is the symbol of myself the mortal limit of the self was loosed and past into the nameless as a cloud melts into heaven  i touchd my limbs the limbs were strange not mineand yet no shade of doubt but utter clearness and thro loss of self the gain of such large life as matchd with ours were sun to sparkunshadowable in words themselves but shadows of a shadowworld   the poets habit of         revolving in myself the word that is the symbol of myself    that is of dwelling on the sound of his own name was familiar to the arabs  m lefebure has drawn my attention to a passage in the works of a mediaeval arab philosopher ibn khaldoun  17 to arrive at the highest degree of inspiration of which he is capable the diviner should have recourse to the use of certain phrases marked by a peculiar cadence and parallelism  thus he emancipates his mind from the influence of the senses and is enabled to attain an imperfect contact with the spiritual world  ibn khaldoun regards the contact as extremely imperfect  he describes similar efforts made by concentrating the gaze on a mirror a bowl of water or the like  tennyson was doubtless unaware that he had stumbled accidentally on a method of ancient sages  psychologists will explain his experience by the word dissociation  it is not everybody however who can thus dissociate himself  the temperament of genius has often been subject to such influence as m lefebure has shown in the modern instances of george sand and alfred de musset  we might add shelley goethe and even scott  the poets versatility was displayed in the appearance with these records of weird seizures of the irish dialect piece tomorrow the popular spinsters sweetarts and the locksley hall sixty years after  the old fire of the versification is unabated but the hero has relapsed on the gloom of the hero of maud  he represents himself of course not tennyson or only one of the moods of tennyson which were sometimes black enough  a very different mood chants the charge of the heavy brigade and speaks of   green sussex fading into blue    with one gray glimpse of sea   the lines to virgil were written at the request of the mantuans by the most virgilian of all the successors of the   wielder of the stateliest measure    ever moulded by the lips of man   never was tennyson more virgilian than in this unmatched panegyric the sum and flower of criticism of that   golden branch amid the shadows    kings and realms that pass to rise no more   hardly less admirable is the tribute to catullus and the old poet is young again in the birdsong of early spring  the lines on poets and their bibliographies with the dead prophet express tennysons lifelong abhorrence of the critics and biographers whose joy is in the futile and the unimportant in personal gossip and the sweepings of the studio the salvage of the wastepaper basket  the prefatory poem to my brothers sonnets is not only touching in itself but proves that the poet can turn to favour and to prettiness such an affliction as the ruinous summer of 1879  the year 1880 brought deeper distress in the death of the poets son lionel whose illness begun in india ended fatally in the red sea the interest of the following years was mainly domestic  the poets health hitherto robust was somewhat impaired in 1888 but his vivid interest in affairs and in letters was unabated  he consoled himself with virgil keats wordsworth gibbon euripides and mr leafs speculations on the composite nature of the iliad in which coleridge perhaps alone among poets believed  you know said tennyson to mr leaf i never liked that theory of yours about the many poets  it would be at least as easy to prove that there were many authors of ivanhoe or perhaps it would be a good deal more easy  however he admitted that three lines which occur both in the eighth and the sixteenth books of the iliad are more appropriate in the later book  similar examples might be found in his own poems he still wrote in the intervals of a malady which brought him as near death as a man could be without dying  he was an example of the great physical strength which on the whole seems usually to accompany great mental power  the strength may be dissipated by passion or by undue labour as in cases easily recalled to memory but neither cause had impaired the vigour of tennyson  like goethe he lived out all his life and his eightieth birthday was cheered both by public and private expressions of reverence and affection  of tennysons last three years on earth we may think in his own words that his      lifes latest eve endured nor settled into hueless grey   nature was as dear to him and as inspiring as of old men and affairs and letters were not slurred by his intact and energetic mind  his demeter and other poems with the dedication to lord dufferin appeared in the december of the year  the dedication was the lament for the dead son and the salutation to the viceroy of india a piece of resigned and manly regret  the demeter and persephone is a modern and tender study of the theme of the most beautiful homeric hymn the ancient poet had no such thought of the restored persephone as that which impels tennyson to describe her   faint as a climatechanging bird that flies all night across the darkness and at dawn falls on the threshold of her native land   the spring the restored persephone comes more vigorous and joyous to the shores of the aegean than to ours  all tennysons own is demeters awe of those imperial disimpassioned eyes of her daughter come from the bed and the throne of hades the lord of many guests  the hymn happy in its ending has no thought of the grey heads of the fates and their answer to the goddess concerning fate beyond the fates and the breaking of the bonds of hades  the ballad of owd roa is one of the most spirited of the essays in dialect to which tennyson had of late years inclined  vastness merely expresses in terms of poetry tennysons conviction that without immortality life is a series of worthless contrasts  an opposite opinion may be entertained but a man has a right to express his own which coming from so great a mind is not undeserving of attention or at least is hardly deserving of reproof  the poets idea is also stated thus in the ring in terms which perhaps do not fall below the poetical or at least do not drop into the utterly unpoetical   the ghost in man the ghost that once was man but cannot wholly free itself from man are calling to each other thro a dawn stranger than earth has ever seen the veil is rending and the voices of the day are heard across the voices of the dark no sudden heaven nor sudden hell for man but thro the will of one who knows and rules  and utter knowledge is but utter love  aeonian evolution swift or slow thro all the spheresan ever opening height an ever lessening earth   the ring is in fact a ghost story based on a legend told by mr lowell about a house near where he had once lived one of those houses vexed by   a footstep a low throbbing in the walls a noise of falling weights that never fell weird whispers bells that rang without a hand doorhandles turnd when none was at the door and bolted doors that opend of themselves   these phenomena were doubtless caused by rats and waterpipes but they do not destroy the pity and the passion of the tale  the lines to mary boyle are all of the normal world and worthy of a poets youth and of the spring  merlin and the gleam is the spiritual allegory of the poets own career   arthur had vanishd i knew not whither the king who loved me and cannot die   so at last      all but in heaven hovers the gleam   whither the wayfarer was soon to follow  there is a marvellous hope and pathos in the melancholy of these all but the latest songs reminiscent of youth and love and even of the dim haunting memories and dreams of infancy  no other english poet has thus rounded all his life with music  tennyson was in his eightyfirst year when there came in a moment the crown of his work the immortal lyric crossing the bar  it is hardly less majestic and musical in the perfect greek rendering by his brotherinlaw mr lushington  for once at least a poem has been poured from the golden to the silver cup without the spilling of a drop  the new books appearance was coincident with the death of mr browning so loving and appreciative as lady tennyson wrote a friend not a rival however the partisans of either poet might strive to stir emulation between two men of such lofty and such various genius    chapter x1890    in the year 1889 the poets health had permitted him to take long walks on the seashore and along the cliffs one of which by reason of its whiteness he had named taliessin the splendid brow  his mind ran on a poem founded on an egyptian legend of which the source is not mentioned telling how despair and death came upon him who was mad enough to try to probe the secret of the universe  he also thought of a drama on tristram who in the idylls is treated with brevity and not with the sympathy of the old writer who cries god bless tristram the knight  he fought for england  but early in 1890 tennyson suffered from a severe attack of influenza  in may mr watts painted his portrait and   divinely through all hindrance found the man   tennyson was a great admirer of miss austens novels  the realism and lifelikeness of miss austens dramatis personae come nearest to those of shakespeare  shakespeare however is a sun to which jane austen though a bright and true little world is but an asteroid he was therefore pleased to find appleblossoms coexisting with ripe strawberries on june 28 as miss austen has been blamed by minute philosophers for introducing this combination in the garden party in emma  the poet like most of the good and great read novels eagerly and excited himself over the confirmation of an adult male in a story by miss yonge  of scott the most chivalrous literary figure of the century and the author with the widest range since shakespeare he preferred old mortality and it is a good choice he hated morbid and introspective tales with their oceans of sham philosophy  at this time with catholic taste he read mr stevenson and mr meredith miss braddon and mr henry james ouida and mr thomas hardy mr hall caine and mr anstey mrs oliphant and miss edna lyall not everybody can peruse all of these very diverse authors with pleasure  he began his poem on the roman gladiatorial combats indeed his years fourscore and one left his intellectual eagerness as unimpaired as that of goethe  a crooked share he said to the princess louise may make a straight furrow  one afternoon he had a long waltz with m in the ballroom  speaking of   all the charm of all the muses    often flowering in a lonely word   in virgil he adduced rather strangely the cunctantem ramum said of the golden bough in the sixth aeneid  the choice is odd because the sibyl has just told aeneas that if he be destined to pluck the branch of gold ipse volens facilisque sequetur it will come off of its own accord like the sacred ti branches of the fijians which bend down to be plucked for the fire rite  yet when the predestined aeneas tries to pluck the bough of gold it yields reluctantly cunctantem contrary to what the sibyl has foretold  mr conington therefore thought the phrase a slip on the part of virgil  people accused virgil of plagiarising he said but if a man made it his own there was no harm in that look at the great poets shakespeare included  tennyson like virgil made much that was ancient his own his verses are often and purposefully a mosaic of classical reminiscences  but he was vexed by the hunters after remote and unconscious resemblances and farfetched analogies between his lines and those of others  he complained that if he said that the sun went down a parallel was at once cited from homer or anybody else and he used a very powerful phrase to condemn critics who detected such repetitions  the moanings of the homeless seamoanings from horace homeless from shelley  as if no one else had ever heard the sea moan except horace  tennysons mixture of memory and forgetfulness was not so strange as that of scott and when he adapted from the greek latin or italian it was of set purpose just as it was with virgil  the beautiful lines comparing a girls eyes to bottom agates that seem to      wave and float in crystal currents of clear running seas   he invented while bathing in wales  it was his habit to note down in verse such similes from nature and to use them when he found occasion  but the higher criticism analysing the simile detected elements from shakespeare and from beaumont and fletcher  in june 1891 the poet went on a tour in devonshire and began his akbar and probably wrote june bracken and heather or perhaps it was composed when we often sat on the top of blackdown to watch the sunset  he wrote to mr kipling    the oldest to the youngest singer    that england bore   to alter mr swinburnes lines to landor praising his flag of england  mr kipling replied as the private to the general  early in 1892 the foresters was successfully produced at new york by miss ada rehan the music by sir arthur sullivan and the scenery from woodland designs by whymper  robin hood as we learn from mark twain is a favourite hero with the youth of america  mr tom sawyer himself took in mark twains tale the part of the bold outlaw  the death of oenone was published in 1892 with the dedication to the master of balliol       read a grecian tale retold which cast in later grecian mould       quintus calaber somewhat lazily handled of old   quintus calaber more usually called quintus smyrnaeus is a writer of perhaps the fourth century of our era  about him nothing or next to nothing is known  he told in so late an age the conclusion of the tale of troy and in the writers opinion has been unduly neglected and disdained  his manner i venture to think is more homeric than that of the more famous and doubtless greater alexandrian poet of the argonautic cycle apollonius rhodius his senior by five centuries  his materials were probably the ancient and lost poems of the epic cycle and the story of the death of oenone may be from the little iliad of lesches  possibly parts of his work may be textually derived from the cyclics but the topic is very obscure  in quintus paris after encountering evil omens on his way makes a long speech imploring the pardon of the deserted oenone  she replies not with the tennysonian brevity she sends him back to the helpless arms of her rival helen  paris dies on the hills never did helen see him returning  the woodnymphs bewail paris and a herdsman brings the bitter news to helen who chants her lament  but remorse falls on oenone  she does not go         slowly down by the long torrents everdeepened roar   but rushes swift as the wind to seek and spring upon the pyre of her lord  fate and aphrodite drive her headlong and in heaven selene remembering endymion bewails the lot of her sister in sorrow oenone reaches the funeral flame and without a word or a cry leaps into her husbands arms the wild nymphs wondering  the lovers are mingled in one heap of ashes and these are bestowed in one vessel of gold and buried in a howe  this is the story which the poet rehandled in his old age completing the work of his happy youth when he walked with hallam in the pyrenean hills that were to him as ida the romance of oenone and her death condone as even homer was apt to condone the sins of beautiful paris whom the nymphs lament despite the evil that he has wrought  the silence of the veiled oenone as she springs into her lovers last embrace is perhaps more affecting and more natural than tennysons      she lifted up a voice of shrill command who burns upon the pyre   the st telemachus has the old splendour and vigour of verse and though written so late in life is worthy of the poets prime      eve after eve that haggard anchorite would haunt the desolated fane and there gaze at the ruin often mutter low vicisti galilaee louder again spurning a shatterd fragment of the god vicisti galilaee butwhen now bathed in that lurid crimsonaskd is earth on fire to the west or is the demongod wroth at his fall and heard an answer wake thou deedless dreamer lazying out a life of selfsuppression not of selfless love and once a flight of shadowy fighters crost the disk and once he thought a shape with wings came sweeping by him and

and town of alien tongue following a hundred sunsets and the sphere of westwardwheeling stars and every dawn struck from him his own shadow on to rome    footsore wayworn at length he touchd his goal the christian city   akbars dream may be taken more or less to represent the poets own theology of a race seeking after god if perchance they may find him and the closing hymn was a favourite with tennyson  he said it is a magnificent metre   hymn  i  once again thou flamest heavenward once again we see thee rise every morning is thy birthday gladdening human hearts and eyes    every morning here we greet it bowing lowly down before thee thee the godlike thee the changeless in thine everchanging skies  ii  shadowmaker shadowslayer arrowing light from clime to clime hear thy myriad laureates hail thee monarch in their woodland rhyme    warble bird and open flower and men below the dome of azure kneel adoring him the timeless in the flame that measures time   in this final volume the poet cast his handful of incense on the altar of scott versifying the tale of il bizarro which the dying sir walter records in his journal in italy  the churchwarden and the curate is not inferior to the earlier peasant poems in its expression of shrewdness humour and superstition  a verse of poets and critics may be taken as the poets last word on the old futile quarrel   this thing that thing is the rage helterskelter runs the age minds on this round earth of ours vary like the leaves and flowers    fashiond after certain laws sing thou low or loud or sweet all at all points thou canst not meet    some will pass and some will pause  what is true at last will tell few at first will place thee well some too low would have thee shine some too highno fault of thine     hold thine own and work thy will year will graze the heel of year but seldom comes the poet here    and the critics rarer still   still the lines hold good    some too low would have thee shine some too highno fault of thine   the end was now at hand  a sense of weakness was felt by the poet on september 3 1892  on the 28th his family sent for sir andrew clark but the patient gradually faded out of life and expired on thursday october 6 at 135 am  to the very last he had shakespeare by him and his windows were open to the sun on the last night they were flooded by the moonlight  the description of the final scenes must be read in the biography by the poets son  his patience and quiet strength had power upon those who were nearest and dearest to him we felt thankful for the love and the utter peace of it all  the life after death tennyson had said just before his fatal illness is the cardinal point of christianity  i believe that god reveals himself in every individual soul and my idea of heaven is the perpetual ministry of one soul to another  he had lived the life of heaven upon earth being in all his work a minister of things honourable lovely consoling and ennobling to the souls of others with a ministry which cannot die  his body sleeps next to that of his friend and fellowpoet robert browning in front of chaucers monument in the abbey    chapter xilast chapter    o that press will get hold of me now tennyson said when he knew that his last hour was at hand  he had a horror of personal tattle as even his early poems declare    for now the poet cannot die    nor leave his music as of old    but round him ere he scarce be cold begins the scandal and the cry   but no carrionvulture has waited   to tear his heart before the crowd   about tennyson doubtless there is much anecdotage  most of the anecdotes turn on his shyness his really exaggerated hatred of personal notoriety and the odd and brusque things which he would say when alarmed by effusive strangers  it has not seemed worth while to repeat more than one or two of these legends nor have i sought outside the biography by his son for more than the biographer chose to tell  the readers who are least interested in poetry are most interested in tattle about the poet  it is the privilege of genius to retain the freshness and simplicity with some of the foibles of the child  when tennyson read his poems aloud he was apt to be moved by them and to express frankly his approbation where he thought it deserved  only very rudimentary psychologists recognised conceit in this freedom and only the same set of persons mistook shyness for arrogance  effusiveness of praise or curiosity in a stranger is apt to produce bluntness of reply in a briton  dont talk dd nonsense sir said the duke of wellington to the gushing person who piloted him in his old age across piccadilly  of tennyson mr palgrave says i have known him silenced almost frozen before the eager unintentional eyes of a girl of fifteen  and under the stress of this nervous impulse compelled to contradict his inner self especially when under the terror of leonisation     he was doubtless at times betrayed into an abrupt phrase a cold unsympathetic exterior a moments defect of the rose  had he not been sensitive in all things he would have been less of a poet  the chief criticism directed against his mode of life is that he was sensitive and reserved but he could and did make himself pleasant in the society of les pauvres desprit  curiosity alarmed him and drove him into his shell  strangers who met him in that mood carried away false impressions which developed into myths  as the master of balliol has recorded despite his shyness he was extremely hospitable often inviting not only his friends but the friends of his friends and giving them a hearty welcome  for underneath a sensitive exterior he was thoroughly genial if he was understood in these points he was unlike his great contemporary browning for instance tennyson never i think was the masters guest at balliol mingling like browning with the undergraduates to whom the masters hospitality was freely extended  yet where he was familiar tennyson was a gay companion not shunning jest or even paradox  as dr johnson says every man may be judged of by his laughter  but no boswell has chronicled the laughters of tennyson he never or hardly ever made puns or witticisms though one pun at least endures in tradition but always lived in an attitude of humour  mr jowett writes and no description of the poet is better than his    if i were to describe his outward appearance i should say that he was certainly unlike any one else whom i ever saw  a glance at some of watts portraits of him will give better than any description which can be expressed in words a conception of his noble mien and look  he was a magnificent man who stood before you in his native refinement and strength  the unconventionality of his manners was in keeping with the originality of his figure  he would sometimes say nothing or a word or two only to the stranger who approached him out of shyness  he would sometimes come into the drawingroom reading a book  at other times especially to ladies he was singularly gracious and benevolent  he would talk about the accidents of his own life with an extraordinary freedom as at the moment they appeared to present themselves to his mind the days of his boyhood that were passed at somersby and the old school of manners which he came across in his own neighbourhood  the days of the apostles at cambridge  the years which he spent in london the evenings enjoyed at the cock tavern and elsewhere when he saw another side of life not without a kindly and humorous sense of the ridiculous in his fellowcreatures  his repertory of stories was perfectly inexhaustible they were often about slight matters that would scarcely bear repetition but were told with such lifelike reality that they convulsed his hearers with laughter  like most storytellers he often repeated his favourites but like children his audience liked hearing them again and again and he enjoyed telling them  it might be said of him that he told more stories than any one but was by no means the regular storyteller  in the commonest conversation he showed himself a man of genius   to this description may be added another by mr f t palgrave   every one will have seen men distinguished in some line of work whose conversation to take the old figure either smelt too strongly of the lamp or lay quite apart from their art or craft what through all these years struck me about tennyson was that whilst he never deviated into poetical language as such whether in rhetoric or highly coloured phrase yet throughout the substance of his talk the same mode of thought the same imaginative grasp of nature the same fineness and gentleness in his view of character the same forbearance and toleration the aurea mediocritas despised by fools and fanatics which are stamped on his poetry were constantly perceptible  whilst in the easy and as it were unsought choiceness the conscientious and truthloving precision of his words the same personal identity revealed itself  what a strange charm lay here how deeply illuminating the whole character as in prolonged intercourse it gradually revealed itself  artist and man tennyson was invariably true to himself or rather in wordsworths phrase he moved altogether his nature and his poetry being harmonious aspects of the same soul as botanists tell us that flower and fruit are but transformations of root and stem and leafage  we read how in mediaeval days conduits were made to flow with claret but this was on great occasions only  tennysons fountain always ran wine  once more  in mme recamiers salon i have read at the time when conversation was yet a fine art in paris guests famous for esprit would sit in the twilight round the stove whilst each in turn let fly some sparkling anecdote or bonmot which rose and shone and died out into silence till the next of the elect pyrotechnists was ready good things of this kind as i have said were plentiful in tennysons repertory  but what to pass from the materials to the method of his conversation eminently marked it was the continuity of the electric current  he spoke and was silent and spoke again but the circuit was unbroken there was no effort in taking up the thread no sense of disjunction  often i thought had he never written a line of the poems so dear to us his conversation alone would have made him the most interesting companion known to me  from this great and gracious student of humanity what less indeed could be expected  and if as a converser i were to compare him with socrates as figured for us in the dialogues of his great disciple i think that i should have the assent of that eminently valued friend of tennysons whose long labour of love has conferred english citizenship upon plato   we have called him shy and sensitive in daily intercourse with strangers and as to criticism he freely confessed that a midge of dispraise could sting while applause gave him little pleasure  yet no poet altered his verses so much in obedience to censure unjustly or irritatingly stated yet in essence just  he readily rejected some of his juvenilia on mr palgraves suggestion  the same friend tells how well he took a rather fierce attack on an unpublished piece when mr palgrave owned that he could not find one good line in it  very few poets or even versifiers fiercer they than poets are would have continued to show their virgin numbers to a friend so candid as tennyson did  perhaps most of the genus irritabile will grant that spoken criticism if unfavourable somehow annoys and stirs opposition in an author probably because it confirms his own suspicions about his work  such criticism is almost invariably just but campbell when rogers offered a correction bounced out of the room with a hang it  i should like to see the man who would dare to correct me  mr jowett justly recognised in the life of tennyson two circumstances which made him other than but for these he would have been  he had intended to do with the arthurian subject what he never did in some way or other to have represented in it the great religions of the world    it is a proof of tennysons genius that he should have thus early grasped the great historical aspect of religion  his intention was foiled his early dream was broken by the death of arthur hallam and by the coldness and contempt with which at the same period his early poems were received  mr jowett who had a firm belief in the great work regretted the change of plan as to the arthurian topic regretted it the more from his own interest in the history of religion  but we need not share the regrets  the early plan for the arthur which mr jowett never saw has been published and certainly the scheme could not have been executed on these lines 18  moreover as the master observed the work would have been premature in tennysons youth and indeed it would still be premature  the comparative science of religious evolution is even now very tentative and does not yield materials of sufficient stability for an epic even if such an epic could be forced into the mould of the arthur legends a feat perhaps impossible and certainly undesirable  a truly fantastic allegory must have been the result and it is fortunate that the poet abandoned the idea in favour of more human themes  moreover he recognised very early that his was not a muse de longue haleine that he must be short  we may therefore feel certain that his early sorrow and discouragement were salutary to him as a poet and as a man  he became more sympathetic more tender and was obliged to put forth that stoical selfcontrol and strenuous courage and endurance through which alone his poetic career was rendered possible  he had the susceptibility of a child or a woman says his friend he had also it was a strange combination the strength of a giant or of a god  without these qualities he must have broken down between 1833 and 1842 into a hypochondriac or a morose if majestic failure poor obscure and unhappy he overcame the world and passed from darkness into light  the poetic temperament in another not gifted with his endurance and persistent strength would have achieved ruin  most of us remember taines parallel between tennyson and alfred de musset  the french critic has no high approval of tennysons respectability and long peaceful life as compared with the wrecked life and genius of musset lenfant perdu of love wine and song this is a theory like another and is perhaps attractive to the young  the poet must have strong passions or how can he sing of them  he must be tossed and whirled in the stress of things like shelleys autumn leaves    ghosts from an enchanter fleeing   looking at burns byron musset or even at shelleys earlier years youth sees in them the true poets sacred things but also light as plato says inspired to break their wings against the nature of existence and the flammantia maenia mundi  but this is almost a boyish idea this idea that the true poet is the slave of the passions and that the poet who dominates them has none and is but a staid domestic animal an ass browsing the common as somebody has written about wordsworth  certainly tennysons was no passionless perfection  he like others was tempted to beat with ineffectual wings against the inscrutable nature of life  he too had his dark hour and was as subject to temptation as they who yielded to the stress and died or became unhappy waifs young men with a splendid past  he must have known no less than musset the attractions of many a paradis artificiel with its bright visions its houris its offers of oblivion of pain  he had the look of one who had suffered greatly mr palgrave writes in his record of their first meeting in 1842  but he like goethe scott and victor hugo had strength as well as passion and emotion he came unscorched through the fire that has burned away the wings of so many other great poets  this was no less fortunate for the world than for himself  of his prolonged dark hour we know little in detail but we have seen that from the first he resisted the tempter ulysses is his retro sathanas  about the mechanism of genius in tennyson mr palgrave has told us a little more appears incidentally in his biography  it was his way that when we had entered on some scene of special beauty or grandeur after enjoying it together he should always withdraw wholly from sight and study the view as it were in a little artificial solitude  tennysons poems mr palgrave says often arose in a kind of point de repere like those forms and landscapes which seem to spring from a floating point of light beheld with closed eyes just before we sleep  more than once he said that his poems sprang often from a nucleus some one word maybe or brief melodious phrase which had floated through the brain as it were unbidden  and perhaps at once while walking they were presently wrought into a little song  but if he did not write it down at once the lyric fled from him irrecoverably  he believed himself thus to have lost poems as good as his best  it seems probable that this is a common genesis of verses good or bad among all who write  like dickens and like most men of genius probably he saw all the scenes of his poems in his minds eye  many authors do this without the power of making their readers share the vision but probably few can impart the vision who do not themselves visualise with distinctness  we have seen in the cases of the holy grail and other pieces that tennyson after long meditating a subject often wrote very rapidly and with little need of correction  he was born with style it was a gift of his genius rather than the result of conscious elaboration  yet he did use the file of which much is now written especially for the purpose of polishing away the sibilants so common in our language  in the nine years of silence which followed the little book of 1833 his poems matured and henceforth it is probable that he altered his verses little if we except the modifications in the princess  many slight verbal touches were made or old readings were restored but important changes in the way of omission or addition became rare  of nature tennyson was scrupulously observant till his very latest days eagerly noting not only effects as a painter does but their causes botanical or geological  had man been scientific from the beginning he would probably have evolved no poetry at all material things would not have been endowed by him with life and passion he would have told himself no stories of the origins of stars and flowers clouds and fire winds and rainbows  modern poets have resented like keats and wordsworth the destruction of the old prehistoric dreams by the geologist and by other scientific characters  but it was part of tennysons poetic originality to see the beautiful things of nature at once with the vision of early poetic men and of moderns accustomed to the microscope telescope spectrum analysis and so forth  thus tennyson received a double delight from the sensible universe and it is a double delight that he communicates to his readers  his intellect was thus always active even in apparent repose  his eyes rested not from observing or his mind from recording and comparing the beautiful familiar phenomena of earth and sky  in the matter of the study of books we have seen how deeply versed he was in certain of the greek roman and italian classics  mr jowett writes  he was what might be called a good scholar in the university or publicschool sense of the term    yet i seem to remember that he had his favourite classics such as homer and pindar and theocritus    he was also a lover of greek fragments  but i am not sure whether in later life he ever sat down to read consecutively the greatest works of aeschylus and sophocles although he used occasionally to dip into them  the greek dramatists in fact seem to have affected tennysons work but slightly while he constantly reminds us of virgil homer theocritus and even persius and horace  mediaeval french whether in poetry or prose and the poetry of the pleiad seems to have occupied little of his attention  into the oriental literatures he dippedpretty deeply for his akbar and even his locksley hall owed something to sir william joness version of the old arabian moallakat  the debt appears to be infinitesimal  he seems to have been less closely familiar with elizabethan poetry than might have been expected  a number of his obiter dicta on all kinds of literary points are recorded in the life by mr palgrave  sir walter scotts short tale my aunt margarets mirror how little known he once spoke of as the finest of all ghost or magical stories  lord tennyson adds the tapestried chamber also he greatly admired  both are lost from modern view among the short pieces of the last volumes of the waverley novels  of the poets interest in and attitude towards the more obscure pyschological and psychical problemsto popular science foolishnessenough has been said but the remarks of professor tyndall have not been cited   my special purpose in introducing this poem however was to call your attention to a passage further on which greatly interested me the poem is throughout a discussion between a believer in immortality and one who is unable to believe  the method pursued is this  the sage reads a portion of the scroll which he has taken from the hands of his follower and then brings his own arguments to bear upon that portion with a view to neutralising the scepticism of the younger man  let me here remark that i read the whole series of poems published under the title tiresias full of admiration for their freshness and vigour  seven years after i had first read them your father died and you his son asked me to contribute a chapter to the book which you contemplate publishing  i knew that i had some small store of references to my interview with your father carefully written in ancient journals  on the receipt of your request i looked up the account of my first visit to farringford and there to my profound astonishment i found described that experience of your fathers which in the mouth of the ancient sage was made the ground of an important argument against materialism and in favour of personal immortality eightandtwenty years afterwards  in no other poem during all these years is to my knowledge this experience once alluded to  i had completely forgotten it but here it was recorded in black and white  if you turn to your fathers account of the wonderful state of consciousness superinduced by thinking of his own name and compare it with the argument of the ancient sage you will see that they refer to one and the same phenomenon      and more my son for more than once when i sat all alone revolving in myself the word that is the symbol of myself the mortal limit of the self was loosed and past into the nameless as a cloud melts into heaven  i touchd my limbs the limbs were strange not mineand yet no shade of doubt but utter clearness and thro loss of self the gain of such large life as matchd with ours were sun to sparkunshadowable in words themselves but shadows of a shadowworld   any words about tennyson as a politician are apt to excite the sleepless prejudice which haunts the political field  he probably if forced to put a name to it would have called himself a liberal but he was not a social agitator  he never set a rick on fire  he held aloof in a somewhat detached position from the great social seethings of his age mr frederic harrison  but in youth he helped to extinguish some flaming ricks  he spoke of the manyheaded beast the reading public in terms borrowed from plato  he had no higher esteem for mobs than shakespeare or john knox professed while his theory of tyrants in the case of napoleon iii about 1852 was that of liberals like mr swinburne and victor hugo  though to modern enlightenment tennyson may seem as great a tory as dr johnson yet he had spoken his word in 1852 for the freedom of france and for securing england against the supposed designs of a usurper now fallen  he really believed obsolete as the faith may be in guarding our own both on land and sea  perhaps no continental or american critic has ever yet dispraised a poetical fellowcountryman merely for urging the duties of national union and national defence a critic however writes thus of tennyson  when our poet descends into the arena of party polemics in such things as riflemen form hands all round     the fleet and other topical pieces dear to the jingo soul it is not poetry but journalism  i doubt whether the desirableness of the existence of a volunteer force and of a fleet really is within the arena of party polemics  if any party thinks that we ought to have no volunteers and that it is our duty to starve the fleet what is that partys name  who cries down with the fleet  down with national defence  hooray for the disintegration of the empire  tennyson was not a party man but he certainly would have opposed any such party  if to defend our homes and this england be jingoism tennyson like shakespeare was a jingo  but alas i do not know the name of the party which opposes tennyson and which wishes the invader to trample down englandany invader will do for so philanthropic a purpose  except when resisting this unnamed party the poet seldom or never entered the arena of party polemics tennyson could not have exclaimed like squire western hurrah for old england  twenty thousand honest frenchmen have landed in kent he undeniably did write verses whether poetry or journalism tending to make readers take an unfavourable view of honest invaders  if to do that is to be a jingo and if such conduct hurts the feelings of any great english party then tennyson was a jingo and a partisan and was so far a rhymester like mr kipling  indeed we know that tennyson applauded mr kiplings the english flag  so the worst is out as we in england count the worst  in america and on the continent of europe however a poet may be proud of his countrys flag without incurring rebuke from his countrymen  tennyson did not reckon himself a party man he believed more in political evolution than in political revolution with cataclysms  he was neither an anarchist nor a home ruler nor a politician so generous as to wish england to be laid defenceless at the feet of her foes  if these sentiments deserve censure in tennyson at least they claim our tolerance  he was not born in a generation late enough to be truly liberal  old prejudices about this england old words from henry v and king john haunted his memory and darkened his vision of the true proportions of things  we draw in prejudice with our mothers milk  the mother of tennyson had not been an agnostic or a comtist his father had not been a staunch trueblue anti englander  thus he inherited a certain bias in favour of faith and fatherland a bias from which he could never emancipate himself  but tout comprendre cest tout pardonner  had tennysons birth been later we might find in him a more complete realisation of our poetic idealmight have detected less to blame or to forgive  with that apology we must leave the fame of tennyson as a politician to the clement consideration of an enlightened posterity  i do not defend his narrow insularities his jingoism or the appreciable percentage of faith which blushing analysis may detect in his honest doubt  these things i may regret or condemn but we ought not to let them obscure our view of the poet  he was led away by bad examples of all jingoes shakespeare is the most unashamed and next to him are drayton scott and wordsworth with his   oh for one hour of that dundee   in the years which followed the untoward affair of waterloo young tennyson fell much under the influence of shakespeare wordsworth and the other offenders and these are extenuating circumstances  by a curious practical paradox where the realms of poetry and politics meet the tory critics seem milder of mood and more liberal than the liberal critics  thus mr william morris was certainly a very advanced political theorist and in theology mr swinburne has written things not easily reconcilable with orthodoxy  yet we find divine right tories who in literature are fervent admirers of these two poets and leave their heterodoxies out of account  but many liberal critics appear unable quite to forgive tennyson because he did not wish to starve the fleet and because he held certain very ancient if obsolete beliefs  perhaps a general amnesty ought to be passed as far as poets are concerned and their politics and creeds should be left to silence where beyond these voices there is peace  one remark i hope can excite no prejudice  the greatest of the gordons was a soldier and lived in religion  but the point at which tennysons memory is blended with that of gordon is the point of sympathy with the neglected poor  it is to his wise advice and to affection for gordon that we owe the gordon training school for poor boysa good school and good boys come out of that academy  the question as to tennysons precise rank in the glorious roll of the poets of england can never be determined by us if in any case or at any time such determinations can be made  we do not or should not ask whether virgil or lucretius whether aeschylus or sophocles is the greater poet  the consent of mankind seems to place homer and shakespeare and dante high above all  for the rest no prizelist can be settled  if influence among aliens is the test byron probably takes among our poets the next rank after shakespeare  but probably there is no possible test  in certain respects shelley in many respects milton in some coleridge in some burns in the opinion of a number of persons browning are greater poets than tennyson  but for exquisite variety and varied exquisiteness tennyson is not readily to be surpassed  at one moment he pleases the uncritical mass of readers in another mood he wins the verdict of the raffine  it is a success which scarce any english poet but shakespeare has excelled  his faults have rarely if ever been those of flatfooted thickankled dulness of rhetoric of common place rather have his defects been the excess of his qualities  a kind of john bullishness may also be noted especially in derogatory references to france which true or untrue are out of taste and keeping  but these errors could be removed by the excision of half adozen lines  his later work as the voyage of maeldune shows a just appreciation of ancient celtic literature  a great critic f t palgrave has expressed perhaps the soundest appreciation of tennyson   it is for the days that remain to bear witness to his real place in the great hierarchy amongst whom dante boldly yet justly ranked himself  but if we look at tennysons work in a twofold aspect here on the exquisite art in which throughout his verse is clothed the lucid beauty of the form the melody almost audible as music the mysterious skill by which the words used constantly strike as the inevitable words and hence unforgettable the subtle allusive touches by which a secondary image is suggested to enrich the leading thought as the harmonic partials give richness to the note struck upon the string there when we think of the vast fertility in subject and treatment united with happy selection of motive the wide range of character the dramatic force of impersonation the pathos in every variety the mastery over the comic and the tragic alike above all perhaps those phrases of luminous insight which spring direct from imaginative observation of humanity true for all time coming from the heart to the hearthis work will probably be found to lie somewhere between that of virgil and shakespeare  having its portion if i may venture on the phrase in the inspiration of both   a professed enthusiast for tennyson can add nothing to and take nothing from these words of one who though his friend was too truly a critic to entertain the admiration that goes beyond idolatry    footnotes  1  macmillan  co  2  to the present writer as to others the lovers tale appeared to be imitative of shelley but if tennyson had never read shelley cadit
