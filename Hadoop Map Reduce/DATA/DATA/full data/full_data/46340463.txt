rather more than half a century extending if we may put it a little roughly over the middle fifty years of the eighteenth century this middle period marks the exact date of the decisive and immediate preparation for the revolution at its beginning neither the intellectual nor the social elements of the great disruption had distinctly appeared or commenced their fermentation at its close their work was completed and we may count the months thence until the overthrow of every institution in france it was between 1727 and 1781 that the true revolution took place the events from 89 were only finishing strokes the final explosion of a fabric under which every yard had been mined by the long endeavour for half a century of an army of destroyers deliberate and involuntary direct and oblique such as the world has never at any other time beheld  in 1727 voltaire was returning from his exile in england to open the long campaign of which he was from that time forth to the close of his days the brilliant and indomitable captain he died in 1778 bright resolute humane energetic to the last thus turgots life was almost exactly contemporary with the pregnant era of voltaires activity in the same spring in which turgot died maurepas too came to his end and necker was dismissed the last event was the signal at which the floods of the deluge fairly began to rise and the revolutionary tide to swell  it will be observed moreover that turgot was born half a generation after the first race of the speculative revolutionists rousseau diderot helvétius condillac dalembert as well as the foreign hume so much the greatest of the whole band of innovators because penetrating so much nearer to the depths all came into the world which they were to confuse so unspeakably in the half dozen years between 1711 and 1717 turgot was of later stock and comes midway between these fathers of the new church between hume rousseau diderot and the generation of its fiery practical apostles condorcet mirabeau robespierre1 the only other illustrious european of this decade was adam smith who was born in 1723 and between whose labours and some of the most remarkable of turgots there was so much community we cannot tell how far the gulf between turgot and the earlier band was fixed by the accident that he did not belong to their generation in point of time the accident is in itself only worth calling attention to in connection with his distance from them in other and more important points than time  footnote 1 born in 1743 1749 and 1759 respectively  the years of turgot exactly bridge the interval between the ministry of the infamous dubois and the ministry of the inglorious calonne between the despair and confusion of the close of the regency and the despair and confusion of the last ten years of the monarchy in 1727 we stand on the threshold of that farresounding fiery workshop where a hundred hands wrought the cunning implements and cyclopean engines that were to serve in storming the hated citadels of superstition and injustice in 1781 we emerge from these subterranean realms into the open air to find ourselves surrounded by all the sounds and portents of imminent ruin this then is the significance of the date of turgots birth                               his stock was norman and those who amuse themselves by finding a vital condition of the highest ability in antiquity of blood may quote the descent of turgot in support of their delusion his biographers speak of one togut a danish prince who walked the earth some thousand years before the christian era and of saint turgot in the eleventh century the prior of durham biographer of bede and first minister of malcolm iii of scotland we shall do well not to linger in this too dark and frigid air let us pass over togut and saint turgot and the founder of a hospital in the thirteenth century and the greatgreatgrandfather who sat as president of the norman nobles in the statesgeneral of 1614 and the grandfather who deserted arms for the toga history is hardly concerned in this solemn marshalling of shades  even with micheletienne the father of turgot we have here no dealing let it suffice to say that he held high municipal office in paris and performed its duties with exceptional honour and spirit giving sumptuous fêtes constructing useful public works and on one occasion jeoparding his life with a fine intrepidity that did not fail in his son in appeasing a bloody struggle between two bodies of swiss and french guards there is in the library of the british museum a folio of 1740 containing elaborate plates and letterpress descriptive of the fêtes celebrated by the city of paris with micheletienne turgot as its chief officer on the occasion of the marriage of louiseelizabeth of france to don philip of spain august 1739 as one contemplates these courtly sumptuosities la bruyères famous picture recurs to the mind of far other scenes in the same gay land we see certain wild animals male and female scattered over the fields black livid all burnt by the sun bound to the earth that they dig and work with unconquerable pertinacity they have a sort of articulate voice and when they rise on their feet they show a human face in fact they are men that these violent and humiliating contrasts are eternal and inevitable is the last word of the dominant philosophy of society and one of the reasons why turgots life is worth studying is that he felt in so preeminent a degree the urgency of lightening the destiny of that livid wild hardly articulate evertoiling multitude  the sum of the genealogical page is that turgot inherited that position which falling to worthy souls is of its nature so invaluable a family tradition of exalted courage and generous public spirit there have been noble and patriotic men who lacked this inheritance but we may be sure that even these would have fought the battle at greater advantage if a magnanimous preference for the larger interests had come to them as a matter of instinctive prejudice instead of being acquired as a matter of reason the question of titular aristocracy is not touched by this consideration for titular aristocracies postpone the larger interests to the narrow interests of their order and turgots family was only of the secondary noblesse of the robe  turgot was the third son of his father as the employments which persons of respectable family could enter were definite and stereotyped there was little room for debate as to the calling for which a youth should prepare himself arms civil administration and the church furnished the only three openings for a gentleman the effects of this rigorous adherence to artificial and exclusive rules of caste were manifestly injurious to society as such caste rules always are after a society has passed beyond a certain stage to identify the interests of the richest and most powerful class with the interests of the church of the army and of a given system of civil government was indeed to give to that class the strongest motives for leaving the existing social order undisturbed it unfortunately went too far in this direction by fostering the strongest possible motives of hostility to such modifications in these gigantic departments as changing circumstances might make needful in the breasts of the only men who could produce these modifications without a violent organic revolution such a system left too little course to spontaneity and its curse is the curse of french genius some of its evil effects were obvious and on the surface the man who should have been a soldier found himself saying mass and hearing confessions vauvenargues who was born for diplomacy or literature passed the flower of his days in the organised dreariness of garrisons and marches in our own day communities and men who lead them have still to learn that no waste is so profuse and immeasurable even from the material point of view as that of intellectual energy checked uncultivated ignored or left without its opportunity in france until a very short time before the revolution we can hardly point to a single recognised usage which did not augment this waste the eldest son usually preserved the rank and status of the family whether civil or military turgots eldest brother was to devote himself to civil administration the next to be a soldier and turgot himself to be an ecclesiastic  the second of the brothers who began by following arms had as little taste for them as the future minister had for the church it is rather remarkable that he seems to have had the same passion for administration and he persuaded the government after the loss of canada that guiana to be called equinoctial france would if well governed become some sort of equivalent for the northern possession he was made governorgeneral but he had forgotten to take the climate into account and the scheme came to an abortive end involving him in a mass of confused quarrels which lasted some years he had a marked love for botany agriculture and the like was one of the founders of the society of agriculture in 1760 and was the author of various pieces on points of natural history2  footnote 2 among others of a little volume still to be met with in libraries sur la manière de préparer les diverses curiosités dhistoire naturelle 1758  turgot went as a boarder first to the college of louislegrand then to that of plessis thence to the seminary of saint sulpice where he took the degree of bachelor in theology and from saint sulpice to the sorbonne his childhood and youth like that of other men who have afterwards won love and admiration have their stories the affection of one biographer records how the pocketmoney with which the young turgot was furnished used always instantly to disappear no one knew how nor on what it was discovered that he gave it to poor schoolfellows to enable them to buy books condorcet justly remarks on this trait that goodness and even generosity are not rare sentiments in childhood but for these sentiments to be guided by such wisdom this really seems the presage of an extraordinary man all whose sentiments should be virtues because they would always be controlled by reason3 it is at any rate certain that the union of profound benevolence with judgment which this story prefigures was the supreme distinction of turgots character it is less pleasant to learn that turgot throughout his childhood was always repulsed by his mother who deemed him sullen because he failed to make his bow with good grace and was shy and taciturn he fled from her visitors and would hide himself behind sofa or screen until dragged forth for social inspection4 this is only worth recording because the same external awkwardness and lack of grace remained with turgot to the end and had something to do with the unpopularity that caused his fall perhaps he was thinking of his own childhood when he wrote that fathers are often indifferent or incessantly occupied with the details of business and that he had seen the very parents who taught their children that there is nothing so noble as to make people happy yet repulse the same children when urging some ones claim to charity or favour and intimidate their young sensibility instead of encouraging and training it5  footnote 3 vie de turgot p 8 ed 1847  footnote 4 mémoires de morellet i 12 ed 1822  footnote 5 lettre à madame de graffigny oeuv ii 793  morellet one of the best known of the little group of friends and brother students at the sorbonne has recorded other authentic traits turgot he says united the simplicity of a child to a peculiar dignity that forced the respect of his comrades his modesty and reserve were those of a girl and those equivocal references in which the undisciplined animalism of youth often has a stealthy satisfaction always called the blood to his cheeks and covered him with embarrassment for all that his spirit was full of a frank gaiety and he would indulge in long bursts of laughter at a pleasantry or frolic that struck him we may be glad to know this because without express testimony to the contrary there would have been some reason for suspecting that turgot was defective in that most wholesome and human quality of a capacity for laughter  the sensitive purity which morellet notices not without slight lifting of the eyebrow remained with turgot throughout his life this was the more remarkable from the prevailing laxity of opinion upon this particular subject perhaps the worst blemish upon the feeling and intelligence of the revolutionary schools for it was not merely libertines like marmontel making a plea for their own dissoluteness who habitually spoke of these things with inconsiderate levity grave men of blameless life like condorcet deliberately argued in favour of leaving a loose rein to the mutual inclinations of men and women and laughed at the time wasted in quenching the darts of the flesh6 it is true that at dholbachs house the headquarters of the dogmatic atheism in which the irreligious reaction culminated this was the only theme on which freedom of speech was sometimes curtailed but the fact that such a restriction should have been noticed suggests that it was exceptional7 one good effect followed let us admit the virtuousness of continence was not treated as a superstition by those who vindicated it as turgot did but discussed like any other virtue and was defended not as an intuition of faith but as a reasoned conclusion of the judgment it was permitted to occupy no solitary and mysterious throne apart and away from other conditions and parts of human excellence and social wellbeing there is intrinsically no harm in any virtue being accepted in the firm shape of a simple prejudice on the contrary there is a multitude of practical advantages in such a consolidated and spontaneously working order but in considering conduct and character and forming an opinion upon infractions of a virtue we cannot be just unless we have analysed its conditions and this is what the eighteenth century did defectively with regard to that particular virtue which so often usurps the name of all of the virtues together in this respect turgots original purity of character withdrew him from the error of the time  footnote 6 letter to turgot oeuv de condorcet i 228 see also vi 264 and 523526  footnote 7 morellet i 133  with the moral quality that we have seen morellet adds that for the intellectual side turgot as a boy had a prodigious memory he could retain as many as a hundred and eighty lines of verse after hearing them twice or sometimes even once he knew by heart most of voltaires fugitive pieces and long passages in his poems and tragedies his predominant characteristics are described as penetration and that other valuable faculty to which penetration is an indispensable adjunct but which it by no means invariably impliesa spirit of broad and systematic coordination the unusual precocity of his intelligence was perhaps imperfectly appreciated by his fellowstudents it led him so far beyond any point within their sight it has been justly said of him that he passed at once from infancy to manhood and was in the rank of sages before he had shaken off the dust of the playground he was of the type of those who strangle serpents while yet in the cradle we know the temperament which from the earliest hour consumes with eager desire for knowledge and energises spontaneously with unceasing and joyful activity in that bright and pure morning of intellectual curiosity which neither the dull tumultuous needs of life nor the mists of spiritual misgiving have yet come up to make dim of this temperament was turgot in a superlative degree and its fire never abated in him from college days down to the last hours while he lay racked with irremediable anguish  to a certain extent this was the glorious mark of all the best minds of the epoch from voltaire downwards they were inflamed by an inextinguishable and universal curiosity voltaire hardly left a single corner of the field entirely unexplored in science poetry history philosophy rousseau wrote a comic opera and was an ardent botanist diderot wrote and wrote well and intelligently de omni scibili and was the author alike of the letters on the blind and jacques le fataliste no era was ever so little the era of the specialist                               the society of the sorbonne corresponded exactly to a college at one of our universities and will be distinguished by the careful reader from the faculty of theology in the university which was usually but not always composed of docteurs de sorbonne it consisted of a large number of learned men in the position of fellows and a smaller number of younger students who lived together just as undergraduates do in separate apartments but with common hall library and garden one of turgots masters sigorgne was the first to teach in the university the newtonian principles of astronomy instead of the cartesian hypothesis of vortices as is well known cartesianism had for various reasons taken a far deeper root in france than it ever did here and held its place a good generation after newtonian ideas were accepted and taught at oxford and cambridge8 voltaires translation of the principia which he was prevented by the cartesian chancellor daguesseau from publishing until 1738 overthrew the reigning system and gave a strong impulse to scientific inquiry  footnote 8 whewells hist induct sciences ii 147159  turgot mastered the new doctrine with avidity in the acute letter of criticism which while still at the sorbonne he addressed to buffon he pointedly urged it as the first objection to that writers theory of the formation and movements of the planets that any attempt at fundamental explanations of this kind was a departure from the simplicity and safe reserve of the philosophy of newton9 he only however made a certain advance in mathematics he appears to have had no peculiar or natural aptitude for this study though he is said to have constantly blamed himself for not having gone more deeply into it it is hardly to be denied that mathematical genius and philosophic genius do not always go together the precision definiteness and accurate limitations of the method of the one are usually unfriendly to the brooding tentative uncircumscribed meditation which is the productive humour in the other turgot was essentially of the philosophising temper though the activity of his intelligence was incessant his manner of work was the reverse of quick when he applied to work says morellet when it was a question of writing or doing he was slow and loitering slow because he insisted on finishing all he did perfectly according to his own conception of perfection which was most difficult of attainment even down to the minutest detail and because he would not receive assistance being never contented with what he had not done himself he also loitered a great deal losing time in arranging his desk and cutting his pens not that he was not thinking profoundly through all this trifling but mere thinking did not advance his work10 we may admit perhaps that the work was all the better for the thinking that preceded it and that the time which turgot seemed to waste in cutting his pens and setting his table in order was more fruitfully spent than the busiest hours of most men  footnote 9 oeuv de turgot ii 783 edition of messrs eugène daire and h dussard published in the collection des principaux economistes published by guillaumin 1844  footnote 10 mémoires i 16  we know the books which turgot and his friends devoured with ardour locke bayle voltaire buffon relieved clarke leibnitz spinosa cudworth and constant discussions among themselves both cleared up and enlarged what they read11 one of the disputants certainly not the least amiable has painted his own part in these discussions i was violent in discussion says the good morellet as he was pleasantly called but without my antagonist being able to reproach me with a single insult and sometimes i used to spit blood after a debate in which i had not allowed a single personality to escape me12  footnote 11 ib i 20  footnote 12 ib i 19  another member of the circle was loménie de brienne who in long years after was chief minister of france for a narrow space through the momentous winter of 1787 and the spring of the next year filling the gap between calonne and necker in a desperate and fatal manner loménies ambition dated from his youth and it was always personal and mean while turgot his friend was earnestly meditating on the destinies of the race and the conditions of their development loménie was dreaming only of the restoration of his ancestral château of brienne though quite without means he planned this in his visions on a scale of extreme costliness and magnificence the dreams fell true money came to the family and the château was built exactly as he had projected it at a cost of two million francs13 his career was splendid he was clever industrious and persevering after his fashion astute lively pretentious a person ever by wellplanned hints leading you to suppose his unrevealed profundity to be bottomless in a word in all respects an impostor14 he espoused that richly dowered bride the church rose to be archbishop of toulouse and would have risen to be archbishop of paris but for the kings overscrupulous conviction that an archbishop of paris must at least believe in god he became an immense favourite with marie antoinette and the court was made minister like richelieu and mazarin and after having postured and played tricks in face of the bursting deluge and given the government the final impulse into the abyss of bankruptcy was dismissed with the rich archbishopric of sens and a cardinals hat for himself and good sinecures for his kinsfolk his last official act was to send for the 20000 livres for his months salary not fully due his brother the count of brienne remained in office as minister of war he was a person of no talent his friends allowed but assisted by a good chief clerk he would have made a good minister he meant well this was hardly a sufficient reason for letting him take 100000 francs out of an impoverished treasury for the furniture of his residence the hour however was just striking and the knife was sharpened  footnote 13 morellets mémoires i 1721 262270 and ii 15  footnote 14 marmontels mémoires bk xiii morellet however with persevering friendliness denies the truth of marmontels picture ii 465  all his paltry honour and glory loménie de brienne enjoyed for a season until the jacobins laid violent hands upon him he poisoned himself in his own palace just as a worse thing was about to befall him alas poetic justice is the exception in history and only once in many generations does the drama of the state criminal rise to an artistic fifth act this was in 1794 in 1750 a farewell dinner had been given in the rooms of the abbé de brienne at the sorbonne and the friends made an appointment for a game of tennis behind the church of the sorbonne in the year 180015 the year came but no loménie nor turgot and the sorbonne itself had vanished  footnote 15 morellet i 21  when the time arrived for his final acceptance of an ecclesiastical destination turgot felt that honourable repugnance which might have been anticipated alike from his morality and his intelligence to enter into an engagement which would irrevocably bind him for the rest of his life either always to hold exactly the same opinions or else to continue to preach them publicly after he had ceased to hold them privately no certainty of worldly comfort and advantage could in his eyes counterbalance the possible danger and shame of a position which might place him between the two alternatives of stifling his intelligence and outraging his consciencethe one by blind unscrutinising and immovable acceptance of all the dogmas and sentiments of the church the other by the inculcation as truths of what he believed to be false and the proscription as falsehoods of what he believed to be true the horror and disgrace of such a situation were too striking for one who used his mind and acted on principle to run any risk of that situation becoming his own an ambitious timeserver like loménie or a contented adherent of use and wont like morellet might well regard such considerations as the products of a weak and eccentric scrupulosity turgot was of other calibre holding it to be only a degree less unprincipled than the avowed selfishness of the adventurer to contract so serious an engagement on the strength of common hearsay and current usage without deliberate personal reflection and inquiry  at the close of his course at the sorbonne he wrote a letter to his father giving the reasons for this resolution to abandon all idea of an ecclesiastical career and the advancement which it offered him and seeking his consent for the change from church to law his father approved of the resolution and gave the required consent as turgot had studied law as well as theology no time was lost and he formally entered the profession of the law as deputycounsellor of the procureurgénéral at the beginning of 1752  his college friends had remonstrated warmly at this surrender of a brilliant prospect a little deputation of young abbés fresh from their vows waited on him at his rooms in that humour of blithe and sagacious goodwill which comes so naturally to men who believe they have just found out fortunes trick and yoked her fast for ever to the car they declared that he was about to do something opposed to his own interest and inconsistent with his usual good sense he was a younger son of a norman house and therefore poor the law without a competency involved no consideration and he could hope for no advancement in it whereas in the church his family being possessed of influence and credit would have no difficulty in procuring for him excellent abbeys and in good time a rich bishopric here he could realise all his fine dreams of administration and without ceasing to be a churchman could play the statesman to his hearts content in one profession he would waste his genius in arguing trifling private affairs while in the other he would be of the highest usefulness to his country and would acquire the greatest reputation turgot however insisted on placing genius and reputation below the necessity of being honest the object of an oath might be of the least important kind but he could neither allow himself to play with it nor believe that a man could abase his profession in public opinion without at the same time abasing himself you shall do as you will he said for my own part it is impossible for me to wear a mask all my life16  footnote 16 dupont de nemours condorcets vie de turgot pp 810  his clear intelligence revolted from the dominant sophisms of that time by which philosophers as well as ecclesiastics brought falsehood and hypocrisy within the four corners of a decent doctrine of truth and morality the churchman manfully argued that he could be most useful to the world if he were well off and highly placed the philosopher contended that as the world would punish him if he avowed what he had written or what he believed he was fully warranted in lying to the world as to his writing and belief for is not the right to have the truth told to you a thing forfeitable by tyranny and oppression17 truth is not mocked and these sophisms bore their fruit in due season perhaps if there had been found on either side in france a hundred righteous men like turgot who would not fight in masks the end might have been other than it was the lesson remains for those who dream that by reducing pretence to a nicely graduated system and by leaving an exactly measured margin between what they really believe and what they feign to believe they are serving the great cause of order french history informs us what becomes of social order so served after all no man can be sure that it is required of him to save society every man can be sure that he is called upon to keep himself clean from mendacity and equivoke such was turgots view  footnote 17 la nécessité de mentir pour désavouer un ouvrage est une extrémité qui répugne également à la conscience et à la noblesse du caractère mais le crime est pour les

only one in 1754 there appeared two letters nominally from an ecclesiastic to a magistrate and entitled le conciliateur here it is enough to say that they were intended to enforce the propriety and duty of religious toleration in a letter to a friend we find turgot saying although the conciliator is of my principles and those of our friend i am astonished at your conjectures it is neither his style nor mine18 yet turgot had written it this is his one public literary equivocation let us at all events allow that it was resorted to not to break the law with safety nor to cloak a malicious attack on a person but to give additional weight by means of a harmless prosopopoeia to an argument for the noblest of principles19  footnote 18 oeuv ii 685 morellet says that it was written by loménie de brienne 19  footnote 19 see the note of dupont de nemours ad loc                               before turgot entered the great world he had already achieved an amount of success in philosophic speculation which placed him in the front rank of social thinkers to that passion for study and the acquisition of knowledge which is not uncommon in youth as it is one of the most attractive of youths qualities there was added in him what is unhappily not common in men and women of any agean active impulse to use his own intelligence upon the information which he gained from books and professors he was no conceited or froward caviller at authority nor born rebel against established teachers and governors his understanding seriously craved a full and independent satisfaction and could draw this only from laborious meditation which should either disclose the inadequacy of the grounds for an opinion or else establish it with what would be to him a new and higher because an independently acquired conclusiveness  his letter to buffon to which we have already referred is an illustration of this wise and never captious nor ungracious caution in receiving ideas neither buffons reputation nor the glow of his style nor the dazzling ingenuity and grandeur of his conceptionsall of them so well calculated at oneandtwenty to throw even a vigilant intelligence off its guardcould divert turgot from the prime scientific duty of confronting a theory with facts buffon was for explaining the formation of the earth and the other planets and their lateral movement by the hypothesis that a comet had fallen obliquely on to the sun driven off certain portions of its constituent matter in a state of fusion and that these masses made spherical by the mutual attraction of their parts were carried to different distances in proportion to their mass and the force originally impressed on them buffon may have been actuated both here and in his other famous hypothesis of reproduction by a desire less to propound a true and durable explanation than to arrest by a bold and comprehensive generalisation that attention which is only imperfectly touched by mere collections of particular facts the enormous impulse which even the most unscientific of the speculations of descartes had given to european thought was a standing temptation to philosophers not to discard nor relax patient observation but to bind together the results which they arrived at by this process by means of some hardy hypothesis it might be true or not but it was at any rate sure to strike the imagination which ever craves wholes and to stimulate discussion and further discovery by sending assailants and defenders alike in search of new facts to confirm or overthrow the position20  footnote 20 see condorcets éloge on buffon oeuv iii 335 and a passage from bourdon quoted in whewells hist induct sci iii 348  turgot was less sensible of these possible advantages than he was alive to the certain dangers of such a method he perceived that to hold a theory otherwise than as an inference from facts is to have a strong motive for looking at the facts in a predetermined light or for ignoring them an involuntary predisposition most fatal to the discovery of truth which is nothing more than the conformity of our conception of facts to their adequately observed order why he asks do you replunge us into the night of hypotheses justifying the cartesians and their three elements and their vortices and whence comes your comet was it within the sphere of the suns attraction if not how could it fall from the sphere of the other bodies and fall on the sun which was not acting on it if it was it must have fallen perpendicularly not obliquely and therefore if it imparted a lateral movement this direction must have been impressed on it and if so why should not god have impressed this movement upon the planets directly as easily as upon the comet to communicate it to them finally how could the planets have left the body of the sun without falling back into it again what curve did they describe in leaving it so as never to return can you suppose that gravitation could cause the same body to describe a spiral and an ellipse in the same exact spirit turgot brings known facts to bear on buffons theory of the arrangement of the terrestrial and marine divisions of the earths surface the whole criticism he sent to buffon anonymously to assure him that the writer had no other motive than the interest he took in the discovery of truth and the perfection of a great work21  footnote 21 october 1748 oeuv ii 782784  turgots is probably the only case where the biographer has in emerging from the days of school and college at once to proceed to expound and criticise the intellectual productions of his hero and straightway to present fruit and flower of a time that usually does no more than prepare the unseen roots there is perhaps a wider and more stimulating attraction of a dramatic kind in the study of characters which present a history of active and continuous growth which while absolutely free from flimsy caprice and disordered eccentricity are ever surprising our attention by an unsuspected word of calm judgment or fertile energy a fresh interest or an added sympathy by the disappearance of some crudity or the assimilation of some new and richer quality of such gradual rise into full maturity we have here nothing to record as a student turgot had already formed the list of a number of works which he designed to execute poems tragedies philosophic romances vast treatises on physics history geography politics morals metaphysics and language22 of some he had drawn out the plan and even these plans and fragments possess a novelty and depth of view that belong even to the integrity of few works  footnote 22 condorcets vie de turgot 14  before passing on to the more scientific speculations of this remarkable intelligence it is worth while to notice his letter to madame de graffigny both for the intrinsic merit and scope of the ideas it contains and for the proof it furnishes of the interest at once early and profound which he took in moral questions lying at the very bottom as well of sound character as of a healthy society turgots early passion for literature had made him seize an occasion of being introduced to even so moderately renowned a professor of it as madame de graffigny he happened to be intimate with her niece who afterwards became the lively and witty wife of helvétius somewhat to the surprise of turgots friends for although he persuaded mademoiselle de ligniville to present him to her aunt and though he assiduously attended madame de graffignys literary gatherings turgot would constantly quit the circle of men of letters for the sake of a game of battledore with the comely and attractive niece hence the astonishment of men that from such familiarity there grew no stronger passion and that whatever the causes of such reserve the only issue was a tender and lasting friendship23  footnote 23 morellet i 140  madame de graffigny had begged turgots opinion upon the manuscript of a work composed as so many others were after the pattern of montesquieus lettres persanesnow nearly thirty years oldand bearing the accurately imitative title of lettres peruviennes a peruvian comes to europe and sends to a friend or mistress in peru a series of remarks on civilisation goldsmiths delightful citizen of the world is the best known type in our own literature of this primitive form of social criticism the effect upon common opinion of criticism cast in such a mould presenting familiar habits institutions and observances in a striking and unusual light was to give a kind of socratic stimulus to peoples ideas about education civilisation conduct and the other topics springing from a comparison between the manners of one community and another that one of the two whether peru or china or persia was a community drawn mainly from the imagination did not render the contrast any the less effective in stirring mens minds  by the middle of the century the air was full of ideas upon these social subjects the temptation was irresistible to turn from the confusion of squalor oppression license distorted organisation penetrative disorder to ideal states comprising a little range of simple circumstances and a small number of types of virtuous and unsophisticated character much came of the relief thus sought and found it was the beginning of the subversive process for it taught men to look away from ideas of practical amelioration the genius of rousseau gave these dreams the shape which in many respects so unfortunately for france finally attracted the bulk of the national sentiment and sympathy but the vivid humane and inspiring pages of emile were not published until ten years after turgots letter to madame de graffigny24 a circumstance which may teach us that in moral as in physical discoveries though one man may take the final step and reap the fame the conditions have been prepared beforehand it is almost discouraging to think that we may reproduce such passages as the following without being open to the charge of slaying the slain though one hundred and twenty years have elapsed since it was written  footnote 24 written in 1751 oeuv ii 785794  let zilia show that our too arbitrary institutions have too often made us forget nature that we have been the dupes of our own handiwork and that the savage who does not know how to consult nature knows how to follow her let her criticise our pedantry for it is this that constitutes our education of the present day look at the rudiments they begin by insisting on stuffing into the heads of children a crowd of the most abstract ideas those whom nature in her variety summons to her by all her objects we fasten up in a single spot we occupy them on words which cannot convey any sense to them because the sense of words can only come with ideas and ideas only come by degrees starting from sensible objects25 but besides we insist on their acquiring them without the help that we have had we whom age and experience have formed we keep their imagination prisoner we deprive them of the sight of objects by which nature gives to the savage his first notions of all things of all the sciences even we have not the coupdoeil of nature  footnote 25 on sera surpris que je compte létude des langues au nombre des inutilités de léducation etcemile bk ii  it is the same with morality general ideas again spoil all people take great trouble to tell a child that he must be just temperate and virtuous and has it the least idea of virtue do not say to your son be virtuous but make him find pleasure in being so develop within his heart the germ of sentiments that nature has placed there26 there is often much more need for bulwarks against education than against nature give him opportunities of being truthful liberal compassionate rely on the human heart leave these precious seeds to bloom in the air which surrounds them do not stifle them under a quantity of frames and network i am not one of those who want to reject general and abstract ideas they are necessary but i by no means think them in their place in our method of instruction i would have them come to children as they come to men by degrees  footnote 26 see locke of education §§ 81 184 etc  another article of our education which strikes me as bad and ridiculous is our severity towards these poor children they do something silly we take them up as if it were extremely important there is a multitude of these follies of which they will cure themselves by age alone but people do not count on that they insist that the son should be well bred and they overwhelm him with little rules of civility often frivolous which can only harass him as he does not know the reason for them i think it would be enough to hinder him from being troublesome to the persons that he sees27 the rest will come little by little inspire him with the desire of pleasing he will soon know more of the art than all the masters could teach him people wish again that a child should be grave they think it wise for it not to run and fear every moment that it will fall what happens you weary and enfeeble it we have especially forgotten that it is a part of education to form the body28  footnote 27 la seule leçon de morale qui convienne à lenfance et la plus importante à tout âge est de ne jamais faire de mal à personne etc emile bk ii never trouble yourself about these faults in them which you know age will cure and therefore want of wellfashioned civility in the carriage  should be the parents least care

that respect will of itself teach these ways of expressing it which he observes most acceptable etclocke of education §§ 63 67 etc  footnote 28 vous donnez la science à la bonne heure moi je moccupe de linstrument propre à lacquérir etcemile  the reader who remembers lockes thoughts concerning education published in 1690 and the particularly homely prescriptions upon the subjects of the infant body with which that treatise opens will recognise the source of turgots inspiration the same may be said of the other wise passages in this letter upon the right attitude of a father towards his child it was not merely the metaphysics of the sage and positive locke which laid the revolutionary train in france this influence extended over the whole field and even rousseau confesses the obligations of the imaginary governor of emile to the real locke  we are again plainly in the lockian atmosphere when turgot speaks of men being the dupes of general ideas which are true because drawn from nature but which people embrace with a narrow stiffness that makes them false because they no longer combine them with circumstances taking for absolute what is only the expression of a relation the merit of this and the other educational parts of the piece is not their originality but that kind of complete and finished assimilation which is all but tantamount to independent thought and which in certain conditions may be much more practically useful  not less important to the happiness of men than the manner of their education is their own cultivation of a wise spirit of tolerance in conduct i should like to see explained turgot says the causes of alienation and disgust between people who love one another i believe that after living awhile with men we perceive that bickerings illhumours teasings on trifles perhaps cause more troubles and divisions among them than serious things how many bitternesses have their origin in a word in forgetfulness of some slight observances if people would only weigh in an exact balance so many little wrongs if they would only put themselves in the place of those who have to complain of them if they would only reflect how many times they have themselves given way to humours how many things they have forgotten a single word spoken in disparagement of our intelligence is enough to make us irreconcilable and yet how often have we been deceived in the very same matter how many persons of understanding have we taken for fools why should not others have the same privilege as ourselves ah what address is needed to live together to be compliant without cringing to expose a fault without harshness to correct without imperious air to remonstrate without illtemper all this is wise and good but alas as turgot had occasion by and by to say little comes of giving rules instead of breeding habits  it is curious that turgot as early in his career as this should have protested against one of the most dangerous doctrines of the philosophe school i have long thought he says that our nation needs to have marriage and true marriage preached to it we contract marriages ignobly from views of ambition or interest and as many of them are unhappy in consequence we may see growing up from day to day a fashion of thinking that is extremely mischievous to the community to manners to the stability of families and to domestic happiness and virtue29 looseness of opinion as to the family and the conditions of its wellbeing and stability was a flaw that ran through the whole period of revolutionary thought it was not surprising that the family should come in for its share of destructive criticism along with the other elements of the established system but it is a proof of the solidity of turgots understanding that he should from the first have detected the mischievousness of this side of the great social attack nor did subsequent discussion with the champions of domestic license have any effect upon his opinion  footnote 29 ii 790  he makes the protest which the moralist makes and has to make in every age against the practice of determining the expediency of a marriage by considerations of money or rank there is a great abuse he says in the manner in which marriages are made without the two persons most concerned having any knowledge of one another and solely under the authority of the parents who are guided either by fortune or else by station that will one day translate itself into fortune i know he says that even marriages of inclination do not always succeed so from the fact that sometimes people make mistakes in their choice it is concluded that we ought never to choose condorcet we may remember many years after insisted on the banishment by public opinion of avaricious and mercenary considerations from marriage as one of the most important means of diminishing the great inequalities in the accumulation of wealth30  footnote 30 oeuv de condorcet vi 245  in the same letter he took sides by anticipation in another cardinal controversy of the epoch by declaring a preference for the savage over the civilised state to be a ridiculous declamation this strange and fatal debate had been opened by rousseaus memorable first discourse which was given to the world in 1750 preference for the savage state was the peculiar form assumed by emotional protests against the existing system of the distribution of wealth turgot from first to last resisted the whole spirit of such protests in this letter where he makes his first approach to the subject he insists on inequality of conditions as alike necessary and useful it is necessary because men are not born equal because their strength their intelligence their passions would be perpetually overthrowing that momentous equilibrium among them which the laws might have established  what would society be without this inequality of conditions each individual would be reduced to mere necessaries or rather there would be very many to whom mere necessaries would be by no means assured men cannot labour without implements and without the means of subsistence until the gathering in of the produce those who have not had intelligence enough or any opportunity to acquire these things have no right to take them away from one who has earned and deserved them by his labour if the idle and ignorant were to despoil the industrious and the skilful all works would be discouraged and misery would become universal it is alike more just and more useful that all those who have fallen behind either in wit or in good fortune should lend their right arms to those who know how best to employ them who can pay them a wage in advance and guarantee them a share in the future profits there is no injustice in this that a man who has discovered a productive kind of work and who has supplied his assistants with sustenance and the necessary implements who for this has only made free contracts with them should keep back the larger part and that as payment for his advances he should have less toil and more leisure it is this leisure which gives him a better chance of revolving schemes and still further increasing his lights and what he can economise from his share of the produce which is with entire equity a larger share augments his capital and adds to his power of entering into new undertakings  what would become of society if things were not so and if each person tilled his own little plot he would also have to build his own house and make his own clothes what would the people live upon who dwell in lands that produce no wheat who would transport the productions of one country to another country the humblest peasant enjoys a multitude of commodities often got together from remote climes this distribution of professions necessarily leads to inequality of conditions  so early was the rational answer ready for those socialistic sophisms which for so many years misled the most generous part of french intelligence we may regret perhaps that in demolishing the vision of perfect social equality turgot did not show a more lively sense of the need for lessening and softening unavoidable inequalities of condition however capable these inequalities may be of scientific defence they are none the less on that account in need of incessant and strenuous practical modification and it is one of the most serious misfortunes of society and is unhappily long likely to remain so that since the absorbing question of the reformation of the economic conditions of the social union has come more and more prominently to the front gradually but irresistibly thrusting behind both its religious and its political conditions zeal for the amelioration of the common lot has in so few auspicious instances been according to knowledge while the professors of science have been more careful to compose narrow apologies for individual selfishness than to extend as widely as possible the limits set by demonstrable principle to the improvement of the common life  we may notice too in this letter what so many of turgots allies and friends were disposed to complain of but what will commend him to a less newly emancipated and therefore a less fanatical generation there is a conspicuous absence of that peculiar boundlessness of hope that zealous impatience for the instant realisation and fruition of all the inspirations of philosophic intelligence which carried others immediately around him so excessively far in the creed of perfectibility liberty i answer with a sigh maybe that men are not worthy of thee equality they would yearn after thee but cannot attain compared with the confident exultation and illimitable sense of the worth of man which distinguished that time there is something like depression here as in many other places in turgots writings it is usually less articulate and is rather conveyed by a running undertone which so often reveals more of a writers true mood and temper than is seen in his words giving to them by some unconscious and inscrutable process living effects upon the readers sense like those of eye and voice and accompanying gesture  dejection however is perhaps not the most proper word for the humour of reserved and grave suspense natural in those rare spirits who have recognised how narrow is the way of truth and how few there be that enter therein and what prolonged concurrence of favouring hazards with gigantic endeavour is needed for each smallest step in the halting advancement of the race with turgot this was not the result of mere sentimental brooding it had a deliberate and reasoned foundation in historical study he was patient and not hastily sanguine as to the speedy coming of the millennial future exactly because history had taught him to measure the laggard paces of the past the secret of the intense hopefulness of that time lay in the mournfully erroneous conviction that the one condition of progress is plenteous increase of light turgot saw very early that this is not so it is not error he wrote in a saying that every champion of a new idea should have ever in letters of flame before his eyes which opposes the progress of truth it is indolence obstinacy the spirit of routine everything that favours inaction31  footnote 31 oeuv ii 672  the others left these potent elements of obstruction out of calculation and account with turgot they were the main facts to be considered and the main forces to be counteracted it is the mark of the highest kind of union between sagacious firm and clearsighted intelligence and a warm and steadfast glow of social feeling when a man has learnt how little the effort of the individual can do either to hasten or direct the current of human destiny and yet finds in effort his purest pleasure and his most constant duty if we owe honour to that social endeavour which is stimulated and sustained by an enthusiastic confidence in speedy and full fruition we surely owe it still more to those who knowing how remote and precarious and long beyond their own days is the hour of fruit yet need no other spur nor sustenance than bare hope and in this strive and endeavour and still endeavour here lies the true strength and it was the possession of this strength and the constant call and strain upon it which gave turgot in mien and speech a gravity that revolted the frivolous or indifferent and seemed cold and timorous to the enthusiastic and urgent turgot had discovered that there was a law in the history of men and he knew how this law limited and conditioned progress     ii   in 1750 turgot then only in his twentyfourth year was appointed to the honorary office of prior of the sorbonne an elective distinction conferred annually as it appears on some meritorious or highly connected student it was held in the following year by loménie de brienne in this capacity turgot read two latin dissertations one at the opening of the session and the other at its close the first of these was upon the advantages that the establishment of christianity has conferred upon the human race                               its value as might well have been expected from the circumstances of its production is not very high it is pitched in a tone of exaltation that is eminently unfavourable to the permanently profitable treatment of such a subject there are in it too many of those eloquent and familiar commonplaces of orthodox history by which the doubter tries to warm himself into belief and the believer dreams that he is corroborating faith by reason the assembly for whom his discourse was prepared could hardly have endured the apparition in the midst of them of what both rigorous justice and accurate history required to have taken into account on the other side it was not to be expected that a young student within the precincts of the sorbonne should have any eyes for the evil with which the forms of the christian religion like other growths of the human mind from the lowest forms of savage animism upwards have ever alloyed its good the absence of all reference to one half of what the annals of the various christian churches have to teach us robs the first of turgots discourses of that serious and durable quality which belongs to all his other writings  it is fair to point out that the same vicious exclusiveness was practised by the enemies of the church and that if history was to one of the two contending factions an exaggerated enumeration of the blessings of christianity it was to their passionate rivals only a monotonous catalogue of curses of this temper we have a curious illustration in the circumstance that dupont turgots intimate friend of later years who collected and published his works actually took the trouble to suppress the opening of this very discourse in which turgot had replied to the reproach often made against christianity of being useful only for a future life32  footnote 32 oeuv ii 586 n  in the first discourse turgot considers the influence of christianity first upon human nature and secondly on political societies one feature at least deserves remark and this is that in spite both of a settled partiality and a certain amount of the common form of theology yet at bottom and putting some phrases apart religion is handled and its workings traced much as they would have been if treated as admittedly secular forces and this was somewhat let us proceed to analyse what turgot says  1 before the preaching and acceptance of the new faith all nations alike were plunged into the most extravagant superstitions the most frightful dissoluteness of manners was encouraged by the example of the gods themselves every passion and nearly every vice was the object of a monstrous deification a handful of philosophers existed who had learnt no better lesson from their reason than to despise the multitude of their fellows in the midst of the universal contagion the jews alone remained pure even the jews were affected with a narrow and sterile pride which proved how little they appreciated the priceless treasure that was entrusted to their keeping what were the effects of the appearance of christ and the revelation of the gospel it inspired men with a tender zeal for the truth and by establishing the necessity of a body of teachers for the instruction of nations made studiousness and intellectual application indispensable in a great number of persons  consider again the obscurity incertitude and incongruousness that marked the ideas of the wisest of the ancients upon the nature of man and of god and the origin of creation the ideas of plato for instance the numbers of pythagoras the theurgic extravagances of plotinus and porphyry and iamblichus and then measure the contributions made by the scholastic theologians whose dry method has undergone so much severe condemnation to the instruments by which knowledge is enlarged and made accurate it was the church moreover which civilised the northern barbarians and so preserved the west from the same barbarism and desolation with which the triumphs of mahometanism replaced the knowledge and arts and prosperity of the east it is to the services of the church that we owe the perpetuation of a knowledge of the ancient tongues and if this knowledge and the possession of the masterpieces of thought and feeling and form the flower of the ancient european mind remained so long unproductive still religious organisation deserves our gratitude equally for keeping these great treasures for happier times they survived as trees stripped by winter of their leaves survive through frost and storm to give new blossoms in a new spring  this much on the intellectual side but how can we describe the moral transformation which the new faith brought to pass men who had hitherto only regarded gods as beings to be entreated to avert ill or bestow blessing now learnt the nobler emotion of devout love for a divinity of supreme power and beneficence the new faith besides kindling love for god inflamed the kindred sentiment of love for men all of whom it declared to be the children of god one vast family with a common father julian himself bore witness to the fidelity with which the christians whose faith he hated or despised tended the sick and fed the poor not only of their own association but those also who were without the fold the horrible practice of exposing newborn infants which outraged nature and yet did not touch the heart nor the understanding of a numa an aristotle a confucius was first proscribed by the holy religion of christ if shame and misery still sometimes in the hearts of poor outcast mothers overpower the horror which christianity first inspired it is still the same religion which has opened sheltering places for the unhappy victims of such a practice and provided means for rearing foundlings into useful citizens  christian teaching by reviving the principles of sensibility within the breast may be said to have in some sort unveiled human nature to herself if the cruelty of old manners has abated do we not owe the improvement to such courageous priests as ambrose who refused admission into the church to theodosius because in punishing a guilty city he had hearkened to the voice rather of wrath than of justice or as that pope who insisted that lewis the seventh should expiate by a rigorous penance the sack and burning of vitry33 it is not to a titus a trajanus an antoninus that we owe the abolition of the bloody gladiatorial games it is to jesus christ virtuous unbelievers have not seldom been the apostles of benevolence and humanity but we rarely see them in the asylums of misery reason speaks but it is religion that makes men act how much dearer to us than the splendid monuments of antique taste power and greatness are those gothic edifices reared for the poor and the orphan those far nobler monuments of the piety of christian princes and the power of christian faith the rudeness of their architecture may wound the delicacy of our taste but they will be ever beloved by feeling hearts let others admire in the retreat prepared for those who have sacrificed in battle their lives or their health for the state all the gathered riches of the arts displaying in the eyes of all the nations the magnificence of lewis the fourteenth and carrying our renown to the level of that of greece and rome what i will admire is such a use of those arts the sublime glory of serving the weal of men raises them higher than they had ever been at rome or at athens  footnote 33 see martins hist de la france iii 422 or morisons life of saint bernard bk iii ch vi  2 let us turn from the action of the christian faith in modifying the passions of the individual to its influence upon societies of men how has christianity ameliorated the great art of government with reference to the two characteristic aims of that art the happiness of communities and their stability nature has given all men the right of being happy but the old lawgivers abandoned natures wise economy by which she uses the desires and interests of individuals to fulfil her general plans and ensure the common weal men like lycurgus destroyed all idea of property violated the laws of modesty and annihilated the tenderest ties of blood a false and mischievous spirit of system seduced them away from the true method the feeling after experience34 a general injustice reigned in the laws of all nations among all of them what was called the public good was confined to a small number of men love of country was less the love of fellowcitizens than a common hatred towards strangers hence the barbarities practised by the ancients upon their slaves hence that custom of slavery once spread over the whole earth those horrible cruelties in the wars of the greeks and the romans that barbarous inequality between the two sexes which still reigns in the east hence the tyranny of the great towards the common people in hereditary aristocracies the profound degradation of subject peoples in short everywhere the stronger have made the laws and have crushed the weak and if they have sometimes consulted the interests of a given society they have always forgotten those of the human race to recall right and justice a principle was necessary that could raise men above themselves and all around them that could lead them to survey all nations and all conditions with an equitable gaze and in some sort with the eyes of god himself this is what religion has done what other principle could have fought and vanquished both interests and prejudice united  footnote 34 les hommes en tout ne séclairent que par le tâtonnement de lexpérience p 593  nothing but the christian religion could have worked that general revolution in mens minds which brought the rights of humanity out into full day and reconciled an affectionate preference for the community of which one makes a part with a general love for mankind even the horrors of war were softened and humanity began to be spared such frightful sequels of triumph as towns burnt to ashes populations put to the sword the wounded massacred in cold blood or reserved to give a ghastly decoration to triumph slavery where it was not abolished was constantly and effectively mitigated by christian sentiment and the fact that the church did not peremptorily insist on its universal abolition was due to a wise reluctance to expose the constitution of society to so sudden and violent a shock christianity without formal precepts merely by inspiring a love of justice and mercy in mens hearts prevented the laws from becoming an instrument of oppression and held a balance between the strong and the feeble  if the history of the ancient republics shows that they hardly knew the difference between liberty and anarchy and if even the profound aristotle seemed unable to reconcile monarchy with a mild government is not the reason to be found in the fact that before the christian era the various governments of the world only presented either an ambition without bound or limit or else a blind passion for independence a perpetual balance between oppression on the one side and revolt on the other in vain did lawgivers attempt to arrest this incessant struggle of conflicting passions by laws which were too weak for the purpose because they were in too imperfect an accord with opinions and manners religion by placing man under the eyes of an allseeing god imposed on human passions the only rein capable of effectually bridling them it gave men internal laws that were stronger than all the external bonds of the civil laws by means of this internal change it has everywhere had the effect of weakening despotism so that the limits of christianity seem to mark also the limits of mild government and public felicity kings saw the supreme tribunal of a god who should judge them and the cause of their people thus the distance between them and their subjects became as nothing in the infinite distance between kings and subjects alike and the divinity that was equally elevated above either they were both in some sort equalised by a common abasement ye nations be subject to authority cried the voice of religion to the one and to the other it cried ye kings who judge the earth learn that god has only entrusted you with the image of power for the happiness of your peoples  an eloquent description of the efficacy of christianity in raising human nature and impressing on kings the obligation of pursuing above all things the wellbeing of their subjects closes with a courtly official salutation of the virtues of that very christian king lewis the fifteenth                               it is ill reasoning against religion an illustrious contemporary of turgots had said in a deprecatory sentence that serves to mark the spirit of the time to compile a long list of the evils which it has inflicted without doing the same for the blessings which it has bestowed35 conversely we may well think it unphilosophical and unconvincing to enumerate all the blessings without any of the evils to tell us how the christian doctrine enlarged the human spirit without observing what narrowing limitations it imposed to dwell on all the mitigating influences with which the christian churches have been associated while forgetting all the ferocities which they have inspired the history of european belief offers a double record since the decay of polytheism and if for a certain number of centuries this record shows the civilisation of mens instincts by christianity it reveals to us in the centuries subsequent the reverse process of the civilisation of christianity by mens instincts turgots piece treats half the subject as if it were the whole he extends down to the middle of the eighteenth century a number of propositions and implied inferences which are only true up to the beginning of the fourteenth  footnote 35 esprit des lois bk xxiv ch ii  even within this limitation there are many questions that no student of turgots capacity would now overlook yet of which he and the most reasonable spirits of his age took no cognisance the men of neither side in the eighteenth century knew what the history of opinion meant all alike concerned themselves with its truth or falsehood with what they counted to be its abstract fitness or unfitness a perfect method places a man where he can command one point of view as well as the other and can discern not only how far an idea is true and convenient but also how whether true and convenient or otherwise it came into its place in mens minds we ought to be able to separate in thought the question of the grounds and evidence for a given dogma being true from the distinct and purely historic question of the social and intellectual conditions which made men accept it for true  where however there was any question of the two religions whose document and standards are professedly drawn from the bible there the frenchmen of that time assumed not a historic attitude but one exclusively dogmatic everybody was so anxious to prove that he had neither freedom nor humour to observe the controversy as to the exact measure of the supernatural force in judaism and its christian development was so overwhelmingly absorbing as to leave without light or explanation the wide and independent region of their place as simply natural forces it may be said and perhaps it is true that people never allow the latter side of the inquiry to become prominent in their minds until they have settled the former and settled it in one way they must be indifferent to the details of the natural operations of a religion until they are convinced that there are none of any other kind be this as it may we have to record the facts and it is difficult to imagine a frenchman of the era of the encyclopædia asking himself the sort of questions which now present themselves to the student in such abundance for instance has one effect of christianity been to exalt a regard for the sympathetic over the Æsthetic side of action and character and if so to what elements in the forms of christian teaching and practice is this due and is such a transfer of the highest place from the beauty to the lovableness of conduct to be accounted a gain when contrasted with the relative position of the two sides among the greeks and romans  again we have to draw a distinction between the christian idea and the outward christian organisation and between the consequences to human nature and society which flowed from the first and the advantages which may be traced to the second there was on the one hand a doctrine stirring dormant spiritual instincts and satisfying active spiritual needs on the other an external institution preserving interpreting developing and applying the doctrine each of the two has its own origin its own history its own destiny in the memories of the race we may attempt to estimate the functions of the one without pronouncing on the exact value of the other if the idea was the direct gift of heaven the policy was due to the sagacity and motherwit of the great ecclesiastical statesmen if the doctrine was a supernatural boon at least the forms in which it came gradually to overspread europe were to be explained on rational and natural grounds and if historical investigation of these forms and their influences should prove that they are the recognisable roots of most of the benign growths which are vaguely styled results of christianity then such a conclusion would seriously attenuate the merits of the supernatural christian doctrine in favour of the human christian policy  if there had been in the christian idea the mysterious selfsowing quality so constantly claimed for it how came it that in the eastern part of the empire it was as powerless for spiritual or moral regeneration as it was for political health and vitality while in the western part it became the organ of the most important of all the past transformations of the civilised world is not the difference to be explained by the difference in the surrounding medium and what is the effect of such an explanation upon the supernatural claims of the christian idea does such an explanation reduce that idea to the rank of one of the historic forces which arise and operate and expand themselves in accordance with strictly natural conditions the christianity of the east was probably as degraded a form of belief as lowering for human character and as mischievous to social wellbeing as has ever been held by civilised peoples yet the east strangely enough was the great home and nursery of all that is most distinctive in the constituent ideas of the christian faith why in meditating on christianity are we to shut our eyes to the depravation that overtook it when placed amid unfavourable social conditions and to confine our gaze to the brighter qualities which it developed in the healthier atmosphere of the west  further turgot might have asked with much profit to the cause of historic truth and perhaps in more emancipated years he did ask whether economic circumstances have not had more to do with the dissolution of slavery than christian doctrineswhether the rise of rent from free tenants over the profits to be drawn from slavelabour by the landowner has not been a more powerful stimulant to emancipation than the moral maxim that we ought to love one another or the christian proposition that we are all equals before the divine throne and coheirs of salvationwhether a steady and permanent fall in the price of slaveraised productions had not as much to do with the decay of slavery in europe as the love of god or the doctrine of human brotherhood36 that the influence of christianity so far as it went and so far as it was a real power tended both to abolish slavery and where it was too feeble to press in this direction at any rate tended to mitigate the harshness of its usages is hardly to be denied by any fairminded person the true issue is what this influence amounted to the orthodox historian treats it as single and omnipotent his heterodox brotherin the eighteenth century they both usually belonged to one familyleaves it out  footnote 36 see on this subject finlays mediæval greece and trebizond p 197 and also on the other hand p 56  the crowded annals of human misology as well as the more terrible chronicle of the consequences when misology has impatiently betaken itself to the cruel arm of flesh show the decisive importance of the precise way in which a great subject of debate is put now the whole question of religion was in those days put with radical incompleteness and turgots dissertation was only in a harmony that might have been expected with the prevailing error the champions of authority like the leaders of the revolt insisted on inquiring absolutely not relatively on judging religion with reference to human nature in the abstract instead of with reference to the changing varieties of social institution and circumstance we ought to place ourselves where we can see both lines of inquiry to be possible we ought to place ourselves where we can ask what the tendencies of christian influence have been without mixing up with that question the further and distinct inquiry what these tendencies are now or are likely to be the nineteenth century has hitherto leaned to the historical and relative aspect of the great controversy the eighteenth was characteristically dogmatic and the destroyers of the faith were not any less dogmatic in their own way than those who professed to be its apologists                               probably it was not long after the composition of this apologetic thesis before turgot became alive to the precise position of a creed which had come to demand apologetic theses this was indeed one of the marked and critical moments in the great transformation of religious feeling and ecclesiastical order in europe of which our own age four generations later is watching a very decisive if not a final stage turgots demonstration of the beneficence of christianity was delivered in july 1750almost the exact middle of the eighteenth century the death of the emperor charles the sixth ten years before had given the signal for the breakup of the european system the iron army of prussia made its first stride out of the narrow northern borders into the broad arena of the west and every new illustration of the fortitude and depth and farreaching power of prussia has been a new blow to the old catholic organisation the first act of this prodigious drama closed while turgot was a pupil at the sorbonne the court of france had blundered into alliances against the retrograde and catholic house of austria while england with equal blindness had stumbled into friendship with it before the opening of the second act or true climaxthat is before the seven years war beganinterests and forces became more naturally adjusted france spain and austria bourbons and hapsburgs the great pillars of the church were ranged against england and prussia the halfconscious representatives of those industrial and individualist principles which replaced whether for a time or permanently the decaying system of aristocratic caste in temporal things and an ungrowing catholicism in things spiritual in 1750 ecclesiastical farsightedness court intrigue and family ambitions were actively preparing the way for the austrian alliance in the mephitic air of versailles the issue at stake was the maintenance of the supremacy of the church and the ancient christian organisation of france and of europe  we now know how this long battle has gone the jesuit churchmen lost their lead and were thrown back out of the civil and political sphere we know too what effect these blows to the catholic organisation have had upon the activity of the catholic idea with the decline and extermination of the predominance of churchmen in civil affairs there began a tendency which has since become deeper and stronger in the church to withdraw herself and her sons from a sphere where she could no longer be sovereign and queen religion since the revolution isolates the most devout catholics from political action and political interests this great change however this return of the leaders of the christian society upon the original conceptions of the christian faith did not come to pass in turgots time he watched the struggle of the church for the maintenance of its temporal privilege and honour and for the continued protection by secular power of its spiritual supremacy the outcome of the struggle was later  we may say in fine that if this first public composition of turgots is extremely imperfect it was better to exaggerate the services of christianity alike as an internal faith and as a peculiar form of social organisation than to describe gregory the great and innocent hildebrand and bernard as artful and vulgar tyrants and aquinas and roger bacon as the products of a purely barbarous stationary and dark age there is at first sight something surprising in the respect which turgots ablest contemporaries paid to the contributions made to progress by greece and rome compared with their angry disparagement of the dark ages the reason of this contrast we soon discover to be that the passions of present contests gave their own colour to mens interpretation of the circumstances of the remote middle time between the roman empire and the commencement of the revolutionary period turgot escaped these passions more completely than any man of his time who was noble enough to be endowed with the capacity for passion he never forgot that it is as wise and just to confess the obligations of mankind to the catholic monotheism of the west as it is shallow and unjust in professors of christianity to despise or hate the lower theological systems which guide the humbler families of mankind  let us observe that only three years after this academic discourse in praise of the religion of the time turgot was declaring that the greatest of the services of christianity to the world was that it had both enlightened and propagated natural religion37  footnote 37 lettres sur la tolérance ii vol ii 687     iii   turgots inquiry into the extent and quality of the debt of european civilisation to christianity was marked by a certain breadth and largeness in spite of the bonds of circumstance and subjectfor who after all can consider christianity to any purpose apart from other conditions of general progress or without free comparison with other dogmatic systems it is not surprising then to find the same valuable gifts of vision coming into play with a thousand times greater liberty and power when the theme was widened so as to comprehend the successive steps of the advancement of the human mind in all its aspects the second and more famous of the two discourses at the sorbonne was read in december 1750 and professes to treat the successive advances of the human mind38 the opening lines are among the most pregnant as they were among the most original in the history of literature and reveal in an outline standing clear against the light a thought which revolutionised old methods of viewing and describing the course of human affairs and contained the germs of a new and most fruitful philosophy of society  footnote 38 sur les progrés successifs de lesprit humain oeuv ii 597611  the phenomena of nature subjected as they are to constant laws are enclosed in a circle of revolutions that remain the same for ever all comes to life again all perishes again and in these successive generations by which vegetables and animals reproduce themselves time does no more than bring back at each moment the image of what it has just dismissed  the succession of men on the contrary offers from age to age a spectacle of continual variations reason freedom the passions are incessantly producing new events all epochs are fastened together by a sequence of causes and effects linking the condition of the world to all the conditions that have gone before it the gradually multiplied signs of speech and writing giving men an instrument for making sure of the continued possession of their ideas as well as of imparting them to others have formed out of the knowledge of each individual a common treasure which generation transmits to generation as an inheritance constantly augmented by the discoveries of each age and the human race observed from its first beginning seems in the eyes of the philosopher to be one vast whole which like each individual in it has its infancy and its growth  this was not a mere casual reflection in turgots mind taking a solitary and separate position among those various and unordered ideas which spring up and go on existing without visible fruit in every active intelligence it was one of the systematic conceptions which shape and rule many groups of facts fixing a new and high place of their own for them among the great divisions of knowledge in a word it belonged to the rare order of truly creative ideas and was the root or germ of a whole body of vigorous and connected thought this quality marks the distinction in respect of the treatment of history between turgot and both bossuet and the great writers of history in france and england in the eighteenth century many of the sayings to which we are referred for the origin of the modern idea of history such as pascals for instance are the fortuitous glimpses of men of genius into a vast sea whose extent they have not been led to suspect and which only make a passing and momentary mark bossuets talk of universal history which has been so constantly praised was fundamentally and in substance no more than a bit of theological commonplace splendidly decorated he did indeed speak of the concatenation of human affairs but only in the same sentence with the sequence of the counsels of god the gorgeous rhetorician of the church was not likely to rise philosophically into the larger air of universal history properly so called his famous discourse is a vindication of divine foresight by means of an intensely narrow survey of such sets of facts as might be thought not inconsistent with the deitys fixed purpose to make one final and decisive revelation to men no one who looks upon the vast assemblage of stupendous human circumstances from the first origin of man upon the earth as merely the ordained antecedent of what seen from the long procession of all the ages figures in so diminutive a consummation as the catholic church is likely to obtain a very effective hold of that broad sequence and manylinked chain of events to which bossuet gave a right name but whose real meaning he never was even near seizing his merit is that he did in a small and rhetorical way what montesquieu and voltaire afterwards did in a truly comprehensive and philosophical way he pressed forward general ideas in connection with the recorded movements of the chief races of mankind for a teacher of history to leave the bare chroniclers road so far as to declare for example the general principle inadequate and overstated as it is that religion and civil government are the two points on which human things revolveeven this was a clear step in advance the dismissal of the long series of emperors from augustus to alexander severus in two or three pages was to show a ripe sense of large historic proportion again bossuets expressions of the concatenation of the universe of the interdependence of the parts of so vast a whole of there coming no great change without having its causes in foregoing centuries and of the true object of history being to observe in connection with each epoch those secret dispositions of events which prepared the way for great changes as well as the momentous conjunctures which more immediately brought them to pass39all these phrases seem to point to a true and philosophic survey but they end in themselves and lead nowhither the chain is an arbitrary and onesided collection of facts the writer does not cautiously follow and feel after the successive links but forges and chooses and arrays them after a pattern of his own which was fixed independently of them a scientific term or two is not enough to disguise the purely theological essence of the treatise  footnote 39 discours sur lhistoire universelle part iii ch ii  montesquieu and voltaire were both far enough removed from bossuets point of view and the spirit of laws of the one and the essay on the manners and character of nations of the other mark a very different way of considering history from the lofty and confident method of the orthodox rhetorician the spirit of laws was published in 1748 that is to say a couple of years before turgots discourse at the sorbonne voltaires essay on manners did not come out until 1757 or seven years later than the discourse but voltaire himself has told us that its composition dates from 1740 when he prepared this new presentation of european history for the service of madame du châtelet40 we may hence fairly consider the cardinal work of montesquieu and the cardinal historical work of voltaire as virtually belonging to the same time and they possess a leading character in common which separates them both from turgot and places them relatively to his idea in a secondary rank in a word montesquieu and voltaire if we have to search their most distinctive quality introduced into history systematically and with full and decisive effect a broad generality of treatment they grouped the facts of history and they did not group them locally or in accordance with mere geographical or chronological division but collected the facts in social classes and orders from many countries and times their work was a work of classification it showed the possibility of arranging the manifold and complex facts of society and of the movements of communities under heads and with reference to definite general conditions  footnote 40 preface to essai sur les moeurs oeuv xx  there is no need here to enter into any criticism of montesquieus great work how far the merits of its execution equalled the merit of its design how far his vicious confusion of the senses of the word law impaired the worth of his book as a contribution to inductive or comparative history we have only to seek the difference between the philosophic conception of montesquieu and the philosophic conception of turgot the latter may be considered a more liberal completion of the former turgot not only sees the operation of law in the movements and institutions of society but he interprets this law in a positive and scientific sense as an ascertainable succession of social states each of them being the cause and effect of other social states turgot gives its deserved prominence to the fertile idea of there being an ordered movement of growth or advance among societies in other words of the civilisation of any given portion of mankind having fixed conditions analogous to those of a physical organism finally he does not limit his thought by fixing it upon the laws and constitutions only of countries but refers historical philosophy to its veritable and widest object and concern the steps and conditions of the progression of the human mind  how he inquires can we seize the thread of the progress of the human mind how trace the road now overgrown and halfhidden along which the race has travelled two ideas suggest themselves which lay foundations for this inquiry for one thing the resources of nature and the fruitful germ of all sorts of knowledge are to be found wherever men are to be found the sublimest attainments are not and cannot be other than the first ideas of sense developed or combined just as the edifice whose height most amazes the eye of necessity reposes on the very earth that we tread and the same senses the same organs the spectacle of the same universe have everywhere given men the same ideas as the same needs and the same dispositions have everywhere taught them the same arts or it might be put in other words there is identity in human nature and repetition in surrounding circumstance means the reproduction of social consequences for another thing the actual state of the universe by presenting at the same moment on the earth all the shades of barbarism and civilisation discloses to us as in a single glance the monuments the footprints of all the steps of the human mind the measure of the whole track along which it has passed the history of all the ages  the progress of the human mind means to turgot the progress of knowledge its history is the history of the growth and spread of science and the arts its advance is increased enlightenment of the understanding from adam and eve down to lewis the fourteenth the record of progress is the chronicle of the everincreasing additions to the sum of what men know and the accuracy and fulness with which they know the chief instrument in this enlightenment is the rising up from time to time of some lofty and superior intelligence for though human character contains everywhere the same principle yet certain minds are endowed with a peculiar abundance of talent that is refused to others circumstances develop these superior talents or leave them buried in obscurity and from the infinite variety of these circumstances springs the inequality among nations the agricultural stage goes immediately before a decisively polished state because it is then first that there is that surplus of means of subsistence which allows men of higher capacity the leisure for using it in the acquisition of knowledge properly so called  one of the greatest steps was the precious invention of writing and one of the most rapid was the constitution of mathematical knowledge the sciences that came next matured more slowly because in mathematics the explorer has only to compare ideas among one another while in the others he has to test the conformity of ideas to objective facts mathematical truths becoming more numerous every day and increasingly fruitful in proportion lead to the development of hypotheses at once more extensive and more exact and point to new experiments which in their turn furnish new problems to solve so necessity perfects the instrument so mathematics finds support in physics to which it lends its lamp so all knowledge is bound together so notwithstanding the diversity of their advance all the sciences lend one another mutual aid and so by force of feeling a way of multiplying systems of exhausting errors so to speak the world at length arrives at the knowledge of a vast number of truths it might seem as if a prodigious confusion as of tongues would arise from so enormous an advance along so many lines the different sciences originally confined within a few simple notions common to all can now after their advance into more extensive and difficult ideas only be surveyed apart but an advance greater still brings them together again because that mutual dependence of all truths is discovered which while it links them one to another throws light on one by another  alas the history of opinion is in one of its most extensive branches the history of error the senses are the single source of our ideas and furnish its models to the imagination hence that nearly incorrigible disposition to judge what we are ignorant of by what we know hence those deceptive analogies to which the primitive rudeness of men surrenders itself as they watched nature as their eyes wandered to the surface of a profound ocean instead of the faroff bed hidden under the waters they saw nothing but their own likeness every object in nature had its god and this god formed after the pattern of men had mens attributes and mens vices41 here in anthropomorphism or the transfer of human quality to things not human and the invention of spiritual existences to be the recipients of this quality turgot justly touched the root of most of the wrong thinking that has been as a manacle to science  footnote 41 p 601  his admiration for those epochs in which new truths were most successfully discovered and old fallacies most signally routed did not prevent turgot from appreciating the ages of criticism and their services to knowledge he does full justice to alexandria not only for its astronomy and geometry but for that peculiar studiousness which exercises itself less on things than on books whose strength lies less in producing and discovering than in collecting and comparing and estimating what has been produced and discovered which does not press forward but gazes backward along the road that has already been traversed the studies that require most genius are not always those which imply most progress in the mass of men there are minds to which nature has given a memory capable of comparing truths of suggesting an arrangement that places these truths in the fullest light but to which at the same time she has refused that ardour of genius which insists on inventing and opening out for itself new lines of discovery made to unite former discoveries under a single point of view to surround them with light and to exhibit them in entire perfection if they are not luminaries that burn and sparkle of themselves at least they are like diamonds that reflect with dazzling brilliance a borrowed light  thus turgots conception of progress regards it mainly if not entirely as a gradual dawn and diffusion of light the spreading abroad of the rays of knowledge he does not assert as some moderns have crudely asserted that morality is of the nature of a fixed quantity still he hints something of the kind morality he says speaking of greece in the time of its early physical speculation though still imperfect still kept fewer relics of the infancy of reason those everspringing necessities which so incessantly recall man to society and force him to bend to its laws that instinct that sentiment of what is good and right which providence has engraved in all hearts and which precedes reason all lead the thinkers of every time back to the same fundamental principles of the science of morals  we meet with this limitation of the idea of progress in every member of the school to which more than to any other turgot belonged even in the vindication of the claims of christianity to the gratitude of mankind he had forborne from laying stress on any original contribution supposed to be made by that religion to the precious stock of ethical ideas he dwells upon the tender zeal for the progress of truth that the christian religion inspired and recounts the various circumstances in which it spread and promoted the social and political conditions most favourable to intellectual or scientific activity whatever may be the truth or the value of christianity as a dogmatic system there can be little doubt that its weight as a historic force is to be looked for not so much in the encouragement it gave to science and learning in respect of which western europe probably owes more to mahometanism as in the high and generous types of character which it inspired a man of rare moral depth warmth or delicacy may be a more important element in the advance of civilisation than the newest and truest deduction from what turgot calls the fundamental principles of the science of morals the leading of souls to do what is right and humane is always more urgent than mere instruction of the intelligence as to what exactly is the right and the humane the saint after all has a place in positive history but the men of the eighteenth century passionately threw him out from their calendar as the mere wooden idol of superstition they eagerly recognised the genius of scientific discovery but they had no eyes for the genius of moral holiness turgot far as he was from many of the narrownesses of his time yet did not entirely transcend this the worst of them all and because he could not perceive there to be any new growths in moral science he left out from a front place among the forces that have given strength and ripeness to the human mind the superior capacity of some men for kindling by word and example the glowing love and devout practice of morality in the breasts of many generations of their fellows  the mechanical arts turgot says were preserved in the dark ages by the necessities of existence and because it is impossible but that out of the crowd of artisans practising them there should arise from time to time one of those men of genius who are found mingled with other men as gold is found mingled with the earth of a mine surely in the same way holy men arose with keener feeling for the spiritual necessities of the time and finer knowledge to train and fit the capacities of human nature to meet these needs and make their satisfaction the basis for yet loftier standards and holier aspirations and nobler and more careful practice the work of all such men deserved a place in an outline of the progressive forces of the human mind as much as the work of those who invented bills of exchange the art of musical notation windmills clocks gunpowder and all the other material instruments for multiplying the powers of man and the conveniences of life  even if we give turgot the benefit of the doubt whether he intended to describe more than the progress of the human intelligence or the knowing part of the mind the omission of the whole moral side is still a defect for as he interprets knowledge to be the conformity of our ideas to facts has there not been a clearly recognisable progress in the improved conformity of our ideas to the most momentous facts of all the various circumstances of human action its motives and consequences no factor among the constituents of a progressive civilisation deserves more carefully to be taken into account than the degree in which the current opinion and usage of a society recognise the comprehensiveness of moral obligation more than upon anything else does progress depend on the kinds of conduct which a community classifies as moral or immoral and upon the wider or narrower inclusiveness within rigid ethical boundaries of what ought or ought not to be left open and indifferent the conditions which create and modify these ethical regulationstheir law in a wordform a department of the history of the human mind which can be almost less readily dispensed with than any other what sort of a history of europe would that be which should omit for example to consider the influence of the moral rigour of calvinism upon the growth of the nations affected by it  moreover turgot expressly admits the everpresent wants of society to be the stimulating agents as well as the guides of scientific energy he expressly admits too that they are constantly plucking men by the skirt and forcing them back to social rules of conduct it is certain therefore that as the necessities of society increase in number and complexity morality will be developed to correspond with them and the way in which new applications of ethical sentiments to the demands of the common weal are made is as interesting and as deserving of a place in any scientific inquiry into social progress as the new applications of physical truths to satisfy material needs and to further material convenience turgot justly points to the perfecting of language as one of the most important of the many processes that go to the general advancement of the race42 not less but more important is the analogous work of perfecting our ideas of virtue and duty surely this chamber too in the great laboratory deserves that the historian should unseal its door and explore its recesses  footnote 42 p 603  the characteristic merits of the second of the two discourses at the sorbonne may be briefly described in this way it recognises the idea of ordered succession in connection with the facts of society it considers this succession as one not of superficial events but of working forces thus bolingbroke writing fifteen years before had said that as to events that stand recorded in history we see them all we see them as they followed one another or as they produced one another causes or effects immediate or remote43 but it is very evident from his illustrations that by all this he understood no more than the immediate connection between one transaction and another he thought for example of the revolution of 1688 being a consequence of the bad government of james the second of this bad government springing from the kings attachment to popery this in turn being caused by the exile of the royal family this exile having its source in cromwells usurpation and so forth one may suppose down to the noachian flood or the era when the earth was formless and void it is mere futility to talk of cause and effect in connection with a string of arbitrarily chosen incidents of this sort cause and effect in turgots sense of history describe a relation between certain sets or groups of circumstances that are of a peculiarly decisive kind because the surface of events conforms itself to their inner working his account of these deciding circumstances was not what we should be likely to accept now because he limited them too closely to purely intellectual acquisitions as we have just seen and because he failed to see the necessity of tracing the root of the whole growth to certain principles in the mental constitution of mankind but at all events his conception of history rose above merely individual concerns embraced the successive movements of societies and their relations to one another and sought the spring of revolutions in the affairs of a community in long trains of preparing conditions internal and external above all history was a whole the fortunes and achievements of each nation were scrutinised for their effect on the growth of all mankind  footnote 43 study of history letter ii     iv   in the year 1761 turgot then in his thirtyfourth year was appointed to the office of intendant in the generality of limoges there were three different divisions of france in the eighteenth century first and oldest the diocese or ecclesiastical circumscription second the province or military government and third the generality or a district defined for fiscal and administrative purposes the intendant in the government of the last century was very much what the prefect is in the government of our own time perhaps however we understand turgots position in limousin best by comparing it to that of the chief commissioner of some great district in our indian empire for example the first task which turgot had to perform was to execute a new landassessment for purposes of imperial revenue he had to construct roads to build barracks to administer justice to deal with a famine just as the english civilian has to do in orissa or behar much of his time was taken up in elaborate memorials to the central government and the desk of the controllergeneral at versailles was loaded with minutes and reports exactly like the voluminous papers which fill the mahogany boxes of the members of council and the home secretary at calcutta the fundamental conditions of the two systems of government were much alike absolute political authority and an elaborately centralised civil administration for keeping order and raising a revenue the direct authority of an intendant was not considerable his chief functions were the settlement of detail in executing the general orders that he received from the minister a provisional decision on certain kinds of minor affairs and a power of judging some civil suits subject to appeal to the council but though the intendant was so strictly a subordinate yet he was the man of the government and thoroughly in its confidence the government only saw with his eyes and only acted on the faith of his reports memorials and requisitions and this in a country where the government united in itself all forms of power and was obliged to be incessantly active and to make itself felt at every point  of all the thirtytwo great districts in which the authority of the intendant stood between the common people and the authority of the minister at versailles the generality of limoges was the poorest the rudest the most backward and the most miserable to the eye of the traveller with a mind for the picturesque there were parts of this central region of france whose smiling undulations delicious waterscenes deep glens extending into amphitheatres and slopes hung with woods of chestnut all seemed to make a lovelier picture than the cheerful beauty of prosperous normandy or the olivegroves and orangegardens of provence arthur young thought the limousin the most beautiful part of france unhappily for the cultivator these gracious conformations belonged to a harsh and churlish soil for him the roll of the chalk and the massing of the granite would have been well exchanged for the fat loams of level picardy the soil of the limousin was declared by its inhabitants to be the most ungrateful in the whole kingdom returning no more than four net for one of seed sown while there was land in the vale of the garonne that returned thirtyfold the two conditions for raising tolerable crops were abundance of labour and abundance of manure but misery drove the men away and the stock were sold to pay the taxes so the land lacked both the arms of the tiller and the dressing whose generous chemistry would have transmuted the dull earth into fruitfulness and plenty the extent of the district was estimated at a million and a half of hectares equivalent to nearly four millions of english acres yet the population of this vast tract was only five hundred thousand souls even today it is not more than eight hundred thousand  the common food of the people was the chestnut and to the great majority of them even the coarsest ryebread was a luxury that they had never tasted maise and buckwheat were their chief cereals and these together with a coarse radish took up hundreds of acres that might under a happier system have produced fine wheat and nourished fruittrees there had once been a certain export of cattle but that had now come to an end partly because the general decline of the district had impaired the quality of the beasts and partly because the parisian butchers who were by much the greatest customers had found the markets of normandy more convenient the more the trade went down the heavier was the burden of the cattletax on the stock that remained the stockdealer was thus ruined from both sides at once in the same way the limousin horses whose breed had been famous all over france had ceased to be an object of commerce and the progressive increase of taxation had gradually extinguished the trade angoumois which formed part of the generality of limoges had previously boasted of producing the best and finest paper in the world and it had found a market not only throughout france but all over europe there had been a time when this manufacture supported sixty mills at the death of lewis xiv their number had fallen from sixty to sixteen an excise duty at the mill a duty on exportation at the provincial frontier a duty on the importation of rags over the provincial frontierall these vexations had succeeded in reducing the trade with holland one of frances best customers to onefourth of its previous dimensions nor were paper and cattle the only branches of trade that had been blighted by fiscal perversity the same burden arrested the transport of saffron across the borders of the province on its way to hungary and prussia and the other cold lands where saffron was a favourite condiment salt which came up the charente from the marshes by the coast was stripped of all its profit first by the duty paid on crossing from the limousin to périgord and auvergne and next by the right possessed by certain of the great lords on the banks of the charente to help themselves at one point and another to portions of the cargo iron was subject to a harassing excise in all those parts of the country that were beyond the jurisdiction of the parlement of bordeaux the effect of such positive hindrances as these to the transit of goods was further aided to the destruction of trade by the absence of roads there were four roads in the province but all of them so bad that the traveller knew not whether to curse more lustily the rocks or the swamps that interrupted his journey alternately there were two rivers the vienne and the vézère and these might seem to an enthusiast for the famous argument from design as if nature had intended them for the transport of timber from the immense forests that crowned the limousin hills unluckily their beds were so thickly bestrewn with rock that neither of them was navigable for any considerable part of its long course through the illstarred province  the inhabitants were as cheerless as the land on which they lived they had none of the fiery energy the eloquence the mobility of the people of the south still less were they endowed with the apt intelligence the ease the social amiability the openness of their neighbours on the north the dwellers in upper limousin said one who knew them are coarse and heavy jealous distrustful avaricious the dwellers in lower limousin had a less repulsive address but they were at least as narrowly selfinterested at heart and they added a capacity for tenacious and vindictive hatred the limousins had the superstitious doctrines of other semibarbarous populations and they had their vices they passed abruptly and without remorse from a penitential procession to the tavern and the brothel their christianity was as superficial as that of the peasant of the eifel in our own day or of the finnish converts of whom we are told that they are even now not beyond sacrificing a foal in honour of the virgin mary saint martial and saint leonard were the patron saints of the country and were the objects of an adoration in comparison with which the other saints and even god himself were thrust into a secondary place  in short the people of the generality of limoges represented the most unattractive type of peasantry they were deeply superstitious violent in their prejudices obstinate withstanders of all novelty rude dull stupid perverse and hardly redeeming a narrow and blinding covetousness by a stubborn and mechanical industry their country has been fixed upon as the cradle of celtic nationality in france and there are some who believe that here the old gaulish blood kept itself purer from external admixture than was the case anywhere else in the land in our own day when an orator has occasion to pay a compliment to the townsmen of limoges he says that the genius of the people of the district has ever been faithful to its source it has ever held the balance true between the frank tradition of the north and the roman tradition of the south this makes an excellent period for a rhetorician but the fact which it conveys made limousin all the severer a task for an administrator almost immediately after his appointment turgot had the chance of being removed to rouen and after that to lyons either of these promotions would have had the advantages of a considerable increase of income less laborious duties and a much more agreeable residence turgot with a high sense of duty that probably seemed quixotic enough to the controllergeneral declined the preferment on the very ground of the difficulty and importance of the task that he had already undertaken poor peasants poor kingdom had been quesnays constant exclamation and it had sunk deep into the spirit of his disciple he could have little thought of high salary or personal ease when he discerned an opportunity of improving the hard lot of the peasant and softening the misfortunes of the realm  turgot was one of the men to whom good government is a religion it might be said to be the religion of all the best men of that century and it was natural that it should be so the decay of a theology that places our deepest solicitudes in a sphere beyond this is naturally accompanied by a transfer of these high solicitudes to a nearer scene but though the desire for good government and a right sense of its cardinal importance were common ideas of the time in all the best heads from voltaire downwards yet turgot had a patience which in them was universally wanting there are two sorts of mistaken people in the world those who always think that something could and ought to have been done to prevent disaster and those who always think that nothing could have been done turgot was very far removed indeed from the latter class but on the other side he was too sagacious not to know that there are some evils of which we do well to bear a part as the best means of mitigating the other part though he respected the writings of rousseau and confessed his obligations to them turgot abhorred declamation he had no hope of clearing society of the intellectual and moral débris of ages at a stroke nor had he abstract standards of human bliss the keyword to his political theory was not pity nor benevolence but justice we are sure to go wrong he said once when pressed to confer some advantage on the poor at the cost of the rich the moment we forget that justice alone can keep the balance true among all rights and all interests let us proceed to watch this principle actively applied in a field where it was grievously needed  as everybody knows the great fiscal grievance of old france was the taille a tax raised on property and income but only on the property and income of the unprivileged classes in the limousin turgots predecessor tried to substitute for the arbitrary taille a tax systematically assessed in proportion to the amount of the persons property such a design involved a complete remeasurement and revaluation of all the land of the generality and this was a task of immense magnitude and difficulty it was very imperfectly performed and turgot found the province groaning under a mass of fiscal anomalies and disorders assessment collection exemption were all alike conducted without definite principles or uniform system besides these abuses the total sum demanded from the generality by the royal government was greatly in excess of the local resources the district was heavily overcharged relatively to other districts around it no deduction had been made from the sum exacted by the treasury though the falling off in prosperity was great and notorious turgot computed that the kings share was as large as that of the proprietors in other words taxation absorbed one half of the net products of the land the government listened to these representations and conceded to the generality about half of the remissions that turgot had solicited a greater operation was the readjustment of the burden thus lightened within the province the people were so irritated by the disorders which had been introduced by the imperfect operation of the proportional taille that with the characteristic impatience of a rude and unintelligent population they were heedlessly crying out for a return to the more familiar and therefore more comfortable disorders of the arbitrary taille turgot as was natural resisted this slovenly reaction and applied himself with zealous industry to the immense and complex work of effecting a complete revision and settlement of the regulations for assessment and what was a more gigantic enterprise of carrying out a new survey and new valuation of lands and property to serve as a true base for the application of an equitable assessment at the end of thirteen years of indomitable toil the work was still unfinished chiefly owing to want of money for its execution the court wasted more in a fortnight in the easy follies of versailles than would have given to the limousin the instrument of a finished scheme of fiscal order turgots labour was not wholly thrown away the worst abuses were corrected and the most crying iniquities swept away save that iniquity of the exemption of the privileged orders which turgot could not yet venture to touch  let us proceed to another of the master abuses of the old system the introduction of the corvée in the sense in which we have to speak of it dates no further back than the beginning of the eighteenth century it was an encroachment and an innovation on the part of the bureaucracy and the odd circumstance has been remarked that the first mention of the road corvées in any royal act is the famous edict of 1776 which suppressed them until the regency this famous word had described only the services owed by dependents to their lords it meant so many days labour on the lords lands and so many offices of domestic duty when in the early part of the century the advantages of a good system of highroads began to be perceived by the government the convenient idea came into the heads of the more ingenious among the intendants of imposing for the construction of the roads a royal or public corvée analogous to that of private feudalism few more mischievous imposts could have been devised  that undying class who are contented with the shallow presumptions of à priori reasoning in economic matters did it is true find specious pleas even for the road corvée there has never been an abuse in the history of the world for which something good could not be said if men earned money by labour and the use of their time why not require from them time and labour instead of money by the latter device are we not assured against malversation of the funds those who substitute words for things and verbal plausibilities for the observation of experience could prolong these arguments indefinitely the evils of the road corvée meanwhile remained patent and indisputable in england at the same period it is true the country people were obliged to give six days in the year to the repair of the highways under the management of the justices of the peace and in england the business was performed without oppression but then this only illustrates the unwisdom of arguing about economic arrangements in the abstract all depends on the conditions by which the given arrangement is surrounded and a practice that in england was merely clumsy was in france not only clumsy but a gross cruelty there the burden united almost all the follies and iniquities with which a public service could be loaded the french peasant had to give not six but twelve or fifteen days of labour every year for the construction and repair of the roads of his neighbourhood if he had a horse and cart they too were pressed into the service he could not choose the time and he was constantly carried away at the moment when his own poor harvest needed his right arm and his supervision he received no pay and his days on the roads were days of hunger to himself and his family he had the bitterness of knowing that the advantage of the highroad was slight indirect and sometimes null to himself while it was direct and great to the town merchants and the country gentlemen who contributed not an hour nor a sou to the work it was exactly the most indigent upon whose backs this slavish load was placed there were a hundred abuses of spite or partiality of favouritism or vengeance in the allotment of the work the wretch was sent to the part of the road most distant from his own house or he was forced to work for a longer time than fell fairly to his share or he saw a neighbour allowed to escape on payment of a sum of money and at the end of all the roads were vile the labourers having little heart in work for which they had no wage and weakened by want of food did badly what they had to do there was no scientific superintendence no skilled direction no system in the construction no watchfulness as to the maintenance the rains of winter and the storms of summer did damage that one man could have repaired by careful industry from day to day and that for lack of this one man went on increasing until the road fell into holes the ditches got filled up and deep pools of water stood permanently in the middle of the highway the rich disdained to put a hand to the work the poor aware that they would be forced to the hated task in the following autumn or spring naturally attended to their own fields and left the roads to fall to ruin  it need not be said that this barbarous slovenliness and disorder meant an incredible waste of resources it was calculated that a contractor would have provided and maintained fine roads for little more than onethird of the cost at which the corvée furnished roads that were execrable condorcet was right in comparing the government in this matter to a senseless fellow who indulges in all the more lavish riot because by paying for nothing and getting everything at a higher price on credit he is never frightened into sense by being confronted with a budget of his prodigalities  it takes fewer words to describe turgots way of dealing with this oriental mixture of extravagance injustice and squalor the intendant of caen had already proposed to the inhabitants of that district the alternative plan of commuting the corvée into a money payment turgot adopted and perfected this great transformation he substituted for personal service on the roads a yearly rate proportional in amount to the taille he instituted a systematic survey and direction of the roads existing or required in the generality and he committed the execution of the approved plans to contractors on exact and businesslike principles the result of this change was not merely an immense relief to the unfortunate men who had been every year harassed to death and halfruined by the old method of forced labour but so remarkable an improvement both in the goodness and extension of the roads that when arthur young went over them five and twenty years afterwards he pronounced them by far the noblest public ways to be found anywhere in france  two very instructive facts may be mentioned in connection with the suppression of the corvées in the limousin the first is that the central government assented to the changes proposed by the young intendant as promptly as if it had been a committee of the convention instead of being the nominee of an absolute king the other is that the people in the country when turgot had his plans laid before them in their parish meetings held after mass on sundays listened with the keenest distrust and suspicion to what they insisted on regarding as a sinister design for exacting more money from them well might condorcet say that very often it needs little courage to do men harm for they constantly suffer harm tranquilly enough but when you take it into your head to do them some service then they revolt and accuse you of being an innovator it is fair however to remember how many good grounds the french countryman had for distrusting the professions of any agent of the government for even in the case of this very reform though turgot was able to make an addition to the taille in commutation of the work on the roads he was not able to force a contribution either to the taille or any other impost from the privileged classes the very persons who were best able to pay this is only an illustration of what is now a wellknown fact that revolution was made necessary less by despotism than by privilege on the one side and by intense political distrust on the other side  turgot was thoroughly awake to the necessity of penetrating public opinion the first principle of the school of economists was an enlightened people nothing was to be done by them everything was to be done for them but they were to be trained to understand the grounds of the measures which a central authority conceived shaped and carried into practice rousseau was the only writer of the revolutionary school who had the modern democratic faith in the virtue and wisdom of the common people voltaire habitually spoke of their bigotry and prejudice with the natural bitterness of a cultivated man towards the incurable vices of ignorance the economists admitted voltaires view as true of an existing state of things but they looked to education meaning by that something more than primary instruction to lead gradually to the development of sound political intelligence hence when turgot come into full power as the minister of lewis xvi twelve years after he first went to his obscure duties in the limousin he introduced the method of prefacing his edicts by an elaborate statement of the reasons on which their policy rested and on the same principle he now adopted the only means at his disposal for instructing and directing opinion the bookpress was at that moment doing tremendous work among the classes with education and leisure but the newspaper press hardly existed and even if it had existed however many official journals turgot might have had under his inspiration the people whose minds he wished to affect were unable to read there was only one way of reaching them and that was through the priests religious life among the limousins was as we have seen not very pure but it is a significant law of human nature that the less pure a religion is the more important in it is the place of the priest and his office turgot pressed the curés into friendly service it is a remarkable fact not without a parallel in other parts of modern history that of the two great conservative corporations of society the lawyers did all they could to thwart his projects and the priests did all they could to advance them in truth the priests are usually more or less sympathetic towards any form of centralised authority it is only when the people take their own government into their own hands that the clergy are sure to turn cold or antipathetic towards improvement there is one other reservation as turgot found out in 1775 when he had been transferred to a greater post and the clergy had joined his bitterest enemies then he touched the corporate spirit and perceived that for authority to lay a hand on ecclesiastical privilege is to metamorphose goodwill into the most rancorous malignity meanwhile the letters in which turgot explained his views and wishes to the curés by them to be imparted to their parishes are masterpieces of the care the patience the interest of a good ruler those impetuous and peremptory spirits who see in frederick or napoleon the only born rulers of men might find in these letters and in the acts to which they refer the memorials of a far more admirable and beneficent type                               the corvée vexatious as it was yet excited less violent heats and inflicted less misery than the abuses of military service there had been a militia in the country as far back as the time of the merovingians but the militiaservice with which turgot had to deal only dated from 1726 each parish was bound to supply its quota of men to this service and the obligation was perhaps the most odious grievance though not the most really mischievous of all that then afflicted the realm the hatred which it raised was due to no failure of the military spirit in the people from frederick the great downwards everybody was well aware that the disasters to france which had begun with the shameful defeat of rossbach and ended with the loss of canada in the west and the indies in the east 17571763 were due to no want of valour in the common soldier it was the generals as napoleon said fifty years afterwards who were incapable and inept and it was the ineptitude of the administrative chiefs that made the militia at once ineffective and abhorred first they allowed a great number of classified exemptions from the ballot the noble the tonsured clerk the counsellor the domestic of noble tonsured clerk and counsellor the eldest son of the lawyer and the farmer the tax collector the schoolmaster were all exempt hence the curse of service was embittered by a sense of injustice this was one of the many springs in the old régime that fed the swelling and vehement stream of passion for social equality until at length when the day came it made such short and furious work with the structure of envious partition between citizen and citizen  again by a curious perversity of official pedantry the government insisted on each man who drew the black ticket in the abhorred lottery performing his service in person it forbade substitution under a modern system of universal military service this is perfectly intelligible and just but as we have seen military service was only made obligatory on those who were already ground down by hardships as a consequence of this prohibition those who were liable to be drawn lived in despair and as no worse thing than the black ticket could possibly befall them they had every inducement to run away from their own homes and villages at the approach of the commissary of the government they fled into the woods and marshes as if they had been pursued by the plague this was a signal for a civil war on a small scale those who were left behind and whose chance of being drawn was thus increased hastened to pursue the fugitives with such weapons as came to their hands in the limousin the country was constantly the scene of murderous disorders of this kind what was worse was not only that the land was infested by vagabonds and bad characters but that villages became half depopulated and the soil lost its cultivators finally as is uniformly the case in the history of bad government an unjust method produced a worthless machine the milice supplied as bad troops as the corvée supplied bad roads the force was recruited from the lowest class of the population and as soon as its members had learned a little drill they were discharged and their places taken by raw batches provided at random by blind lot  turgot proposed that a character both of permanence and locality should be given to the provincial force that each parish or union of parishes should be required to raise a number of men that these men should be left at home and in their own districts and only called out for exercise for a certain time each year and that they should be retained as a reserve force by a small payment in this way he argued that the government would secure a competent force and by stimulating local pride and point of honour would make service popular instead of hateful as the government was too weak and distracted to take up so important a scheme as this turgot was obliged to content himself with evading the existing regulations and it is a curious illustration of the pliancy of versailles that he should have been allowed to do so openly and without official remonstrance he permitted the victim of the ballot to provide a voluntary substitute and he permitted the parish to tempt substitutes by payment of a sum of money on enrolment this may seem a very obvious course to follow but no one who has tried to realise the strength and obstinacy of routine will measure the service of a reformer by the originality of his ideas in affairs of government the priceless qualities are not merely originality of resource but a sense for things that are going wrong and a sufficiently vigorous will to set them right  one general expression serves to describe this most important group of turgots undertakings the reader has probably already observed that what turgot was doing was to take that step which is one of the most decisive in the advance of a society to a highly organised industrial stage he displaced imposts in kind that rudest and most wasteful form of contribution to the public service and established in their stead a system of money payments and of having the work of the government done on commercial principles thus as if it were not enough to tear the peasant away from the soil to serve in the militia as if it were not enough to drag away the farmer and his cattle to the public highways the reigning system struck a third blow at agriculture by requiring the people of the localities that happened to be traversed by a regiment on the march to supply their waggons and horses and oxen for the purposes of military transport in this case it is true a certain compensation in money was allowed but how inadequate was this insignificant allowance we may easily understand the payment was only for one day but the days march was often of many miles and the oxen which in the limousin mostly did the work of horses were constantly seen to drop down dead in the roads there was not only the one days work often two three or five days were needed to reach the place of appointment and for these days not even the paltry twenty sous were granted nor could any payment of this kind recompense the peasant for the absence of his beasts of burden on the great days when he wanted to plough his fields to carry the grain to the barns or to take his produce to market the obvious remedy here as in the corvées was to have the transport effected by a contractor and to pay him out of a rate levied on the persons liable this was what turgot ordered to be done  of one other burden of the same species he relieved the cultivator this unfortunate being was liable to be called upon to collect as well as to pay the taxes once nominated he became responsible for the amount at which his commune was assessed if he did not produce the sum he lost his liberty if he advanced it from his own pocket he lost at least the interest on the money in collecting the money from his fellow taxpayers he not only incurred bitter and incessant animosities but what was harder to bear he lost the priceless time of which his own land was only too sorely in need in the limousin the luckless creature had a special disadvantage for here the collector of the taille had also to collect the twentieths and the twentieths were a tax for which even the privileged classes were liable they as might be supposed cavilled disputed and appealed the appeal lay to a sort of county board which was composed of people of their own kind and before which they too easily made out a plausible case against a clumsy collector who more often than not knew neither how to read nor to write turgots reform of a system which was always harassing and often ruinous to an innocent individual consisted in the creation of the task of collection into a distinct and permanent office exercised over districts sufficiently large to make the poundage out of which the collectors were paid an inducement to persons of intelligence and spirit to undertake the office as a profession however moderate and easy each of these reforms may seem by itself yet any one may see how the sum of them added to the prosperity of the land increased the efficiency of the public service and tended to lessen the grinding sense of injustice among the common people  apart from these the greatest and most difficult of all turgots administrative reforms we may notice in passing his assiduity in watching for the smaller opportunities of making life easier to the people of his province his private benevolence was incessant and marked one case of its exercise carries our minds at a word into the very midst of the storm of fire which purified france of the evil and sordid elements that now and for his life lay like a mountain of lead on all turgots aims and efforts a certain foreign contractor at limoges was ruined by the famine of 1770 he had a clever son whom turgot charitably sent to school and afterwards to college in paris the youth grew up to be the most eloquent and dazzling of the girondins the highsouled vergniaud it was not however in good works of merely private destination that turgot mostly exercised himself in 1767 the district was infested by wolves the intendant imposed a small tax for the purpose of providing rewards for the destruction of these tormentors and in reading the minutes on the subject we are reminded of the fact which was not without its significance when the peasants rose in vengeance on their lords two and twenty years later that the dispersion of the hamlets and the solitude of the farms had made it customary for the people to go about with firearms besides encouraging the destruction of noxious beasts turgot did something for the preservation of beasts not noxious the first veterinary school in france had been founded at lyons in 1762 to this he sent pupils from his province and eventually he founded a similar school at limoges he suppressed a tax on cattle which acted prejudicially on breeding and grazing and he introduced clover into the grasslands the potato had been unknown in limousin it was not common in any part of france and perhaps this is not astonishing when we remember that the first field crop even in agricultural scotland is supposed only to have been sown in the fourth decade of that century people would not touch it though the experiment of persuading them to cultivate this root had been frequently tried in the limousin the people were even more obstinate in their prejudice than elsewhere but turgot persevered knowing how useful potatoes would be in a land where scarcity of grain was so common the ordinary view was that they were hardly fit for pigs and that in human beings they would certainly breed leprosy some of the english puritans would not eat potatoes because they are not mentioned in the bible and that is perhaps no better a reason than the other when however it was seen that the intendant had the hated vegetable served every day at his own table the opposition grew more faint men were at last brought to consent to use potatoes for their cattle and after a time even for themselves  it need scarcely be said that among turgots efforts for agricultural improvement was the foundation of an agricultural society this was the time when the passion for provincial academies of all sorts was at its height when we consider that turgots society was not practical but deliberative and what themes he proposed for discussion by it we may believe that it was one of the less useful of his works what the farmers needed was something much more directly instructive in the methods of their business than could come of discussions as to the effects of indirect taxation on the revenues of landowners or the right manner of valuing the income of land in the different kinds of cultivation in that most unlucky path of french exertion says arthur young this distinguished patriot was able to do nothing this society does like other societies they meet converse offer premiums and publish nonsense this is not of much consequence for the people instead of reading their memoirs are not able to read at all they can however see and if a farm was established in that good cultivation which they ought to copy something would be presented from which they might learn i asked particularly if the members of this society had land in their own hands and was assured that they had but the conversation presently explained it they had métayers round their country seats and this was considered as farming their own lands so that they assume something of a merit from the identical circumstance which is the curse and ruin of the whole country  the record of what turgot did for manufacturing industry and commerce is naturally shorter than that of his efforts for the relief of the land and its cultivators in the eyes of the modern economist with his horror of government encouragement to industry no matter in what time place or circumstance some of turgots actions will seem of doubtful wisdom at brives for example with all the authority of an intendant he urged the citizens to provide buildings for carrying on a certain manufacture which he and others thought would be profitable to the town and as the money for the buildings did not come in very readily he levied a rate both on the town and on the inhabitants of the suburbs his argument was that the new works would prove indirectly beneficial to the whole neighbourhood he was not long however in finding out as the authors of such a policy generally find out how difficult it is to reconcile the interests of aided manufactures with those of the taxpayers it is characteristic we may remark of the want of public spirit in the great nobles that one of turgots first difficulties in the affair was to defeat an unjust claim made by no less a personage than the marshal de noailles to a piece of public land on which the proposed works were to be built a more important industry in the history of limoges sprang from the discovery during turgots tenure of office of the china clay which has now made the porcelain of limoges only second among the french potteries to that of sèvres itself the modern pottery has been developed since the close of the revolution which checked the establishments and processes that had been directed encouraged and supervised by turgot  to his superior enlightenment in another part of the commercial field we owe one of the most excellent of turgots pieces his memorial on loans of money this plea for free trade in money has all the sense and liberality of the brightest side of the eighteenth century illumination it was suggested by the following circumstance at angoulême four or five rogues associated together and drew bills on one another on these bills they borrowed money the average rate of interest being from eight to ten per cent when the bills fell due instead of paying them they laid informations against the lenders for taking more than the legal rate of interest the lenders were ruined persons who had money were afraid to make advances bills were protested commercial credit was broken and the trade of the district was paralysed turgot prevailed upon the council of state to withdraw the cases from the local jurisdiction the proceedings against the lenders were annulled and the institution of similar proceedings forbidden this was a characteristic course the royal government was generally willing in the latter half of the eighteenth century to redress a given case of abuse but it never felt itself strong enough or had leisure enough to deal with the general source from which the particular grievance sprang turgots memorial is as cogent an exposure of the mischief of usury laws to the public prosperity as the more renowned pages either of bentham or j b say on the same subject and it has the merit of containing an explanation at once singularly patient and singularly intelligent of the origin of the popular feeling about usury and its adoption by the legislator  after he had been eight years at his post turgot was called upon to deal with the harassing problems of a scarcity of food in 1770 even the maize and black grain and the chestnuts on which the people supported life failed almost completely and the failure extended over two years the scarcity very speedily threatened to become a famine and all its conditions were exasperated by the unwisdom of the authorities and the selfish rapacity of the landlords it needed all the firmness and all the circumspection of which turgot was capable to overcome the difficulties which the strong forces of ignorance prejudice and greediness raised up against him  his first battle was on an issue which is painfully familiar to our own indian administrators at the present time in 1764 an edict had been promulgated decreeing free trade in grain not with foreign countries but among the different provinces of the kingdom this edict had not made much way in the minds either of the local officials or of the people at large and the presence of famine made the free and unregulated export of food seem no better than a cruel and outrageous paradox the parlement of bordeaux at once suspended the edict of 1764 they ordered that all dealers in grain farmers of land owners of land of whatever rank quality or condition should forthwith convey to the markets of their district a sufficient quantity of grain to provision the said markets the same persons were forbidden to sell either by wholesale or retail any portion of the said grain at their own granaries turgot at once procured from the council at versailles the proper instrument for checking this impolitic interference with the free circulation of grain and he contrived this instrument in such conciliatory terms as to avoid any breach with the parlement whose motives for that matter were respectable enough in spite however of the action of the government popular feeling ran high against free markets tumultuous gatherings of famishing men and women menaced the unfortunate graindealers waggoners engaged in carrying grain away from a place where it was cheaper to another place where it was dearer were violently arrested in their business and terrified from proceeding hunger prevented people from discerning the unanswerable force of the argument that if the grain commanded a higher price somewhere else that was a sure sign of the need there being more dire the local officials were as hostile as their humbler neighbours at the town of turenne they forbade grain to be taken away and forced the owners of it to sell it on the spot at the market rate at the town of angoulême the lieutenant of police took upon himself to order that all the grain destined for the limousin should be unloaded and stored at angoulême turgot brought a heavy hand to bear on these breakers of administrative discipline and readily procured such sanction as his authority needed from the council  one of the most interesting of the measures to which turgot resorted in meeting the destitution of the country was the establishment of the charitable workshops some of the advocates of the famous national workshops of 1848 have appealed to this example of the severe patriot for a sanction to their own economic policy it is not clear that the logic of the socialist is here more remorseless than usual if the state may set up workshops to aid people who are short of food because the harvest has failed why should it not do the same when people are short of food because trade is bad work scarce and wages intolerably low of course turgots answer would have been that remorseless logic is the most improper instrument in the world for a business of rough expedients such as government is there is a vital difference in practice between opening a public workshop in the exceptional emergency of a famine and keeping public workshops open as a normal interference with the free course of industrial activity for the moment the principle may appear to be the same but in reality the application of the principle means in the latter case the total disorganisation of industry in the former it means no more than a temporary breach of the existing principles of organisation with a view to its speedier revival to invoke turgot as a dabbler in socialism because he opened ateliers de charité is as unreasonable as it would be to make an english minister who should suspend the bank charter act in a crisis into the champion of an inconvertible paper currency turgot always regarded the sums paid in his works not as wages but as alms all that he urged was that the best and most useful kind of alms consists in providing means for earning them to prevent the workers from earning aid with as little trouble to themselves as possible he recommended payment by the piece and not by the day to check workers from flocking in from their regular employments he insisted on the wages being kept below the ordinary rate and he urged the propriety of driving as sharp bargains as possible in fixing the price of the piece of work to prevent the dissipation of earnings at the tavern he paid not in money but in leathern tokens that were only current in exchange for provisions all these regulations mark a wide gulf between the economist of 1770 and the socialist of 1848 nobody was sterner than turgot against beggars the inevitable scourge of every country where the evils of vicious economic arrangements are aggravated by the mischievous views of the catholic clergy first as to the duties of promiscuous almsgiving and second as to the virtue of improvident marriages in 1614 the states general had been for hanging all mendicants and colbert had sent them to the galleys turgot was less rigorous than that but he would not suffer his efforts for the economic restoration of his province to be thwarted by the influx of these devouring parasites and he sent every beggar on whom hands could be laid to prison  the story of the famine in the limousin brings to light some instructive facts as to the temper of the lords and rich proprietors on the eve of the changes that were to destroy them turgot had been specially anxious that as much as possible of what was necessary for the relief of distress should be done by private persons he knew the straits of the government he knew how hard it would be to extract from it the means of repairing a deficit in his own finances accordingly he invited the landowners not merely to contribute sums of money in return for the public works carried on in their neighbourhood but also by way of providing employment to their indigent neighbours to undertake such works as they should find convenient on their own estates the response was disappointing the districts he wrote in 1772 where i have works on foot do not give me reason to hope for much help on the side of the generosity of the nobles and the rich landowners the prince de soubise is so far the only person who has given anything for the works that have been executed in his duchy nor was abstinence from generosity the worst part of this failure in public spirit the same nobles and landowners who refused to give did not refuse to take away most of them proceeded at once to dismiss their métayers the people who farmed their lands in consideration of a fixed proportion of the produce turgot in an ordinance of admirable gravity remonstrated against this harsh and impolitic proceeding he pointed out that the unfortunate wretches thus stripped of every resource would have to leave the district abandoning their wives and children to the charity of villages that were already overburdened with the charge of their own people to cast this additional load on the villages was all the more unjust because the owners of land had been exempted from onehalf of the taxes levied on the owners of other property exactly because the former were expected to provide for their own peasants it was a claim less of humanity than of bare justice that the landowners should do something for men with whom their relations had been so close as to be almost domestic and to whose hard toil their masters owed all that they possessed as a mere matter of selfinterest moreover apart alike from both justice and humanity the death or flight of the labourers would leave the proprietors helpless when the next good season came and for want of hands the land would be doomed to barrenness for years to come to the grievous detriment no less of the landowners than of the whole people of the realm accordingly turgot ordered all those who had dismissed their métayers to take them back again and he enacted generally that all proprietors of whatever quality or condition and whether privileged or not should be bound to keep and support until the next harvest all the labourers who had been on their land in the previous october as well women and children as men  turgots policy in this matter is more instructive as to the social state of france than it may at first sight appear at first sight we are astonished to find the austere economist travelling so far from the orthodox path of free contract as to order a landowner to furnish at his own cost subsistence for his impoverished tenants but the truth is that the métayer was not a free tenant in the sense which we attach to the word in limousin says arthur young the métayers are considered as little better than menial servants and it is not going beyond the evidence to say that they were even something lower than menial servants they were really a kind of serfcaste they lived in the lowest misery more than half of them were computed to be deeply in debt to the proprietors in many cases they were even reduced every year to borrow from their landlord before the harvest came round such coarse bread of mixed rye and barley as he might choose to lend them what turgot therefore had in his mind was no relation of free contract though it was that legally but a relation which partly resembled that of a feudal lord to his retainer and partlyas sir henry maine has hintedthat of a planter to his negroes it is less surprising then that turgot should have enforced some of the responsibilities of the lord and the planter  the nobles had resort to a still more indefensible measure than the expulsion of their métayers most of the lands in the generality of limoges were charged with dues in kind payable to the lords as the cultivators had for the most part no grain even for their own bread they naturally had no grain for the lords dues the lords then insisted on payment in cash and they insisted on estimating this payment at the famine price of the grain most of them were really as needy as they were idle and proud and nothing is so inordinately grasping as the indigence of classpride the effect of their proceedings now was to increase their revenue fourfold and fivefold out of public calamity and universal misery and unfortunately the liability of the cultivators in a given manor was solidaire they were jointly and severally responsible and the effect of this was that even those who were in circumstances to pay the quadrupled dues were ruined and destroyed without mercy in consequence of having also to pay the quadrupled dues of their beggared neighbours turgot arrested this odious process by means of an old and forgotten decree which he prevailed upon the parlement of bordeaux to revive in good and due form to the effect that the arrears of dues in kind for 1769 should be paid at the market price of grain when the dues were payable that is before the scarcity had declared itself  when we consider the grinding and extortionate spirit thus shown in face of a common calamity we may cease to wonder at the ferocity with which when the hour struck the people tore away privilege distinction and property itself from classes that had used all three only to ruin the land and crush its inhabitants into the dust and the moment that the lord had thus transformed himself into a mere creditor and a creditor for goods delivered centuries ago and long since consumed and forgotten then it was certain that if political circumstances favoured the growing economic sentiment there would be heard again the old cry of the roman plebs for an agrarian law and novæ tabulæ nay something was heard that is amazingly like the cry of the modern irish peasant in 1776 two noteworthy incidents happened a certain marquis de vibraye threw into prison a peasant who refused to pay the droit de cens immediately between thirty and forty peasants came to the rescue armed themselves besieged the château took it and sacked it and drove the marquis de vibraye away in terror still more significant is the second incident which happened shortly after a relative of the duke of mortemart shooting on his property was attacked by peasants who insisted that he should cease his sport they treated him with much brutality and even threatened to fire on him and his attendants claiming to be free masters of their lands here was the main root of the great french revolution a fair consideration of the details of such an undertaking as turgots administration of the limousin helps us to understand two things first that all the ideas necessary for the pacific transformation of french society were there in the midst of it second that the system of privilege had fostered such a spirit in one class and the reaction against the inconsiderate manifestation of that spirit was so violent in the other class that good political ideas were vain and inapplicable  it is curious to find that in the midst of his beneficent administration turgot was rating practical work very low in comparison with the achievements of the student and the thinker you are very fortunate condorcet said to him in having a passion for the public good and in being able to satisfy it it is a great consolation and of a very superior order to the consolation of mere study nay replied turgot in his next letter whatever you may say i believe that the satisfaction derived from study is superior to any other kind of satisfaction i am perfectly convinced that one may be through study a thousand times more useful to men than in any of our subordinate posts there we torment ourselves and often without any compensating success to secure some small benefits while we are the involuntary instrument of evils that are by no means small all our small benefits are transitory while the light that a man of letters is able to diffuse must sooner or later destroy all the artificial evils of the human race and place it in a position to enjoy all the goods that nature offers it is clear that we can only accept turgots preference on condition that the man of letters is engaged on work that seriously advances social interests and adds something to human stature most literature nearly all literature is distinctly subordinate and secondary it only serves to pass the time of the learned or cultured class without making any definite mark either on the mental habits of men and women or on the institutions under which they live compared with such literature as this the work of an administrator who makes life materially easier and more hopeful to the halfmillion of persons living in the generality of limoges or elsewhere must be pronounced emphatically the worthier and more justly satisfactory44  footnote 44 see vol i p 290  turgot himself however found time in his industry at limoges to make a contribution to a kind of literature which has seriously modified the practical arrangements and social relations of the western world in 1766 he published his essay on the formation and distribution of wealtha short but most pithy treatise in which he anticipated some of the leading economic principles of that greater work by adam smith which was given to the world ten years later turgots essay has none of the breadth of historic outlook and none of the amplitude of concrete illustrations from real affairs which make the wealth of nations so deeply fertile so persuasive so interesting so thoroughly alive so genuinely enriching to the understanding of the judicious reader but the comparative dryness of turgots too concise form does not blind the historian of political economy to the merit of the substance of his propositions it was no small proof of originality and enlightenment to precede adam smith by ten years in the doctrines of free trade of free industry of loans on interest of the constitutive elements of price of the effects of the division of labour of the processes of the formation of capital the passage on interest will bear reproducing once morewe may regard the rate of interest as a kind of level below which all labour all cultivation all industry all commerce ceases it is like a sea spreading out over a vast district the tops of the mountains rise above the waters and form fertile and cultivated islands if the sea by any chance finds an outlet then in proportion as it goes down first the slopes next the plains and valleys appear and clothe themselves with productions of every kind it is enough that the sea rises or falls by a foot to inundate vast shores or to restore them to cultivation and plenty there are not many illustrations at once so apt and so picturesque as this but most of the hundred paragraphs that make up the reflections are notwithstanding one or two of the characteristic crotchets of quesnais school both accurate and luminous     v   in may 1774 lewis xv died his successor was only twenty years old he was sluggish in mind vacillating in temper and inexperienced in affairs maurepas was recalled to become the new kings chief adviser and maurepas at the suggestion of one of turgots college friends summoned the intendant from limoges and placed him at the head of the department of marine this post turgot only held for a couple of months he was then preferred to the great office of controllergeneral the condition of the national finance made its administration the most important of all the departments of the government turgots policy in this high sphere belongs to the general history of france and there is no occasion for us to reproduce its details here it was mainly an attempt to extend over the whole realm the kind of reforms which had been tried on a small scale in the limousin he suppressed the corvées and he tacked the money payment which was substituted for that burden on to the twentieths an impost from which the privileged class was not exempt the weight of this charge he made the king say in the edict of suppression now falls and must fall only on the poorest classes of our subjects this truth only added to the exasperation of the rich and perhaps might well have been omitted along with the corvées were suppressed the jurandes or exclusive industrial corporations or tradeguilds whose monopolies and restrictions were so mischievous an impediment to the wellbeing of the country in the preamble to this edict we seem to be breathing the air not of versailles in 1775 but of the convention in 1793god when he made man with wants and rendered labour an indispensable resource made the right of work the property of every individual in the world and this property is the first the most sacred and the most imprescriptible of all kinds of property we regard it as one of the first duties of our justice and as one of the acts most of all worthy of our benevolence to free our subjects from every infraction of that inalienable right of humanity  again turgot removed a tax from certain forms of lease with a view to promote the substitution of a system of farming for the system of métayers he abolished an obstructive privilege by which the hôtel dieu had the exclusive right of selling meat during lent the whole of the old incoherent and vexatious police of the cornmarkets was swept away finally he inspired the publication of a short but most important writing boncerfs inconvénients des droits féodaux in which without criticising the origin of the privileges of the nobles the author showed how much it would be to the advantage of the lords to accept a commutation of their feudal dues what was still more exasperating both to nobles and lawyers was the authors hardy assertion that if the lords refused the offer of their vassals the king had the power to settle the question for them by his own legislative authority this was the most important and decisive of the prerevolutionary tracts  equally violent prejudices and more sensitive interests were touched by two other sets of proposals the minister began to talk of a new territorial contribution and a great survey and reassessment of the land then followed an edict restoring in good earnest the free circulation of corn within the kingdom turgot was a partisan of free trade in its most entire application but for the moment he contented himself with the free importation of grain and its free circulation at home without sanctioning its exportation abroad apart from changes thus organically affecting the industry of the country turgot dealt sternly with certain corruptions that had crept into the system of taxfarming as well as with the monstrous abuses of the system of courtpensions  the measures we have enumerated were all excellent in themselves and the state of the kingdom was such as urgently to call for them they were steps towards the construction of a fabric of freedom and justice but they provoked a host of bitter and irreconcilable enemies while they raised up no corresponding host of energetic supporters the reason of the first of these circumstances is plain enough but the second demands a moments consideration that the country clergy should denounce the philosopher as they called him from the pulpit and the steps of the altar was natural enough many even of his old colleagues of the encyclopædia had joined necker against the minister the greatest of them all it is true stood by turgot with unfailing staunchness a shower of odes diatribes dialogues allegories dissertations came from the patriarch of ferney to confound and scatter the enemies of the new reforms but the people were unmoved if turgot published an explanation of the high price of grain they perversely took explanation for gratulation and thought the controller preferred to have bread dear if he put down seditious risings with a strong hand they insisted that he was in nefarious league with the cornmerchants and the bakers how was it that the people did not recognise the hand of a benefactor the answer is that they suspected the source of the new reforms too virulently to judge them calmly for half a century as condorcet says pregnantly they had been undergoing the evils of anarchy while they supposed that they were feeling those of despotism the error was grave but it was natural and one effect of it was to make every measure that proceeded from the court odious hence when the parlements took up their judicial arms in defence of abuses and against reforms the common people took sides with them for no better reason than that this was to take sides against the kings government malesherbes in those days and good writers since held that the only safe plan was to convoke the statesgeneral they would at least have shared the responsibility with the crown turgot rejected this opinion by doctrine no less than by temperament he disliked the control of a government by popular bodies everything for the people nothing by the people this was the maxim of the economists and turgot held it in all its rigour the royal authority was the only instrument that he could bring himself to use even if he could have counted on a frederick or a napoleon the instrument would hardly have served his purposes as things were it was a broken reed not a fine sword that he had to his hand  the national assembly and the convention went to work exactly in the same stiff and absolute spirit as turgot they were just as little disposed to gradual moderate and compromising ways as he but with them the absolute authority on which they leaned was real and most potent with him it was a shadow we owe it to turgot that the experiment was complete he proved that the monarchy of divine right was incapable of reform45 as it has been sententiously expressed the part of the sages was now played out room was now for the men of destiny  footnote 45 foncins ministère de turgot p 574  if the repudiation of a popular assembly was the cardinal error in turgots scheme of policy there were other errors added the publication of boncerfs attack on the feudal dues with the undisguised sanction of the minister has been justly condemned as a grave imprudence and as involving a forgetfulness of the true principles of government and administration that would certainly not have been committed either by colbert in whom turgot professed to seek his model nor by gournai who had been his master it was a broad promise of reforms which turgot was by no means sure of being able to persuade the king and his council to adopt by prematurely divulging his projects it augmented the number of his adversaries without being definite enough to bring new friends46 again turgot did nothing to redeem it by personal conciliatoriness in carrying out the designs of a benevolent absolutism the count of provence afterwards lewis xviii wrote a satire on the government during turgots ministry and in it there is a picture of the great reformer as he appeared to his enemies there was then in france an awkward heavy clumsy creature born with more rudeness than character more obstinacy than firmness more impetuosity than tact a charlatan in administration no less than in virtue exactly formed to get the one decried and to disgust the world with the other made harsh and distant by his selflove and timid by his pride as much a stranger to men whom he had never known as to the public weal which he had never seen aright this man was called turgot  footnote 46 see mauguins etudes historiques sur ladministration de lagriculture i 353  it is a mistake to take the word of political adversaries for a mans character but adversaries sometimes only say out aloud what is already suspected by friends the coarse account given by the count of provence shows us where turgots weakness as a ruler may have lain he was distant and stiff in manner and encouraged no one to approach him even his health went against him for at a critical time in his short ministry he was confined to bed by gout for four months and he could see nobody save clerks and secretaries the very austerity loftiness and purity which make him so reverend and inspiring a figure in the pages of the noblehearted condorcet may well have been impediments in dealing with a society that in the fatal words of the roman historian could bear neither its disorders nor their remedies  the king had once said pathetically it is only m turgot and i who love the people but even with the king there were points at which the ministers philosophic severity strained their concord turgot was the friend of voltaire and condorcet he counted christianity a form of superstition and he who as a youth had refused to go through life wearing the mask of the infidel abbé had too much selfrespect in his manhood to practise the rites and uses of a system which he considered a degradation of the understanding one day the king said to maurepas you have given me a controllergeneral who never goes to mass sire replied that ready worldling the abbé terray always wentand terray had brought the government to bankruptcy but turgot hurt the kings conscience more directly than by staying away from mass and confession faithful to the long tradition of his ancestors lewis xvi wished the ceremony of his coronation to take place at rheims turgot urged that it should be performed at paris and as cheaply as possible and he advanced on to still more delicate ground in the rite of consecration the usage was that the king should take an oath to pursue all heretics turgot demanded the suppression of this declaration of intolerance it was pointed out to him that it was only a formality but turgot was one of those severe and scrupulous souls to whom a wicked promise does not cease to be degrading by becoming hypocritical and he was perfectly justified it was only by the gradual extinction of the vestiges of her ancient barbarisms as occasion offered that the church could have escaped the crash of the revolution meanwhile the king and the priests had their own way the king was crowned at rheims and the priests exacted from him an oath to be unjust oppressive and cruel towards a portion of his subjects turgot could only remonstrate but the philosophic memorial in which he protested in favour of religious freedom and equality gave the king a serious shock  we have no space nor would it be worth while to describe the intrigues which ended in the ministers fall already in the previous volume we have referred to the immediate and decisive share which the queen had in his disgrace47 he was dismissed in the beginning of may 1776 having been in power little more than twenty months you are too hurried malesherbes had said to him you think you have the love of the public good not at all you have a rage for it for a man must be nothing short of enraged to insist on forcing the hand of the whole world turgot replied more pathetically perhaps than reasonably what you accuse me of haste and you know that in my family we die of gout at fifty  footnote 47 see vol i p 31  there is something almost tragic in the joy with which turgots dismissal was received on all sides i seem said marmontel to be looking at a band of brigands in the forest of bondy who have just heard that the provostmarshal has been discharged voltaire and condorcet were not more dismayed by the fall of the minister than by the insensate delight which greeted the catastrophe this event wrote condorcet has changed all nature in my eyes i have no longer the same pleasure in looking at those fair landscapes over which he would have shed happiness and contentment the sight of the gaiety of the people wrings my heart they dance and sport as if they had lost nothing ah we have had a delicious dream but it has been all too short voltaire was equally inconsolable and still more violent in the expression of his grief when he had become somewhat calmer he composed those admirable versesto a man       philosophe indulgent ministre citoyen     qui ne cherchas le vrai que pour faire le bien     qui dun peuple léger et trop ingrat peutêtre     préparais le bonheur et celui de son maître     ce quon nomme disgrace a payé tes bienfaits     le vrai prix de travail nest que de vivre en paix   turgot at first showed some just and natural resentment at the levity with which he had been banished from power and he put on no airs of theatrical philosophy he would have been untrue to the sincerity of his character if he had affected indifference or satisfaction at seeing his beneficent hopes for ever destroyed but chagrin did not numb his industry or his wide interests condorcet went to visit him some months after his fall he describes turgot as reading ariosto as making experiments in physics and as having forgotten all that had passed within the last two years save when the sight of evils that he would have mitigated or removed happened to remind him of it he occupied himself busily with chemistry and optics with astronomy and mechanics and above all with meteorology which was a new science in those days and the value of which to the study of the conditions of human health of the productions of the earth of navigation excited his most ardent anticipations turgot also was so moved by the necessity for a new synthesis of life and knowledge as to frame a plan for a great work on the human soul the order of the universe the supreme being the principles of societies the rights of men political constitutions legislation administration physical education the means of perfecting the human race relatively to the progressive advance and employment of their forces to the happiness of which they are susceptible to the extent of the knowledge to which they may attain to the certainty clearness and simplicity of the principles of conduct to the purity of the feelings that spring up in mens souls while his mind was moving through these immense spaces of thought he did not forget the things of the hour he invented a machine for serving ships cables he wrote a plea for allowing captain cooks vessel to remain unmolested during the american war with adam smith with dr price with franklin with hume he kept up a grave and worthy correspondence of his own countrymen condorcet was his most faithful friend and disciple and it is much to condorcets credit that this was so for turgot never gave way to the passionate impulses of the philosophic school against what voltaire called the infamous that is to say against the church her doctrines her morality her history  we have already said that the keyword to turgots political aims and social theory was not pity nor benevolence but justice it was justice also not temporary prejudice nor passion that guided his judgment through the heated issues of the time this justice and exact reasonableness it was impossible to surprise or throw off its guard his sublime intellectual probity never suffered itself to be tempted he protested against the doctrines of helvétiuss book de lesprit and of dholbachs système de la nature at a moment when some of his best friends were enthusiastic in admiration for no better reason than that the doctrines of the two books were hateful to the ecclesiastics and destructive of the teaching of the church in the course of a discussion condorcet had maintained that in general scrupulous persons are not fit for great things a christian he said will waste in subduing the darts of the flesh time that he might have employed upon things that would have been useful to humanity he will never venture to rise against tyrants for fear of having formed a hasty judgment and so forth in other cases no virtue replies turgot in whatever sense you take the word can dispense with justice and i think no better of the people who do your great things at the cost of justice than i do of poets who fancy that they can produce great wonders of imagination without order and regularity i know that excessive precision tends to deaden the fire alike of action and of composition but there is a medium in everything there has never been any question in our controversy of a capuchin wasting his time in quenching the darts of the flesh though by the way in the whole sum of time wasted the term expressing the time lost in satisfying the appetites of the flesh would probably be found to be decidedly the greater of the two this parenthesis is one of a hundred illustrations of turgots habitual refusal to be carried out of the narrow path of exact rationality or to take for granted a single word of the common form of the dialect even of his best friends and closest associates and the readiness with which men fall into common form the levity with which they settle the most complex and difficult issues stirred in turgot what michelet calls férocité and mr matthew arnold calls soeva indignatio turgot was filled with an astonished awful oppressive sense of the immoral thoughtlessness of men of the heedless hazardous way in which they deal with things of the greatest moment to them of the immense incalculable misery which is due to this cause m arnold  turgot died on the 20th of march 1781 leaving to posterity the memory of a character which was more perfect and imposing than his performances condorcet saw in this harmonious union and fine balance of qualities the secret of his unpopularity envy he says seems more closely to attend a character that approaches perfection than one that while astonishing men by its greatness yet by exhibiting a mixture of defects and vices offers a consolation that envy seeks
