13558872	in the cage   chapter i   it had occurred to her early that in her positionthat of a young person spending in framed and wired confinement the life of a guineapig or a magpieshe should know a great many persons without their recognising the acquaintance  that made it an emotion the more livelythough singularly rare and always even then with opportunity still very much smotheredto see any one come in whom she knew outside as she called it any one who could add anything to the meanness of her function  her function was to sit there with two young menthe other telegraphist and the counterclerk to mind the sounder which was always going to dole out stamps and postalorders weigh letters answer stupid questions give difficult change and more than anything else count words as numberless as the sands of the sea the words of the telegrams thrust from morning to night through the gap left in the high lattice across the encumbered shelf that her forearm ached with rubbing  this transparent screen fenced out or fenced in according to the side of the narrow counter on which the human lot was cast the duskiest corner of a shop pervaded not a little in winter by the poison of perpetual gas and at all times by the presence of hams cheese dried fish soap varnish paraffin and other solids and fluids that she came to know perfectly by their smells without consenting to know them by their names  the barrier that divided the little postandtelegraphoffice from the grocery was a frail structure of wood and wire but the social the professional separation was a gulf that fortune by a stroke quite remarkable had spared her the necessity of contributing at all publicly to bridge  when mr cockers young men stepped over from behind the other counter to change a fivepound noteand mr cockers situation with the cream of the court guide and the dearest furnished apartments simpkins ladles thrupps just round the corner was so select that his place was quite pervaded by the crisp rustle of these emblemsshe pushed out the sovereigns as if the applicant were no more to her than one of the momentary the practically featureless appearances in the great procession and this perhaps all the more from the very fact of the connexion only recognised outside indeed to which she had lent herself with ridiculous inconsequence  she recognised the others the less because she had at last so unreservedly so irredeemably recognised mr mudge  however that might be she was a little ashamed of having to admit to herself that mr mudges removal to a higher sphereto a more commanding position that is though to a much lower neighbourhoodwould have been described still better as a luxury than as the mere simplification the corrected awkwardness that she contented herself with calling it  he had at any rate ceased to be all day long in her eyes and this left something a little fresh for them to rest on of a sunday  during the three months of his happy survival at cockers after her consent to their engagement she had often asked herself what it was marriage would be able to add to a familiarity that seemed already to have scraped the platter so clean  opposite there behind the counter of which his superior stature his whiter apron his more clustering curls and more present too present hs had been for a couple of years the principal ornament he had moved to and fro before her as on the small sanded floor of their contracted future  she was conscious now of the improvement of not having to take her present and her future at once they were about as much as she could manage when taken separate  she had none the less to give her mind steadily to what mr mudge had again written her about the idea of her applying for a transfer to an office quite similarshe couldnt yet hope for a place in a biggerunder the very roof where he was foreman so that dangled before her every minute of the day he should see her as he called it hourly and in a part the far nw district where with her mother she would save on their two rooms alone nearly three shillings  it would be far from dazzling to exchange mayfair for chalk farm and it wore upon her much that he could never drop a subject still it didnt wear as things had worn the worries of the early times of their great misery her own her mothers and her elder sistersthe last of whom had succumbed to all but absolute want when as conscious and incredulous ladies suddenly bereft betrayed overwhelmed they had slipped faster and faster down the steep slope at the bottom of which she alone had rebounded  her mother had never rebounded any more at the bottom than on the way had only rumbled and grumbled down and down making in respect of caps topics and habits no effort whateverwhich simply meant smelling much of the time of whiskey     chapter ii   it was always rather quiet at cockers while the contingent from ladles and thrupps and all the other great places were at luncheon or as the young men used vulgarly to say while the animals were feeding  she had forty minutes in advance of this to go home for her own dinner and when she came back and one of the young men took his turn there was often half an hour during which she could pull out a bit of work or a booka book from the place where she borrowed novels very greasy in fine print and all about fine folks at a hapenny a day  this sacred pause was one of the numerous ways in which the establishment kept its finger on the pulse of fashion and fell into the rhythm of the larger life  it had something to do one day with the particular flare of importance of an arriving customer a lady whose meals were apparently irregular yet whom she was destined she afterwards found not to forget  the girl was blasee nothing could belong more as she perfectly knew to the intense publicity of her profession but she had a whimsical mind and wonderful nerves she was subject in short to sudden flickers of antipathy and sympathy red gleams in the grey fitful needs to notice and to care odd caprices of curiosity  she had a friend who had invented a new career for womenthat of being in and out of peoples houses to look after the flowers  mrs jordan had a manner of her own of sounding this allusion the flowers on her lips were in fantastic places in happy homes as usual as the coals or the daily papers  she took charge of them at any rate in all the rooms at so much a month and people were quickly finding out what it was to make over this strange burden of the pampered to the widow of a clergyman  the widow on her side dilating on the initiations thus opened up to her had been splendid to her young friend over the way she was made free of the greatest housesthe way especially when she did the dinnertables set out so often for twenty she felt that a single step more would transform her whole social position  on its being asked of her then if she circulated only in a sort of tropical solitude with the upper servants for picturesque natives and on her having to assent to this glance at her limitations she had found a reply to the girls invidious question  youve no imagination my dearthat was because a door more than half open to the higher life couldnt be called anything but a thin partition  mrs jordans imagination quite did away with the thickness  our young lady had not taken up the charge had dealt with it goodhumouredly just because she knew so well what to think of it  it was at once one of her most cherished complaints and most secret supports that people didnt understand her and it was accordingly a matter of indifference to her that mrs jordan shouldnt even though mrs jordan handed down from their early twilight of gentility and also the victim of reverses was the only member of her circle in whom she recognised an equal  she was perfectly aware that her imaginative life was the life in which she spent most of her time and she would have been ready had it been at all worth while to contend that since her outward occupation didnt kill it it must be strong indeed  combinations of flowers and greenstuff forsooth  what she could handle freely she said to herself was combinations of men and women  the only weakness in her faculty came from the positive abundance of her contact with the human herd this was so constant it had so the effect of cheapening her privilege that there were long stretches in which inspiration divination and interest quite dropped  the great thing was the flashes the quick revivals absolute accidents all and neither to be counted on nor to be resisted  some one had only sometimes to put in a penny for a stamp and the whole thing was upon her  she was so absurdly constructed that these were literally the moments that made upmade up for the long stiffness of sitting there in the stocks made up for the cunning hostility of mr buckton and the importunate sympathy of the counterclerk made up for the daily deadly flourishy letter from mr mudge made up even for the most haunting of her worries the rage at moments of not knowing how her mother did get it  she had surrendered herself moreover of late to a certain expansion of her consciousness something that seemed perhaps vulgarly accounted for by the fact that as the blast of the season roared louder and the waves of fashion tossed their spray further over the counter there were more impressions to be gathered and reallyfor it came to thatmore life to be led  definite at any rate it was that by the time may was well started the kind of company she kept at cockers had begun to strike her as a reasona reason she might almost put forward for a policy of procrastination  it sounded silly of course as yet to plead such a motive especially as the fascination of the place was after all a sort of torment  but she liked her torment it was a torment she should miss at chalk farm  she was ingenious and uncandid therefore about leaving the breadth of london a little longer between herself and that austerity if she hadnt quite the courage in short to say to mr mudge that her actual chance for a play of mind was worth any week the three shillings he desired to help her to save she yet saw something happen in the course of the month that in her heart of hearts at least answered the subtle question  this was connected precisely with the appearance of the memorable lady     chapter iii   she pushed in three bescribbled forms which the girls hand was quick to appropriate mr buckton having so frequent a perverse instinct for catching first any eye that promised the sort of entertainment with which she had her peculiar affinity  the amusements of captives are full of a desperate contrivance and one of our young friends hapennyworths had been the charming tale of picciola  it was of course the law of the place that they were never to take no notice as mr buckton said whom they served but this also never prevented certainly on the same gentlemans own part what he was fond of describing as the underhand game  both her companions for that matter made no secret of the number of favourites they had among the ladies sweet familiarities in spite of which she had repeatedly caught each of them in stupidities and mistakes confusions of identity and lapses of observation that never failed to remind her how the cleverness of men ends where the cleverness of women begins

cissy  that was the second  the third the girl noted when she took it was on a foreign form everard hotel brighton paris  only understand and believe  22nd to 26th and certainly 8th and 9th  perhaps others  come  mary  mary was very handsome the handsomest woman she felt in a moment she had ever seenor perhaps it was only cissy  perhaps it was both for she had seen stranger things than thatladies wiring to different persons under different names  she had seen all sorts of things and pieced together all sorts of mysteries  there had once been onenot long beforewho without winking sent off five over five different signatures  perhaps these represented five different friends who had asked herall women just as perhaps now mary and cissy or one or other of them were wiring by deputy  sometimes she put in too muchtoo much of her own sense sometimes she put in too little and in either case this often came round to her afterwards for she had an extraordinary way of keeping clues  when she noticed she noticed that was what it came to  there were days and days there were weeks sometimes of vacancy this arose often from mr bucktons devilish and successful subterfuges for keeping her at the sounder whenever it looked as if anything might arouse the sounder which it was equally his business to mind being the innermost cell of captivity a cage within the cage fenced oft from the rest by a frame of ground glass  the counterclerk would have played into her hands but the counterclerk was really reduced to idiocy by the effect of his passion for her  she flattered herself moreover nobly that with the unpleasant conspicuity of this passion she would never have consented to be obliged to him  the most she would ever do would be always to shove off on him whenever she could the registration of letters a job she happened particularly to loathe  after the long stupors at all events there almost always suddenly would come a sharp taste of something it was in her mouth before she knew it it was in her mouth now  to cissy to mary whichever it was she found her curiosity going out with a rush a mute effusion that floated back to her like a returning tide the living colour and splendour of the beautiful head the light of eyes that seemed to reflect such utterly other things than the mean things actually before them and above all the high curt consideration of a manner that even at bad moments was a magnificent habit and of the very essence of the innumerable thingsher beauty her birth her father and mother her cousins and all her ancestorsthat its possessor couldnt have got rid of even had she wished  how did our obscure little public servant know that for the lady of the telegrams this was a bad moment  how did she guess all sorts of impossible things such as almost on the very spot the presence of drama at a critical stage and the nature of the tie with the gentleman at the hotel brighton  more than ever before it floated to her through the bars of the cage that this at last was the high reality the bristling truth that she had hitherto only patched up and eked outone of the creatures in fine in whom all the conditions for happiness actually met and who in the air they made bloomed with an unwitting insolence  what came home to the girl was the way the insolence was tempered by something that was equally a part of the distinguished life the custom of a flowerlike bend to the less fortunatea dropped fragrance a mere quick breath but which in fact pervaded and lingered  the apparition was very young but certainly married and our fatigued friend had a sufficient store of mythological comparison to recognise the port of juno  marguerite might be awful but she knew how to dress a goddess  pearls and spanish laceshe herself with assurance could see them and the full length too and also red velvet bows which disposed on the lace in a particular manner she could have placed them with the turn of a hand were of course to adorn the front of a black brocade that would be like a dress in a picture  however neither marguerite nor lady agnes nor haddon nor fritz nor gussy was what the wearer of this garment had really come in for  she had come in for everardand that was doubtless not his true name either  if our young lady had never taken such jumps before it was simply that she had never before been so affected  she went all the way  mary and cissy had been round together in their single superb person to see himhe must live round the corner they had found that in consequence of something they had come precisely to make up for or to have another scene about he had gone offgone off just on purpose to make them feel it on which they had come together to cockers as to the nearest place where they had put in the three forms partly in order not to put in the one alone  the two others in a manner covered it muffled it passed it off  oh yes she went all the way and this was a specimen of how she often went  she would know the hand again any time  it was as handsome and as everything else as the woman herself the woman herself had on learning his flight pushed past everards servant and into his room she had written her missive at his table and with his pen  all this every inch of it came in the waft that she blew through and left behind her the influence that as i have said lingered  and among the things the girl was sure of happily was that she should see her again     chapter iv   she saw her in fact and only ten days later but this time not alone and that was exactly a part of the luck of it  not unawareas how could her observation have left her soof the possibilities through which it could range our young lady had ever since had in her mind a dozen conflicting theories about everards type as to which the instant they came into the place she felt the point settled with a thump that seemed somehow addressed straight to her heart  that organ literally beat faster at the approach of the gentleman who was this time with cissy and who as seen from within the cage became on the spot the happiest of the happy circumstances with which her mind had invested the friend of fritz and gussy  he was a very happy circumstance indeed as with his cigarette in his lips and his broken familiar talk caught by his companion he put down the halfdozen telegrams it would take them together several minutes to dispatch  and here it occurred oddly enough that if shortly before the girls interest in his companion had sharpened her sense for the messages then transmitted her immediate vision of himself had the effect while she counted his seventy words of preventing intelligibility  his words were mere numbers they told her nothing whatever and after he had gone she was in possession of no name of no address of no meaning of nothing but a vague sweet sound and an immense impression  he had been there but five minutes he had smoked in her face and busy with his telegrams with the tapping pencil and the conscious danger the odious betrayal that would come from a mistake she had had no wandering glances nor roundabout arts to spare  yet she had taken him in she knew everything she had made up her mind  he had come back from paris everything was rearranged the pair were again shoulder to shoulder in their high encounter with life their large and complicated game  the fine soundless pulse of this game was in the air for our young woman while they remained in the shop  while they remained  they remained all day their presence continued and abode with her was in everything she did till nightfall in the thousands of other words she counted she transmitted in all the stamps she detached and the letters she weighed and the change she gave equally unconscious and unerring in each of these particulars and not as the run on the little office thickened with the afternoon hours looking up at a single ugly face in the long sequence nor really hearing the stupid questions that she patiently and perfectly answered  all patience was possible now all questions were stupid after his all faces were ugly  she had been sure she should see the lady again and even now she should perhaps she should probably see her often  but for him it was totally different she should never never see him  she wanted it too much  there was a kind of wanting that helpedshe had arrived with her rich experience at that generalisation and there was another kind that was fatal  it was this time the fatal kind it would prevent  well she saw him the very next day and on this second occasion it was quite different the sense of every syllable he paid for was fiercely distinct she indeed felt her progressive pencil dabbing as if with a quick caress the marks of his own put life into every stroke  he was there a long timehad not brought his forms filled out but worked them off in a nook on the counter and there were other people as wella changing pushing cluster with every one to mind at once and endless right change to make and information to produce  but she kept hold of him throughout she continued for herself in a relation with him as close as that in which behind the hated ground glass mr buckton luckily continued with the sounder  this morning everything changed but rather to dreariness she had to swallow the rebuff to her theory about fatal desires which she did without confusion and indeed with absolute levity yet if it was now flagrant that he did live close at handat park chambersand belonged supremely to the class that wired everything even their expensive feelings so that as he never wrote his correspondence cost him weekly pounds and pounds and he might be in and out five times a day there was all the same involved in the prospect and by reason of its positive excess of light a perverse melancholy a gratuitous misery  this was at once to give it a place in an order of feelings on which i shall presently touch  meanwhile for a month he was very constant  cissy mary never reappeared with him he was always either alone or accompanied only by some gentleman who was lost in the blaze of his glory  there was another sense howeverand indeed there was more than onein which she mostly found herself counting in the splendid creature with whom she had originally connected him  he addressed this correspondent neither as mary nor as cissy but the girl was sure of whom it was in eaten square that he was perpetually wiring toand all so irreproachablyas lady bradeen  lady bradeen was cissy lady bradeen was mary lady bradeen was the friend of fritz and of gussy the customer of marguerite and the close ally in short as was ideally right only the girl had not yet found a descriptive term that was of the most magnificent of men nothing could equal the frequency and variety of his communications to her ladyship but their extraordinary their abysmal propriety  it was just the talkso profuse sometimes that she wondered what was left for their real meetingsof the very happiest people  their real meetings must have been constant for half of it was appointments and allusions all swimming in a sea of other allusions still tangled in a complexity of questions that gave a wondrous image of their life  if lady bradeen was juno it was all certainly olympian  if the girl missing the answers her ladyships own outpourings vainly reflected that cockers should have been one of the bigger offices where telegrams arrived as well as departed there were yet ways in which on the whole she pressed the romance closer by reason of the very quantity of imagination it demanded and consumed  the days and hours of this new friend as she came to account him were at all events unrolled and however much more she might have known she would still have wished to go beyond  in fact she did go beyond she went quite far enough  but she could none the less even after a month scarce have told if the gentlemen who came in with him recurred or changed and this in spite of the fact that they too were always posting and wiring smoking in her face and signing or not signing  the gentlemen who came in with him were nothing when he was there  they turned up alone at other timesthen only perhaps with a dim richness of reference  he himself absent as well as present was all  he was very tall very fair and had in spite of his thick preoccupations a goodhumour that was exquisite particularly as it so often had the effect of keeping him on  he could have reached over anybody and anybodyno matter whowould have let him but he was so extraordinarily kind that he quite pathetically waited never waggling things at her out of his turn nor saying here with horrid sharpness  he waited for pottering old ladies for gaping slaveys for the perpetual buttonses from thrupps and the thing in all this that she would have liked most unspeakably to put to the test was the possibility of her having for him a personal identity that might in a particular way appeal  there were moments when he actually struck her as on her side as arranging to help to support to spare her  but such was the singular spirit of our young friend that she could remind herself with a pang that when people had awfully good mannerspeople of that classyou couldnt tell  these manners were for everybody and it might be drearily unavailing for any poor particular body to be overworked and unusual  what he did take for granted was all sorts of facility and his high pleasantness his relighting of cigarettes while he waited his unconscious bestowal of opportunities of boons of blessings were all a part of his splendid security the instinct that told him there was nothing such an existence as his could ever lose by  he was somehow all at once very bright and very grave very young and immensely complete and whatever he was at any moment it was always as much as all the rest the mere bloom of his beatitude  he was sometimes everard as he had been at the hotel brighton and he was sometimes captain everard  he was sometimes philip with his surname and sometimes philip without it  in some directions he was merely phil in others he was merely captain  there were relations in which he was none of these things but a quite different personthe count  there were several friends for whom he was william  there were several for whom in allusion perhaps to his complexion he was the pink un  once once only by good luck he had coinciding comically quite miraculously with another person also near to her been mudge  yes whatever he was it was a part of his happinesswhatever he was and probably whatever he wasnt  and his happiness was a partit became so little by littleof something that almost from the first of her being at cockers had been deeply with the girl     chapter v   this was neither more nor less than the queer extension of her experience the double life that in the cage she grew at last to lead as the weeks went on there she lived more and more into the world of whiffs and glimpses she found her divinations work faster and stretch further  it was a prodigious view as the pressure heightened a panorama fed with facts and figures flushed with a torrent of colour and accompanied with wondrous worldmusic  what it mainly came to at this period was a picture of how london could amuse itself and that with the running commentary of a witness so exclusively a witness turned for the most part to a hardening of the heart  the nose of this observer was brushed by the bouquet yet she could never really pluck even a daisy what could still remain fresh in her daily grind was the immense disparity the difference and contrast from class to class of every instant and every motion  there were times when all the wires in the country seemed to start from the little holeandcorner where she plied for a livelihood and where in the shuffle of feet the flutter of forms the straying of stamps and the ring of change over the counter the people she had fallen into the habit of remembering and fitting together with others and of having her theories and interpretations of kept up before her their long procession and rotation  what twisted the knife in her vitals was the way the profligate rich scattered about them in extravagant chatter over their extravagant pleasures and sins an amount of money that would have held the stricken household of her frightened childhood her poor pinched mother and tormented father and lost brother and starved sister together for a lifetime  during her first weeks she had often gasped at the sums people were willing to pay for the stuff they transmittedthe much loves the awful regrets the compliments and wonderments and vain vague gestures that cost the price of a new pair of boots  she had had a way then of glancing at the peoples faces but she had early learnt that if you became a telegraphist you soon ceased to be astonished  her eye for types amounted nevertheless to genius and there were those she liked and those she hated her feeling for the latter of which grew to a positive possession an instinct of observation and detection  there were the brazen women as she called them of the higher and the lower fashion whose squanderings and graspings whose struggles and secrets and love affairs and lies she tracked and stored up against them till she had at moments in private a triumphant vicious feeling of mastery and ease a sense of carrying their silly guilty secrets in her pocket her small retentive brain and thereby knowing so much more about them than they suspected or would care to think  there were those she would have liked to betray to trip up to bring down with words altered and fatal and all through a personal hostility provoked by the lightest signs by their accidents of tone and manner by the particular kind of relation she always happened instantly to feel  there were impulses of various kinds alternately soft and severe to which she was constitutionally accessible and which were determined by the smallest accidents  she was rigid in general on the article of making the public itself affix its stamps and found a special enjoyment in dealing to that end with some of the ladies who were too grand to touch them  she had thus a play of refinement and subtlety greater she flattered herself than any of which she could be made the subject and though most people were too stupid to be conscious of this it brought her endless small consolations and revenges  she recognised quite as much those of her sex whom she would have liked to help to warn to rescue to see more of and that alternative as well operated exactly through the hazard of personal sympathy her vision for silver threads and moonbeams and her gift for keeping the clues and finding her way in the tangle  the moonbeams and silver threads presented at moments all the vision of what poor she might have made of happiness  blurred and blank as the whole thing often inevitably or mercifully became she could still through crevices and crannies be stupefied especially by what in spite of all seasoning touched the sorest place in her consciousness the revelation of the golden shower flying about without a gleam of gold for herself  it remained prodigious to the end the money her fine friends were able to spend to get still more or even to complain to fine friends of their own that they were in want  the pleasures they proposed were equalled only by those they declined and they made their appointments often so expensively that she was left wondering at the nature of the delights to which the mere approaches were so paved with shillings  she quivered on occasion into the perception of this and that one whom she would on the chance have just simply liked to be  her conceit her baffled vanity was possibly monstrous she certainly often threw herself into a defiant conviction that she would have done the whole thing much better  but her greatest comfort mostly was her comparative vision of the men by whom i mean the unmistakeable gentlemen for she had no interest in the spurious or the shabby and no mercy at all for the poor  she could have found a sixpence outside for an appearance of want but her fancy in some directions so alert had never a throb of response for any sign of the sordid  the men she did track moreover she tracked mainly in one relation the relation as to which the cage convinced her she believed more than anything else could have done that it was quite the most diffused  she found her ladies in short almost always in communication with her gentlemen and her gentlemen with her ladies and she read into the immensity of their intercourse stories and meanings without end incontestably she grew to think that the men cut the best figure and in this particular as in many others she arrived at a philosophy of her own all made up of her private notations and cynicisms  it was a striking part of the business for example that it was much more the women on the whole who were after the men than the men who were after the women it was literally visible that the general attitude of the one sex was that of the object pursued and defensive apologetic and attenuating while the light of her own nature helped her more or less to conclude as to the attitude of the other  perhaps she herself a little even fell into the custom of pursuit in occasionally deviating only for gentlemen from her high rigour about the stamps  she had early in the day made up her mind in fine that they had the best manners and if there were none of them she noticed when captain everard was there there were plenty she could place and trace and name at other times plenty who with their way of being nice to her and of handling as if their pockets were private tills loose mixed masses of silver and gold were such pleasant appearances that she could envy them without dislike they never had to give changethey only had to get it  they ranged through every suggestion every shade of fortune which evidently included indeed lots of bad luck as well as of good declining even toward mr mudge and his bland firm thrift and ascending in wild signals and rocketflights almost to within hail of her highest standard  so from month to month she went on with them all through a thousand ups and downs and a thousand pangs and indifferences  what virtually happened was that in the shuffling herd that passed before her by far the greater part only passeda proportion but just appreciable stayed  most of the elements swam straight away lost themselves in the bottomless common and by so doing really kept the page clear  on the clearness therefore what she did retain stood sharply out she nipped and caught it turned it over and interwove it     chapter vi   she met mrs jordan when she could and learned from her more and more how the great people under her gentle shake and after going through everything with the mere shops were waking up to the gain of putting into the hands of a person of real refinement the question that the shop people spoke of so vulgarly as that of the floral decorations  the regular dealers in these decorations were all very well but there was a peculiar magic in the play of taste of a lady who had only to remember through whatever intervening dusk all her own little tables little bowls and little jars and little other arrangements and the wonderful thing she had made of the garden of the vicarage  this small domain which her young friend had never seen bloomed in mrs jordans discourse like a new eden and she converted the past into a bank of violets by the tone in which she said of course you always knew my one passion  she obviously met now at any rate a big contemporary need measured what it was rapidly becoming for people to feel they could trust her without a tremor  it brought them a peace thatduring the quarter of an hour before dinner in especialwas worth more to them than mere payment could express  mere payment none the less was tolerably prompt she engaged by the month taking over the whole thing and there was an evening on which in respect to our heroine she at last returned to the charge its growing and growing and i see that i must really divide the work one wants an associateof ones own kind dont you know  you know the look they want it all to haveof having come not from a florist but from one of themselves  well im sure you could give itbecause you are one  then we should win  therefore just come in with me  and leave the po  let the po simply bring you your letters  it would bring you lots youd see orders after a bit by the score  it was on this in due course that the great advantage again came up one seems to live again with ones own people  it had taken some little time after their having parted company in the tempest of their troubles and then in the glimmering dawn finally sighted each other again for each to admit that the other was in her private circle her only equal but the admission came when it did come with an honest groan and since equality was named each found much personal profit in exaggerating the others original grandeur  mrs jordan was ten years the older but her young friend was struck with the smaller difference this now made it had counted otherwise at the time when much more as a friend of her mothers the bereaved lady without a penny of provision and with stopgaps like their own all gone had across the sordid landing on which the opposite doors of the pair of scared miseries opened and to which they were bewilderedly bolted borrowed coals and umbrellas that were repaid in potatoes and postagestamps  it had been a questionable help at that time to ladies submerged floundering panting swimming for their lives that they were ladies but such an advantage could come up again in proportion as others vanished and it had grown very great by the time it was the only ghost of one they possessed  they had literally watched it take to itself a portion of the substance of each that had departed and it became prodigious now when they could talk of it together when they could look back at it across a desert of accepted derogation and when above all they could together work up a credulity about it that neither could otherwise work up  nothing was really so marked as that they felt the need to cultivate this legend much more after having found their feet and stayed their stomachs in the ultimate obscure than they had done in the upper air of mere frequent shocks  the thing they could now oftenest say to each other was that they knew what they meant and the sentiment with which all round they knew it was known had wellnigh amounted to a promise not again to fall apart  mrs jordan was at present fairly dazzling on the subject of the way that in the practice of her fairy art as she called it she more than peeped inshe penetrated  there was not a house of the great kindand it was of course only a question of those real homes of luxuryin which she was not at the rate such people now had things all over the place the girl felt before the picture the cold breath of disinheritance as much as she had ever felt it in the cage she knew moreover how much she betrayed this for the experience of poverty had begun in her life too early and her ignorance of the requirements of homes of luxury had grown with other active knowledge a depth of simplification  she had accordingly at first often found that in these colloquies she could only pretend she understood  educated as she had rapidly been by her chances at cockers there were still strange gaps in her learningshe could never like mrs jordan have found her way about one of the homes little by little however she had caught on above all in the light of what mrs jordans redemption had materially made of that lady giving her though the years and the struggles had naturally not straightened a feature an almost supereminent air  there were women in and out of cockers who were quite nice and who yet didnt look well whereas mrs jordan looked well and yet with her extraordinarily protrusive teeth was by no means quite nice  it would seem mystifyingly that it might really come from all the greatness she could live with  it was fine to hear her talk so often of dinners of twenty and of her doing as she said exactly as she liked with them  she spoke as if for that matter she invited the company  they simply give me the tableall the rest all the other effects come afterwards     chapter vii   then you do see them the girl again asked  mrs jordan hesitated and indeed the point had been ambiguous before do you mean the guests  her young friend cautious about an undue exposure of innocence was not quite sure  wellthe people who live there  lady ventnor  mrs bubb  lord rye  dear yes  why they like one  but does one personally know them our young lady went on since that was the way to speak  i mean socially dont you knowas you know me  theyre not so nice as you mrs jordan charmingly cried  but i shall see more and more of them  ah this was the old story  but how soon  why almost any day  of course mrs jordan honestly added theyre nearly always out  then why do they want flowers all over  oh that doesnt make any difference  mrs jordan was not philosophic she was just evidently determined it shouldnt make any  theyre awfully interested in my ideas and its inevitable they should meet me over them  her interlocutress was sturdy enough  what do you call your ideas  mrs jordans reply was fine  if you were to see me some day with a thousand tulips youd discover  a thousandthe girl gaped at such a revelation of the scale of it she felt for the instant fairly planted out  well but if in fact they never do meet you she none the less pessimistically insisted  never  they often doand evidently quite on purpose  we have grand long talks  there was something in our young lady that could still stay her from asking for a personal description of these apparitions that showed too starved a state  but while she considered she took in afresh the whole of the clergymans widow  mrs jordan couldnt help her teeth and her sleeves were a distinct rise in the world  a thousand tulips at a shilling clearly took one further than a thousand words at a penny and the betrothed of mr mudge in whom the sense of the race for life was always acute found herself wondering with a twinge of her easy jealousy if it mightnt after all then for her also be betterbetter than where she wasto follow some such scent  where she was was where mr bucktons elbow could freely enter her right side and the counter clerks breathinghe had something the matter with his nosepervade her left ear  it was something to fill an office under government and she knew but too well there were places commoner still than cockers but it needed no great range of taste to bring home to her the picture of servitude and promiscuity she couldnt but offer to the eye of comparative freedom  she was so boxed up with her young men and anything like a margin so absent that it needed more art than she should ever possess to pretend in the least to compass with any one in the nature of an acquaintancesay with mrs jordan herself flying in as it might happen to wire sympathetically to mrs bubban approach to a relation of elegant privacy  she remembered the day when mrs jordan had in fact by the greatest chance come in with fiftythree words for lord rye and a fivepound note to change  this had been the dramatic manner of their reuniontheir mutual recognition was so great an event the girl could at first only see her from the waist up besides making but little of her long telegram to his lordship  it was a strange whirligig that had converted the clergymans widow into such a specimen of the class that went beyond the sixpence  nothing of the occasion all the more had ever become dim least of all the way that as her recovered friend looked up from counting mrs jordan had just blown in explanation through her teeth and through the bars of the cage i do flowers you know  our young woman had always with her little finger crooked out a pretty movement for counting and she had not forgotten the small secret advantage a sharpness of triumph it might even have been called that fell upon her at this moment and avenged her for the incoherence of the message an unintelligible enumeration of numbers colours days hours  the correspondence of people she didnt know was one thing but the correspondence of people she did had an aspect of its own for her even when she couldnt understand it  the speech in which mrs jordan had defined a position and announced a profession was like a tinkle of bluebells but for herself her one idea about flowers was that people had them at funerals and her present sole gleam of light was that lords probably had them most  when she watched a minute later through the cage the swing of her visitors departing petticoats she saw the sight from the waist down and when the counterclerk after a mere male glance remarked with an intention unmistakeably low handsome woman she had for him the finest of her chills shes the widow of a bishop she always felt with the counterclerk that it was impossible sufficiently to put it on for what she wished to express to him was the maximum of her contempt and that element in her nature was confusedly stored  a bishop was putting it on but the counterclerks approaches were vile  the night after this when in the fulness of time mrs jordan mentioned the grand long talks the girl at last brought out should i see themi mean if i were to give up everything for you  mrs jordan at this became most arch  id send you to all the bachelors  our young lady could be reminded by such a remark that she usually struck her friend as pretty  do they have their flowers  oceans  and theyre the most particular  oh it was a wonderful world you should see lord ryes  his flowers  yes and his letters  he writes me pages on pageswith the most adorable little drawings and plans  you should see his diagrams     chapter viii   the girl had in course of time every opportunity to inspect these documents and they a little disappointed her but in the mean while there had been more talk and it had led to her saying as if her friends guarantee of a life of elegance were not quite definite well i see every one at my place  every one  lots of swells  they flock  they live you know all round and the place is filled with all the smart people all the fast people those whose names are in the papersmamma has still the morning postand who come up for the season  mrs jordan took this in with complete intelligence  yes and i dare say its some of your people that i do  her companion assented but discriminated  i doubt if you do them as much as i  their affairs their appointments and arrangements their little games and secrets and vicesthose things all pass before me  this was a picture that could make a clergymans widow not imperceptibly gasp it was in intention moreover something of a retort to the thousand tulips  their vices  have they got vices  our young critic even more overtly stared then with a touch of contempt in her amusement havent you found that out  the homes of luxury then hadnt so much to give  i find out everything  mrs jordan at bottom a very meek person was visibly struck  i see you do have them  oh i dont care  much good it does me  mrs jordan after an instant recovered her superiority  noit doesnt lead to much  her own initiations so clearly did  stillafter all and she was not jealous there must be a charm  in seeing them  at this the girl suddenly let herself go  i hate them  theres that charm  mrs jordan gaped again  the real smarts  is that what you call mrs bubb  yesit comes to me ive had mrs bubb  i dont think she has been in herself but there are things her maid has brought  well my dearand the young person from cockers recalling these things and summing them up seemed suddenly to have much to say  she didnt say it however she checked it she only brought out her maid whos horridshe must have her  then she went on with indifference theyre too real  theyre selfish brutes  mrs jordan turning it over adopted at last the plan of treating it with a smile  she wished to be liberal  well of course they do lay it out  they bore me to death her companion pursued with slightly more temperance  but this was going too far  ah thats because youve no sympathy  the girl gave an ironic laugh only retorting that nobody could have any who had to count all day all the words in the dictionary a contention mrs jordan quite granted the more that she shuddered at the notion of ever failing of the very gift to which she owed the voguethe rage she might call itthat had caught her up  without sympathyor without imagination for it came back again to thathow should she get for big dinners down the middle and toward the far corners at all  it wasnt the combinations which were easily managed the strain was over the ineffable simplicities those that the bachelors above all and lord rye perhaps most of any threw offjust blew off like cigarettepuffssuch sketches of  the betrothed of mr mudge at all events accepted the explanation which had the effect as almost any turn of their talk was now apt to have of bringing her round to the terrific question of that gentleman  she was tormented with the desire to get out of mrs jordan on this subject what she was sure was at the back of mrs jordans head and to get it out of her queerly enough if only to vent a certain irritation at it  she knew that what her friend would already have risked if she hadnt been timid and tortuous was give him upyes give him up youll see that with your sure chances youll be able to do much better  our young woman had a sense that if that view could only be put before her with a particular sniff for poor mr mudge she should hate it as much as she morally ought  she was conscious of not as yet hating it quite so much as that  but she saw that mrs jordan was conscious of something too and that there was a degree of confidence she was waiting little by little to arrive at  the day came when the girl caught a glimpse of what was still wanting to make her friend feel strong which was nothing less than the prospect of being able to announce the climax of sundry private dreams  the associate of the aristocracy had personal calculationsmatter for brooding and dreaming even for peeping out not quite hopelessly from behind the windowcurtains of lonely lodgings  if she did the flowers for the bachelors in short didnt she expect that to have consequences very different from such an outlook at cockers as she had pronounced wholly desperate  there seemed in very truth something auspicious in the mixture of bachelors and flowers though when looked hard in the eye mrs jordan was not quite prepared to say she had expected a positive proposal from lord rye to pop out of it  our young woman arrived at last none the less at a definite vision of what was in her mind  this was a vivid foreknowledge that the betrothed of mr mudge would unless conciliated in advance by a successful rescue almost hate her on the day she should break a particular piece of news how could that unfortunate otherwise endure to hear of what under the protection of lady ventnor was after all so possible     chapter ix   meanwhile since irritation sometimes relieved her the betrothed of mr mudge found herself indebted to that admirer for amounts of it perfectly proportioned to her fidelity  she always walked with him on sundays usually in the regents park and quite often once or twice a month he took her in the strand or thereabouts to see a piece that was having a run  the productions he always preferred were the really good onesshakespeare thompson or some funny american thing which as it also happened that she hated vulgar plays gave him ground for what was almost the fondest of his approaches the theory that their tastes were blissfully just the same  he was for ever reminding her of that rejoicing over it and being affectionate and wise about it  there were times when she wondered how in the world she could put up with him how she could put up with any man so smugly unconscious of the immensity of her difference  it was just for this difference that if she was to be liked at all she wanted to be liked and if that was not the source of mr mudges admiration she asked herself what on earth could be  she was not different only at one point she was different all round unless perhaps indeed in being practically human which her mind just barely recognised that he also was  she would have made tremendous concessions in other quarters there was no limit for instance to those she would have made to captain everard but what i have named was the most she was prepared to do for mr mudge  it was because he was different that in the oddest way she liked as well as deplored him which was after all a proof that the disparity should they frankly recognise it wouldnt necessarily be fatal  she felt that oleaginoustoo oleaginousas he was he was somehow comparatively primitive she had once during the portion of his time at cockers that had overlapped her own seen him collar a drunken soldier a big violent man who having come in with a mate to get a postalorder cashed had made a grab at the money before his friend could reach it and had so determined among the hams and cheeses and the lodgers from thrupps immediate and alarming reprisals a scene of scandal and consternation  mr buckton and the counterclerk had crouched within the cage but mr mudge had with a very quiet but very quick step round the counter an air of masterful authority she shouldnt soon forget triumphantly interposed in the scrimmage parted the combatants and shaken the delinquent in his skin  she had been proud of him at that moment and had felt that if their affair had not already been settled the neatness of his execution would have left her without resistance  their affair had been settled by other things by the evident sincerity of his passion and by the sense that his high white apron resembled a front of many floors  it had gone a great way with her that he would build up a business to his chin which he carried quite in the air  this could only be a question of time he would have all piccadilly in the pen behind his ear  that was a merit in itself for a girl who had known what she had known  there were hours at which she even found him goodlooking though frankly there could be no crown for her effort to imagine on the part of the tailor or the barber some such treatment of his appearance as would make him resemble even remotely a man of the world  his very beauty was the beauty of a grocer and the finest future would offer it none too much room consistently to develop  she had engaged herself in short to the perfection of a type and almost anything square and smooth and whole had its weight for a person still conscious herself of being a mere bruised fragment of wreckage  but it contributed hugely at present to carry on the two parallel lines of her experience in the cage and her experience out of it  after keeping quiet for some time about this opposition she suddenlyone sunday afternoon on a penny chair in the regents parkbroke for him capriciously bewilderingly into an intimation of what it came to  he had naturally pressed more and more on the point of her again placing herself where he could see her hourly and for her to recognise that she had as yet given him no sane reason for delay he had small need to describe himself as unable to make out what she was up to  as if with her absurd bad reasons she could have begun to tell him  sometimes she thought it would be amusing to let him have them full in the face for she felt she should die of him unless she once in a while stupefied him and sometimes she thought it would be disgusting and perhaps even fatal  she liked him however to think her silly for that gave her the margin which at the best she would always require and the only difficulty about this was that he hadnt enough imagination to oblige her  it produced none the less something of the desired effectto leave him simply wondering why over the matter of their reunion she didnt yield to his arguments  then at last simply as if by accident and out of mere boredom on a day that was rather flat she preposterously produced her own  well wait a bit  where i am i still see things  and she talked to him even worse if possible than she had talked to jordan  little by little to her own stupefaction she caught that he was trying to take it as she meant it and that he was neither astonished nor angry oh the british tradesmanthis gave her an idea of his resources  mr mudge would be angry only with a person who like the drunken soldier in the shop should have an unfavourable effect on business  he seemed positively to enter for the time and without the faintest flash of irony or ripple of laughter into the whimsical grounds of her enjoyment of cockers custom and instantly to be casting up whatever it might as mrs jordan had said lead to  what he had in mind was not of course what mrs jordan had had it was obviously not a source of speculation with him that his sweetheart might pick up a husband  she could see perfectly that this was not for a moment even what he supposed she herself dreamed of  what she had done was simply to give his sensibility another push into the dim vast of trade  in that direction it was all alert and she had whisked before it the mild fragrance of a connexion that was the most he could see in any account of her keeping in on whatever roundabout lines with the gentry and when getting to the bottom of this she quickly proceeded to show him the kind of eye she turned on such people and to give him a sketch of what that eye discovered she reduced him to the particular prostration in which he could still be amusing to her     chapter x   theyre the most awful wretches i assure youthe lot all about there  then why do you want to stay among them  my dear man just because they are  it makes me hate them so  hate them  i thought you liked them  dont be stupid  what i like is just to loathe them  you wouldnt believe what passes before my eyes  then why have you never told me  you didnt mention anything before i left  oh i hadnt got round to it then  its the sort of thing you dont believe at first you have to look round you a bit and then you understand  you work into it more and more  besides the girl went on this is the time of the year when the worst lot come up  theyre simply packed together in those smart streets  talk of the numbers of the poor what i can vouch for is the numbers of the rich  there are new ones every day and they seem to get richer and richer  oh they do come up she cried imitating for her private recreationshe was sure it wouldnt reach mr mudgethe low intonation of the counterclerk  and where do they come from her companion candidly enquired  she had to think a moment then she found something  from the spring meetings  they bet tremendously  well they bet enough at chalk farm if thats all  it isnt all  it isnt a millionth part she replied with some sharpness  its immense funshe had to tantalise him  then as she had heard mrs jordan say and as the ladies at cockers even sometimes wired its quite too dreadful  she could fully feel how it was mr mudges propriety which was extremehe had a horror of coarseness and attended a wesleyan chapelthat prevented his asking for details  but she gave him some of the more innocuous in spite of himself especially putting before him how at simpkins and ladles they all made the money fly  that was indeed what he liked to hear the connexion was not direct but one was somehow more in the right place where the money was flying than where it was simply and meagrely nesting  the air felt that stir he had to acknowledge much less at chalk farm than in the district in which his beloved so oddly enjoyed her footing  she gave him she could see a restless sense that these might be familiarities not to be sacrificed germs possibilities faint foreshowingsheaven knew whatof the initiation it would prove profitable to have arrived at when in the fulness of time he should have his own shop in some such paradise  what really touched himthat was discerniblewas that she could feed him with so much mere vividness of reminder keep before him as by the play of a fan the very wind of the swift banknotes and the charm of the existence of a class that providence had raised up to be the blessing of grocers  he liked to think that the class was there that it was always there and that she contributed in her slight but appreciable degree to keep it up to the mark  he couldnt have formulated his theory of the matter but the exuberance of the aristocracy was the advantage of trade and everything was knit together in a richness of pattern that it was good to follow with ones fingertips  it was a comfort to him to be thus assured that there were no symptoms of a drop  what did the sounder as she called it nimbly worked do but keep the ball going  what it came to therefore for mr mudge was that all enjoyments were as might be said interrelated and that the more people had the more they wanted to have  the more flirtations as he might roughly express it the more cheese and pickles  he had even in his own small way been dimly struck with the linked sweetness connecting the tender passion with cheap champagne or perhaps the other way round  what he would have liked to say had he been able to work out his thought to the end was i see i see  lash them up then lead them on keep them going some of it cant help some time coming our way  yet he was troubled by the suspicion of subtleties on his companions part that spoiled the straight view  he couldnt understand peoples hating what they liked or liking what they hated above all it hurt him somewherefor he had his private delicaciesto see anything but money made out of his betters  to be too enquiring or in any other way too free at the expense of the gentry was vaguely wrong the only thing that was distinctly right was to be prosperous at any price  wasnt it just because they were up there aloft that they were lucrative  he concluded at any rate by saying to his young friend if its improper for you to remain at cockers then that falls in exactly with the other reasons ive put before you for your removal  improperher smile became a prolonged boldness  my dear boy theres no one like you  i dare say he laughed but that doesnt help the question  well she returned i cant give up my friends  im making even more than mrs jordan  mr mudge considered  how much is she making  oh you dear donkeyand regardless of all the regents park she patted his cheek  this was the sort of moment at which she was absolutely tempted to tell him that she liked to be near park chambers there was a fascination in the idea of seeing if on a mention of captain everard he wouldnt do what she thought he might wouldnt weigh against the obvious objection the still more obvious advantage  the advantage of course could only strike him at the best as rather fantastic but it was always to the good to keep hold when you had hold and such an attitude would also after all involve a high tribute to her fidelity  of one thing she absolutely never doubted mr mudge believed in her with a belief  she believed in herself too for that matter if there was a thing in the world no one could charge her with it was being the kind of low barmaid person who rinsed tumblers and bandied slang  but she forbore as yet to speak she had not spoken even to mrs jordan and the hush that on her lips surrounded the captains name maintained itself as a kind of symbol of the success that up to this time had attended something or othershe couldnt have said whatthat she humoured herself with calling without words her relation with him     chapter xi   she would have admitted indeed that it consisted of little more than the fact that his absences however frequent and however long always ended with his turning up again  it was nobodys business in the world but her own if that fact continued to be enough for her  it was of course not enough just in itself what it had taken on to make it so was the extraordinary possession of the elements of his life that memory and attention had at last given her  there came a day when this possession on the girls part actually seemed to enjoy between them while their eyes met a tacit recognition that was half a joke and half a deep solemnity  he bade her good morning always now he often quite raised his hat to her  he passed a remark when there was time or room and once she went so far as to say to him that she hadnt seen him for ages ages was the word she consciously and carefully though a trifle tremulously used ages was exactly what she meant  to this he replied in terms doubtless less anxiously selected but perhaps on that account not the less remarkable oh yes hasnt it been awfully wet  that was a specimen of their give and take it fed her fancy that no form of intercourse so transcendent and distilled had ever been established on earth  everything so far as they chose to consider it so might mean almost anything  the want of margin in the cage when he peeped through the bars wholly ceased to be appreciable  it was a drawback only in superficial commerce  with captain everard she had simply the margin of the universe  it may be imagined therefore how their unuttered reference to all she knew about him could in this immensity play at its ease  every time he handed in a telegram it was an addition to her knowledge what did his constant smile mean to mark if it didnt mean to mark that  he never came into the place without saying to her in this manner oh yes you have me by this time so completely at your mercy that it doesnt in the least matter what i give you now  youve become a comfort i assure you  she had only two torments the greatest of which was that she couldnt not even once or twice touch with him on some individual fact  she would have given anything to have been able to allude to one of his friends by name to one of his engagements by date to one of his difficulties by the solution  she would have given almost as much for just the right chanceit would have to be tremendously rightto show him in some sharp sweet way that she had perfectly penetrated the greatest of these last and now lived with it in a kind of heroism of sympathy  he was in love with a woman to whom and to any view of whom a ladytelegraphist and especially one who passed a life among hams and cheeses was as the sand on the floor and what her dreams desired was the possibility of its somehow coming to him that her own interest in him could take a pure and noble account of such an infatuation and even of such an impropriety  as yet however she could only rub along with the hope that an accident sooner or later might give her a lift toward popping out with something that would surprise and perhaps even some fine day assist him  what could people mean moreovercheaply sarcastic peopleby not feeling all that could be got out of the weather  she felt it all and seemed literally to feel it most when she went quite wrong speaking of the stuffy days as cold of the cold ones as stuffy and betraying how little she knew in her cage of whether it was foul or fair  it was for that matter always stuffy at cockers and she finally settled down to the safe proposition that the outside element was changeable  anything seemed true that made him so radiantly assent  this indeed is a small specimen of her cultivation of insidious ways of making things easy for himways to which of course she couldnt be at all sure he did real justice  real justice was not of this world she had had too often to come back to that yet strangely happiness was and her traps had to be set for it in a manner to keep them unperceived by mr buckton and the counterclerk  the most she could hope for apart from the question which constantly flickered up and died down of the divine chance of his consciously liking her would be that without analysing it he should arrive at a vague sense that cockers waswell attractive easier smoother sociably brighter slightly more picturesque in short more propitious in general to his little affairs than any other establishment just thereabouts  she was quite aware that they couldnt be in so huddled a hole particularly quick but she found her account in the slownessshe certainly could bear it if he could the great pang was that just thereabouts postoffices were so awfully thick  she was always seeing him in imagination in other places and with other girls  but she would defy any other girl to follow him as she followed  and though they werent for so many reasons quick at cockers she could hurry for him when through an intimation light as air she gathered that he was pressed  when hurry was better still impossible it was because of the pleasantest thing of all the particular element of their contactshe would have called it their friendshipthat consisted of an almost humorous treatment of the look of some of his words  they would never perhaps have grown half so intimate if he had not by the blessing of heaven formed some of his letters with a queerness  it was positive that the queerness could scarce have been greater if he had practised it for the very purpose of bringing their heads together over it as far as was possible to heads on different sides of a wire fence  it had taken her truly but once or twice to master these tricks but at the cost of striking him perhaps as stupid she could still challenge them when circumstances favoured  the great circumstance that favoured was that she sometimes actually believed he knew she only feigned perplexity  if he knew it therefore he tolerated it if he tolerated it he came back and if he came back he liked her  this was her seventh heaven and she didnt ask much of his likingshe only asked of it to reach the point of his not going away because of her own  he had at times to be away for weeks he had to lead lets life he had to travelthere were places to which he was constantly wiring for rooms all this she granted him forgave him in fact in the long run literally blessed and thanked him for  if he had to lead his life that precisely fostered his leading it so much by telegraph therefore the benediction was to come in when he could  that was all she askedthat he shouldnt wholly deprive her  sometimes she almost felt that he couldnt have deprived her even had he been minded by reason of the web of revelation that was woven between them  she quite thrilled herself with thinking what with such a lot of material a bad girl would do  it would be a scene better than many in her hapenny novels this going to him in the dusk of evening at park chambers and letting him at last have it  i know too much about a certain person now not to put it to youexcuse my being so luridthat its quite worth your while to buy me off  come therefore buy me there was a point indeed at which such flights had to drop againthe point of an unreadiness to name when it came to that the purchasing medium  it wouldnt certainly be anything so gross as money and the matter accordingly remained rather vague all the more that she was not a bad girl  it wasnt for any such reason as might have aggravated a mere minx that she often hoped he would again bring cissy  the difficulty of this however was constantly present to her for the kind of communion to which cockers so richly ministered rested on the fact that cissy and he were so often in different places  she knew by this time all the placessuchbury monkhouse whiteroy finchesand even how the parties on these occasions were composed but her subtlety found ways to make her knowledge fairly protect and promote their keeping as she had heard mrs jordan say in touch  so when he actually sometimes smiled as if he really felt the awkwardness of giving her again one of the same old addresses all her being went out in the desirewhich her face must have expressedthat he should recognise her forbearance to criticise as one of the finest tenderest sacrifices a woman had ever made for love     chapter xii   she was occasionally worried however this might be by the impression that these sacrifices great as they were were nothing to those that his own passion had imposed if indeed it was not rather the passion of his confederate which had caught him up and was whirling him round like a great steamwheel  he was at any rate in the strong grip of a dizzy splendid fate the wild wind of his life blew him straight before it didnt she catch in his face at times even through his smile and his happy habit the gleam of that pale glare with which a bewildered victim appeals as he passes to some pair of pitying eyes  he perhaps didnt even himself know how scared he was but she knew  they were in danger they were in danger captain everard and lady bradeen it beat every novel in the shop  she thought of mr mudge and his safe sentiment she thought of herself and blushed even more for her tepid response to it  it was a comfort to her at such moments to feel that in another relationa relation supplying that affinity with her nature that mr mudge deluded creature would never supplyshe should have been no more tepid than her ladyship  her deepest soundings were on two or three occasions of finding herself almost sure that if she dared her ladyships lover would have gathered relief from speaking to her  she literally fancied once or twice that projected as he was toward his doom her own eyes struck him while the air roared in his ears as the one pitying pair in the crowd  but how could he speak to her while she sat sandwiched there between the counterclerk and the sounder  she had long ago in her comings and goings made acquaintance with park chambers and reflected as she looked up at their luxurious front that they of course would supply the ideal setting for the ideal speech  there was not an object in london that before the season was over was more stamped upon her brain  she went roundabout to pass it for it was not on the short way she passed on the opposite side of the street and always looked up though it had taken her a long time to be sure of the particular set of windows  she had made that out finally by an act of audacity that at the time had almost stopped her heartbeats and that in retrospect greatly quickened her blushes  one evening she had lingered late and watchedwatched for some moment when the porter who was in uniform and often on the steps had gone in with a visitor  then she followed boldly on the calculation that he would have taken the visitor up and that the hall would be free  the hall was free and the electric light played over the gilded and lettered board that showed the names and numbers of the occupants of the different floors  what she wanted looked straight at hercaptain everard was on the third  it was as if in the immense intimacy of this they were for the instant and the first time face to face outside the cage  alas they were face to face but a second or two she was whirled out on the wings of a panic fear that he might just then be entering or issuing  this fear was indeed in her shameless deflexions never very far from her and was mixed in the oddest way with depressions and disappointments  it was dreadful as she trembled by to run the risk of looking to him as if she basely hung about and yet it was dreadful to be obliged to pass only at such moments as put an encounter out of the question  at the horrible hour of her first coming to cockers he was alwaysit was to be hopedsnug in bed and at the hour of her final departure he was of courseshe had such things all on her fingersendsdressing for dinner  we may let it pass that if she couldnt bring herself to hover till he was dressed this was simply because such a process for such a person could only be terribly prolonged  when she went in the middle of the day to her own dinner she had too little time to do anything but go straight though it must be added that for a real certainty she would joyously have omitted the repast  she had made up her mind as to there being on the whole no decent pretext to justify her flitting casually past at three oclock in the morning  that was the hour at which if the hapenny novels were not all wrong he probably came home for the night she was therefore reduced to the vainest figuration of the miraculous meeting toward which a hundred impossibilities would have to conspire but if nothing was more impossible than the fact nothing was more intense than the vision  what may not we can only moralise take place in the quickened muffled perception of a young person with an ardent soul  all our humble friends native distinction her refinement of personal grain of heredity of pride took refuge in this small throbbing spot for when she was most conscious of the objection of her vanity and the pitifulness of her little flutters and manoeuvres then the consolation and the redemption were most sure to glow before her in some just discernible sign  he did like her     chapter xiii   he never brought cissy back but cissy came one day without him as fresh as before from the hands of marguerite or only at the seasons end a trifle less fresh  she was however distinctly less serene  she had brought nothing with her and looked about with impatience for the forms and the place to write  the latter convenience at cockers was obscure and barely adequate and her clear voice had the light note of disgust which her lovers never showed as she responded with a there of surprise to the gesture made by the counterclerk in answer to her sharp question  our young friend was busy with half a dozen people but she had dispatched them in her most businesslike manner by the time her ladyship flung through the bars this light of reappearance  then the directness with which the girl managed to receive the accompanying missive was the result of the concentration that had caused her to make the stamps fly during the few minutes occupied by the production of it this concentration in turn may be described as the effect of the apprehension of imminent relief  it was nineteen days counted and checked off since she had seen the object of her homage and as had he been in london she should with his habits have been sure to see him often she was now about to learn what other spot his presence might just then happen to sanctify  for she thought of them the other spots as ecstatically conscious of it expressively happy in it  but gracious how handsome was her ladyship and what an added price it gave him that the air of intimacy he threw out should have flowed originally from such a source  the girl looked straight through the cage at the eyes and lips that must so often have been so near as ownlooked at them with a strange passion that for an instant had the result of filling out some of the gaps supplying the missing answers in his correspondence  then as she made out that the features she thus scanned and associated were totally unaware of it that they glowed only with the colour of quite other and not at all guessable thoughts this directly added to their splendour gave the girl the sharpest impression she had yet received of the uplifted the unattainable plains of heaven and yet at the same time caused her to thrill with a sense of the high company she did somehow keep  she was with the absent through her ladyship and with her ladyship through the absent  the only pangbut it didnt matterwas the proof in the admirable face in the sightless preoccupation of its possessor that the latter hadnt a notion of her her folly had gone to the point of half believing that the other party to the affair must sometimes mention in eaton square the extraordinary little person at the place from which he so often wired  yet the perception of her visitors blankness actually helped this extraordinary little person the next instant to take refuge in a reflexion that could be as proud as it liked  how little she knows how little she knows the girl cried to herself for what did that show after all but that captain everards telegraphic confidant was captain everards charming secret  our young friends perusal of her ladyships telegram was literally prolonged by a momentary daze what swam between her and the words making her see them as through rippled shallow sunshot water was the great the perpetual flood of how much i knowhow much i know this produced a delay in her catching that on the face these words didnt give her what she wanted though she was prompt enough with her remembrance that her grasp was half the time just of what was not on the face  miss dolman parade lodge parade terrace dover  let him instantly know right one hotel de france ostend  make it seven nine four nine six one  wire me alternative burfields  the girl slowly counted  then he was at ostend  this hooked on with so sharp a click that not to feel she was as quickly letting it all slip from her she had absolutely to hold it a minute longer and to do something to that end  thus it was that she did on this occasion what she never didthrew off a reply paid that sounded officious but that she partly made up for by deliberately affixing the stamps and by waiting till she had done so to give change  she had for so much coolness the strength that she considered she knew all about miss dolman  yespaid  she saw all sorts of things in this reply even to a small suppressed start of surprise at so correct an assumption even to an attempt the next minute at a fresh air of detachment  how much with the answer  the calculation was not abstruse but our intense observer required a moment more to make it and this gave her ladyship time for a second thought  oh just wait  the white begemmed hand bared to write rose in sudden nervousness to the side of the wonderful face which with eyes of anxiety for the paper on the counter she brought closer to the bars of the cage  i think i must alter a word  on this she recovered her telegram and looked over it again but she had a new an obvious trouble and studied it without deciding and with much of the effect of making our young woman watch her  this personage meanwhile at the sight of her expression had decided on the spot  if she had always been sure they were in danger her ladyships expression was the best possible sign of it  there was a word wrong but she had lost the right one and much clearly depended on her finding it again  the girl therefore sufficiently estimating the affluence of customers and the distraction of mr buckton and the counterclerk took the jump and gave it  isnt it coopers  it was as if she had bodily leapedcleared the top of the cage and alighted on her interlocutress  coopersthe stare was heightened by a blush  yes she had made juno blush  this was all the greater reason for going on  i mean instead of burfields  our young friend fairly pitied her she had made her in an instant so helpless and yet not a bit haughty nor outraged  she was only mystified and scared  oh you know  yes i know  our young friend smiled meeting the others eyes and having made juno blush proceeded to patronise her  ill do itshe put out a competent hand  her ladyship only submitted confused and bewildered all presence of mind quite gone and the next moment the telegram was in the cage again and its author out of the shop  then quickly boldly under all the eyes that might have witnessed her tampering the extraordinary little person at cockers made the proper change  people were really too giddy and if they were in a certain case to be caught it shouldnt be the fault of her own grand memory hadnt it been settled weeks beforefor miss dolman it was always to be coopers     chapter xiv   but the summer holidays brought a marked difference they were holidays for almost every one but the animals in the cage  the august days were flat and dry and with so little to feed it she was conscious of the ebb of her interest in the secrets of the refined  she was in a position to follow the refined to the extent of knowingthey had made so many of their arrangements with her aidexactly where they were yet she felt quite as if the panorama had ceased unrolling and the band stopped playing  a stray member of the latter occasionally turned up but the communications that passed before her bore now largely on rooms at hotels prices of furnished houses hours of trains dates of sailings and arrangements for being met she found them for the most part prosaic and coarse  the only thing was that they brought into her stuffy corner as straight a whiff of alpine meadows and scotch moors as she might hope ever to inhale there were moreover in especial fat hot dull ladies who had out with her to exasperation the terms for seaside lodgings which struck her as huge and the matter of the number of beds required which was not less portentous this in reference to places of which the nameseastbourne folkestone cromer scarborough whitbytormented her with something of the sound of the plash of water that haunts the traveller in the desert  she had not been out of london for a dozen years and the only thing to give a taste to the present dead weeks was the spice of a chronic resentment  the sparse customers the people she did see were the people who were just offoff on the decks of fluttered yachts off to the uttermost point of rocky headlands where the very breeze was then playing for the want of which she said to herself that she sickened  there was accordingly a sense in which at such a period the great differences of the human condition could press upon her more than ever a circumstance drawing fresh force in truth from the very fact of the chance that at last for a change did squarely meet herthe chance to be off for a bit almost as far as anybody  they took their turns in the cage as they took them both in the shop and at chalk farm she had known these two months that time was to be allowed in septemberno less than eleven daysfor her personal private holiday  much of her recent intercourse with mr mudge had consisted of the hopes and fears expressed mainly by himself involved in the question of their getting the same datesa question that in proportion as the delight seemed assured spread into a sea of speculation over the choice of where and how  all through july on the sunday evenings and at such other odd times as he could seize he had flooded their talk with wild waves of calculation  it was practically settled that with her mother somewhere on the south coast a phrase of which she liked the sound they should put in their allowance together but she already felt the prospect quite weary and worn with the way he went round and round on it  it had become his sole topic the theme alike of his most solemn prudences and most placid jests to which every opening led for return and revision and in which every little flower of a foretaste was pulled up as soon as planted  he had announced at the earliest daycharacterising the whole business from that moment as their plans under which name he handled it as a syndicate handles a chinese or other loanhe had promptly declared that the question must be thoroughly studied and he produced on the whole subject from day to day an amount of information that excited her wonder and even not a little as she frankly let him know her disdain  when she thought of the danger in which another pair of lovers rapturously lived she enquired of him anew why he could leave nothing to chance  then she got for answer that this profundity was just his pride and he pitted ramsgate against bournemouth and even boulogne against jerseyfor he had great ideaswith all the mastery of detail that was some day professionally to carry him afar  the longer the time since she had seen captain everard the more she was booked as she called it to pass park chambers and this was the sole amusement that in the lingering august days and the twilights sadly drawn out it was left her to cultivate  she had long since learned to know it for a feeble one though its feebleness was perhaps scarce the reason for her saying to herself each evening as her time for departure approached no nonot tonight  she never failed of that silent remark any more than she failed of feeling in some deeper place than she had even yet fully sounded that ones remarks were as weak as straws and that however one might indulge in them at eight oclock ones fate infallibly declared itself in absolute indifference to them at about eightfifteen remarks were remarks and very well for that but fate was fate and this young ladys was to pass park chambers every night in the working week out of the immensity of her knowledge of the life of the world there bloomed on these occasions as specific remembrance that it was regarded in that region in august and september as rather pleasant just to be caught for something or other in passing through town  somebody was always passing and somebody might catch somebody else  it was in full cognisance of this subtle law that she adhered to the most ridiculous circuit she could have made to get home  one warm dull featureless friday when an accident had made her start from cockers a little later than usual she became aware that something of which the infinite possibilities had for so long peopled her dreams was at last prodigiously upon her though the perfection in which the conditions happened to present it was almost rich enough to be but the positive creation of a dream  she saw straight before her like a vista painted in a picture the empty street and the lamps that burned pale in the dusk not yet established  it was into the convenience of this quiet twilight that a gentleman on the doorstep of the chambers gazed with a vagueness that our young ladys little figure violently trembled in the approach with the measure of its power to dissipate  everything indeed grew in a flash terrific and distinct her old uncertainties fell away from her and since she was so familiar with fate she felt as if the very nail that fixed it were driven in by the hard look with which for a moment captain everard awaited her  the vestibule was open behind him and the porter as absent as on the day she had peeped in he had just come outwas in town in a tweed suit and a pot hat but between two journeysduly bored over his evening and at a loss what to do with it  then it was that she was glad she had never met him in that way before she reaped with such ecstasy the benefit of his not being able to think she passed often  she jumped in two seconds to the determination that he should even suppose it to be the very first time and the very oddest chance this was while she still wondered if he would identify or notice her  his original attention had not she instinctively knew been for the young woman at cockers it had only been for any young woman who might advance to the tune of her not troubling the quiet air and in fact the poetic hour with ugliness  ah but then and just as she had reached the door came his second observation a long light reach with which visibly and quite amusedly he recalled and placed her  they were on different sides but the street narrow and still had only made more of a stage for the small momentary drama  it was not over besides it was far from over even on his sending across the way with the pleasantest laugh she had ever heard a little lift of his hat and an oh good evening  it was still less over on their meeting the next minute though rather indirectly and awkwardly in the middle of the roada situation to which three or four steps of her own had unmistakeably contributedand then passing not again to the side on which she had arrived but back toward the portal of park chambers  i didnt know you at first  are you taking a walk  ah i dont take walks at night  im going home after my work  oh  that was practically what they had meanwhile smiled out and his exclamation to which for a minute he appeared to have nothing to add left them face to face and in just such an attitude as for his part he might have worn had he been wondering if he could properly ask her to come in  during this interval in fact she really felt his question to be just how properly  it was simply a question of the degree of properness     chapter xv   she never knew afterwards quite what she had done to settle it and at the time she only knew that they presently moved with vagueness yet with continuity away from the picture of the lighted vestibule and the quiet stairs and well up the street together  this also must have been in the absence of a definite permission of anything vulgarly articulate for that matter on the part of either and it was to be later on a thing of remembrance and reflexion for her that the limit of what just here for a longish minute passed between them was his taking in her thoroughly successful deprecation though conveyed without pride or sound or touch of the idea that she might be out of the cage the very shop girl at large that she hugged the theory she wasnt  yes it was strange she afterwards thought that so much could have come and gone and yet not disfigured the dear little intense crisis either with impertinence or with resentment with any of the horrid notes of that kind of acquaintance  he had taken no liberty as she would have so called it and through not having to betray the sense of one she herself had still more charmingly taken none  on the spot nevertheless she could speculate as to what it meant that if his relation with lady bradeen continued to be what her mind had built it up to he should feel free to proceed with marked independence  this was one of the questions he was to leave her to deal withthe question whether people of his sort still asked girls up to their rooms when they were so awfully in love with other women  could people of his sort do that without what people of her sort would call being false to their love  she had already a vision of how the true answer was that people of her sort didnt in such cases matterdidnt count as infidelity counted only as something else she might have been curious since it came to that to see exactly what  strolling together slowly in their summer twilight and their empty corner of mayfair they found themselves emerge at last opposite to one of the smaller gates of the park upon which without any particular word about itthey were talking so of other thingsthey crossed the street and went in and sat down on a bench  she had gathered by this time one magnificent hope about himthe hope he would say nothing vulgar  she knew thoroughly what she meant by that she meant something quite apart from any matter of his being false  their bench was not far within it was near the park lane paling and the patchy lamplight and the rumbling cabs and buses  a strange emotion had come to her and she felt indeed excitement within excitement above all a conscious joy in testing him with chances he didnt take  she had an intense desire he should know the type she really conformed to without her doing anything so low as tell him and he had surely begun to know it from the moment he didnt seize the opportunities into which a common man would promptly have blundered  these were on the mere awkward surface and their relation was beautiful behind and below them  she had questioned so little on the way what they might be doing that as soon as they were seated she took straight hold of it  her hours her confinement the many conditions of service in the postoffice hadwith a glance at his own postal resources and alternativesformed up to this stage the subject of their talk  well here we are and it may be right enough but this isnt the least you know where i was going  you were going home  yes and i was already rather late  i was going to my supper  you havent had it  no indeed  then you havent eaten  he looked of a sudden so extravagantly concerned that she laughed out all day  yes we do feed once  but that was long ago  so i must presently say goodbye  oh deary me he exclaimed with an intonation so droll and yet a touch so light and a distress so markeda confession of helplessness for such a case in short so unrelievedthat she at once felt sure she had made the great difference plain  he looked at her with the kindest eyes and still without saying what she had known he wouldnt  she had known he wouldnt say then sup with me but the proof of it made her feel as if she had feasted  im not a bit hungry she went on  ah you must be awfully he made answer but settling himself on the bench as if after all that neednt interfere with his spending his evening  ive always quite wanted the chance to thank you for the trouble you so often take for me  yes i know she replied uttering the words with a sense of the situation far deeper than any pretence of not fitting his allusion  she immediately felt him surprised and even a little puzzled at her frank assent but for herself the trouble she had taken could only in these fleeting minutesthey would probably never come backbe all there like a little hoard of gold in her lap  certainly he might look at it handle it take up the pieces  yet if he understood anything he must understand all  i consider youve already immensely thanked me  the horror was back upon her of having seemed to hang about for some reward  its awfully odd you should have been there just the one time  the one time youve passed my place  yes you can fancy i havent many minutes to waste  there was a place tonight i had to stop at  i see i see he knew already so much about her work  it must be an awful grindfor a lady  it is but i dont think i groan over it any more than my companionsand youve seen theyre not ladies  she mildly jested but with an intention  one gets used to things and there are employments i should have hated much more  she had the finest conception of the beauty of not at least boring him  to whine to count up her wrongs was what a barmaid or a shopgirl would do and it was quite enough to sit there like one of these  if you had had another employment he remarked after a moment we might never have become acquainted  its highly probableand certainly not in the same way  then still with her heap of gold in her lap and something of the pride of it in her manner of holding her head she continued not to moveshe only smiled at him  the evening had thickened now the scattered lamps were red the park all before them was full of obscure and ambiguous life there were other couples on other benches whom it was impossible not to see yet at whom it was impossible to look  but ive walked so much out of my way with you only just to show you thatthatwith this she paused it was not after all so easy to expressthat anything you may have thought is perfectly true  oh ive thought a tremendous lot her companion laughed  do you mind my smoking  why should i  you always smoke there  at your place  oh yes but here its different  no she said as he lighted a cigarette thats just what it isnt its quite the same  well then thats because there its so wonderful  then youre conscious of how wonderful it is she returned  he jerked his handsome head in literal protest at a doubt  why thats exactly what i mean by my gratitude for all your trouble  it has been just as if you took a particular interest  she only looked at him by way of answer in such sudden headlong embarrassment as she was quite aware that while she remained silent he showed himself checked by her expression  you havehavent youtaken a particular interest  oh a particular interest she quavered out feeling the whole thingher headlong embarrassmentget terribly the better of her and wishing with a sudden scare all the more to keep her emotion down  she maintained her fixed smile a moment and turned her eyes over the peopled darkness unconfused now because there was something much more confusing  this with a fatal great rush was simply the fact that they were thus together  they were near near and all she had imagined of that had only become more true more dreadful and overwhelming  she stared straight away in silence till she felt she looked an idiot then to say something to say nothing she attempted a sound which ended in a flood of tears     chapter xvi   her tears helped her really to dissimulate for she had instantly in so public a situation to recover herself  they had come and gone in half a minute and she immediately explained them  its only because im tired  its thatits that  then she added a trifle incoherently i shall never see you again  ah but why not  the mere tone in which her companion asked this satisfied her once for all as to the amount of imagination for which she could count on him  it was naturally not large it had exhausted itself in having arrived at what he had already touched uponthe sense of an intention in her poor zeal at cockers  but any deficiency of this kind was no fault in him he wasnt obliged to have an inferior clevernessto have secondrate resources and virtues  it had been as if he almost really believed she had simply cried for fatigue and he accordingly put in some kind confused pleayou ought really to take something wont you have something or other somewhere to which she had made no response but a headshake of a sharpness that settled it  why shant we all the more keep meeting  i mean meeting this wayonly this way  at my place therethat ive nothing to do with and i hope of course youll turn up with your correspondence when it suits you  whether i stay or not i mean for i shall probably not stay  youre going somewhere else he put it with positive anxiety  yes ever so far awayto the other end of london  there are all sorts of reasons i cant tell you and its practically settled  its better for me much and ive only kept on at cockers for you  for me  making out in the dusk that he fairly blushed she now measured how far he had been from knowing too much  too much she called it at present and that was easy since it proved so abundantly enough for her that he should simply be where he was  as we shall never talk this way but to nightnever never againhere it all is  ill say it i dont care what you think it doesnt matter i only want to help you  besides youre kindyoure kind  ive been thinking then of leaving for ever so long  but youve come so oftenat timesand youve had so much to do and it has been so pleasant and interesting that ive remained ive kept putting off any change  more than once when i had nearly decided youve turned up again and ive thought oh no  thats the simple fact  she had by this time got her confusion down so completely that she could laugh  this is what i meant when i said to you just now that i knew  ive known perfectly that you knew i took trouble for you and that knowledge has been for me and i seemed to see it was for you as if there were somethingi dont know what to call itbetween us  i mean something unusual and good and awfully nicesomething not a bit horrid or vulgar  she had by this time she could see produced a great effect on him but she would have spoken the truth to herself had she at the same moment declared that she didnt in the least care all the more that the effect must be one of extreme perplexity  what in it all was visibly clear for him none the less was that he was tremendously glad he had met her she held him and he was astonished at the force of it he was intent immensely considerate  his elbow was on the back of the seat and his head with the pothat pushed quite back in a boyish way so that she really saw almost for the first time his forehead and hair rested on the hand into which he had crumpled his gloves  yes he assented its not a bit horrid or vulgar  she just hung fire a moment then she brought out the whole truth  id do anything for you  id do anything for you  never in her life had she known anything so high and fine as this just letting him have it and bravely and magnificently leaving it  didnt the place the associations and circumstances perfectly make it sound what it wasnt and wasnt that exactly the beauty  so she bravely and magnificently left it and little by little she felt him take it up take it down as if they had been on a satin sofa in a boudoir  she had never seen a boudoir but there had been lots of boudoirs in the telegrams  what she had said at all events sank into him so that after a minute he simply made a movement that had the result of placing his hand on her ownpresently indeed that of her feeling herself firmly enough grasped  there was no pressure she need return there was none she need decline she just sat admirably still satisfied for the time with the surprise and bewilderment of the impression she made on him  his agitation was even greater on the whole than she had at first allowed for  i say you know you mustnt think of leaving he at last broke out  of leaving cockers you mean  yes you must stay on there whatever happens and help a fellow  she was silent a little partly because it was so strange and exquisite to feel him watch her as if it really mattered to him and he were almost in suspense  then you have quite recognised what ive tried to do she asked  why wasnt that exactly what i dashed over from my door just now to thank you for  yes so you said  and dont you believe it  she looked down a moment at his hand which continued to cover her own whereupon he presently drew it back rather restlessly folding his arms without answering his question she went on have you ever spoken of me  spoken of you  of my being thereof my knowing and that sort of thing  oh never to a human creature he eagerly declared  she had a small drop at this which was expressed in another pause and she then returned to what he had just asked her  oh yes i quite believe you like itmy always being there and our taking things up so familiarly and successfully if not exactly where we left them she laughed almost always at least at an interesting point  he was about to say something in reply to this but her friendly gaiety was quicker you want a great many things in life a great many comforts and helps and luxuriesyou want everything as pleasant as possible  therefore so far as its in the power of any particular person to contribute to all that  she had turned her face to him smiling just thinking  oh see here  but he was highly amused  well what then he enquired as if to humour her  why the particular person must never fail  we must manage it for you somehow  he threw back his head laughing out he was really exhilarated  oh yes somehow  well i think we each dodont wein one little way and another and according to our limited lights  im pleased at any rate for myself that you are for i assure you ive done my best  you do better than any one  he had struck a match for another cigarette and the flame lighted an instant his responsive finished face magnifying into a pleasant grimace the kindness with which he paid her this tribute  youre awfully clever you know cleverer cleverer cleverer  he had appeared on the point of making some tremendous statement then suddenly puffing his cigarette and shifting almost with violence on his seat he let it altogether fall     chapter xvii   in spite of this drop if not just by reason of it she felt as if lady bradeen all but named out had popped straight up and she practically betrayed her consciousness by waiting a little before she rejoined cleverer than who  well if i wasnt afraid youd think i swagger i should saythan anybody  if you leave your place there where shall you go he more gravely asked  oh too far for you ever to find me  id find you anywhere  the tone of this was so still more serious that she had but her one acknowledgement  id do anything for youid do anything for you she repeated  she had already she felt said it all so what did anything more anything less matter  that was the very reason indeed why she could with a lighter note ease him generously of any awkwardness produced by solemnity either his own or hers  of course it must be nice for you to be able to think there are people all about who feel in such a way  in immediate appreciation of this however he only smoked without looking at her  but you dont want to give up your present work he at last threw out  i mean you will stay in the postoffice  oh yes i think ive a genius for that  rather  no one can touch you  with this he turned more to her again but you can get with a move greater advantages  i can get in the suburbs cheaper lodgings  i live with my mother  we need some space  theres a particular place that has other inducements  he just hesitated  where is it  oh quite out of your way  youd never have time  but i tell you id go anywhere  dont you believe it  yes for once or twice  but youd soon see it wouldnt do for you  he smoked and considered seemed to stretch himself a little and with his legs out surrender himself comfortably  well well welli believe everything you say  i take it from youanything you likein the most extraordinary way  it struck her certainlyand almost without bitternessthat the way in which she was already as if she had been an old friend arranging for him and preparing the only magnificence she could muster was quite the most extraordinary  dont dont go he presently went on  i shall miss you too horribly  so that you just put it to me as a definite requestoh how she tried to divest this of all sound of the hardness of bargaining  that ought to have been easy enough for what was she arranging to get  before he could answer she had continued to be perfectly fair i should tell you i recognise at cockers certain strong attractions  all you people come  i like all the horrors  the horrors  those you allyou know the set i mean your setshow me with as good a conscience as if i had no more feeling than a letterbox  he looked quite excited at the way she put it  oh they dont know  dont know im not stupid  no how should they  yes how should they said the captain sympathetically  but isnt horrors rather strong  what you do is rather strong the girl promptly returned  what i do  your extravagance your selfishness your immorality your crimes she pursued without heeding his expression  i sayher companion showed the queerest stare  i like them as i tell youi revel in them  but we neednt go into that she quietly went on for all i get out of it is the harmless pleasure of knowing  i know i know i knowshe breathed it ever so gently  yes thats what has been between us he answered much more simply  she could enjoy his simplicity in silence and for a moment she did so if i do stay because you want itand im rather capable of thatthere are two or three things i think you ought to remember  one is you know that im there sometimes for days and weeks together without your ever coming  oh ill come every day he honestly cried  she was on the point at this of imitating with her hand his movement of shortly before but she checked herself and there was no want of effect in her soothing substitute  how can you  how can you  he had too manifestly only to look at it there in the vulgarly animated gloom to see that he couldnt and at this point by the mere action of his silence everything they had so definitely not named the whole presence round which they had been circling became part of their reference settled in solidly between them  it was as if then for a minute they sat and saw it all in each others eyes saw so much that there was no need of a pretext for sounding it at last  your danger your danger  her voice indeed trembled with it and she could only for the moment again leave it so  during this moment he leaned back on the bench meeting her in silence and with a face that grew more strange  it grew so strange that after a further instant she got straight up  she stood there as if their talk were now over and he just sat and watched her  it was as if nowowing to the third person they had brought inthey must be more careful so that the most he could finally say was thats where it is  thats where it is the girl as guardedly replied  he sat still and she added i wont give you up  goodbye  goodbyehe appealed but without moving  i dont quite see my way but i wont give you up she repeated there  goodbye  it brought him with a jerk to his feet tossing away his cigarette  his poor face was flushed  see heresee here  no i wont but i must leave you now she went on as if not hearing him  see heresee here  he tried from the bench to take her hand again  but that definitely settled it for her this would after all be as bad as his asking her to supper  you mustnt come with meno no  he sank back quite blank as if she had pushed him  i maynt see you home  no no let me go  he looked almost as if she had struck him but she didnt care and the manner in which she spokeit was literally as if she were angryhad the force of a command  stay where you are  see heresee here he nevertheless pleaded  i wont give you up she cried once morethis time quite with passion on which she got away from him as fast as she could and left him staring after her     chapter xviii   mr mudge had lately been so occupied with their famous plans that he had neglected for a while the question of her transfer but down at bournemouth which had found itself selected as the field of their recreation by a process consisting it seemed exclusively of innumerable pages of the neatest arithmetic in a very greasy but most orderly little pocketbook the distracting possible melted awaythe fleeting absolute ruled the scene  the plans hour by hour were simply superseded and it was much of a rest to the girl as she sat on the pier and overlooked the sea and the company to see them evaporate in rosy fumes and to feel that from moment to moment there was less left to cipher about  the week proves blissfully fine and her mother at their lodgingspartly to her embarrassment and partly to her reliefstruck up with the landlady an alliance that left the younger couple a great deal of freedom  this relative took her pleasure of a week at bournemouth in a stuffy backkitchen and endless talks to that degree even that mr mudge himselfhabitually inclined indeed to a scrutiny of all mysteries and to seeing as he sometimes admitted too much in thingsmade remarks on it as he sat on the cliff with his betrothed or on the decks of steamers that conveyed them closepacked items in terrific totals of enjoyment to the isle of wight and the dorset coast  he had a lodging in another house where he had speedily learned the importance of keeping his eyes open and he made no secret of his suspecting that sinister mutual connivances might spring under the roof of his companions from unnatural sociabilities  at the same time he fully recognised that as a source of anxiety not to say of expense his future motherin law would have weighted them more by accompanying their steps than by giving her hostess in the interest of the tendency they considered that they never mentioned equivalent pledges as to the tea caddy and the jampot  these were the questionsthese indeed the familiar commoditiesthat he had now to put into the scales and his betrothed had in consequence during her holiday the odd and yet pleasant and almost languid sense of an anticlimax  she had become conscious of an extraordinary collapse a surrender to stillness and to retrospect  she cared neither to walk nor to sail it was enough for her to sit on benches and wonder at the sea and taste the air and not be at cockers and not see the counterclerk  she still seemed to wait for somethingsomething in the key of the immense discussions that had mapped out their little week of idleness on the scale of a worldatlas something came at last but without perhaps appearing quite adequately to crown the monument  preparation and precaution were however the natural flowers of mr mudges mind and in proportion as these things declined in one quarter they inevitably bloomed elsewhere  he could always at the worst have on tuesday the project of their taking the swanage boat on thursday and on thursday that of their ordering minced kidneys on saturday  he had moreover a constant gift of inexorable enquiry as to where and what they should have gone and have done if they hadnt been exactly as they were he had in short his resources and his mistress had never been so conscious of them on the other hand they never interfered so little with her own  she liked to be as she wasif it could only have lasted  she could accept even without bitterness a rigour of economy so great that the little fee they paid for admission to the pier had to be balanced against other delights  the people at ladles and at thrupps had their ways of amusing themselves whereas she had to sit and hear mr mudge talk of what he might do if he didnt take a bath or of the bath he might take if he only hadnt taken something else  he was always with her now of course always beside her she saw him more than hourly more than ever yet more even than he had planned she should do at chalk farm  she preferred to sit at the far end away from the band and the crowd as to which she had frequent differences with her friend who reminded her often that they could have only in the thick of it the sense of the money they were getting back  that had little effect on her for she got back her money by seeing many things the things of the past year fall together and connect themselves undergo the happy relegation that transforms melancholy and misery passion and effort into experience and knowledge  she liked having done with them as she assured herself she had practically done and the strange thing was that she neither missed the procession now nor wished to keep her place for it  it had become there in the sun and the breeze and the seasmell a faraway story a picture of another life  if mr mudge himself liked processions liked them at bournemouth and on the pier quite as much as at chalk farm or anywhere she learned after a little not to be worried by his perpetual counting of the figures that made them up  there were dreadful women in particular usually fat and in mens caps and write shoes whom he could never let alonenot that she cared it was not the great world the world of cockers and ladles and thrupps but it offered an endless field to his faculties of memory philosophy and frolic  she had never accepted him so much never arranged so successfully for making him chatter while she carried on secret conversations  this separate commerce was with herself and if they both practised a great thrift she had quite mastered that of merely spending words enough to keep him imperturbably and continuously going  he was charmed with the panorama not knowingor at any rate not at all showing that he knewwhat far other images peopled her mind than the women in the navy caps and the shopboys in the blazers  his observations on these types his general interpretation of the show brought home to her the prospect of chalk farm  she wondered sometimes that he should have derived so little illumination during his period from the society at cockers  but one evening while their holiday cloudlessly waned he gave her such a proof of his quality as might have made her ashamed of her many suppressions  he brought out something that in all his overflow he had been able to keep back till other matters were disposed of  it was the announcement that he was at last ready to marrythat he saw his way  a rise at chalk farm had been offered him he was to be taken into the business bringing with him a capital the estimation of which by other parties constituted the handsomest recognition yet made of the head on his shoulders  therefore their waiting was overit could be a question of a near date  they would settle this date before going back and he meanwhile had his eye on a sweet little home  he would take her to see it on their first sunday     chapter xix   his having kept this great news for the last having had such a card up his sleeve and not floated it out in the current of his chatter and the luxury of their leisure was one of those incalculable strokes by which he could still affect her the kind of thing that reminded her of the latent force that had ejected the drunken soldieran example of the profundity of which his promotion was the proof  she listened a while in silence on this occasion to the wafted strains of the music she took it in as she had not quite done before that her future was now constituted  mr mudge was distinctly her fate yet at this moment she turned her face quite away from him showing him so long a mere quarter of her cheek that she at last again heard his voice  he couldnt see a pair of tears that were partly the reason of her delay to give him the assurance he required but he expressed at a venture the hope that she had had her fill of cockers  she was finally able to turn back  oh quite  theres nothing going on no one comes but the americans at thrupps and they dont do much  they dont seem to have a secret in the world  then the extraordinary reason youve been giving me for holding on there has ceased to work  she thought a moment  yes that one  ive seen the thing throughive got them all in my pocket  so youre ready to come  for a little again she made no answer  no not yet all the same  ive still got a reasona different one  he looked her all over as if it might have been something she kept in her mouth or her glove or under her jacketsomething she was even sitting upon  well ill have it please  i went out the other night and sat in the park with a gentleman she said at last  nothing was ever seen like his confidence in her and she wondered a little now why it didnt irritate her  it only gave her ease and space as she felt for telling him the whole truth that no one knew  it had arrived at present at her really wanting to do that and yet to do it not in the least for mr mudge but altogether and only for herself  this truth filled out for her there the whole experience about to relinquish suffused and coloured it as a picture that she should keep and that describe it as she might no one but herself would ever really see moreover she had no desire whatever to make mr mudge jealous there would be no amusement in it for the amusement she had lately known had spoiled her for lower pleasures  there were even no materials for it the odd thing was how she never doubted that properly handled his passion was poisonable what had happened was that he had cannily selected a partner with no poison to distil  she read then and there that she should never interest herself in anybody as to whom some other sentiment some superior view wouldnt be sure to interfere for him with jealousy  and what did you get out of that he asked with a concern that was not in the least for his honour  nothing but a good chance to promise him i wouldnt forsake him  hes one of my customers  then its for him not to forsake you  well he wont  its all right  but i must just keep on as long as he may want me  want you to sit with him in the park  he may want me for thatbut i shant  i rather liked it but once under the circumstances is enough  i can do better for him in another manner  and what manner pray  well elsewhere  elsewherei say  this was an ejaculation used also by captain everard but oh with what a different sound  you neednt saytheres nothing to be said  and yet you ought perhaps to know  certainly i ought  but whatup to now  why exactly what i told him  that id do anything for him  what do you mean by anything  everything  mr mudges immediate comment on this statement was to draw from his pocket a crumpled paper containing the remains of half a pound of sundries  these sundries had figured conspicuously in his prospective sketch of their tour but it was only at the end of three days that they had defined themselves unmistakeably as chocolatecreams  have anotherthat one he said  she had another but not the one he indicated and then he continued what took place afterwards  afterwards  what did you do when you had told him youd do everything  i simply came away  out of the park  yes leaving him there  i didnt let him follow me  then what did you let him do  i didnt let him do anything  mr mudge considered an instant  then what did you go there for  his tone was even slightly critical  i didnt quite know at the time  it was simply to be with him i supposejust once  hes in danger and i wanted him to know i know it it makes meeting himat cockers since its that i want to stay on formore interesting  it makes it mighty interesting for me mr mudge freely declared yet he didnt follow you he asked  i would  yes of course  that was the way you began you know  youre awfully inferior to him  well my dear youre not inferior to anybody  youve got a cheek whats he in danger of  of being found out  hes in love with a ladyand it isnt rightand ive found him out  thatll be a lookout for me mr mudge joked  you mean she has a husband  never mind what she has  theyre in awful danger but his is the worst because hes in danger from her too  like me from youthe woman i love  if hes in the same funk as me  hes in a worse one  hes not only afraid of the ladyhes afraid of other things  mr mudge selected another chocolatecream  well im only afraid of one  but how in the world can you help this party  i dont knowperhaps not at all  but so long as theres a chance  you wont come away  no youve got to wait for me  mr mudge enjoyed what was in his mouth  and what will he give you  give me  if you do help him  nothing  nothing in all the wide world  then what will he give me mr mudge enquired  i mean for waiting  the girl thought a moment then she got up to walk  he never heard of you she replied  you havent mentioned me  we never mention anything  what ive told you is just what ive found out  mr mudge who had remained on the bench looked up at her she often preferred to be quiet when he proposed to walk but now that he seemed to wish to sit she had a desire to move  but you havent told me what he has found out  she considered her lover  hed never find you my dear  her lover still on his seat appealed to her in something of the attitude in which she had last left captain everard but the impression was not the same  then where do i come in  you dont come in at all  thats just the beauty of itand with this she turned to mingle with the multitude collected round the band  mr mudge presently overtook her and drew her arm into his own with a quiet force that expressed the serenity of possession in consonance with which it was only when they parted for the night at her door that he referred again to what she had told him  have you seen him since  since the night in the park  no not once  oh what a cad said mr mudge     chapter xx   it was not till the end of october that she saw captain everard again and on that occasionthe only one of all the series on which hindrance had been so utterno communication with him proved possible  she had made out even from the cage that it was a charming golden day a patch of hazy autumn sunlight lay across the sanded floor and also higher up quickened into brightness a row of ruddy bottled syrups  work was slack and the place in general empty the town as they said in the cage had not waked up and the feeling of the day likened itself to something than in happier conditions she would have thought of romantically as saint martins summer  the counterclerk had gone to his dinner she herself was busy with arrears of postal jobs in the midst of which she became aware that captain everard had apparently been in the shop a minute and that mr buckton had already seized him  he had as usual half a dozen telegrams and when he saw that she saw him and their eyes met he gave on bowing to her an exaggerated laugh in which she read a new consciousness  it was a confession of awkwardness it seemed to tell her that of course he knew he ought better to have kept his head ought to have been clever enough to wait on some pretext till he should have found her free  mr buckton was a long time with him and her attention was soon demanded by other visitors so that nothing passed between them but the fulness of their silence  the look she took from him was his greeting and the other one a simple sign of the eyes sent her before going out  the only token they exchanged therefore was his tacit assent to her wish that since they couldnt attempt a certain frankness they should attempt nothing at all  this was her intense preference she could be as still and cold as any one when that was the sole solution  yet more than any contact hitherto achieved these counted instants struck her as marking a step they were built sojust in the mere flashon the recognition of his now definitely knowing what it was she would do for him  the anything anything she had uttered in the park went to and fro between them and under the pokedout china that interposed  it had all at last even put on the air of their not needing now clumsily to manoeuvre to converse their former little postal makebelieves the intense implications of questions and answers and change had become in the light of the personal fact of their having had their moment a possibility comparatively poor  it was as if they had met for all timeit exerted on their being in presence again an influence so prodigious  when she watched herself in the memory of that night walk away from him as if she were making an end she found something too pitiful in the primness of such a gait  hadnt she precisely established on the part of each a consciousness that could end only with death  it must be admitted that in spite of this brave margin an irritation after he had gone remained with her a sense that presently became one with a still sharper hatred of mr buckton who on her friends withdrawal had retired with the telegrams to the sounder and left her the other work  she knew indeed she should have a chance to see them when she would on file and she was divided as the day went on between the two impressions of all that was lost and all that was reasserted what beset her above all and as she had almost never known it before was the desire to bound straight out to overtake the autumn afternoon before it passed away for ever and hurry off to the park and perhaps be with him there again on a bench  it became for an hour a fantastic vision with her that he might just have gone to sit and wait for her  she could almost hear him through the tick of the sounder scatter with his stick in his impatience the fallen leaves of october  why should such a vision seize her at this particular moment with such a shake  there was a timefrom four to fivewhen she could have cried with happiness and rage  business quickened it seemed toward five as if the town did wake up she had therefore more to do and she went through it with little sharp stampings and jerkings she made the crisp postalorders fairly snap while she breathed to herself its the last daythe last day  the last day of what  she couldnt have told  all she knew now was that if she were out of the cage she wouldnt in the least have minded this time its not yet being dark  she would have gone straight toward park chambers and have hung about there till no matter when  she would have waited stayed rung asked have gone in sat on the stairs  what the day was the last of was probably to her strained inner sense the group of golden ones of any occasion for seeing the hazy sunshine slant at that angle into the smelly shop of any range of chances for his wishing still to repeat to her the two words she had in the park scarcely let him bring out  see heresee herethe sound of these two words had been with her perpetually but it was in her ears today without mercy with a loudness that grew and grew  what was it they then expressed what was it he had wanted her to see  she seemed whatever it was perfectly to see it nowto see that if she should just chuck the whole thing should have a great and beautiful courage he would somehow make everything up to her  when the clock struck five she was on the very point of saying to mr buckton that she was deadly ill and rapidly getting worse  this announcement was on her lips and she had quite composed the pale hard face she would offer him i cant stopi must go home  if i feel better later on ill come back  im very sorry but i must go  at that instant captain everard once more stood there producing in her agitated spirit by his real presence the strangest quickest revolution  he stopped her off without knowing it and by the time he had been a minute in the shop she felt herself saved  that was from the first minute how she thought of it  there were again other persons with whom she was occupied and again the situation could only be expressed by their silence  it was expressed of a truth in a larger phrase than ever yet for her eyes now spoke to him with a kind of supplication  be quiet be quiet they pleaded and they saw his own reply ill do whatever you say i wont even look at yousee see they kept conveying thus with the friendliest liberality that they wouldnt look quite positively wouldnt  what she was to see was that he hovered at the other end of the counter mr bucktons end and surrendered himself again to that frustration  it quickly proved so great indeed that what she was to see further was how he turned away before he was attended to and hung off waiting smoking looking about the shop how he went over to mr cockers own counter and appeared to price things gave in fact presently two or three orders and put down money stood there a long time with his back to her considerately abstaining from any glance round to see if she were free  it at last came to pass in this way that he had remained in the shop longer than she had ever yet known to do and that nevertheless when he did turn about she could see him time himselfshe was freshly taken upand cross straight to her postal subordinate whom some one else had released  he had in his hand all this while neither letters nor telegrams and now that he was close to herfor she was close to the counterclerkit brought her heart into her mouth merely to see him look at her neighbour and open his lips  she was too nervous to bear it  he asked for a post office guide and the young man whipped out a new one whereupon he said he wished not to purchase but only to consult one a moment with which the copy kept on loan being produced he once more wandered off  what was he doing to her  what did he want of her  well it was just the aggravation of his see here  she felt at this moment strangely and portentously afraid of himhad in her ears the hum of a sense that should it come to that kind of tension she must fly on the spot to chalk farm  mixed with her dread and with her reflexion was the idea that if he wanted her so much as he seemed to show it might be after all simply to do for him the anything she had promised the everything she had thought it so fine to bring out to mr mudge  he might want her to help him might have some particular appeal though indeed his manner didnt denote thatdenoted on the contrary an embarrassment an indecision something of a desire not so much to be helped as to be treated rather more nicely than she had treated him the other time  yes he considered quite probably that he had help rather to offer than to ask for  still none the less when he again saw her free he continued to keep away from her when he came back with his thumbed guide it was mr buckton he caughtit was from mr buckton he obtained halfacrownsworth of stamps  after asking for the stamps he asked quite as a second thought for a postalorder for ten shillings  what did he want with so many stamps when he wrote so few letters  how could he enclose a postalorder in a telegram  she expected him the next thing to go into the corner and make up one of his telegramshalf a dozen of themon purpose to prolong his presence  she had so completely stopped looking at him that she could only guess his movementsguess even where his eyes rested  finally she saw him make a dash that might have been toward the nook where the forms were hung and at this she suddenly felt that she couldnt keep it up  the counterclerk had just taken a telegram from a slavey and to give herself something to cover her she snatched it out of his hand  the gesture was so violent that he gave her in return an odd look and she also perceived that mr buckton noticed it  the latter personage with a quick stare at her appeared for an instant to wonder whether his snatching it in his turn mightnt be the thing she would least like and she anticipated this practical criticism by the frankest glare she had ever given him  it sufficed this time it paralysed him and she sought with her trophy the refuge of the sounder     chapter xxi   it was repeated the next day it went on for three days and at the end of that time she knew what to think  when at the beginning she had emerged from her temporary shelter captain everard had quitted the shop and he had not come again that evening as it had struck her he possibly mightmight all the more easily that there were numberless persons who came morning and afternoon numberless times so that he wouldnt necessarily have attracted attention  the second day it was different and yet on the whole worse  his access to her had become possibleshe felt herself even reaping the fruit of her yesterdays glare at mr buckton but transacting his business with him didnt simplifyit could in spite of the rigour of circumstance feed so her new conviction  the rigour was tremendous and his telegramsnot now mere pretexts for getting at herwere apparently genuine yet the conviction had taken but a night to develop  it could be simply enough expressed she had had the glimmer of it the day before in her idea that he needed no more help than she had already given that it was help he himself was prepared to render  he had come up to town but for three or four days he had been absolutely obliged to be absent after the other time yet he would now that he was face to face with her stay on as much longer as she liked little by little it was thus clarified though from the first flash of his reappearance she had read into it the real essence  that was what the night before at eight oclock her hour to go had made her hang back and dawdle  she did last things or pretended to do them to be in the cage had suddenly become her safety and she was literally afraid of the alternate self who might be waiting outside  he might be waiting it was he who was her alternate self and of him she was afraid  the most extraordinary change had taken place in her from the moment of her catching the impression he seemed to have returned on purpose to give her  just before she had done so on that bewitched afternoon she had seen herself approach without a scruple the porter at park chambers then as the effect of the rush of a consciousness quite altered she had on at last quitting cockers gone straight home for the first time since her return from bournemouth  she had passed his door every night for weeks but nothing would have induced her to pass it now this change was the tribute of her fearthe result of a change in himself as to which she needed no more explanation than his mere face vividly gave her strange though it was to find an element of deterrence in the object that she regarded as the most beautiful in the world  he had taken it from her in the park that night that she wanted him not to propose to her to sup but he had put away the lesson by this timehe practically proposed supper every time he looked at her  this was what for that matter mainly filled the three days  he came in twice on each of these and it was as if he came in to give her a chance to relent that was after all she said to herself in the intervals the most that he did  there were ways she fully recognised in which he spared her and other particular ways as to which she meant that her silence should be full to him of exquisite pleading  the most particular of all was his not being outside at the corner when she quitted the place for the night  this he might so easily have beenso easily if he hadnt been so nice  she continued to recognise in his forbearance the fruit of her dumb supplication and the only compensation he found for it was the harmless freedom of being able to appear to say yes im in town only for three or four days but you know i would stay on  he struck her as calling attention each day each hour to the rapid ebb of time he exaggerated to the point of putting it that there were only two days more that there was at last dreadfully only one  there were other things still that he struck her as doing with a special intention as to the most marked of whichunless indeed it were the most obscureshe might well have marvelled that it didnt seem to her more horrid  it was either the frenzy of her imagination or the disorder of his baffled passion that gave her once or twice the vision of his putting down redundant moneysovereigns not concerned with the little payments he was perpetually makingso that she might give him some sign of helping him to slip them over to her  what was most extraordinary in this impression was the amount of excuse that with some incoherence she found for him  he wanted to pay her because there was nothing to pay her for  he wanted to offer her things he knew she wouldnt take  he wanted to show her how much he respected her by giving her the supreme chance to show him she was respectable  over the dryest transactions at any rate their eyes had out these questions  on the third day he put in a telegram that had evidently something of the same point as the stray sovereignsa message that was in the first place concocted and that on a second thought he took back from her before she had stamped it  he had given her time to read it and had only then bethought himself that he had better not send it  if it was not to lady bradeen at twindlewhere she knew her ladyship then to bethis was because an address to doctor buzzard at brickwood was just as good with the added merit of its not giving away quite so much a person whom he had still after all in a manner to consider  it was of course most complicated only half lighted but there was discernibly enough a scheme of communication in which lady bradeen at twindle and dr buzzard at brickwood were within limits one and the same person  the words he had shown her and then taken back consisted at all events of the brief but vivid phrase absolutely impossible  the point was not that she should transmit it the point was just that she should see it  what was absolutely impossible was that before he had setted something at cockers he should go either to twindle or to brickwood  the logic of this in turn for herself was that she could lend herself to no settlement so long as she so intensely knew  what she knew was that he was almost under peril of life clenched in a situation therefore how could she also know where a poor girl in the po might really stand  it was more and more between them that if he might convey to her he was free with all the impossible locked away into a closed chapter her own case might become different for her she might understand and meet him and listen  but he could convey nothing of the sort and he only fidgeted and floundered in his want of power  the chapter wasnt in the least closed not for the other party and the other party had a pull somehow and somewhere this his whole attitude and expression confessed at the same time that they entreated her not to remember and not to mind  so long as she did remember and did mind he could only circle about and go and come doing futile things of which he was ashamed  he was ashamed of his two words to dr buzzard he went out of the shop as soon as he had crumpled up the paper again and thrust it into his pocket  it had been an abject little exposure of dreadful impossible passion  he appeared in fact to be too ashamed to come back he had once more left town and a first week elapsed and a second  he had had naturally to return to the real mistress of his fate she had insistedshe knew how to insist and he couldnt put in another hour there was always a day when she called time  it was known to our young friend moreover that he had now been dispatching telegrams from other offices  she knew at last so much that she had quite lost her earlier sense of merely guessing  there were no different shades of distinctnessit all bounced out     chapter xxii   eighteen days elapsed and she had begun to think it probable she should never see him again  he too then understood now he had made out that she had secrets and reasons and impediments that even a poor girl at the po might have her complications  with the charm she had cast on him lightened by distance he had suffered a final delicacy to speak to him had made up his mind that it would be only decent to let her alone  never so much as during these latter days had she felt the precariousness of their relationthe happy beautiful untroubled original one if it could only have been restoredin which the public servant and the casual public only were concerned  it hung at the best by the merest silken thread which was at the mercy of any accident and might snap at any minute  she arrived by the end of the fortnight at the highest sense of actual fitness never doubting that her decision was now complete  she would just give him a few days more to come back to her on a proper impersonal basisfor even to an embarrassing representative of the casual public a public servant with a conscience did owe somethingand then would signify to mr mudge that she was ready for the little home it had been visited in the further talk she had had with him at bournemouth from garret to cellar and they had especially lingered with their respectively darkened brows before the niche into which it was to be broached to her mother that she must find means to fit  he had put it to her more definitely than before that his calculations had allowed for that dingy presence and he had thereby marked the greatest impression he had ever made on her  it was a stroke superior even again to his handling of the drunken soldier  what she considered that in the face of it she hung on at cockers for was something she could only have described as the common fairness of a last word  her actual last word had been till it should be superseded that she wouldnt forsake her other friend and it stuck to her through thick and thin that she was still at her post and on her honour  this other friend had shown so much beauty of conduct already that he would surely after all just reappear long enough to relieve her to give her something she could take away  she saw it caught it at times his parting present and there were moments when she felt herself sitting like a beggar with a hand held out to almsgiver who only fumbled  she hadnt taken the sovereigns but she would take the penny  she heard in imagination on the counter the ring of the copper  dont put yourself out any longer he would say for so bad a case  youve done all there is to be done  i thank and acquit and release you  our lives take us  i dont know muchthough ive really been interestedabout yours but i suppose youve got one  mine at any rate will take meand where it will  heighho  goodbye  and then once more for the sweetest faintest flower of all only i saysee here  she had framed the whole picture with a squareness that included also the image of how again she would decline to see there decline as she might say to see anywhere see anything  yet it befell that just in the fury of this escape she saw more than ever  he came back one night with a rush near the moment of their closing and showed her a face so different and new so upset and anxious that almost anything seemed to look out of it but clear recognition  he poked in a telegram very much as if the simple sense of pressure the distress of extreme haste had blurred the remembrance of where in particular he was but as she met his eyes a light came it broke indeed on the spot into a positive conscious glare  that made up for everything since it was an instant proclamation of the celebrated danger it seemed to pour things out in a flood  oh yes here it isits upon me at last  forget for gods sake my having worried or bored you and just help me just save me by getting this off without the loss of a second  something grave had clearly occurred a crisis declared itself  she recognised immediately the person to whom the telegram was addressedthe miss dolman of parade lodge to whom lady bradeen had wired at dover on the last occasion and whom she had then with her recollection of previous arrangements fitted into a particular setting  miss dolman had figured before and not figured since but she was now the subject of an imperative appeal  absolutely necessary to see you  take last train victoria if you can catch it  if not earliest morning and answer me direct either way  reply paid said the girl  mr buckton had just departed and the counterclerk was at the sounder  there was no other representative of the public and she had never yet as it seemed to her not even in the street or in the park been so alone with him  oh yes reply paid and as sharp as possible please  she affixed the stamps in a flash  shell catch the train she then declared to him breathlessly as if she could absolutely guarantee it  i dont knowi hope so  its awfully important  so kind of you awfully sharp please  it was wonderfully innocent now his oblivion of all but his danger  anything else that had ever passed between them was utterly out of it  well she had wanted him to be impersonal  there was less of the same need therefore happily for herself yet she only took time before she flew to the sounder to gasp at him youre in trouble  horrid horridtheres a row  but they parted on it in the next breath and as she dashed at the sounder almost pushing in her violence the counterclerk off the stool she caught the bang with which at cockers door in his further precipitation he closed the apron of the cab into which he had leaped  as he rebounded to some other precaution suggested by his alarm his appeal to miss dolman flashed straight away  but she had not on the morrow been in the place five minutes before he was with her again still more discomposed and quite now as she said to herself like a frightened child coming to its mother  her companions were there and she felt it to be remarkable how in the presence of his agitation his mere scared exposed nature she suddenly ceased to mind it came to her as it had never come to her before that with absolute directness and assurance they might carry almost anything off  he had nothing to sendshe was sure he had been wiring all overand yet his business was evidently huge  there was nothing but that in his eyesnot a glimmer of reference or memory  he was almost haggard with anxiety and had clearly not slept a wink  her pity for him would have given her any courage and she seemed to know at last why she had been such a fool she didnt come she panted  oh yes she came but there has been some mistake  we want a telegram  a telegram  one that was sent from here ever so long ago  there was something in it that has to be recovered  something very very important pleasewe want it immediately  he really spoke to her as if she had been some strange young woman at knightsbridge or paddington but it had no other effect on her than to give her the measure of his tremendous flurry  then it was that above all she felt how much she had missed in the gaps and blanks and absent answershow much she had had to dispense with it was now black darkness save for this little wild red flare  so much as that she saw so much her mind dealt with  one of the lovers was quaking somewhere out of town and the other was quaking just where he stood  this was vivid enough and after an instant she knew it was all she wanted  she wanted no detail no factshe wanted no nearer vision of discovery or shame when was your telegram  do you mean you sent it from here  she tried to do the young woman at knightsbridge  oh yes from hereseveral weeks ago  five six sevenhe was confused and impatientdont you remember  remember she could scarcely keep out of her face at the word the strangest of smiles  but the way he didnt catch what it meant was perhaps even stranger still  i mean dont you keep the old ones  for a certain time  but how long  she thought she must do the young woman and she knew exactly what the young woman would say and still more wouldnt  can you give me the date  oh god no  it was some time or other in augusttoward the end  it was to the same address as the one i gave you last night  oh said the girl knowing at this the deepest thrill she had ever felt  it came to her there with her eyes on his face that she held the whole thing in her hand held it as she held her pencil which might have broken at that instant in her tightened grip  this made her feel like the very fountain of fate but the emotion was such a flood that she had to press it back with all her force  that was positively the reason again of her flutelike paddington tone  you cant give us anything a little nearer  her little and her us came straight from paddington these things were no false note for himhis difficulty absorbed them all  the eyes with which he pressed her and in the depths of which she read terror and rage and literal tears were just the same he would have shown any other prim person  i dont know the date  i only know the thing went from here and just about the time i speak of  it wasnt delivered you see  weve got to recover it     chapter xxiii   she was as struck with the beauty of his plural pronoun as she had judged he might be with that of her own but she knew now so well what she was about that she could almost play with him and with her newborn joy  you say about the time you speak of  but i dont think you speak of an exact timedo you  he looked splendidly helpless  thats just what i want to find out dont you keep the old onescant you look it up  our young ladystill at paddingtonturned the question over  it wasnt delivered  yes it was yet at the same time dont you know it wasnt  he just hung back but he brought it out  i mean it was intercepted dont you know and there was something in it  he paused again and as if to further his quest and woo and supplicate success and recovery even smiled with an effort at the agreeable that was almost ghastly and that turned the knife in her tenderness  what must be the pain of it all of the open gulf and the throbbing fever when this was the mere hot breath we want to get what was in itto know what it was  i seei see  she managed just the accent they had at paddington when they stared like dead fish  and you have no clue  not at allive the clue ive just given you  oh the last of august  if she kept it up long enough she would make him really angry  yes and the address as ive said  oh the same as last night  he visibly quivered as with a gleam of hope but it only poured oil on her quietude and she was still deliberate  she ranged some papers wont you look he went on  i remember your coming she replied  he blinked with a new uneasiness it might have begun to come to him through her difference that he was somehow different himself  you were much quicker then you know  so were youyou must do me that justice she answered with a smile but let me see  wasnt it dover  yes miss dolman  parade lodge parade terrace  exactlythank you so awfully much  he began to hope again  then you have itthe other one  she hesitated afresh she quite dangled him  it was brought by a lady  yes and she put in by mistake something wrong  thats what weve got to get hold of  heavens what was he going to sayflooding poor paddington with wild betrayals  she couldnt too much for her joy dangle him yet she couldnt either for his dignity warn or control or check him  what she found herself doing was just to treat herself to the middle way  it was intercepted  it fell into the wrong hands  but theres something in it he continued to blurt out that may be all right  that is if its wrong dont you know  its all right if its wrong he remarkably explained  what was he on earth going to say  mr buckton and the counterclerk were already interested no one would have the decency to come in and she was divided between her particular terror for him and her general curiosity  yet she already saw with what brilliancy she could add to carry the thing off a little false knowledge to all her real  i quite understand she said with benevolent with almost patronising quickness the lady has forgotten what she did put  forgotten most wretchedly and its an immense inconvenience  it has only just been found that it didnt get there so that if we could immediately have it  immediately  every minute counts  you have he pleaded surely got them on file  so that you can see it on the spot  yes pleasethis very minute  the counter rang with his knuckles with the knob of his stick with his panic of alarm  do do hunt it up he repeated  i dare say we could get it for you the girl weetly returned  get ithe looked aghast  when  probably by tomorrow  then it isnt herehis face was pitiful  she caught only the uncovered gleams that peeped out of the blackness and she wondered what complication even among the most supposable the very worst could be bad enough to account for the degree of his terror there were twists and turns there were places where the screw drew blood that she couldnt guess  she was more and more glad she didnt want to  it has been sent on  but how do you know if you dont look  she gave him a smile that was meant to be in the absolute irony of its propriety quite divine  it was august 23rd and weve nothing later here than august 27th  something leaped into his face  27th23rd  then youre sure  you know  she felt she scarce knew whatas if she might soon be pounced upon for some lurid connexion with a scandal  it was the queerest of all sensations for she had heard she had read of these things and the wealth of her intimacy with them at cockers might be supposed to have schooled and seasoned her  this particular one that she had really quite lived with was after all an old story yet what it had been before was dim and distant beside the touch under which she now winced  scandalit had never been but a silly word  now it was a great tense surface and the surface was somehow captain everards wonderful face  deep down in his eyes a picture a scenea great place like a chamber of justice where before a watching crowd a poor girl exposed but heroic swore with a quavering voice to a document proved an alibi supplied a link in this picture she bravely took her place  it was the 23rd  then cant you get it this morningor some time today  she considered still holding him with her look which she then turned on her two companions who were by this time unreservedly enlisted  she didnt carenot a scrap and she glanced about for a piece of paper with this she had to recognise the rigour of official thrifta morsel of blackened blotter was the only loose paper to be seen  have you got a card she said to her visitor  he was quite away from paddington now and the next instant pocketbook in hand he had whipped a card out  she gave no glance at the name on itonly turned it to the other side  she continued to hold him she felt at present as she had never held him and her command of her colleagues was for the moment not less marked  she wrote something on the back of the card and pushed it across to him  he fairly glared at it  seven nine four  nine six oneshe obligingly completed the number  is it right she smiled  he took the whole thing in with a flushed intensity then there broke out in him a visibility of relief that was simply a tremendous exposure  he shone at them all like a tall lighthouse embracing even for sympathy the blinking young men  by all the powersits wrong  and without another look without a word of thanks without time for anything or anybody he turned on them the broad back of his great stature straightened his triumphant shoulders and strode out of the place  she was left confronted with her habitual critics  if its wrong its all right she extravagantly quoted to them  the counterclerk was really awestricken  but how did you know dear  i remembered love  mr buckton on the contrary was rude  and what game is that miss  no happiness she had ever known came within miles of it and some minutes elapsed before she could recall herself sufficiently to reply that it was none of his business     chapter xxiv   if life at cockers with the dreadful drop of august had lost something of its savour she had not been slow to infer that a heavier blight had fallen on the graceful industry of mrs jordan  with lord rye and lady ventnor and mrs bubb all out of town with the blinds down on all the homes of luxury this ingenious woman might well have found her wonderful taste left quite on her hands  she bore up however in a way that began by exciting much of her young friends esteem they perhaps even more frequently met as the wine of life flowed less free from other sources and each in the lack of better diversion carried on with more mystification for the other an intercourse that consisted not a little in peeping out and drawing back  each waited for the other to commit herself each profusely curtained for the other the limits of low horizons  mrs jordan was indeed probably the more reckless skirmisher nothing could exceed her frequent incoherence unless it was indeed her occasional bursts of confidence  her account of her private affairs rose and fell like a flame in the windsometimes the bravest bonfire and sometimes a handful of ashes  this our young woman took to be an effect of the position at one moment and another of the famous door of the great world  she had been struck in one of her hapenny volumes with the translation of a french proverb according to which such a door any door had to be either open or shut and it seemed part of the precariousness of mrs jordans life that hers mostly managed to be neither  there had been occasions when it appeared to gape widefairly to woo her across its threshold there had been others of an order distinctly disconcerting when it was all but banged in her face  on the whole however she had evidently not lost heart these still belonged to the class of things in spite of which she looked well she intimated that the profits of her trade had swollen so as to float her through any state of the tide and she had besides this a hundred profundities and explanations  she rose superior above all on the happy fact that there were always gentlemen in town and that gentlemen were her greatest admirers gentlemen from the city in especialas to whom she was full of information about the passion and pride excited in such breasts by the elements of her charming commerce  the city men did in short go in for flowers  there was a certain type of awfully smart stockbrokerlord rye called them jews and bounders but she didnt carewhose extravagance she more than once threw out had really if one had any conscience to be forcibly restrained  it was not perhaps a pure love of beauty it was a matter of vanity and a sign of business they wished to crush their rivals and that was one of their weapons  mrs jordans shrewdness was extreme she knew in any case her customershe dealt as she said with all sorts and it was at the worst a race for hera race even in the dull monthsfrom one set of chambers to another  and then after all there were also still the ladies the ladies of stockbroking circles were perpetually up and down  they were not quite perhaps mrs bubb or lady ventnor but you couldnt tell the difference unless you quarrelled with them and then you knew it only by their makingup sooner  these ladies formed the branch of her subject on which she most swayed in the breeze to that degree that her confidant had ended with an inference or two tending to banish regret for opportunities not embraced  there were indeed teagowns that mrs jordan describedbut teagowns were not the whole of respectability and it was odd that a clergymans widow should sometimes speak as if she almost thought so  she came back it was true unfailingly to lord rye never evidently quite losing sight of him even on the longest excursions  that he was kindness itself had become in fact the very moral it all pointedpointed in strange flashes of the poor womans nearsighted eyes  she launched at her young friend portentous looks solemn heralds of some extraordinary communication  the communication itself from week to week hung fire but it was to the facts over which it hovered that she owed her power of going on  they are in one way and another she often emphasised a tower of strength and as the allusion was to the aristocracy the girl could quite wonder why if they were so in one way they should require to be so in two  she thoroughly knew however how many ways mrs jordan counted in  it all meant simply that her fate was pressing her close  if that fate was to be sealed at the matrimonial altar it was perhaps not remarkable that she shouldnt come all at once to the scratch of overwhelming a mere telegraphist  it would necessarily present to such a person a prospect of regretful sacrifice  lord ryeif it was lord ryewouldnt be kind to a nonentity of that sort even though people quite as good had been  one sunday afternoon in november they went by arrangement to church together after whichon the inspiration of the moment the arrangement had not included itthey proceeded to mrs jordans lodging in the region of maida vale  she had raved to her friend about her service of predilection she was excessively high and had more than once wished to introduce the girl to the same comfort and privilege  there was a thick brown fog and maida vale tasted of acrid smoke but they had been sitting among chants and incense and wonderful music during which though the effect of such things on her mind was great our young lady had indulged in a series of reflexions but indirectly related to them one of these was the result of mrs jordans having said to her on the way and with a certain fine significance that lord rye had been for some time in town  she had spoken as if it were a circumstance to which little required to be addedas if the bearing of such an item on her life might easily be grasped  perhaps it was the wonder of whether lord rye wished to marry her that made her guest with thoughts straying to that quarter quite determine that some other nuptials also should take place at saint julians  mr mudge was still an attendant at his wesleyan chapel but this was the least of her worriesit had never even vexed her enough for her to so much as name it to mrs jordan  mr mudges form of worship was one of several thingsthey made up in superiority and beauty for what they wanted in numberthat she had long ago settled he should take from her and she had now moreover for the first time definitely established her own  its principal feature was that it was to be the same as that of mrs jordan and lord rye which was indeed very much what she said to her hostess as they sat together later on  the brown fog was in this hostesss little parlour where it acted as a postponement of the question of there being besides anything else than the teacups and a pewter pot and a very black little fire and a paraffin lamp without a shade  there was at any rate no sign of a flower it was not for herself mrs jordan gathered sweets  the girl waited till they had had a cup of teawaited for the announcement that she fairly believed her friend had this time possessed herself of her formally at last to make but nothing came after the interval save a little poke at the fire which was like the clearing of a throat for a speech     chapter xxv   i think you must have heard me speak of mr drake  mrs jordan had never looked so queer nor her smile so suggestive of a large benevolent bite  mr drake  oh yes isnt he a friend of lord rye  a great and trusted friend  almosti may saya loved friend  mrs jordans almost had such an oddity that her companion was moved rather flippantly perhaps to take it up  dont people as good as love their friends when they i trust them  it pulled up a little the eulogist of mr drake  well my dear i love you  but you dont trust me the girl unmercifully asked  again mrs jordan pausedstill she looked queer  yes she replied with a certain austerity thats exactly what im about to give you rather a remarkable proof of  the sense of its being remarkable was already so strong that while she bridled a little this held her auditor in a momentary muteness of submission  mr drake has rendered his lordship for several years services that his lordship has highly appreciated and that make it all the moreaunexpected that they should perhaps a little suddenly separate  separate  our young lady was mystified but she tried to be interested and she already saw that she had put the saddle on the wrong horse  she had heard something of mr drake who was a member of his lordships circlethe member with whom apparently mrs jordans avocations had most happened to throw her  she was only a little puzzled at the separation  well at any rate she smiled if they separate as friends  oh his lordship takes the greatest interest in mr drakes future  hell do anything for him he has in fact just done a great deal  there must you know be changes  no one knows it better than i the girl said  she wished to draw her interlocutress out  there will be changes enough for me  youre leaving cockers  the ornament of that establishment waited a moment to answer and then it was indirect  tell me what youre doing  well what will you think of it  why that youve found the opening you were always so sure of  mrs jordan on this appeared to muse with embarrassed intensity  i was always sure yesand yet i often wasnt  well i hope youre sure now  sure i mean of mr drake  yes my dear i think i may say i am  i kept him going till i was  then hes yours  my very own  how nice  and awfully rich our young woman went on  mrs jordan showed promptly enough that she loved for higher things awfully handsomesix foot two  and he has put by  quite like mr mudge then that gentlemans friend rather desperately exclaimed  oh not quite mr drakes was ambiguous about it but the name of mr mudge had evidently given her some sort of stimulus  hell have more opportunity now at any rate  hes going to lady bradeen  to lady bradeen  this was bewilderment  going  the girl had seen from the way mrs jordan looked at her that the effect of the name had been to make her let something out  do you know her  she floundered but she found her feet  well youll remember ive often told you that if youve grand clients i have them too  yes said mrs jordan but the great difference is that you hate yours whereas i really love mine  do you know lady bradeen she pursued  down to the ground  shes always in and out  mrs jordans foolish eyes confessed in fixing themselves on this sketch to a degree of wonder and even of envy  but she bore up and with a certain gaiety do you hate her she demanded  her visitors reply was prompt  dear nonot nearly so much as some of them  shes too outrageously beautiful  mrs jordan continued to gaze  outrageously  well yes deliciously  what was really delicious was mrs jordans vagueness  you dont know heryouve not seen her her guest lightly continued  no but ive heard a great deal about her  so have i our young lady exclaimed  jordan looked an instant as if she suspected her good faith or at least her seriousness  you know some friend  of lady bradeens  oh yesi know one  only one  the girl laughed out  only onebut hes so intimate  mrs jordan just hesitated  hes a gentleman  yes hes not a lady  her interlocutress appeared to muse  shes immensely surrounded  she will bewith mr drake  mrs jordans gaze became strangely fixed  is she very goodlooking  the handsomest person i know  mrs jordan continued to brood  well i know some beauties  then with her odd jerkiness do you think she looks good  because thats not always the case with the goodlookingthe other took it up  no indeed it isnt thats one thing cockers has taught me  still there are some people who have everything  lady bradeen at any rate has enough eyes and a nose and a mouth a complexion a figure  a figure mrs jordan almost broke in  a figure a head of hair  the girl made a little conscious motion that seemed to let the hair all down and her companion watched the wonderful show  but mr drake is another  anothermrs jordans thoughts had to come back from a distance  of her ladyships admirers  hes going you say to her  at this mrs jordan really faltered  she has engaged him  engaged himour young woman was quite at sea  in the same capacity as lord rye  and was lord rye engaged     chapter xxvi   mrs jordan looked away from her nowlooked she thought rather injured and as if trifled with even a little angry  the mention of lady bradeen had frustrated for a while the convergence of our heroines thoughts but with this impression of her old friends combined impatience and diffidence they began again to whirl round her and continued it till one of them appeared to dart at her out of the dance as if with a sharp peck  it came to her with a lively shock with a positive sting that mr drake wascould it be possible  with the idea she found herself afresh on the edge of laughter of a sudden and strange perversity of mirth  mr drake loomed in a swift image before her such a figure as she had seen in open doorways of houses in cockers quartermajestic middleaged erect flanked on either side by a footman and taking the name of a visitor  mr drake then verily was a person who opened the door  before she had time however to recover from the effect of her evocation she was offered a vision which quite engulfed it  it was communicated to her somehow that the face with which she had seen it rise prompted mrs jordan to dash a bit wildly at something at anything that might attenuate criticism  lady bradeens rearrangingshes going to be married  married  the girl echoed it ever so softly but there it was at last  didnt you know it  she summoned all her sturdiness  no she hasnt told me  and her friendshavent they  i havent seen any of them lately  im not so fortunate as you  mrs jordan gathered herself  then you havent even heard of lord bradeens death  her comrade unable for a moment to speak gave a slow headshake  you know it from mr drake  it was better surely not to learn things at all than to learn them by the butler  she tells him everything  and he tells youi see  our young lady got up recovering her muff and her gloves she smiled  well i havent unfortunately any mr drake i congratulate you with all my heart  even without your sort of assistance however theres a trifle here and there that i do pick up  i gather that if shes to marry any one it must quite necessarily be my friend  mrs jordan was now also on her feet  is captain everard your friend  the girl considered drawing on a glove  i saw at one time an immense deal of him  mrs jordan looked hard at the glove but she hadnt after all waited for that to be sorry it wasnt cleaner  what time was that  it must have been the time you were seeing so much of mr drake  she had now fairly taken it in the distinguished person mrs jordan was to marry would answer bells and put on coals and superintend at least the cleaning of boots for the other distinguished person whom she mightwell whom she might have had if she had wished so much more to say to  good bye she added goodbye  mrs jordan however again taking her muff from her turned it over brushed it off and thoughtfully peeped into it  tell me this before you go  you spoke just now of your own changes  do you mean that mr mudge  mr mudge has had great patience with mehe has brought me at last to the point  were to be married next month and have a nice little home but hes only a grocer you knowthe girl met her friends intent eyesso that im afraid that with the set youve got into you wont see your way to keep up our friendship  mrs jordan for a moment made no answer to this she only held the muff up to her face after which she gave it back  you dont like it  i see i see  to her guests astonishment there were tears now in her eyes  i dont like what the girl asked  why my engagement  only with your great cleverness the poor lady quavered out you put it in your own way  i mean that youll cool off you already have  and on this the next instant her tears began to flow  she succumbed to them and collapsed she sank down again burying her face and trying to smother her sobs  her young friend stood there still in some rigour but taken much by surprise even if not yet fully moved to pity  i dont put anything in any way and im very glad youre suited  only you know you did put to me so splendidly what even for me if i had listened to you it might lead to  mrs jordan kept up a mild thin weak wail then drying her eyes as feebly considered this reminder  it has led to my not starving she faintly gasped  our young lady at this dropped into the place beside her and now in a rush the small silly misery was clear  she took her hand as a sign of pitying it then after another instant confirmed this expression with a consoling kiss  they sat there together they looked out hand in hand into the damp dusky shabby little room and into the future of no such very different suggestion at last accepted by each  there was no definite utterance on either side of mr drakes position in the great world but the temporary collapse of his prospective bride threw all further necessary light and what our heroine saw and felt for in the whole business was the vivid reflexion of her own dreams and delusions and her own return to reality  reality for the poor things they both were could only be ugliness and obscurity could never be the escape the rise  she pressed her friendshe had tact enough for thatwith no other personal question brought on no need of further revelations only just continued to hold and comfort her and to acknowledge by stiff little forbearances the common element in their fate  she felt indeed magnanimous in such matters since if it was very well for condolence or reassurance to suppress just then invidious shrinkings she yet by no means saw herself sitting down as she might say to the same table with mr drake  there would luckily to all appearance be little question of tables and the circumstance that on their peculiar lines her friends interests would still attach themselves to mayfair flung over chalk farm the first radiance it had shown  where was ones pride and ones passion when the real way to judge of ones luck was by making not the wrong but the right comparison  before she had again gathered herself to go she felt very small and cautious and thankful  we shall have our own house she said and you must come very soon and let me show it you  we shall have our own too mrs jordan replied for dont you know he makes it a condition that he sleeps out  a conditionthe girl felt out of it  for any new position  it was on that he parted with lord rye  his lordship cant meet it  so mr drake has given him up  and all for youour young woman put it as cheerfully as possible  for me and lady bradeen  her ladyships too glad to get him at any price  lord rye out of interest in us has in fact quite made her take him  so as i tell you he will have his own establishment  mrs jordan in the elation of it had begun to revive but there was nevertheless between them rather a conscious pausea pause in which neither visitor nor hostess brought out a hope or an invitation  it expressed in the last resort that in spite of submission and sympathy they could now after all only look at each other across the social gulf they remained together as if it would be indeed their last chance still sitting though awkwardly quite close and feeling alsoand this most unmistakeablythat there was one thing more to go into  by the time it came to the surface moreover our young friend had recognised the whole of the main truth from which she even drew again a slight irritation  it was not the main truth perhaps that most signified but after her momentary effort her embarrassment and her tears mrs jordan had begun to sound afreshand even without speakingthe note of a social connexion  she hadnt really let go of it that she was marrying into society  well it was a harmless compensation and it was all the prospective bride of mr mudge had to leave with her     chapter xxvii   this young lady at last rose again but she lingered before going  and has captain everard nothing to say to it  to what dear  why to such questionsthe domestic arrangements things in the house  how can he with any authority when nothing in the house is his  not his  the girl wondered perfectly conscious of the appearance she thus conferred on mrs jordan of knowing in comparison with herself so tremendously much about it  well there were things she wanted so to get at that she was willing at last though it hurt her to pay for them with humiliation  why are they not his  dont you know dear that he has nothing  nothing  it was hard to see him in such a light but mrs jordans power to answer for it had a superiority that began on the spot to grow  isnt he rich  mrs jordan looked immensely looked both generally and particularly informed  it depends upon what you call  not at any rate in the least as she is  what does he bring  think what she has  and then love his debts  his debts  his young friend was fairly betrayed into helpless innocence  she could struggle a little but she had to let herself go and if she had spoken frankly she would have said do tell me for i dont know so much about him as that  as she didnt speak frankly she only said his debts are nothingwhen she so adores him  mrs jordan began to fix her again and now she saw that she must only take it all  that was what it had come to his having sat with her there on the bench and under the trees in the summer darkness and put his hand on her making her know what he would have said if permitted his having returned to her afterwards repeatedly with supplicating eyes and a fever in his blood and her having on her side hard and pedantic helped by some miracle and with her impossible condition only answered him yet supplicating back through the bars of the cageall simply that she might hear of him now for ever lost only through mrs jordan who touched him through mr drake who reached him through lady bradeen she adores himbut of course that wasnt all there was about it  the girl met her eyes a minute then quite surrendered  what was there else about it  why dont you knowmrs jordan was almost compassionate  her interlocutress had in the cage sounded depths but there was a suggestion here somehow of an abyss quite measureless  of course i know she would never let him alone  how could shefancywhen he had so compromised her  the most artless cry they had ever uttered broke at this from the younger pair of lips  had he so  why dont you know the scandal  our heroine thought recollected there was something whatever it was that she knew after all much more of than mrs jordan  she saw him again as she had seen him come that morning to recover the telegramshe saw him as she had seen him leave the shop  she perched herself a moment on this  oh there was nothing public  not exactly publicno  but there was an awful scare and an awful row it was all on the very point of coming out  something was lostsomething was found  ah yes the girl replied smiling as if with the revival of a blurred memory something was found  it all got aboutand there was a point at which lord bradeen had to act  had toyes  but he didnt  mrs jordan was obliged to admit it  no he didnt  and then luckily for them he died  i didnt know about his death her companion said  it was nine weeks ago and most sudden  it has given them a prompt chance  to get marriedthis was a wonderwithin nine weeks  oh not immediately butin all the circumstancesvery quietly and i assure you very soon  every preparations made  above all she holds him  oh yes she holds him our young friend threw off  she had this before her again a minute then she continued you mean through his having made her talked about  yes but not only that  she has still another pull  another  mrs jordan hesitated  why he was in something  her comrade wondered  in what  i dont know  something bad  as i tell you something was found  the girl stared  well  it would have been very bad for him  but she helped him some wayshe recovered it got hold of it  its even said she stole it  our young woman considered afresh  why it was what was found that precisely saved him  mrs jordan however was positive  i beg your pardon  i happen to know  her disciple faltered but an instant  do you mean through mr drake  do they tell him these things  a good servant said mrs jordan now thoroughly superior and proportionately sententious doesnt need to be told  her ladyship savedas a woman so often savesthe man she loves  this time our heroine took longer to recover herself but she found a voice at last  ah wellof course i dont know  the great thing was that he got off  they seem then in a manner she added to have done a great deal for each other  well its she that has done most  she has him tight  i see i see  goodbye  the women had already embraced and this was not repeated but mrs jordan went down with her guest to the door of the house  here again the younger lingered reverting though three or four other remarks had on the way passed between them to captain everard and lady bradeen  did you mean just now that if she hadnt saved him as you call it she wouldnt hold him so tight  well i dare say  mrs jordan on the doorstep smiled with a reflexion that had come to her she took one of her big bites of the brown gloom  men always dislike one when theyve done one an injury  but what injury had he done her  the one ive mentioned  he must marry her you know  and didnt he want to  not before  not before she recovered the telegram  mrs jordan was pulled up a little  was it a telegram  the girl hesitated  i thought you said so  i mean whatever it was  yes whatever it was i dont think she saw that  so she just nailed him  she just nailed him  the departing friend was now at the bottom of the little flight of steps the other was at the top with a certain thickness of fog  and when am i to think of you in your little homenext month asked the voice from the top  at the very latest  and when am i to think of you in yours  oh even sooner  i feel after so much talk with you about it as if i were already there  then goodbye came out of the fog  goodbye went into it  our young lady went into it also in the opposed quarter and presently after a few sightless turns came out on the paddington canal  distinguishing vaguely what the low parapet enclosed she stopped close to it and stood a while very intently but perhaps still sightlessly looking down on it  a policeman while she remained strolled past her then going his way a little further and half lost in the atmosphere paused and watched her  but she was quite unawareshe was full of her thoughts  they were too numerous to find a place just here but two of the number may at least be mentioned  one of these was that decidedly her little home must be not for next month but for next week the other which came indeed as she resumed her walk and went her way was that it was strange such a matter should be at last settled for her by mr drake
