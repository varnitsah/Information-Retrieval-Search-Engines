47034480	the journal to stella  by jonathan swift  with preface introduction and notes by george a aitken  numbers thus 5 refer to the notes at the end which are arranged by introduction or by letter number     preface   the history of the publication of the journal to stella is somewhat curious on swifts death twentyfive of the letters forming the closing portion of the series fell into the hands of dr lyon a clergyman who had been in charge of swift for some years the letters passed to a man named wilkes who sold them for publication they accordingly appeared in 1766 in the tenth volume of dr hawkesworths quarto edition of swifts works but the editor made many changes in the text including a suppression of most of the little language the publishers however fortunately for us were publicspirited enough to give the manuscripts with one exception to the british museum where after many years they were examined by john forster who printed in his unfinished life of swift numerous passages from the originals showing the manner in which the text had been tampered with by hawkesworth swift himself too in his later years obliterated many words and sentences in the letters and forster was able to restore not a few of these omissions his zeal however sometimes led him to make guesses at words which are quite undecipherable besides forsters work i have had the benefit of the careful collation made by mr ryland for his edition of 1897 where these authorities differ i have usually found myself in agreement with mr ryland but i have felt justified in accepting some of forsters readings which were rejected by him as uncertain and the examination of the manuscripts has enabled me to make some additions and corrections of my own swifts writing is extremely small and abounds in abbreviations the difficulty of arriving at the true reading is therefore considerable apart from the erasures  the remainder of the journal consisting of the first forty letters was published in 1768 by deane swift dr swifts second cousin these letters had been given to mrs whiteway in 1788 and by her to her soninlaw deane swift the originals have been lost with the exception of the first which by some accident is in the british museum but it is evident that deane swift took even greater liberties with the text than hawkesworth he substituted for ppt the word stella a name which swift seems not to have used until some years later he adopted the name presto for swift and in other ways tried to give a greater literary finish to the letters the whole of the correspondence was first brought together under the title of the journal to stella in sheridans edition of 1784  previous editions of the journal have been but slightly annotated swifts letters abound with allusions to people of all classes with whom he came in contact in london and to others known to esther johnson in ireland and a large proportion of these persons have been passed over in discreet silence by sir walter scott and others the task of the annotator has of course been made easier of late years by the publication of contemporary journals and letters and of useful works of reference dealing with parliament the army the church the civil service and the like besides the invaluable dictionary of national biography i have also been assisted by a collection of ms notes kindly placed at my disposal by mr thomas seccombe i have aimed at brevity and relevance but it is hoped that the reader will find all the information that is necessary here and there a name has baffled research but i have been able to give definite particulars of a very large number of peoplenoblemen and ladies in society in london or dublin members of parliament doctors clergymen government officials and others who have hitherto been but names to the reader of the journal i have corrected a good many errors in the older notes but in dealing with so large a number of persons some of whom it is difficult to identify i cannot hope that i myself have escaped pitfalls  g a a     introduction  when swift began to write the letters known as the journal to stella he was fortytwo years of age and esther johnson twentynine perhaps the most useful introduction to the correspondence will be a brief setting forth of what is known of their friendship from stellas childhood the more specially as the question has been obscured by many assertions and theories resting on a very slender basis of fact  jonathan swift born in 1667 after his fathers death was educated by his uncle godwin and after a not very successful career at trinity college dublin went to stay with his mother abigail erick at leicester mrs swift feared that her son would fall in love with a girl named betty jones but as swift told a friend he had had experience enough not to think of marriage till i settle my fortune in the world which i am sure will not be in some years and even then i am so hard to please that i suppose i shall put it off to the other world soon afterwards an opening for swift presented itself sir william temple now living in retirement at moor park near farnham had been like his father master of the irish rolls and had thus become acquainted with swifts uncle godwin moreover lady temple was related to mrs swift as lord orrery tells us thanks to these facts the application to sir william temple was successful and swift went to live at moor park before the end of 1689 there he read to temple wrote for him and kept his accounts and growing into confidence with his employer was often trusted with matters of great importance the storyafterwards improved upon by lord macaulaythat swift received only 20 pounds and his board and was not allowed to sit at table with his master is wholly untrustworthy within three years of their first intercourse temple had introduced his secretary to william the third and sent him to london to urge the king to consent to a bill for triennial parliaments  when swift took up his residence at moor park he found there a little girl of eight daughter of a merchant named edward johnson who had died young swift says that esther johnson was born on march 18 1681 in the parish register of richmond1 which shows that she was baptized on march 20 168081 her name is given as hester but she signed her will esther the name by which she was always known swift says her father was a younger brother of a good family in nottinghamshire her mother of a lower degree and indeed she had little to boast in her birth mrs johnson had two children esther and ann and lived at moor park as companion to lady giffard temples widowed sister another member of the household afterwards to be esthers constant companion was rebecca dingley a relative of the temple family2 she was a year or two older than swift  the lonely young man of twentytwo was both playfellow and teacher of the delicate child of eight how he taught her to write has been charmingly brought before us in the painting exhibited by miss dicksee at the royal academy a few years ago he advised her what books to read and instructed her as he says in the principles of honour and virtue from which she never swerved in any one action or moment of her life  by 1694 swift had grown tired of his position and finding that temple who valued his services was slow in finding him preferment he left moor park in order to carry out his resolve to go into the church he was ordained and obtained the prebend of kilroot near belfast where he carried on a flirtation with a miss waring whom he called varina but in may 1696 temple made proposals which induced swift to return to moor park where he was employed in preparing temples memoirs and correspondence for publication and in supporting the side taken by temple in the letters of phalaris controversy by writing the battle of the books which was however not published until 1704 on his return to temples house swift found his old playmate grown from a sickly child into a girl of fifteen in perfect health she came he says to be looked upon as one of the most beautiful graceful and agreeable young women in london only a little too fat her hair was blacker than a raven and every feature of her face in perfection  on his death in january 1699 temple left a will3 dated 1694 directing the payment of 20 pounds each with half a years wages to bridget johnson and all my other servants and leaving a lease of some land in monistown county wicklow to esther johnson servant to my sister giffard by a codicil of february 1698 temple left 100 pounds to mr jonathan swift now living with me it may be added that by her will of 1722 proved in the following year lady giffard gave 20 pounds to mrs mossmrs bridget johnson who had married richard mose or moss lady giffards steward the will proceeds to mrs hester sic johnson i give 10 pounds with the 100 pounds i put into the exchequer for her life and my own and declare the 100 pounds to be hers which i am told is there in my name upon the survivorship and for which she has constantly sent over her certificate and received the interest i give her besides my two little silver candlesticks  temple left in swifts hands the task of publishing his posthumous works a duty which afterwards led to a quarrel with lady giffard and other members of the family many years later swift told lord palmerston that he stopped at moor park solely for the benefit of temples conversation and advice and the opportunity of pursuing his studies at temples death he was as far to seek as ever in the summer of 1699 however he was offered and accepted the post of secretary and chaplain to the earl of berkeley one of the lords justices but when he reached ireland he found that the secretaryship had been given to another he soon however obtained the living of laracor agher and rathbeggan and the prebend of dunlavin in st patricks cathedral dublin the total value of these preferments was about 230 pounds a year an income which miss waring seems to have thought enough to justify him in marrying swifts reply to the lady whom he had singled out at first from the rest of women could only have been written with the intention of breaking off the connection and accordingly we hear no more of poor varina  at laracor a mile or two from trim and twenty miles from dublin swift ministered to a congregation of about fifteen persons and had abundant leisure for cultivating his garden making a canal after the dutch fashion of moor park planting willows and rebuilding the vicarage as chaplain to lord berkeley he spent much of his time in dublin he was on intimate terms with lady berkeley and her daughters one of whom is best known by her married name of lady betty germaine and through them he had access to the fashionable society of dublin when lord berkeley returned to england in april 1701 swift after taking his doctors degree at dublin went with him and soon afterwards published anonymously a political pamphlet a discourse on the contests and dissentions in athens and rome when he returned to ireland in september he was accompanied by stellato give esther johnson the name by which she is best knownand her friend mrs dingley stellas fortune was about 1500 pounds and the property temple had left her was in county wicklow swift very much for his own satisfaction who had few friends or acquaintance in ireland persuaded stellanow twenty years oldthat living was cheaper there than in england and that a better return was obtainable on money the ladies took his advice and made ireland their home at first they felt themselves strangers in dublin the adventure looked so like a frolic swift says the censure held for some time as if there were a secret history in such a removal which however soon blew off by her excellent conduct swift took every step that was possible to avoid scandal when he was away the ladies occupied his rooms when he returned they went into their own lodgings when he was absent they often stopped at the vicarage at laracor but if he were there they moved to trim where they visited the vicar dr raymond or lived in lodgings in the town or neighbourhood swift was never with stella except in the presence of a third person and in 1726 he said that he had not seen her in a morning these dozen years except once or twice in a journey  during a visit to england in the winter of 17034 we find swift in correspondence with the rev william tisdall a dublin incumbent whom he had formerly known at belfast tisdall was on friendly terms with stella and mrs dingley and swift sent messages to them through him pray put them upon reading he wrote and be always teaching something to mrs johnson because she is good at comprehending remembering and retaining but the correspondence soon took a different turn tisdall paid his addresses to stella and charged swift with opposing his suit tisdalls letters are missing but swifts reply of april 20 1704 puts things sufficiently clearly my conjecture is he says that you think i obstructed your inclinations to please my own and that my intentions were the same with yours in answer to all which i will upon my conscience and honour tell you the naked truth first i think i have said to you before that if my fortunes and humour served me to think of that state i should certainly among all persons upon earth make your choice because i never saw that person whose conversation i entirely valued but hers this was the utmost i ever gave way to and secondly i must assure you sincerely that this regard of mine never once entered into my head to be an impediment to you he had thought tisdall not rich enough to marry but the objection of your fortune being removed i declare i have no other nor shall any consideration of my own misfortune in losing so good a friend and companion as her prevail on me against her interest and settlement in the world since it is held so necessary and convenient a thing for ladies to marry and that time takes off from the lustre of virgins in all other eyes but mine i appeal to my letters to herself whether i was your friend or not in the whole concern though the part i designed to act in it was purely passive he had even thought it could not be decently broken without disadvantage to the ladys credit since he supposed it was known to the town and he had always spoken of her in a manner far from discouraging though he knew many ladies of rank he had nowhere met with an humour a wit or conversation so agreeable a better portion of good sense or a truer judgment of men or things he envied tisdall his prudence and temper and love of peace and settlement the reverse of which has been the great uneasiness of my life and is likely to continue so  this letter has been quoted at some length because of its great importance it is obviously capable of various interpretations and some like dr johnson have concluded that swift was resolved to keep stella in his power and therefore prevented an advantageous match by making unreasonable demands i cannot see any ground for this interpretation though it is probable that tisdalls appearance as a suitor was sufficiently annoying there is no evidence that stella viewed tisdalls proposal with any favour unless it can be held to be furnished by swifts belief that the town thoughtrightly or wronglythat there was an engagement in any case there could be no mistake in future with regard to swifts attitude towards stella she was dearer to him than anyone else and his feeling for her would not change but for marriage he had neither fortune nor humour tisdall consoled himself by marrying another lady two years afterwards and though for a long time swift entertained for him feelings of dislike in later life their relations improved and tisdall was one of the witnesses to swifts will  the tale of a tub was published in 1704 and swift was soon in constant intercourse with addison and the other wits while he was in england in 1705 stella and mrs dingley made a short visit to london this and a similar visit in 1708 are the only occasions on which stella is known to have left ireland after taking up her residence in that country swifts influence over women was always very striking most of the toasts of the day were his friends and he insisted that any lady of wit and quality who desired his acquaintance should make the first advances this he sayswriting in 1730had been an established rule for over twenty years in 1708 a dispute on this question with one toast mrs long was referred for settlement to ginckel vanhomrigh the son of the house where it was proposed that the meeting should take place and by the decisionwhich was in swifts favourmrs vanhomrigh and her fair daughter hessy were forbidden to aid mrs long in her disobedience for the future this is the first that we hear of hester or esther vanhomrigh who was afterwards to play so marked a part in the story of swifts life born on february 14 1690 she was now eighteen her father bartholomew vanhomrigh a dublin merchant of dutch origin had died in 1703 leaving his wife a fortune of some sixteen thousand pounds on the income from this money mrs vanhomrigh with her two daughters hester and mary were able to mix in fashionable society in london swift was introduced to them by sir andrew fountaine early in 1708 but evidently stella did not make their acquaintance nor indeed hear much if anything of them until the time of the journal  swifts visit to london in 17079 had for its object the obtaining for the irish church of the surrender by the crown of the firstfruits and twentieths which brought in about 2500 pounds a year nothing came of swifts interviews with the whig statesmen and after many disappointments he returned to laracor june 1709 and conversed with none but stella and her cardplaying friends and addison now secretary to lord wharton4 next year came the fall of the whigs and a request to swift from the irish bishops that he would renew the application for the firstfruits in the hope that there would be greater success with the tories swift reached london in september 1710 and began the series of letters giving details of the events of each day which now form the journal to stella i will write something every day to md he says and make it a sort of journal and when it is full i will send it whether md writes or no and so that will be pretty and i shall always be in conversation with md and md with presto it is interesting to note that by way of caution these letters were usually addressed to mrs dingley and not to stella  the story of swifts growing intimacy with the tory leaders of the success of his mission of the increasing coolness towards older acquaintances and of his services to the government can best be read in the journal itself in the meantime the intimacy with the vanhomrighs grew rapidly they were near neighbours of swifts and in a few weeks after his arrival in town we find frequent allusions to the dinners at their house where he kept his best gown and periwig sometimes with the explanation that he went there out of mere listlessness or because it was wet or because another engagement had broken down only thrice does he mention the eldest daughter once on her birthday once on the occasion of a trick played him when he received a message that she was suddenly very ill i rattled off the daughter and once to state that she was come of age and was going to ireland to look after her fortune there is evidence that miss essy or vanessa to give her the name by which she will always be known was in correspondence with swift in july 1710while he was still in irelandand in the spring of 17115 and early in 1711 stella seems to have expressed surprise at swifts intimacy with the family for in february he replied you say they are of no consequence why they keep as good female company as i do male i see all the drabs of quality at this end of the town with them in the autumn swift seems to have thought that vanessa was keeping company with a certain hatton but mrs longpossibly meaning to give him a warning hintremarked that if this were so she is not the girl i took her for but to me she seems melancholy  in 1712 occasional letters took the place of the daily journal to md but there is no change in the affectionate style in which swift wrote in the spring he had a long illness which affected him indeed throughout the year other reasons which he gives for the falling off in his correspondence are his numerous business engagements and the hope of being able to send some good news of an appointment for himself there is only one letter to stella between july 19 and september 15 and dr birkbeck hill argues that the poem cadenus and vanessa was composed at that time6 if this be so it must have been altered next year because it was not until 1713 that swift was made a dean writing on april 19 1726 swift said that the poem was written at windsor near fourteen years ago and dated it was a task performed on a frolic among some ladies and she it was addressed to died some time ago in dublin and on her death the copy shewn by her executor several copies were in circulation and he was indifferent what was done with it it was only a cavalier business and if those who would not give allowances were malicious it was only what he had long expected  from this letter it would appear that this remarkable poem was written in the summer of 1712 whereas the titlepage of the pamphlet says it was written at windsor 1713 swift visited windsor in both years but he had more leisure in 1712 and we know that vanessa was also at windsor in that year in that year too he was fortyfour the age mentioned in the poem neither swift nor vanessa forgot this intercourse years afterwards swift wrote to her go over the scenes of windsor cad thinks often of these and again remember the indisposition at windsor we know that this poem was revised in 1719 when in all probability swift added the lines to which most exception can be taken cadenus was to be vanessas instructor       his conduct might have made him styled       a father and the nymph his child  he had grown old in politics and wit and in every scene had kept his heart so that he now understood not what was love but he had written much and vanessa admired his wit cadenus found that her thoughts wandered       though she seemed to listen more       to all he spoke than eer before  when she confessed her love he was filled with shame disappointment guilt surprise he had aimed only at cultivating the mind and had hardly known whether she was young or old but he was flattered and though he could not give her love he offered her friendship with gratitude respect esteem vanessa took him at his word and said she would now be tutor though he was not apt to learn       but what success vanessa met       is to the world a secret yet       whether the nymph to please her swain       talks in a high romantic strain       or whether he at last descends       to act with less seraphic ends       or to compound the business whether       they temper love and books together       must never to mankind be told       nor shall the conscious muse unfold  such is the poem as we now have it written it must be remembered for vanessas private perusal it is to be regretted for her own sake that she did not destroy it  swift received the reward of his services to the governmentthe deanery of st patricks dublinin april 1713 disappointed at what he regarded as exile he left london in june vanessa immediately began to send him letters which brought home to him the extent of her passion and she hinted at jealousy in the words if you are very happy it is illnatured of you not to tell me so except tis what is inconsistent with my own in his reply swift dwelt upon the dreariness of his surroundings at laracor and reminded her that he had said he would endeavour to forget everything in england and would write as seldom as he could  swift was back again in the political strife in london in september taking oxfords part in the quarrel between that statesman and bolingbroke on the fall of the tories at the death of queen anne he saw that all was over and retired to ireland not to return again for twelve years in the meantime the intimacy with vanessa had been renewed her mother had died leaving debts and she pressed swift for advice in the management of her affairs when she suggested coming to ireland where she had property he told her that if she took this step he would see her very seldom however she took up her abode at celbridge only a few miles from dublin swift gave her many cautions out of the perfect esteem and friendship he felt for her but he often visited her she was dissatisfied however begging him to speak kindly and at least to counterfeit his former indulgent friendship what can be wrong she wrote in seeing and advising an unhappy young woman you cannot but know that your frowns make my life unsupportable sometimes he treated the matter lightly sometimes he showed annoyance sometimes he assured her of his esteem and love but urged her not to make herself or him unhappy by imaginations he was uniformly unsuccessful in stopping vanessas importunity he endeavoured she said by severities to force her from him she knew she was the cause of uneasy reflections to him but nothing would lessen her inexpressible passion  unfortunately he failedpartly no doubt from mistaken considerations of kindness partly because he shrank from losing her affectionto take effective steps to put an end to vanessas hopes it would have been better if he had unhesitatingly made it clear to her that he could not return her passion and that if she could not be satisfied with friendship the intimacy must cease to quote sir henry craik the friendship had begun in literary guidance it was strengthened by flattery it lived on a cold and almost stern repression fed by confidences as to literary schemes and by occasional literary compliments but it never came to have a real hold over swifts heart  with 1716 we come to the alleged marriage with stella in 1752 seven years after swifts death lord orrery in his remarks on swift said that stella was the concealed but undoubted wife of dr swift if my informations are right she was married to dr swift in the year 1716 by dr ashe then bishop of clogher ten years earlier in 1742 in a letter to deane swift which i have not seen quoted before orrery spoke of the advantage of a wife to a man in his declining years nor had the dean felt a blow or wanted a companion had he been married or in other words had stella lived what this means is not at all clear in 1754 dr delany an old friend of swifts wrote in comment upon orrerys remarks your account of his marriage is i am satisfied true in 1789 george monck berkeley in his literary relics said that swift and stella were married by dr ashe who himself related the circumstances to bishop berkeley by whose relict the story was communicated to me dr ashe cannot have told bishop berkeley by word of mouth because ashe died in 1717 the year after the supposed marriage and berkeley was then still abroad but berkeley was at the time tutor to ashes son and may therefore have been informed by letter though it is difficult to believe that ashe would write about such a secret so soon after the event thomas sheridan on information received from his father dr sheridan swifts friend accepted the story of the marriage in his book 1784 adding particulars which are of very doubtful authenticity and johnson in his lives of the poets says that dr madden told him that stella had related her melancholy story to dr sheridan before her death on the other hand dr lyon swifts attendant in his later years disbelieved the story of the marriage which was he said founded only on hearsay and mrs dingley laughed at it as an idle tale founded on suspicion  sir henry craik is satisfied with the evidence for the marriage mr leslie stephen is of opinion that it is inconclusive and forster could find no evidence that is at all reasonably sufficient while mr stanley lanepoole mr churton collins and others are strongly of opinion that no such marriage ever took place a full discussion of the evidence would involve the consideration of the reliability of the witnesses and the probability of their having authentic information and would be out of place here my own opinion is that the evidence for the marriage is very far from convincing and this view seems to be confirmed by all that we know from his own letters of swifts relations with stella it has been suggested that she was pained by reports of swifts intercourse with vanessa and felt that his feelings towards herself were growing colder but this is surmise and no satisfactory explanation has been given to account for a form of marriage being gone through after so many years of the closest friendship there is no reason to suppose that there was at the time any gossip in circulation about stella and if her reputation was in question a marriage of which the secret was carefully kept would obviously be of no benefit to her moreover we are told that there was no change in their mode of life if they were married what reason could there be for keeping it a secret or for denying themselves the closer relationship of marriage the only possible benefit to stella was that swift would be prevented marrying anyone else it is impossible of course to disprove a marriage which we are told was secretly performed without banns or licence or witnesses but we may reasonably require strong evidence for so startling a step if we reject the tale the story of swifts connection with stella is at least intelligible while the acceptance of this marriage introduces many puzzling circumstances and makes it necessary to believe that during the remainder of stellas life swift repeatedly spoke of his wife as a friend and of himself as one who had never married7 what right have we to put aside swifts plain and repeated statements moreover his attitude towards vanessa for the remaining years of her life becomes much more culpable if we are to believe that he had given stella the claim of a wife upon him8  from 1719 onwards we have a series of poems to stella written chiefly in celebration of her birthday she was now thirtyeight swift says thirtyfourwe shant dispute a year or more and the verses abound in laughing allusions to her advancing years and wasting form hers was an angels face a little cracked but all men would crowd to her door when she was fourscore his verses to her had always been       without one word of cupids darts       of killing eyes or bleeding hearts       with friendship and esteem possessed       i neer admitted love a guest  her only fault was that she could not bear the lightest touch of blame her wit and sense her loving care in illnessto which he owed that fact that he was alive to say itmade her the best pattern of true friends she replied in lines written on swifts birthday in 1721 that she was his pupil and humble friend he had trained her judgment and refined her fancy and taste       you taught how i might youth prolong       by knowing what was right and wrong       how from my heart to bring supplies       of lustre to my fading eyes       how soon a beauteous mind repairs       the loss of changed or falling hairs       how wit and virtue from within       send out a smoothness oer the skin       your lectures could my fancy fix       and i can please at thirtysix  in 1723 vanessa is said to have written to stella or to swiftthere are discrepancies in the versions given by sheridan and lord orrery both of whom are unreliableasking whether the report that they were married was true swift we are told rode to celbridge threw down vanessas letter in a great rage and left without speaking a word9 vanessa whose health had been failing for some time died shortly afterwards having cancelled a will in swifts favour she left cadenus and vanessa for publication and when someone said that she must have been a remarkable woman to inspire such a poem stella replied that it was well known that the dean could write finely upon a broomstick  soon after this tragedy swift became engrossed in the irish agitation which led to the publication of the drapiers letters and in 1726 he paid a longdeferred visit to london taking with him the manuscript of gullivers travels while in england he was harassed by bad news of stella who had been in continued illhealth for some years his letters to friends in dublin show how greatly he suffered to the rev john worrall he wrote in a letter which he begged him to burn what you tell me of mrs johnson i have long expected with great oppression and heaviness of heart we have been perfect friends these thirtyfive years upon my advice they both came to ireland and have been ever since my constant companions and the remainder of my life will be a very melancholy scene when one of them is gone whom i most esteemed upon the score of every good quality that can possibly recommend a human creature he would not for the world be present at her death i should be a trouble to her and a torment to myself if stella came to dublin he begged that she might be lodged in some airy healthy part and not in the deanery where too it would be improper for her to die there is not a greater folly he thinks than to contract too great and intimate a friendship which must always leave the survivor miserable to dr stopford he wrote in similar terms of the younger of the two oldest and dearest friends i have in the world this was a person of my own rearing and instructing from childhood who excelled in every good quality that can possibly accomplish a human creature i know not what i am saying but believe me that violent friendship is much more lasting and as much engaging as violent love to dr sheridan he said i look upon this to be the greatest event that can ever happen to me but all my preparation will not suffice to make me bear it like a philosopher nor altogether like a christian there hath been the most intimate friendship between us from our childhood and the greatest merit on her side that ever was in one human creature towards another10 pope alludes in a letter to sheridan to the illness of swifts particular friend but with the exception of another reference by pope and of a curiously flippant remark by bolingbroke the subject is nowhere mentioned in swifts correspondence with his literary and fashionable friends in london  swift crossed to ireland in august fearing the worst but stella rallied and in the spring of 1727 he returned to london in august however there came alarming news when swift was himself suffering from giddiness and deafness to dr sheridan he wrote that the last act of life was always a tragedy at best it is a bitter aggravation to have ones best friend go before one life was indifferent to him if he recovered from his disorder it would only be to feel the loss of that person for whose sake only life was worth preserving i brought both those friends over that we might be happy together as long as god should please the knot is broken and the remaining person you know has ill answered the end and the other who is now to be lost is all that was valuable to worrall he again wrote in latin that stella ought not to be lodged at the deanery he had enemies who would place a bad interpretation upon it if she died there  swift left london for dublin in september he was detained some days at holyhead by stress of weather and in the private journal which he kept during that time he speaks of the suspense he was in about his dearest friend11 in december stella made a willsigned esther johnson spinsterdisposing of her property in the manner swift had suggested her allusions to swift are incompatible with any such feeling of resentment as is suggested by sheridan she died on january 28 1728 swift could not bear to be present but on the night of her death he began to write his very interesting character of mrs johnson from which passages have already been quoted he there calls her the truest most virtuous and valuable friend that i or perhaps any other person was ever blessed with combined with excellent gifts of the mind she had a gracefulness somewhat more than human in every motion word and action never was so happy a conjunction of civility freedom easiness and sincerity everyone treated her with marked respect yet everyone was at ease in her society she preserved her wit judgment and vivacity to the last but often complained of her memory she chose men rather than women for her companions the usual topic of ladies discourse being such as she had little knowledge of and less relish honour truth liberality good nature and modesty were the virtues she chiefly possessed and most valued in her acquaintance in some prayers used by swift during her last sickness he begged for pity for the mournful friends of thy distressed servant who sink under the weight of her present condition and the fear of losing the most valuable of our friends he was too ill to be present at the funeral at st patricks afterwards we are told a lock of her hair was found in his desk wrapped in a paper bearing the words only a womans hair  swift continued to produce pamphlets manifesting growing misanthropy though he showed many kindnesses to people who stood in need of help he seems to have given mrs dingley fifty guineas a year pretending that it came from a fund for which he was trustee the mental decay which he had always fearedi shall be like that tree he once said i shall die at the topbecame marked about 1738 paralysis was followed by aphasia and after acute pain followed by a long period of apathy death relieved him in october 1745 he was buried by stellas side in accordance with his wishes the bulk of his fortune was left to found a hospital for idiots and lunatics  there has been much rather fruitless discussion respecting the reason or reasons why swift did not marry stella for if there was any marriage it was nothing more than a form some have supposed that swift resolved to remain unmarried because the insanity of an uncle and the fits and giddiness to which he was always subject led him to fear insanity in his own case others looking rather to physical causes have dwelt upon his coldness of temperament and indisposition to love upon the repugnance he often showed towards marriage and the tone of some of the verses on the subject written in his later years others again have found a cause in his parsimonious habits in his dread of poverty the effects of which he had himself felt and in the smallness of his income at least until he was middleaged12 it may well be that one or all of these things influenced swifts action we cannot say more he himself as we have seen said as early as 1704 that if his humour and means had permitted him to think of marriage his choice would have been stella perhaps however there is not much mystery in the matter swift seems to have been wanting in passion probably he was satisfied with the affection which stella gave him and did not wish for more such an attachment as his usually results in marriage but not necessarily it is not sufficiently remembered that the affection began in stellas childhood they were perfect friends for nearly forty years and her advancing years in no way lessened his love which was independent of beauty whether stella was satisfied who shall say mrs oliphant thought that few women would be disposed to pity stella or think her life one of blight or injury mr leslie stephen says she might and probably did regard his friendship as a full equivalent for the sacrifice is it better to be the most intimate friend of a man of genius or the wife of a commonplace tisdall whatever we may surmise there is nothing to prove that she was disappointed she was the one star which brightened swifts stormtossed course it is well that she was spared seeing the wreck at the end   the journal to stella is interesting from many points of view for its bearing upon swifts relations with stella and upon his own character for the light which it throws upon the history of the time and upon prominent men of the day and for the illustrations it contains of the social life of people of various classes in london and elsewhere the fact that it was written without any thought of publication is one of its greatest attractions swift jotted down his opinions his hopes his disappointments without thought of their being seen by anybody but his correspondents the letters are transparently natural it has been said more than once that the journal by the nature of the case contains no fulllength portraits and hardly any sketches swift mentions the people he met but rarely stops to draw a picture of them but though this is true the casual remarks which he makes often give a vivid impression of what he thought of the person of whom he is speaking and in many cases those few words form a chief part of our general estimate of the man there are but few people of note at the time who are not mentioned in these pages we see queen anne holding a drawingroom in her bedroom she looked at us round with her fan in her mouth and once a minute said about three words to some that were nearest her we see harley afterwards the earl of oxford a pure trifler who was always putting off important business bolingbroke a thorough rake the prudent lord dartmouth the other secretary of state from whom swift could never work out a dinner there is marlborough covetous as hell and ambitious as the prince of it yet a great general and unduly pressed by the tories and the volatile earl of peterborough above fifty and as active as one of fiveandtwentythe ramblingest lying rogue on earth we meet poor congreve nearly blind and in fear of losing his commissionership the kindly arbuthnot the queens physician addison whom swift met more and more rarely busy with the preparation and production of cato steele careless as ever neglecting important appointments and governed by his wife most abominably prior poet and diplomatist with a lean carcass and young berkeley of trinity college dublin a very ingenious man and great philosopher whom swift determined to favour as much as he could mrs masham the duchess of somerset the duchess of shrewsbury the duchess of hamilton lady betty germaine and many other ladies appear with more or less distinctness besides a host of people of less note of whom we often know little but what swift tells us  swift throws much light too on the daily life of his time the bellman on his nightly rounds calling paaast twelvvve oclock the dinner at three or at the latest four the meetings at coffeehouses the booksales the visit to the london sightsthe lions at the tower bedlam the tombs in westminster abbey and the puppetshow the terrible mohocks of whom swift stood in so much fear the polite howdees sent to friends by footmen these and more are all described in the journal we read of curious habits and practices of fashionable ladies of the snuff used by mrs dingley and others of the jokesbites puns and the likeindulged in by polite persons when swift lodged at chelsea he reached london either by boat or by coachwhich was sometimes full when he wanted itor by walking across the five fields not without fear of robbers at night the going to or from ireland was a serious matter after the long journey by road came the voyage weather permitting of some fifteen hours with the risk of being seized or pursued by french privateers and when ireland was reached the roads were of the worst we have glimpses of fashionable society in dublin of the quiet life at laracor and trim and of the drinking of the waters at wexford where visitors had to put up with primitive arrangements mrs dingley never saw such a place in her life  swifts own characteristics come out in the clearest manner in the journal which gives all his hopes and fears during three busy years he was pleased to find on his arrival in london how great a value was set on his friendship by both political parties the whigs were ravished to see me and would lay hold on me as a twig while they are drowning but godolphins coldness enraged him so that he was almost vowing vengeance next day he talked treason heartily against the whigs their baseness and ingratitude and went home full of schemes of revenge the tories drily tell me i may make my fortune if i please but i do not understand them or rather i do understand them he realised that the tories might not be more grateful than others but he thought they were pursuing the true interests of the public and was glad to contribute what was in his power his vanity was gratified by harley inviting him to the private dinners with st john and harcourt which were given on saturdays and by their calling him jonathan but he did not hope too much from their friendship i said i believed they would leave me jonathan as they found me but i care not  of swifts frugal habits there is abundant evidence in the journal when he came to town he took rooms on a first floor a diningroom and bedchamber at eight shillings a week plaguy dear but i spend nothing for eating never go to a tavern and very seldom in a coach yet after all it will be expensive in november he mentions that he had a fire i am spending my second halfbushel of coals in another place he says people have so left the town that i am at a loss for a dinner it cost me eighteenpence in coachhire before i could find a place to dine in elsewhere we find this paper does not cost me a farthing i have it from the secretarys office he often complains of having to take a coach owing to the dirty condition of the streets this rain ruins me in coachhire i walked away sixpennyworth and came within a shilling length and then took a coach and got a lift back for nothing13  swifts arrogancethe arrogance sometimes of a man who is morbidly suspicious that he may be patronisedis shown in the manner in which he speaks of the grand ladies with whom he came in contact he calls the duke of ormonds daughters insolent drabs and talks of his mistress ophy butlers wife who is grown a little charmless when the duchess of shrewsbury reproached him for not dining with her swift said that was not so soon done he expected more advances from ladies especially duchesses on another occasion he was to have supped at lady ashburnhams but the drab did not call for us in her coach as she promised but sent for us and so i sent my excuses the arrogance was however often only on the surface it is evident that swift was very kind in many cases he felt deeply for mrs long in her misfortunes living and dying in an obscure country town on the last illness of the poet harrison he says i am very much afflicted for him as he is my own creature i was afraid to knock at the door my mind misgave me he was heartily sorry for poor mrs parnells death she seemed to be an excellent goodnatured young woman and i believe the poor lad is much afflicted they appeared to live perfectly well together afterwards he helped parnell by introducing him to bolingbroke and oxford he found kind words for mrs manley in her illness and lady ashburnhams death was extremely moving she was my greatest favourite and i am in excessive concern for her loss lastly he was extraordinarily patient towards his servant patrick who drank stopped out at night and in many ways tried swifts temper there were good points about patrick but no doubt the great consideration which swift showed him was due in part to the fact that he was a favourite of the ladies in dublin and had mrs vanhomrigh to intercede for him  but for the best example of the kindly side of swifts nature we must turn to what he tells us in the journal about stella herself the little language which swift used when writing to her was the language he employed when playing with stella as a little child at moor park thackeray who was not much in sympathy with swift said that he knew of nothing more manly more tender more exquisitely touching than some of these notes swift says that when he wrote plainly he felt as if they were no longer alone but a bad scrawl is so snug it looks like a pmd in writing his fond and playful prattle he made up his mouth just as if he were speaking it14  though mrs dingley is constantly associated with stella in the affectionate greetings in the journal she seems to have been included merely as a cloak to enable him to express the more freely his affection for her companion such phrases as saucy girls sirrahs sauceboxes and the like are often applied to both and sometimes swift certainly writes as if the one were as dear to him as the other thus we find farewell my dearest lives and delights i love you better than ever if possible as hope saved i do and ever will i can count upon nothing nor will but upon mds love and kindness and so farewell dearest md stella dingley presto all together now and for ever all together but as a rule notwithstanding swifts caution the greetings intended for stella alone are easily distinguishable in tone he often refers to her weak eyes and delicate health thus he writes the chocolate is a present madam for stella dont read this you little rogue with your little eyes but give it to dingley pray now and i will write as plain as the skies and again god almighty bless poor stella and her eyes and head what shall we do to cure them poor dear life or now to stellas little postscript and i am almost crazed that you vex yourself for not writing cant you dictate to dingley and not strain your dear little eyes i am sure tis the grief of my soul to think you are out of order they had been keeping his birthday swift wished he had been with them rather than in london where he had no manner of pleasure i say amen with all my heart and vitals that we may never be asunder again ten days together while poor presto lives a few days later he says i wish i were at laracor with dear charming md and again farewell dearest beloved md and love poor poor presto who has not had one happy day since he left you i will say no more but beg you to be easy till fortune takes his course and to believe mds felicity is the great goal i aim at in all my pursuits how does stella look madam dingley he asks pretty well a handsome young woman still will she pass in a crowd will she make a figure in a country church elsewhere he writes on receipt of a letter god almighty bless poor dear stella and send her a great many birthdays all happy and healthy and wealthy and with me ever together and never asunder again unless by chance i can hardly imagine you absent when i am reading your letter or writing to you no faith you are just here upon this little paper and therefore i see and talk with you every evening constantly and sometimes in the morning the letters lay under swifts pillow and he fondled them as if he were caressing stellas hand  of stella herself we naturally have no direct account in the journal but we hear a good deal of her life in ireland and can picture what she was among her friends in and about trim and laracor were dr raymond the vicar of trim and his wife the garret wesleys the percevals and mr warburton swifts curate at dublin there were archdeacon walls and his family alderman stoyte his wife and sisterinlaw dean sterne and the irish postmastergeneral isaac manley for years these friends formed a club which met in dublin at each others houses to sup and play cards ombre and claret and toasted oranges and we have frequent allusions to stellas indifferent play and the money which she lost much to mrs dingleys chagrin poor dingley fretted to see stella lose that four and elevenpence tother night mrs dingley herself could hardly play well enough to hold the cards while stella went into the next room if at dinner the mutton was underdone and poor stella cannot eat poor dear rogue then dingley is so vexed swift was for ever urging stella to walk and ride she was naturally a stout walker and dingley would do well enough if her petticoats were pinned up and we see stella setting out on and returning from her ride with her riband and mask ah that riding to laracor gives me short sighs as well as you he says all the days i have passed here have been dirt to those  if the journal shows us some of swifts less attractive qualities it shows still more how great a store of humour tenderness and affection there was in him in these letters we see his very soul in his literary work we are seldom moved to anything but admiration of his wit and genius such daily outpourings could never have been written for publication they were meant only for one who understood him perfectly and everything that we know of stellaher kindliness her wit her vivacity her loyaltyshows that she was worthy of the confidence     journal to stella     letter 11  chester sept 2 1710  joe2 will give you an account of me till i got into the boat after which the rogues made a new bargain and forced me to give them two crowns and talked as if we should not be able to overtake any ship but in half an hour we got to the yacht

will frankland to stand manleys3 friend with his father in this shaking season for places he told me his father was in danger to be out that several were now soliciting for manleys place that he was accused of opening letters that sir thomas frankland4 would sacrifice everything to save himself and in that i fear manley is undone etc  10 today i dined with lord mountjoy at kensington saw my mistress ophy butlers5 wife who is grown a little charmless i sat till ten in the evening with addison and steele steele will certainly lose his gazetteers place all the world detesting his engaging in parties6 at ten i went to the coffeehouse hoping to find lord radnor7 whom i had not seen he was there and for an hour and a half we talked treason heartily against the whigs their baseness and ingratitude and i am come home rolling resentments in my mind and framing schemes of revenge full of which having written down some hints i go to bed i am afraid md dined at home because it is sunday and there was the little halfpint of wine for gods sake be good girls and all will be well ben tooke8 was with me this morning  11 seven morning i am rising to go to jervas to finish my picture and tis shavingday so goodmorrow md but dont keep me now for i cant stay and pray dine with the dean but dont lose your money i long to hear from you etcten at night i sat four hours this morning to jervas who has given my picture quite another turn and now approves it entirely but we must have the approbation of the town if i were rich enough i would get a copy of it and bring it over mr addison and i dined together at his lodgings and i sat with him part of this evening and i am now come home to write an hour patrick9 observes that the rabble here are much more inquisitive in politics than in ireland every day we expect changes and the parliament to be dissolved lord wharton expects every day to be out he is working like a horse for elections and in short i never saw so great a ferment among all sorts of people i had a miserable letter from joe last saturday telling me mr pratt10 refuses payment of his money i have told it mr addison and will to lord wharton but i fear with no success however i will do all i can  12 today i presented mr ford11 to the duke of ormond and paid my first visit to lord president12 with whom i had much discourse but put him always off when he began to talk of lord wharton in relation to me till he urged it then i said he knew i never expected anything from lord wharton and that lord wharton knew that i understood it so he said that he had written twice to lord wharton about me who both times said nothing at all to that part of his letter i am advised not to meddle in the affair of the firstfruits till this hurry is a little over which still depends and we are all in the dark lord president told me he expects every day to be out and has done so these two months i protest upon my life i am heartily weary of this town and wish i had never stirred  13 i went this morning to the city to see mr stratford the hamburg merchant my old schoolfellow13 but calling at bulls14 on ludgate hill he forced me to his house at hampstead to dinner among a great deal of ill company among the rest mr hoadley15 the whig clergyman so famous for acting the contrary part to sacheverell16 but tomorrow i design again to see stratford i was glad however to be at hampstead where i saw lady lucy17 and moll stanhope i hear very unfortunate news of mrs long18 she and her comrade19 have broke up house and she is broke for good and all and is gone to the country i should be extremely sorry if this be true  14 today i saw patty rolt20 who heard i was in town and i dined with stratford at a merchants in the city where i drank the first tokay wine i ever saw and it is admirable yet not to the degree i expected stratford is worth a plum21 and is now lending the government forty thousand pounds yet we were educated together at the same school and university22 we hear the chancellor23 is to be suddenly out and sir simon harcourt24 to succeed him i am come early home not caring for the coffeehouse  15 today mr addison colonel freind25 and i went to see the million lottery26 drawn at guildhall the jackanapes of bluecoat boys gave themselves such airs in pulling out the tickets and showed white hands open to the company to let us see there was no cheat we dined at a countryhouse near chelsea where mr addison often retires and tonight at the coffeehouse we hear sir simon harcourt is made lord keeper so that now we expect every moment the parliament will be dissolved but i forgot that this letter will not go in three or four days and that my news will be stale which i should therefore put in the last paragraph shall i send this letter before i hear from md or shall i keep it to lengthen i have not yet seen stellas mother because i will not see lady giffard but i will contrive to go there when lady giffard is abroad i forgot to mark my two former letters but i remember this is number 3 and i have not yet had number 1 from md but i shall by monday which i reckon will be just a fortnight after you had my first i am resolved to bring over a great deal of china i loved it mightily today27 what shall i bring  16 morning sir john holland28 comptroller of the household has sent to desire my acquaintance i have a mind to refuse him because he is a whig and will i suppose be out among the rest but he is a man of worth and learning tell me do you like this journal way of writing is it not tedious and dull  night i dined today with a cousin a printer29 where patty rolt lodges and then came home after a visit or two and it has been a very insipid day mrs longs misfortune is confirmed to me bailiffs were in her house she retired to private lodgings thence to the country nobody knows where her friends leave letters at some inn and they are carried to her and she writes answers without dating them from any place i swear it grieves me to the soul  17 today i dined six miles out of town with will pate30 the learned woollendraper mr stratford went with me six miles here is nothing we left pate after sunset and were here before it was dark this letter shall go on tuesday whether i hear from md or no my health continues pretty well pray god stella may give me a good account of hers and i hope you are now at trim or soon designing it i was disappointed tonight the fellow gave me a letter and i hoped to see little mds hand and it was only to invite me to a venison pasty today so i lost my pasty into the bargain pox on these declining courtiers here is mr brydges31 the paymastergeneral desiring my acquaintance but i hear the queen sent lord shrewsbury32 to assure him he may keep his place and he promises me great assistance in the affair of the firstfruits well i must turn over this leaf tonight though the side would hold another line but pray consider this is a whole sheet it holds a plaguy deal and you must be content to be weary but ill do so no more sir simon harcourt is made attorneygeneral and not lord keeper  18 today i dined with mr stratford at mr addisons retirement near chelsea then came to town got home early and began a letter to the tatler33 about the corruptions of style and writing etc and having not heard from you am resolved this letter shall go tonight lord wharton was sent for to town in mighty haste by the duke of devonshire34 they have some project in hand but it will not do for every hour we expect a thorough revolution and that the parliament will be dissolved when you see joe tell him lord wharton is too busy to mind any of his affairs but i will get what good offices i can from mr addison and will write today to mr pratt and bid joe not to be discouraged for i am confident he will get the money under any government but he must have patience  19 i have been scribbling this morning and i believe shall hardly fill this side today but send it as it is and it is good enough for naughty girls that wont write to a body and to a good boy like presto i thought to have sent this tonight but was kept by company and could not and to say the truth i had a little mind to expect one post more for a letter from md yesterday at noon died the earl of anglesea35 the great support of the tories so that employment of vicetreasurer of ireland is again vacant we were to have been great friends and i could hardly have a loss that could grieve me more the bishop of durham36 died the same day the duke of ormonds daughter37 was to visit me today at a third place by way of advance38 and i am to return it tomorrow i have had a letter from lady berkeley begging me for charity to come to berkeley castle for company to my lord39 who has been ill of a dropsy but i cannot go and must send my excuse tomorrow i am told that in a few hours there will be more removals  20 today i returned my visits to the dukes daughters40 the insolent drabs came up to my very mouth to salute me then i heard the report confirmed of removals my lord president somers the duke of devonshire lord steward and mr boyle41 secretary of state are all turned out today i never remember such bold steps taken by a court i am almost shocked at it though i did not care if they were all hanged we are astonished why the parliament is not yet dissolved and why they keep a matter of that importance to the last we shall have a strange winter here between the struggles of a cunning provoked discarded party and the triumphs of one in power of both which i shall be an indifferent spectator and return very peaceably to ireland when i have done my part in the affair i am entrusted with whether it succeeds or no tomorrow i change my lodgings in pall mall for one in bury street42 where i suppose i shall continue while i stay in london if anything happens tomorrow i will add itrobins coffeehouse43 we have great news just now from spain madrid taken and pampeluna i am here ever

pennypost letter2 tomorrow and contrive to see her without hazarding seeing lady giffard which i will not do until she begs my pardon  22 i dined today at hampstead with lady lucy etc and when i got home found a letter from joe with one enclosed to lord wharton which i will send to his excellency and second it as well as i can but to talk of getting the queens order is a jest things are in such a combustion here that i am advised not to meddle yet in the affair i am upon which concerns the clergy of a whole kingdom and does he think anybody will trouble the queen about joe we shall i hope get a recommendation from the lord lieutenant to the trustees for the linen business and i hope that will do and so i will write to him in a few days and he must have patience this is an answer to part of

widen the margin by lying in bed when i write my bed lies on the wrong side for me so that i am forced often to write when i am up manley you must know has had people putting in for his place already and has been complained of for opening letters remember that last sunday september 24 1710 was as hot as midsummer this was written in the morning it is now night and presto in bed heres a clutter i have gotten mds second letter and i must answer it here i gave the bill to tooke and sowell i dined today with sir john holland the comptroller and sat with him till eight then came home and sent my letters and writ part of a lampoon10 which goes on very slow and now i am writing to saucy md no wonder indeed good boys must write to naughty girls i have not seen your mother yet my pennypost letter i suppose miscarried i will write another mr s came to see me and said m was going to the country next morning with her husband who i find is a surly brute so i could only desire my service to her  27 today all our company dined at will franklands with steele and addison too this is the first rainy day since i came to town i cannot afford to answer your letter yet morgan11 the puppy writ me a long letter to desire i would recommend him for pursebearer or secretary to the next lord chancellor that would come with the next governor i will not answer him but beg you will say these words to his father raymond12 or anybody that will tell him that dr swift has received his letter and would be very ready to serve him but cannot do it in what he desires because he has no sort of interest in the persons to be applied to these words you may write and let joe or mr warburton13 give them to him a pox on him however it is by these sort of ways that fools get preferment i must not end yet because i cannot say goodnight without losing a line and then md would scold but now goodnight  28 i have the finest piece of brazil tobacco for dingley that ever was born14 you talk of leigh why he wont be in dublin these two months he goes to the country then returns to london to see how the world goes here in parliament goodnight sirrahs no no not night i writ this in the morning and looking carelessly i thought it had been of last night i dined today with mrs barton15 alone at her lodgings where she told me for certain that lady s was with child when she was last in england and pretended a tympany and saw everybody then disappeared for three weeks her tympany was gone and she looked like a ghost etc no wonder she married when she was so ill at containing connolly16 is out and mr roberts in his place who loses a better here but was formerly a commissioner in ireland that employment cost connolly three thousand pounds to lord wharton so he has made one ill bargain in his life  29 i wish md a merry michaelmas i dined with mr addison and jervas the painter at addisons country place and then came home and writ more to my lampoon i made a tatler since i came guess which it is and whether the bishop of clogher smokes it i saw mr sterne17 today he will do as you order and i will give him chocolate for stellas health he goes not these three weeks i wish i could send it some other way so now to your letter brave boys i dont like your way of saving shillings nothing vexes me but that it does not make stella a coward in a coach18 i dont think any ladys advice about my ear signifies twopence however i will in compliance to you ask dr cockburn radcliffe19 i know not and barnard20 i never see walls will certainly be stingier for seven years upon pretence of his robbery so stella puns again why tis well enough but ill not second it though i could make a dozen i never thought of a pun since i left irelandbishop of cloghers bill why he paid it to me do you think i was such a fool to go without it as for the four shillings i will give you a bill on parvisol for it on tother side of this paper and pray tear off the two letters i shall write to him and joe or let dingley transcribe and send them though that to parvisol i believe he must have my hand for no no ill eat no grapes i ate about six the other day at sir john hollands but would not give sixpence for a thousand they are so bad this year yes faith i hope in god presto and md will be together this time twelvemonth what then last year i suppose i was at laracor but next i hope to eat my michaelmas goose at my two little gooses lodgings i drink no aile i suppose you mean ale but yet good wine every day of five and six shillings a bottle o lord how much stella writes pray dont carry that too far young women but be temperate to hold out tomorrow i go to mr harley21 why small hopes from the duke of ormond he loves me very well i believe and would in my turn give me something to make me easy and i have good interest among his best friends but i dont think of anything further than the business i am upon you see i writ to manley before i had your letter and i fear he will be out yes mrs owl blighs corpse22 came to chester when i was there and i told you so in my letter or forgot it i lodge in bury street where i removed a week ago i have the first floor a diningroom and bedchamber at eight shillings a week plaguy deep but i spend nothing for eating never go to a tavern and very seldom in a coach yet after all it will be expensive why do you trouble yourself mistress stella about my instrument i have the same the archbishop gave me and it is as good now the bishops are away the dean friendly the dean be poxed a great piece of friendship indeed what you heard him tell the bishop of clogher i wonder he had the face to talk so but he lent me money and thats enough faith i would not send this these four days only for writing to joe and parvisol tell the dean that when the bishops send me any packets they must not write to me at mr steeles but direct for mr steele at his office at the cockpit and let the enclosed be directed for me that mistake cost me eighteenpence the other day  30 i dined with stratford today but am not to see mr harley till wednesday it is late and i send this before there is occasion for the bell because i would have joe have his letter and parvisol too which you must so contrive as not to cost them double postage i can say no more but that i am etc     letter 5  london sept 30 1710  hant i brought myself into a fine praemunire1 to begin writing letters in whole sheets and now i dare not leave it off i cannot tell whether you like these journal letters i believe they would be dull to me to read them over but perhaps little md is pleased to know how presto passes his time in her absence i always begin my last the same day i ended my former i told you where i dined today at a tavern with stratford lewis2 who is a great favourite of harleys was to have been with us but he was hurried to hampton court and sent his excuse and that next wednesday he would introduce me to harley tis good to see what a lamentable confession the whigs all make me of my ill usage but i mind them not i am already represented to harley as a discontented person that was used ill for not being whig enough and i hope for good usage from him the tories drily tell me i may make my fortune if i please but i do not understand themor rather i do understand them  oct 1 today i dined at molesworths the florence envoy and sat this evening with my friend darteneuf3 whom you have heard me talk of the greatest punner of this town next myself have you smoked the tatler that i writ4 it is much liked here and i think it a pure5 one tomorrow i go with delaval6 the portugal envoy to dine with lord halifax near hampton court7 your manleys brother a parliamentman here has gotten an employment8 and i am informed uses much interest to preserve his brother and today i spoke to the elder frankland to engage his father postmaster here and i hope he will be safe although he is cruelly hated by all the tories of ireland i have almost finished my lampoon and will print it for revenge on a certain great person9 it has cost me but three shillings in meat and drink since i came here as thin as the town is i laugh to see myself so disengaged in these revolutions well i must leave off and go write to sir john stanley10 to desire him to engage lady hyde as my mistress to engage lord hyde11 in favour of mr pratt12  2 lord halifax was at hampton court at his lodgings and i dined with him there with methuen13 and delaval and the late attorneygeneral14 i went to the drawingroom before dinner for the queen was at hampton court and expected to see nobody but i met acquaintance enough i walked in the gardens saw the cartoons of raphael and other things and with great difficulty got from lord halifax who would have kept me tomorrow to show me his house and park and improvements we left hampton court at sunset and got here in a chariot and two horses time enough by starlight thats something charms me mightily about london that you go dine a dozen miles off in october stay all day and return so quickly you cannot do anything like this in dublin15 i writ a second penny post letter to your mother and hear nothing of her did i tell you that earl berkeley died last sunday was sennight at berkeley castle of a dropsy lord halifax began a health to me today it was the resurrection of the whigs which i refused unless he would add their reformation too and i told him he was the only whig in england i loved or had any good opinion of  3 this morning stellas sister16 came to me with a letter from her mother who is at sheen but will soon be in town and will call to see me she gave me a bottle of palsy water17 a small one and desired i would send it you by the first convenience as i will and she promises a quart bottle of the same your sister looked very well and seems a good modest sort of girl i went then to mr lewis first secretary to lord dartmouth18 and favourite to mr harley who is to introduce me tomorrow morning lewis had with him one mr dyot19 a justice of peace worth twenty thousand pounds a commissioner of the stamp office and married to a sister of sir philip meadows20 envoy to the emperor i tell you this because it is odds but this mr dyot will be hanged for he is discovered to have counterfeited stamped paper in which he was a commissioner and with his accomplices has cheated the queen of a hundred thousand pounds you will hear of it before this come to you but may be not so particularly and it is a very odd accident in such a man smoke presto writing news to md i dined today with lord mountjoy at kensington and walked from thence this evening to town like an emperor remember that yesterday october 2 was a cruel hard frost with ice and six days ago i was dying with heat as thin as the town is i have more dinners than ever and am asked this month by some people without being able to come for preengagements well but i should write plainer when i consider stella cannot read21 and dingley is not so skilful at my ugly hand i had tonight a letter from mr pratt who tells me joe will have his money when there are trustees appointed by the lord lieutenant for receiving and disposing the linen fund and whenever those trustees are appointed i will solicit whoever is lord lieutenant and am in no fear of succeeding so pray tell or write him word and bid him not be cast down for ned southwell22 and mr addison both think pratt in the right dont lose your money at manleys tonight sirrahs  4 after i had put out my candle last night my landlady came into my room with a servant of lord halifax to desire i would go dine with him at his house near hampton court but i sent him word i had business of great importance that hindered me etc and today i was brought privately to mr harley who received me with the greatest respect and kindness imaginable he has appointed me an hour on saturday at four afternoon when i will open my business to him which expression i would not use if i were a woman i know you smoked it but i did not till i writ it i dined today at mr delavals the envoy for portugal with nic rowe23 the poet and other friends and i gave my lampoon to be printed i have more mischief in my heart and i think it shall go round with them all as this hits and i can find hints i am certain i answered your 2d letter and yet i do not find it here i suppose it was in my 4th and why n 2d 3d is it not enough to say as i do 1 2 3 etc i am going to work at another tatler24 ill be far enough but i say the same thing over two or three times just as i do when i am talking to little md but what care i they can read it as easily as i can write it i think i have brought these lines pretty straight again i fear it will be long before i finish two sides at this rate pray dear md when i occasionally give you any little commission mixed with my letters dont forget it as that to morgan and joe etc for i write just as i can remember otherwise i would put them all together i was to visit mr sterne today and give him your commission about handkerchiefs that of chocolate i will do myself and send it him when he goes and youll pay me when the givers bread25 etc tonight i will read a pamphlet to amuse myself god preserve your dear healths  5 this morning delaval came to see me and we went together to knellers26 who was not in town in the way we met the electors for parliamentmen27 and the rabble came about our coach crying a colt a stanhope etc we were afraid of a dead cat or our glasses broken and so were always of their side i dined again at delavals and in the evening at the coffeehouse heard sir andrew fountaine28 was come to town this has been but an insipid sort of day and i have nothing to remark upon it worth threepence i hope md had a better with the dean the bishop or mrs walls29 why the reason you lost four and eightpence last night but one at manleys was because you played bad games i took notice of six that you had ten to one against you would any but a mad lady go out twice upon manilio basto and two small diamonds30 then in that game of spades you blundered when you had tenace i never saw the like of you and now you are in a huff because i tell you this well heres two and eightpence halfpenny towards your loss  6 sir andrew fountaine came this morning and caught me writing in bed i went into the city with him and we dined at the chophouse with will pate31 the learned woollendraper then we sauntered at chinashops32 and booksellers went to the tavern drank two pints of white wine and never parted till ten and now i am come home and must copy out some papers i intend for mr harley whom i am to see as i told you tomorrow afternoon so that this night i shall say little to md but that i heartily wish myself with them and will come as soon as i either fail or compass my business we now hear daily of elections and in a list i saw yesterday of about twenty there are seven or eight more tories than in the last parliament so that i believe they need not fear a majority with the help of those who will vote as the court pleases but i have been told that mr harley himself would not let the tories be too numerous for fear they should be insolent and kick against him and for that reason they have kept several whigs in employments who expected to be turned out every day as sir john holland the comptroller and many others and so get you gone to your cards and your claret and orange at the deans and ill go write  7 i wonder when this letter will be finished it must go by tuesday thats certain and if i have one from md before i will not answer it thats as certain too tis now morning and i did not finish my papers for mr harley last night for you must understand presto was sleepy and made blunders and blots very pretty that i must be writing to young women in a morning fresh and fasting faith well goodmorrow to you and so i go to business and lay aside this paper till night sirrahsat night jack how33 told harley that if there were a lower place in hell than another it was reserved for his porter who tells lies so gravely and with so civil a manner this porter i have had to deal with going this evening at four to visit mr harley by his own appointment but the fellow told me no lie though i suspected every word he said he told me his master was just gone to dinner with much company and desired i would come an hour hence which i did expecting to hear mr harley was gone out but they had just done dinner mr harley came out to me brought me in and presented to me his soninlaw lord doblane34 or some such name and his own son35 and among others will penn36 the quaker we sat two hours drinking as good wine as you do and two hours more he and i alone where he heard me tell my business entered into it with all kindness asked for my powers and read them and read likewise a memorial37 i had drawn up and put it in his pocket to show the queen told me the measures he would take and in short said everything i could wish told me he must bring mr st john38 secretary of state and me acquainted and spoke so many things of personal kindness and esteem for me that i am inclined half to believe what some friends have told me that he would do everything to bring me over he has desired to dine with me what a comical mistake was that i mean he has desired me to dine with him on tuesday and after four hours being with him set me down at st jamess coffeehouse in a hackneycoach all this is odd and comical if you consider him and me he knew my christian name very well i could not forbear saying thus much upon this matter although you will think it tedious but ill tell you you must know tis fatal39 to me to be a scoundrel and a prince the same day for being to see him at four i could not engage myself to dine at any friends so i went to tooke40 to give him a ballad and dine with him but he was not at home so i was forced to go to a blind41 chophouse and dine for tenpence upon gillale42 bad broth and three chops of mutton and then go reeking from thence to the first minister of state and now i am going in charity to send steele a tatler who is very low of late i think i am civiller than i used to be and have not used the expression of you in ireland and we in england as i did when i was here before to your great indignationthey may talk of the you know what43 but gad if it had not been for that i should never have been able to get the access i have had and if that helps me to succeed then that same thing will be serviceable to the church but how far we must depend upon new friends i have learnt by long practice though i think among great ministers they are just as good as old ones and so i think this important day has made a great hole in this side of the paper and the fiddlefaddles of tomorrow and monday will make up the rest and besides i shall see harley on tuesday before this letter goes  8 i must tell you a great piece of refinement44 of harley he charged me to come to him often i told him i was loth to trouble him in so much business as he had and desired i might have leave to come at his levee which he immediately refused and said that was not a place for friends to come to tis now but morning and i have got a foolish trick i must say something to md when i wake and wish them a goodmorrow for this is not a shavingday sunday so i have time enough but get you gone you rogues i must go write yes twill vex me to the blood if any of these long letters should miscarry if they do i will shrink to halfsheets again but then what will you do to make up the journal there will be ten days of prestos life lost and that will be a sad thing faith and trothat night i was at a loss today for a dinner unless i would have gone a great way so i dined with some friends that board hereabout45 as a spunger46 and this evening sir andrew fountaine would needs have me go to the tavern where for two bottles of wine portugal and florence among three of us we had sixteen shillings to pay but if ever he catches me so again ill spend as many pounds and therefore i have it among my extraordinaries but we had a neck of mutton dressed a la maintenon that the dog could not eat and it is now twelve oclock and i must go sleep i hope this letter will go before i have mds third do you believe me and yet faith i long for mds third too and yet i would have it to say that i writ five for two i am not fond at all of st jamess coffeehouse47 as i used to be i hope it will mend in winter but now they are all out of town at elections or not come from their country houses yesterday i was going with dr garth48 to dine with charles main49 near the tower who has an employment there he is of ireland the bishop of clogher knows him well an honest goodnatured fellow a thorough hearty laugher mightily beloved by the men of wit his mistress is never above a cookmaid and so goodnight etc  9 i dined today at sir john stanleys my lady stanley50 is one of my favourites i have as many here as the bishop of killala has in ireland i am thinking what scurvy company i shall be to md when i come back they know everything of me already i will tell you no more or i shall have nothing to say no story to tell nor any kind of thing i was very uneasy last night with ugly nasty filthy wine that turned sour on my stomach i must go to the tavern oh but i told you that before tomorrow i dine at harleys and will finish this letter at my return but i can write no more now because of the archbishop faith tis true for i am going now to write to him an account of what i have done in the business with harley51 and faith young women ill tell you what you must count upon that i never will write one word on the third side in these long letters  10 poor mds letter was lying so huddled up among papers i could not find it i mean poor prestos letter well i dined with mr harley today and hope some things will be done but i must say no more and this letter must be sent to the posthouse and not by the bellman52 i am to dine again there on sunday next i hope to some good issue and so now soon as ever i can in bed i must begin my 6th to md as gravely as if i had not written a word this month fine doings faith methinks i dont write as i should because i am not in bed see the ugly wide lines god almighty ever bless you etc  faith this is a whole treatise ill go reckon the lines on the other sides ive reckoned them53     letter 6  london oct 10 1710  so as i told you just now in the letter i sent half an hour ago i dined with mr harley today who presented me to the attorneygeneral sir simon harcourt with much compliment on all sides etc harley told me he had shown my memorial to the queen and seconded it very heartily and he desires me to dine with him again on sunday when he promises to settle it with her majesty before she names a governor1 and i protest i am in hopes it will be done all but the forms by that time for he loves the church this is a popular thing and he would not have a governor share in it and besides i am told by all hands he has a mind to gain me over but in the letter i writ last post yesterday to the archbishop i did not tell him a syllable of what mr harley said to me last night because he charged me to keep it secret so i would not tell it to you but that before this goes i hope the secret will be over i am now writing my poetical description of a shower in london and will send it to the tatler2 this is the last sheet of a whole quire i have written since i came to town pray now it comes into my head will you when you go to mrs walls contrive to know whether mrs wesley3 be in town and still at her brothers and how she is in health and whether she stays in town i writ to her from chester to know what i should do with her note and i believe the poor woman is afraid to write to me so i must go to my business etc  11 today at last i dined with lord mountrath4 and carried lord mountjoy and sir andrew fountaine with me and was looking over them at ombre till eleven this evening like a fool they played running ombre halfcrowns and sir andrew fountaine won eight guineas of mr coote5 so i am come home late and will say but little to md this night i have gotten half a bushel of coals and patrick the extravagant whelp had a fire ready for me but i picked off the coals before i went to bed it is a sign london is now an empty place when it will not furnish me with matter for above five or six lines in a day did you smoke in my last how i told you the very day and the place you were playing at ombre but i interlined and altered a little after i had received a letter from mr manley that said you were at it in his house while he was writing to me but without his help i guessed within one day your town is certainly much more sociable than ours i have not seen your mother yet etc  12 i dined today with dr garth and mr addison at the devil tavern6 by temple bar and garth treated and tis well i dine every day else i should be longer making out my letters for we are yet in a very dull state only inquiring every day after new elections where the tories carry it among the new members six to one mr addisons election7 has passed easy and undisputed and i believe if he had a mind to be chosen king he would hardly be refused an odd accident has happened at colchester one captain lavallin8 coming from flanders or spain found his wife with child by a clerk of doctors commons whose trade you know it is to prevent fornications and this clerk was the very same fellow that made the discovery of dyots9 counterfeiting the stamppaper lavallin has been this fortnight hunting after the clerk to kill him but the fellow was constantly employed at the treasury about the discovery he made the wife had made a shift to patch up the business alleging that the clerk had told her her husband was dead and other excuses but tother day somebody told lavallin his wife had intrigues before he married her upon which he goes down in a rage shoots his wife through the head then falls on his sword and to make the matter sure at the same time discharges a pistol through his own head and died on the spot his wife surviving him about two hours but in what circumstances of mind and body is terrible to imagine i have finished my poem on the shower all but the beginning and am going on with my tatler they have fixed about fifty things on me since i came i have printed but three10 one advantage i get by writing to you daily or rather you get is that i shall remember not to write the same things twice and yet i fear i have done it often already but i will mind and confine myself to the accidents of the day and so get you gone to ombre and be good girls and save your money and be rich against presto comes and write to me now and then i am thinking it would be a pretty thing to hear sometimes from saucy md but do not hurt your eyes stella i charge you  13 o lord here is but a trifle of my letter written yet what shall presto do for prattleprattle to entertain md the talk now grows fresher of the duke of ormond for ireland though mr addison says he hears it will be in commission and lord galway11 one these letters of mine are a sort of journal where matters open by degrees and as i tell true or false you will find by the event whether my intelligence be good but i do not care twopence whether it be or noat night today i was all about st pauls and up at the top like a fool with sir andrew fountaine and two more and spent seven shillings for my dinner like a puppy this is the second time he has served me so but i will never do it again though all mankind should persuade me unconsidering puppies there is a young fellow here in town we are all fond of and about a year or two come from the university one harrison12 a little pretty fellow with a great deal of wit good sense and good nature has written some mighty pretty things that in your 6th miscellanea13 about the sprig of an orange is his he has nothing to live on but being governor to one of the duke of queensberrys14 sons for forty pounds a year the fine fellows are always inviting him to the tavern and make him pay his club henley15 is a great crony of his they are often at the tavern at six or seven shillings reckoning and he always makes the poor lad pay his full share a colonel and a lord were at him and me the same way tonight i absolutely refused and made harrison lag behind and persuaded him not to go to them i tell you this because i find all rich fellows have that humour of using all people without any consideration of their fortunes but i will see them rot before they shall serve me so lord halifax is always teasing me to go down to his country house which will cost me a guinea to his servants and twelve shillings coachhire and he shall be hanged first is not this a plaguy silly story but i am vexed at the heart for i love the young fellow and am resolved to stir up people to do something for him he is a whig and i will put him upon some of my cast whigs for i have done with them and they have i hope done with this kingdom for our time they were sure of the four members for london above all places and they have lost three in the four16 sir richard onslow17 we hear has lost for surrey and they are overthrown in most places lookee gentlewomen if i write long letters i must write you news and stuff unless i send you my verses and some i dare not and those on the shower in london i have sent to the tatler and you may see them in ireland i fancy you will smoke me in the tatler i am going to write for i believe i have told you the hint i had a letter sent me tonight from sir matthew dudley and found it on my table when i came in because it is extraordinary i will transcribe it from beginning to end it is as follows is the devil in you oct 13 1710 i would have answered every particular passage in it only i wanted time here is enough for tonight such as it is etc  14 is that tobacco at the top of the paper18 or what i do not remember i slobbered lord i dreamt of stella etc so confusedly last night and that we saw dean bolton19 and sterne20 go into a shop and she bid me call them to her and they proved to be two parsons i know not and i walked without till she was shifting and such stuff mixed with much melancholy and uneasiness and things not as they should be and i know not how and it is now an ugly gloomy morningat night mr addison and i dined with ned southwell and walked in the park and at the coffeehouse i found a letter from the bishop of clogher and a packet from md i opened the bishops letter but put up mds and visited a lady just come to town and am now got into bed and going to open your little letter and god send i may find md well and happy and merry and that they love presto as they do fires oh i will not open it yet yes i will no i will not i am going i cannot stay till i turn over21 what shall i do my fingers itch and now i have it in my left hand and now i will open it this very momenti have just got it and am cracking the seal and cannot imagine what is in it i fear only some letter from a bishop and it comes too late i shall employ nobodys credit but my own well i see though pshaw tis from sir andrew fountaine what another i fancy thats from mrs barton22 she told me she would write to me but she writes a better hand than this i wish you would inquire it must be at dawsons23 office at the castle i fear this is from patty rolt by the scrawl well i will read mds letter ah no it is from poor lady berkeley to invite me to berkeley castle this winter and now it grieves my heart she says she hopes my lord is in a fair way of recovery24 poor lady well now i go to mds letter faith it is all right i hoped it was wrong your letter n3 that i have now received is dated sept 26 and manleys letter that i had five days ago was dated oct 3 thats a fortnight difference i doubt it has lain in steeles office and he forgot well theres an end of that he is turned out of his place25 and you must desire those who send me packets to enclose them in a paper directed to mr addison at st jamess coffeehouse not common letters but packets the bishop of clogher may mention it to the archbishop when he sees him as for your letter it makes me mad slidikins i have been the best boy in christendom and you come with your two eggs a pennywell but stay i will look over my book adad i think there was a chasm between my n2 and n3 faith i will not promise to write to you every week but i will write every night and when it is full i will send it that will be once in ten days and that will be often enough and if you begin to take up the way of writing to presto only because it is tuesday a monday bedad it will grow a task but write when you have a mindno no no no no no no noagad agad agad agad agad agad no poor stellakins26 slids i would the horse were in yourchamber have not i ordered parvisol to obey your directions about him and hant i said in my former letters that you may pickle him and boil him if you will what do you trouble me about your horses for have i anything to do with themrevolutions a hindrance to me in my business revolutions to me in my business if it were not for the revolutions i could do nothing at all and now i have all hopes possible though one is certain of nothing but tomorrow i am to have an answer and am promised an effectual one i suppose i have said enough in this and a former letter how i stand with new people ten times better than ever i did with the old forty times more caressed i am to dine tomorrow at mr harleys and if he continues as he has begun no man has been ever better treated by another what you say about stellas mother i have spoken enough to it already i believe she is not in town for i have not yet seen her my lampoon is cried up to the skies but nobody suspects me for it except sir andrew fountaine at least they say nothing of it to me did not i tell you of a great man who received me very coldly27 thats he but say nothing twas only a little revenge i will remember to bring it over the bishop of clogher has smoked my tatler28 about shortening of words etc but god so29 etc  15 i will write plainer if i can remember it for stella must not spoil her eyes and dingley cant read my hand very well and i am afraid my letters are too long then you must suppose one to be two and read them at twice i dined today with mr harley mr prior30 dined with us he has left my memorial with the queen who has consented to give the firstfruits and twentieth parts31 and will we hope declare it tomorrow in the cabinet but i beg you to tell it to no person alive for so i am ordered till in public and i hope to get something of greater value after dinner came in lord peterborow32 we renewed our acquaintance and he grew mightily fond of me they began to talk of a paper of verses called sid hamet mr harley repeated part and then pulled them out and gave them to a gentleman at the table to read though they had all read them often lord peterborow would let nobody read them but himself so he did and mr harley bobbed33 me at every line to take notice of the beauties prior rallied lord peterborow for author of them and lord peterborow said he knew them to be his and prior then turned it upon me and i on him i am not guessed at all in town to be the author yet so it is but that is a secret only to you34 ten to one whether you see them in ireland yet here they run prodigiously harley presented me to lord president of scotland35 and mr benson36 lord of the treasury prior and i came away at nine and sat at the smyrna37 till eleven receiving acquaintance  16 this morning early i went in a chair and patrick before it to mr harley to give him another copy of my memorial as he desired but he was full of business going to the queen and i could not see him but he desired i would send up the paper and excused himself upon his hurry i was a little baulked but they tell me it is nothing i shall judge by next visit i tipped his porter with half a crown and so i am well there for a time at least i dined at stratfords in the city and had burgundy and tokay came back afoot like a scoundrel then went with mr addison and supped with lord mountjoy which made me sick all night i forgot that i bought six pounds of chocolate for stella and a little wooden box and i have a great piece of brazil tobacco for dingley38 and a bottle of palsywater39 for stella all which with the two handkerchiefs that mr sterne has bought and you must pay him for will be put in the box directed to mrs currys and sent by dr hawkshaw40 whom i have not seen but sterne has undertaken it the chocolate is a present madam for stella dont read this you little rogue with your little eyes but give it to dingley pray now and i will write as plain as the skies and let dingley write stellas part and stella dictate to her when she apprehends her eyes etc  17 this letter should have gone this post if i had not been taken up with business and two nights being late out so it must stay till thursday i dined today with your mr sterne41 by invitation and drank irish wine42 but before we parted there came in the prince of puppies colonel edgworth43 so i went away this day came out the tatler made up wholly of my shower and a preface to it they say it is the best thing i ever writ and i think so too i suppose the bishop of clogher will show it you pray tell me how you like it tooke is going on with my miscellany44 id give a penny the letter to the bishop of killaloe45 was in it twould do him honour could not you contrive to say you hear they are printing my things together and that you with the bookseller had that letter among the rest but dont say anything of it as from me i forget whether it was good or no but only having heard it much commended perhaps it may deserve it well i have tomorrow to finish this letter in and then i will send it next day i am so vexed that you should write your third to me when you had but my second and i had written five which now i hope you have all and so i tell you you are saucy little pretty dear rogues etc  18 today i dined by invitation with stratford and others at a young merchants in the city with hermitage and tokay and stayed till nine and am now come home and that dog patrick is abroad and drinking and i cannot i get my nightgown i have a mind to turn that puppy away he has been drunk ten times in three weeks but i hant time to say more so goodnight etc  19 i am come home from dining in the city with mr addison at a merchants and just now at the coffeehouse we have notice that the duke of ormond was this day declared lord lieutenant at hampton court in council i have not seen mr harley since but hope the affair is done about firstfruits i will see him if possible tomorrow morning but this goes tonight i have sent a box to mr sterne to send to you by some friend i have directed it for mr curry at his house so you have warning when it comes as i hope it will soon the handkerchiefs will be put in some friends pocket not to pay custom and so here ends my sixth sent when i had but three of mds now i am beforehand and will keep so and god almighty bless dearest md etc     letter 7  london oct 19 1710  faith i am undone this paper is larger than the other and yet i am condemned to a sheet but since it is md i did not value though i were condemned to a pair i told you in my letter today where i had been and how the day passed and so etc  20 today i went to mr lewis at the secretarys office to know when i might see mr harley and by and by comes up mr harley himself and appoints me to dine with him tomorrow i dined with mrs vanhomrigh1 and went to wait on the two lady butlers2 but the porter answered they were not at home the meaning was the youngest lady mary is to be married tomorrow to lord ashburnham3 the best match now in england twelve thousand pounds a year and abundance of money tell me how my shower is liked in ireland i never knew anything pass better here i spent the evening with wortley montagu4 and mr addison over a bottle of irish wine do they know anything in ireland of my greatness among the tories everybody reproaches me of it here but i value them not have you heard of the verses about the rod of sid hamet say nothing of them for your life hardly anybody suspects me for them only they think nobody but prior or i could write them but i doubt they have not reached you there is likewise a ballad full of puns on the westminster election5 that cost me half an hour it runs though it be good for nothing but this is likewise a secret to all but md if you have them not i will bring them over  21 i got mds fourth today at the coffeehouse god almighty bless poor dear stella and her eyes and head what shall we do to cure them poor dear life your disorders are a pullback for your good qualities would to heaven i were this minute shaving your poor dear head either here or there pray do not write nor read this letter nor anything else and i will write plainer for dingley to read from henceforward though my pen is apt to ramble when i think whom i am writing to i will not answer your letter until i tell you that i dined this day with mr harley who presented me to the earl of stirling6 a scotch lord and in the evening came in lord peterborow i stayed till nine before mr harley would let me go or tell me anything of my affair he says the queen has now granted the firstfruits and twentieth parts but he will not give me leave to write to the archbishop because the queen designs to signify it to the bishops in ireland in form and to take notice that it was done upon a memorial from me which mr harley tells me he does to make it look more respectful to me etc and i am to see him on tuesday i know not whether i told you that in my memorial which was given to the queen i begged for two thousand pounds a year more though it was not in my commission but that mr harley says cannot yet be done and that he and i must talk of it further however i have started it and it may follow in time pray say nothing of the firstfruits being granted unless i give leave at the bottom of this i believe never anything was compassed so soon and purely done by my personal credit with mr harley who is so excessively obliging that i know not what to make of it unless to show the rascals of the other party that they used a man unworthily who had deserved better the memorial given to the queen from me speaks with great plainness of lord wharton i believe this business is as important to you as the convocation disputes from tisdall7 i hope in a month or two all the forms of settling this matter will be over and then i shall have nothing to do here i will only add one foolish thing more because it is just come into my head when this thing is made known tell me impartially whether they give any of the merit to me or no for i am sure i have so much that i will never take it upon meinsolent sluts because i say dublin ireland therefore you must say london england that is stellas malicewell for that i will not answer your letter till tomorrowday and so and so i will go write something else and it will not be much for tis late  22 i was this morning with mr lewis the undersecretary to lord dartmouth two hours talking politics and contriving to keep steele in his office of stamped paper he has lost his place of gazetteer three hundred pounds a year for writing a tatler8 some months ago against mr harley who gave it him at first and raised the salary from sixty to three hundred pounds this was devilish ungrateful and lewis was telling me the particulars but i had a hint given me that i might save him in the other employment and leave was given me to clear matters with steele well i dined with sir matthew dudley and in the evening went to sit with mr addison and offer the matter at distance to him as the discreeter person but found party had so possessed him that he talked as if he suspected me and would not fall in with anything i said so i stopped short in my overture and we parted very drily and i shall say nothing to steele and let them do as they will but if things stand as they are he will certainly lose it unless i save him and therefore i will not speak to him that i may not report to his disadvantage is not this vexatious and is there so much in the proverb of proffered service when shall i grow wise i endeavour to act in the most exact points of honour and conscience and my nearest friends will not understand it so what must a man expect from his enemies this would vex me but it shall not and so i bid you goodnight etc  23 i know tis neither wit nor diversion to tell you every day where i dine neither do i write it to fill my letter but i fancy i shall some time or other have the curiosity of seeing some particulars how i passed my life when i was absent from md this time and so i tell you now that i dined today at molesworths the florence envoy then went to the coffeehouse where i behaved myself coldly enough to mr addison and so came home to scribble we dine together tomorrow and next day by invitation but i shall alter my behaviour to him till he begs my pardon or else we shall grow bare acquaintance i am weary of friends and friendships are all monsters but mds  24 i forgot to tell you that last night i went to mr harleys hopingfaith i am blundering for it was this very night at six and i hoped he would have told me all things were done and granted but he was abroad and came home ill and was gone to bed much out of order unless the porter lied i dined today at sir matthew dudleys with mr addison etc  25 i was today to see the duke of ormond and coming out met lord berkeley of stratton9 who told me that mrs temple10 the widow died last saturday which i suppose is much to the outward grief and inward joy of the family i dined today with addison and steele and a sister of mr addison who is married to one mons sartre11 a frenchman prebendary of westminster who has a delicious house and garden yet i thought it was a sort of monastic life in those cloisters and i liked laracor better addisons sister is a sort of a wit very like him i am not fond of her etc  26 i was today to see mr congreve12 who is almost blind with cataracts growing on his eyes and his case is that he must wait two or three years until the cataracts are riper and till he is quite blind and then he must have them couched and besides he is never rid of the gout yet he looks young and fresh and is as cheerful as ever he is younger by three years or more than i and i am twenty years younger than he he gave me a pain in the great toe by mentioning the gout i find such suspicions frequently but they go off again i had a second letter from mr morgan13 for which i thank you i wish you were whipped for forgetting to send him that answer i desired you in one of my former that i could do nothing for him of what he desired having no credit at all etc go be far enough you negligent baggages i have had also a letter from parvisol with an account how my livings are set and that they are fallen since last year sixty pounds a comfortable piece of news he tells me plainly that he finds you have no mind to part with the horse because you sent for him at the same time you sent him my letter so that i know not what must be done it is a sad thing that stella must have her own horse whether parvisol will or no so now to answer your letter that i had three or four days ago i am not now in bed but am come home by eight and it being warm i write up i never writ to the bishop of killala which i suppose was the reason he had not my letter i have not time there is the short of itas fond as the dean14 is of my letter he has not written to me i would only know whether dean bolton15 paid him the twenty pounds and for the rest he may kissand that you may ask him because i am in pain about it that dean bolton is such a whipster tis the most obliging thing in the world in dean sterne to be so kind to you i believe he knows it will please me and makes up that way his other usage16 no we have had none of your snow but a little one morning yet i think it was great snow for an hour or so but no longer i had heard of will crowes17 death before but not the foolish circumstance that hastened his end no i have taken care that captain pratt18 shall not suffer by lord angleseas death19 i will try some contrivance to get a copy of my picture from jervas i will make sir andrew fountaine buy one as for himself and i will pay him again and take it that is provided i have money to spare when i leave thispoor john is he gone and madam parvisol20 has been in town humm why tighe21 and i when he comes shall not take any notice of each other i would not do it much in this town though we had not fallen outi was today at mr sternes lodging he was not within and mr leigh is not come to town but i will do dingleys errand when i see him what do i know whether china be dear or no i once took a fancy of resolving to grow mad for it but now it is off i suppose i told you in some former letter and so you only want some saladdishes and plates and etc yes yes you shall i suppose you have named as much as will cost five poundsnow to stellas little postscript and i am almost crazed that you vex yourself for not writing cannot you dictate to dingley and not strain your little dear eyes i am sure it is the grief of my soul to think you are out of order pray be quiet and if you will write shut your eyes and write just a line and no more thus how do you do mrs stella that was written with my eyes shut faith i think it is better than when they are open and then dingley may stand by and tell you when you go too high or too lowmy letters of business with packets if there be any more occasion for such must be enclosed to mr addison at st jamess coffeehouse but i hope to hear as soon as i see mr harley that the main difficulties are over and that the rest will be but formtake two or three nutgalls take two or threegalls stop your receipt in youri have no need ont here is a clutter well so much for your letter which i will now put up in my letterpartition in my cabinet as i always do every letter as soon as i answer it method is good in all things order governs the world the devil is the author of confusion a general of an army a minister of state to descend lower a gardener a weaver etc that may make a fine observation if you think it worth finishing but i have not time is not this a terrible long piece for one evening i dined today with patty rolt at my cousin leachs22 with a pox in the city he is a printer and prints the postman oh hoo and is my cousin god knows how and he married mrs baby aires of leicester and my cousin thomson was with us and my cousin leach offers to bring me acquainted with the author of the postman23 and says he does not doubt but the gentleman will be glad of my acquaintance and that he is a very ingenious man and a great scholar and has been beyond sea but i was modest and said may be the gentleman was shy and not fond of new acquaintance and so put it off and i wish you could hear me repeating all i have said of this in its proper tone just as i am writing it it is all with the same cadence with oh hoo or as when little girls say i have got an apple miss and i wont give you some it is plaguy twelvepenny weather this last week and has cost me ten shillings in coach and chair hire if the fellow that has your money will pay it let me beg you to buy bank stock with it which is fallen near thirty per cent and pays eight pounds per cent and you have the principal when you please it will certainly soon rise i would to god lady giffard would put in the four hundred pounds she owes you24 and take the five per cent common interest and give you the remainder i will speak to your mother about it when i see her i am resolved to buy three hundred pounds of it for myself and take up what i have in ireland and i have a contrivance for it that i hope will do by making a friend of mine buy it as for himself and i will pay him when i can get in my money i hope stratford will do me that kindness ill ask him tomorrow or next day  27 mr rowe25 the poet desired me to dine with him today i went to his office he is undersecretary in mr addisons place that he had in england and there was mr prior and they both fell commending my shower beyond anything that has been written of the kind there never was such a shower since danaes etc you must tell me how it is liked among you i dined with rowe prior could not come and after dinner we went to a blind tavern26 where congreve sir richard temple27 estcourt28 and charles main29 were over a bowl of bad punch the knight sent for six flasks of his own wine for me and we stayed till twelve but now my head continues pretty well i have left off my drinking and only take a spoonful mixed with water for fear of the gout or some ugly distemper and now because it is late i will etc  28 garth and addison and i dined today at a hedge30 tavern then i went to mr harley but he was denied or not at home so i fear i shall not hear my business is done before this goes then i visited lord pembroke31 who is just come to town and we were very merry talking of old things and i hit him with one pun then i went to see the ladies butler and the son of a whore of a porter denied them so i sent them a threatening message by another lady for not excepting me always to the porter i was weary of the coffeehouse and ford32 desired me to sit with him at next door which i did like a fool chatting till twelve and now am got into bed i am afraid the new ministry is at a terrible loss about money the whigs talk so it would give one the spleen and i am afraid of meeting mr harley out of humour they think he will never carry through this undertaking god knows what will come of it i should be terribly vexed to see things come round again it will ruin the church and clergy for ever but i hope for better i will send this on tuesday whether i hear any further news of my affair or not  29 mr addison and i dined today with lord mountjoy which is all the adventures of this dayi chatted a while tonight in the coffeehouse this being a full night and now am come home to write some business  30 i dined today at mrs vanhomrighs and sent a letter to poor mrs long33 who writes to us but is god knows where and will not tell anybody the place of her residence i came home early and must go write  31 the month ends with a fine day and i have been walking and visiting lewis and concerting where to see mr harley i have no news to send you aire34 they say is taken though the whitehall letters this morning say quite the contrary tis good if it be true i dined with mr addison and dick stewart lord mountjoys brother35 a treat of addisons they were halffuddled but not i for i mixed water with my wine and left them together between nine and ten and i must send this by the bellman which vexes me but i will put it off no longer pray god it does not miscarry i seldom do so but i can put off little md no longer pray give the under note to mrs brent  i am a pretty gentleman and you lose all your money at cards sirrah stella i found you out i did so  i am staying before i can fold up this letter till that ugly d is dry in the last line but one do not you see it o lord i am loth to leave you faithbut it must be so till the next time pox take that d i will blot it to dry it     letter 8  london oct 31 1710  so now i have sent my seventh to your fourth young women and now i will tell you what i would not in my last that this morning sitting in my bed i had a fit of giddiness the room turned round for about a minute and then it went off leaving me sickish but not very and so i passed the day as i told you but i would not end a letter with telling you this because it might vex you and i hope in god i shall have no more of it i saw dr cockburn1 today and he promises to send me the pills that did me good last year and likewise has promised me an oil for my ear that he has been making for that ailment for somebody else  nov 1 i wish md a merry new year you know this is the first day of it with us2 i had no giddiness today but i drank brandy and have bought a pint for two shillings i sat up the night before my giddiness pretty late and writ very much so i will impute it to that but i never eat fruit nor drink ale but drink better wine than you do as i did today with mr addison at lord mountjoys then went at five to see mr harley who could not see me for much company but sent me his excuse and desired i would dine with him on friday and then i expect some answer to this business which must either be soon done or begun again and then the duke of ormond and his people will interfere for their honour and do nothing i came home at six and spent my time in my chamber without going to the coffeehouse which i grow weary of and i studied at leisure writ not above forty lines some inventions of my own and some hints and read not at all and this because i would take care of presto for fear little md should be angry  2 i took my four pills last night and they lay an hour in my throat and so they will do tonight i suppose i could swallow four affronts as easily i dined with dr cockburn today and came home at seven but mr ford has been with me till just now and it is near eleven i have had no giddiness today mr dopping3 i have seen and he tells me coldly my shower is liked well enough theres your irish judgment i writ this post to the bishop of clogher it is now just a fortnight since i heard from you i must have you write once a fortnight and then i will allow for wind and weather how goes ombre does mrs walls4 win constantly as she used to do and mrs stoyte5 i have not thought of her this long time how does she i find we have a cargo of irish coming for london i am sorry for it but i never go near them and tighe is landed but mrs wesley6 they say is going home to her husband like a fool well little monkeys mine i must go write and so goodnight  3 i ought to read these letters i write after i have done for looking over thus much i found two or three literal mistakes which should not be when the hand is so bad but i hope it does not puzzle little dingley to read for i think i mend but methinks when i write plain i do not know how but we are not alone all the world can see us a bad scrawl is so snug it looks like a pmd7 we have scurvy tatlers of late so pray do not suspect me i have one or two hints i design to send him and never any more he does not deserve it he is governed by his wife most abominably8 as bad as  i never saw her since i came nor has he ever made me an invitation either he dares not or is such a thoughtless tisdall9 fellow that he never minds10 it so what care i for his wit for he is the worst company in the world till he has a bottle of wine in his head i cannot write straighter in bed so you must be contentat night in bed stay let me see wheres this letter to md among these papers oh here well i will go on now but i am very busy smoke the new pen i dined with mr harley today and am invited there again on sunday i have now leave to write to the primate and archbishop of dublin that the queen has granted the firstfruits but they are to take no notice of it till a letter is sent them by the queens orders from lord dartmouth secretary of state to signify it the bishops are to be made a corporation to dispose of the revenue etc and i shall write to the archbishop of dublin tomorrow i have had no giddiness today i know not whether they will have any occasion for me longer to be here nor can i judge till i see what letter the queen sends to the bishops and what they will do upon it if despatch be used it may be done in six weeks but i cannot judge they sent me today a new commission signed by the primate and archbishop of dublin11 and promise me letters to the two archbishops here but mine a  for it all the thing is done and has been so these ten days though i had only leave to tell it today i had this day likewise a letter from the bishop of clogher who complains of my not writing and what vexes me says he knows you have long letters from me every week why do you tell him so tis not right faith but i wont be angry with md at distance i writ to him last post before i had his and will write again soon since i see he expects it and that lord and lady mountjoy12 put him off upon me to give themselves ease lastly i had this day a letter from a certain naughty rogue called md and it was n 5 which i shall not answer tonight i thank you no faith i have other fish to fry but tomorrow or next day will be time enough i have put mds commissions in a memorandum paper i think i have done all before and remember nothing but this today about glasses and spectacles and spectacle cases i have no commission from stella but the chocolate and handkerchiefs and those are bought and i expect they will be soon sent i have been with and sent to mr sterne two or three times to know but he was not within odds my life what am i doing i must go write and do business  4 i dined today at kensington with addison steele etc came home and writ a short letter to the archbishop of dublin to let him know the queen has granted the thing etc i writ in the coffeehouse for i stayed at kensington till nine and am plaguy weary for colonel proud13 was very ill company and i will never be of a party with him again and i drank punch and that and ill company has made me hot  5 i was with mr harley from dinner to seven this night and went to the coffeehouse where dr davenant14 would fain have had me gone and drink a bottle of wine at his house hard by with dr chamberlen15 but the puppy used so many words that i was afraid of his company and though we promised to come at eight i sent a messenger to him that chamberlen was going to a patient and therefore we would put it off till another time so he and the comptroller16 and i were prevailed on by sir matthew dudley to go to his house where i stayed till twelve and left them davenant has been teasing me to look over some of his writings that he is going to publish but the rogue is so fond of his own productions that i hear he will not part with a syllable and he has lately put out a foolish pamphlet called the third part of tom double to make his court to the tories whom he had left  6 i was today gambling17 in the city to see patty rolt who is going to kingston where she lodges but to say the truth i had a mind for a walk to exercise myself and happened to be disengaged for dinners are ten times more plentiful with me here than ever or than in dublin i wont answer your letter yet because i am busy i hope to send this before i have another from md it would be a sad thing to answer two letters together as md does from presto but when the two sides are full away the letter shall go that is certain like it or not like it and that will be about three days hence for the answeringnight will be a long one  7 i dined today at sir richard temples with congreve vanbrugh lieutenantgeneral farrington18 etc vanbrugh i believe i told you had a long quarrel with me about those verses on his house19 but we were very civil and cold lady marlborough used to tease him with them which had made him angry though he be a goodnatured fellow it was a thanksgivingday20 and i was at court where the queen passed us by with all tories about her not one whig buckingham21 rochester22 leeds23 shrewsbury berkeley of stratton lord keeper harcourt mr harley lord pembroke etc and i have seen her without one tory the queen made me a curtsey and said in a sort of familiar way to presto how does md i considered she was a queen and so excused her24 i do not miss the whigs at court but have as many acquaintance there as formerly  8 heres ado and a clutter i must now answer mds fifth but first you must know i dined at the portugal envoys25 today with addison vanbrugh admiral wager26 sir richard temple27 methuen28 etc i was weary of their company and stole away at five and came home like a good boy and studied till ten and had a fire o ho and now am in bed i have no fireplace in my bedchamber but tis very warm weather when ones in bed your fine cap29 madam dingley is too little and too hot i will have that fur taken off i wish it were far enough and my old velvet cap is good for nothing is it velvet under the fur i was feeling but cannot find if it be twill do without it else i will face it but then i must buy new velvet but may be i may beg a piece what shall i do well now to rogue mds letter god be thanked for stellas eyes mending and god send it holds but faith you writ too much at a time better write less or write it at ten times yes faith a long letter in a morning from a dear friend is a dear thing i smoke a compliment little mischievous girls i do so but who are those wiggs that think i am turned tory do you mean whigs which wiggs and wat do you mean i know nothing of raymond and only had one letter from him a little after i came herepray remember morgan raymond is indeed like to have much influence over me in london and to share much of my conversation i shall no doubt introduce him to harley and lord keeper and the secretary of state the tatler upon ithuriels spear30 is not mine madam what a puzzle there is betwixt you and your judgment in general you may be sometimes sure of things as that about style31 because it is what i have frequently spoken of but guessing is mine a and i defy mankind if i please why i writ a pamphlet when i was last in london that you and a thousand have seen and never guessed it to be mine could you have guessed the shower in town to be mine how chance you did not see that before your last letter went but i suppose you in ireland did not think it worth mentioning nor am i suspected for the lampoon only harley said he smoked me have i told you so before and some others knew it tis called the rod of sid hamet and i have written several other things that i hear commended and nobody suspects me for them nor you shall not know till i see you again what do you mean that boards near me that i dine with now and then i know no such person i do not dine with boarders what the pox you know whom i have dined with every day since i left you better than i do what do you mean sirrah slids my ailment has been over these two months almost impudence if you vex me i will give ten shillings a week for my lodging for i am almost stk out of this with the sink and it helps me to verses in my shower32 well madam dingley what say you to the world to come what ballad why go look it was not good for much have patience till i come back patience is a gay thing as etc i hear nothing of lord mountjoys coming for ireland when is stellas birthday in march lord bless me my turn at christ church33 it is so natural to hear you write about that i believe you have done it a hundred times it is as fresh in my mind the verger coming to you and why to you would he have you preach for me o pox on your spelling of latin johnsonibus atque that is the way how did the dean get that name by the end twas you betrayed me not i faith ill not break his head your mother is still in the country i suppose for she promised to see me when she came to town i writ to her four days ago to desire her to break it to lady giffard to put some money for you in the bank which was then fallen thirty per cent would to god mine had been here i should have gained one hundred pounds and got as good interest as in ireland and much securer i would fain have borrowed three hundred pounds but money is so scarce here there is no borrowing by this fall of stocks tis rising now and i knew it would it fell from one hundred and twentynine to ninetysix i have not heard since from your mother do you think i would be so unkind not to see her that you desire me in a style so melancholy mrs raymond34 you say is with child i am sorry for it and so is i believe her husband mr harley speaks all the kind things to me in the world and i believe would serve me if i were to stay here but i reckon in time the duke of ormond may give me some addition to laracor why should the whigs think i came to england to leave them sure my journey was no secret i protest sincerely i did all i could to hinder it as the dean can tell you although now i do not repent it but who the devil cares what they think am i under obligations in the least to any of them all rot em for ungrateful dogs i will make them repent their usage before i leave this place they say here the same thing of my leaving the whigs but they own they cannot blame me considering the treatment i have had i will take care of your spectacles as i told you before and of the bishop of killalas but i will not write to him i have not time what do you mean by my fourth madam dinglibus does not stella say you have had my fifth goody blunder you frighted me till i looked back well this is enough for one night pray give my humble service to mrs stoyte and her sister kate is it or sarah35 i have forgot her name faith i think i will even and to mrs walls and the archdeacon send this tomorrow no faith that will be in ten days from the last i will keep it till saturday though i write no more but what if a letter from md should come in the meantime why then i would only say madam i have received your sixth letter your most humble servant to command presto and so conclude well now i will write and think a little and so to bed and dream of md  9 i have my mouth full of water and was going to spit it out because i reasoned with myself how could i write when my mouth was full hant you done things like that reasoned wrong at first thinking well i was to see mr lewis this morning and am to dine a few days hence as he tells me with mr secretary st john and i must contrive to see harley soon again to hasten this business from the queen i dined today at lord mountraths36 with lord mountjoy37 etc but the wine was not good so i came away stayed at the coffeehouse till seven then came home to my fire the maidenhead of my second halfbushel and am now in bed at eleven as usual tis mighty warm yet i fear i should catch cold this wet weather if i sat an evening in my room after coming from warm places and i must make much of myself because md is not here to take care of presto and i am full of business writing etc and do not care for the coffeehouse and so this serves for all together not to tell it you over and over as silly people do but presto is a wiser man faith than so let me tell you gentlewomen see i am got to the third side but faith i will not do that often but i must say something early today till the letter is done and on saturday it shall go so i must leave something till tomorrow till tomorrow and next day  10 o lord i would this letter was with you with all my heart if it should miscarry what a deal would be lost i forgot to leave a gap in the last line but one for the seal like a puppy but i should have allowed for night goodnight but when i am taking leave i cannot leave a bit faith but i fancy the seal will not come there i dined today at lady lucys where they ran down my shower and said sid hamet was the silliest poem they ever read and told prior so whom they thought to be author of it dont you wonder i never dined there before but i am too busy and they live too far off and besides i do not like women so much as i did md you must know are not women i supped tonight at addisons with garth steele and mr dopping and am come home late lewis has sent to me to desire i will dine with some company i shall like i suppose it is mr secretary st johns appointment i had a letter just now from raymond who is at bristol and says he will be at london in a fortnight and leave his wife behind him and desires any lodging in the house where i am but that must not be i shall not know what to do with him in town to be sure i will not present him to any acquaintance of mine and he will live a delicate life a parson and a perfect stranger paaast twelvvve oclock38 and so goodnight etc oh but i forgot jemmy leigh is come to town says he has brought dingleys things and will send them with the first convenience my parcel i hear is not sent yet he thinks of going for ireland in a month etc i cannot write tomorrow becausewhat because of the archbishop because i will seal my letter early because i am engaged from noon till night because of many kind of things and yet i will write one or two words tomorrow morning to keep up my journal constant and at night i will begin my ninth  11 morning by candlelight you must know that i am in my nightgown every morning between six and seven and patrick is forced to ply me fifty times before i can get on my nightgown and so now i will take my leave of my own dear md for this letter and begin my next when i come home at night god almighty bless and protect dearest md farewell etc  this letters as long as a sermon faith     letter 9  london nov 11 1710  i dined today by invitation with the secretary of state mr st john mr harley came in to us before dinner and made me his excuses for not dining with us because he was to receive people who came to propose advancing money to the government there dined with us only mr lewis and dr freind1 that writ lord peterborows actions in spain i stayed with them till just now between ten and eleven and was forced again to give my eighth to the bellman which i did with my own hands rather than keep it till next post the secretary used me with all the kindness in the world prior came in after dinner and upon an occasion he the secretary said the best thing i ever read is not yours but dr swifts on vanbrugh which i do not reckon so very good neither2 but prior was damped until i stuffed him with two or three compliments i am thinking what a veneration we used to have for sir william temple because he might have been secretary of state at fifty and here is a young fellow hardly thirty in that employment3 his father is a man of pleasure4 that walks the mall and frequents st jamess coffeehouse and the chocolatehouses and the young son is principal secretary of state is there not something very odd in that he told me among other things that mr harley complained he could keep nothing from me i had the way so much of getting into him i knew that was a refinement and so i told him and it was so indeed it is hard to see these great men use me like one who was their betters and the puppies with you in ireland hardly regarding me but there are some reasons for all this which i will tell you when we meet at coming home i saw a letter from your mother in answer to one i sent her two days ago it seems she is in town but cannot come out in a morning just as you said and god knows when i shall be at leisure in an afternoon for if i should send her a pennypost letter and afterwards not be able to meet her it would vex me and besides the days are short and why she cannot come early in a morning before she is wanted i cannot imagine i will desire her to let lady giffard know that she hears i am in town and that she would go to see me to inquire after you i wonder she will confine herself so much to that old beasts humour you know i cannot in honour see lady giffard and consequently not go into her house this i think is enough for the first time  12 and how could you write with such thin paper i forgot to say this in my former cannot you get thicker why thats a common caution that writingmasters give their scholars you must have heard it a hundred times tis this       if paper be thin       ink will slip in       but if it be thick       you may write with a stick5  i had a letter today from poor mrs long6 giving me an account of her present life obscure in a remote country town and how easy she is under it poor creature tis just such an alteration in life as if presto should be banished from md and condemned to converse with mrs raymond i dined today with ford sir richard levinge7 etc at a place where they board hard by i was lazy and not very well sitting so long with company yesterday i have been very busy writing this evening at home and had a fire i am spending my second halfbushel of coals and now am in bed and tis late  13 i dined today in the city and then went to christen will franklands8 child and lady falconbridge9 was one of the godmothers this is a daughter of oliver cromwell and extremely like him by his pictures that i have seen i stayed till almost eleven and am now come home and gone to bed my business in the city was to thank stratford for a kindness he has done me which now i will tell you i found bank stock was fallen thirtyfour in the hundred and was mighty desirous to buy it but i was a little too late for the cheapest time being hindered by business here for i was so wise to guess to a day when it would fall my project was this i had three hundred pounds in ireland and so i writ to mr stratford in the city to desire he would buy me three hundred pounds in bank stock and that he should keep the papers and that i would be bound to pay him for them and if it should rise or fall i would take my chance and pay him interest in the meantime i showed my letter to one or two people who understand those things and they said money was so hard to be got here that no man would do it for me however stratford who is the most generous man alive has done it but it costs one hundred pounds and a half that is ten shillings so that three hundred pounds cost me three hundred pounds and thirty shillings this was done about a week ago and i can have five pounds for my bargain already before it fell it was one hundred and thirty pounds and we are sure it will be the same again i told you i writ to your mother to desire that lady giffard would do the same with what she owes you but she tells your mother she has no money i would to god all you had in the world was there whenever you lend money take this rule to have two people bound who have both visible fortunes for they will hardly die together and when one dies you fall upon the other and make him add another security and if rathburn now i have his name pays you in your money let me know and i will direct parvisol accordingly however he shall wait on you and know so ladies enough of business for one night paaaaast twelvvve oclock i must only add that after a long fit of rainy weather it has been fair two or three days and is this day grown cold and frosty so that you must give poor little presto leave to have a fire in his chamber morning and evening too and he will do as much for you  14 what has your chancellor10 lost his senses like will crowe11 i forgot to tell dingley that i was yesterday at ludgate bespeaking the spectacles at the great shop there and shall have them in a day or two this has been an insipid day i dined with mrs vanhomrigh and came gravely home after just visiting the coffeehouse sir richard cox12 they say is sure of going over lord chancellor who is as arrant a puppy as ever ate bread but the duke of ormond has a natural affection to puppies which is a thousand pities being none himself i have been amusing myself at home till now and in bed bid you goodnight  15 i have been visiting this morning but nobody was at home secretary st john sir thomas hanmer13 sir chancellor coxcomb etc i attended the duke of ormond with about fifty other irish gentlemen at skinners hall where the londonderry society laid out three hundred pounds to treat us and his grace with a dinner three great tables with the dessert laid in mighty figure sir richard levinge and i got discreetly to the head of the second table to avoid the crowd at the first but it was so cold and so confounded a noise with the trumpets and hautboys that i grew weary and stole away before the second course came on so i can give you no account of it which is a thousand pities i called at ludgate for dingleys glasses and shall have them in a day or two and i doubt it will cost me thirty shillings for a microscope but not without stellas permission for i remember she is a virtuoso shall i buy it or no tis not the great bulky ones nor the common little ones to impale a louse saving your presence upon a needles point but of a more exact sort and clearer to the sight with all its equipage in a little trunk that you may carry in your pocket tell me sirrah shall i buy it or not for you i came home straight etc  16 i dined today in the city with mr manley14 who invited mr addison and me and some other friends to his lodging and entertained us very handsomely i returned with mr addison and loitered till nine in the coffeehouse where i am hardly known by going so seldom i am here soliciting for trounce you know him he was gunner in the former yacht and would fain be so in the present one if you remember him a good lusty freshcoloured fellow shall i stay till i get another letter from md before i close up this mr addison and i meet a little seldomer than formerly although we are still at bottom as good friends as ever but differ a little about party  17 today i went to lewis at the secretarys office where i saw and spoke to mr harley who promised in a few days to finish the rest of my business i reproached him for putting me on the necessity of minding him of it and rallied him etc which he took very well i dined today with one mr gore elder brother to a young merchant of my acquaintance and stratford and my other friend merchants dined with us where i stayed late drinking claret and burgundy and am just got to bed and will say no more but that it now begins to be time to have a letter from my own little md for the last i had above a fortnight ago and the date was old too  18 today i dined with lewis and prior at an eatinghouse but with lewiss wine lewis went away and prior and i sat on where we complimented one another for an hour or two upon our mutual wit and poetry coming home at seven a gentleman unknown stopped me in the pall mall and asked my advice said he had been to see the queen who was just come to town and the people in waiting would not let him see her that he had two hundred thousand men ready to serve her in the war that he knew the queen perfectly well and had an apartment at court and if she heard he was there she would send for him immediately that she owed him two hundred thousand pounds etc and he desired my opinion whether he should go try again whether he could see her or because perhaps she was weary after her journey whether he had not better stay till tomorrow i had a mind to get rid of my companion and begged him of all love to go and wait on her immediately for that to my knowledge the queen would admit him that this was an affair of great importance and required despatch and i instructed him to let me know the success of his business and come to the smyrna coffeehouse where i would wait for him till midnight and so ended this adventure i would have fain given the man half a crown but was afraid to offer it him lest he should be offended for beside his money he said he had a thousand pounds a year i came home not early and so madams both goodnight etc  19 i dined today with poor lord mountjoy who is ill of the gout and this evening i christened our coffeeman elliots15 child where the rogue had a most noble supper and steele and i sat among some scurvy company over a bowl of punch so that i am come home late young women and cant stay to write to little rogues  20 i loitered at home and dined with sir andrew fountaine at his lodging and then came home a silly day  21 i was visiting all this morning and then went to the secretarys office and found mr harley with whom i dined and secretary st john etc and harley promised in a very few days to finish what remains of my business prior was of the company and we all dine at the secretarys tomorrow i saw stellas mother this morning she came early and we talked an hour i wish you would propose to lady giffard to take the three hundred pounds out of her hands and give her common interest for life and security that you will pay her the bishop of clogher or any friend would be security for you if you gave them countersecurity and it may be argued that it will pass better to be in your hands than hers in case of mortality etc your mother says if you write she will second it and you may write to your mother and then it will come from her she tells me lady giffard has a mind to see me by her discourse but i told her what to say with a vengeance she told lady giffard she was going to see me she looks extremely well i am writing16 in my bed like a tiger and so goodnight etc  22 i dined with secretary st john and lord dartmouth who is tother secretary dined with us and lord orrery17 and prior etc harley called but could not dine with us and would have had me away while i was at dinner but i did not like the company he was to have we stayed till eight and i called at the coffeehouse and looked where the letters lie but no letter directed for mr presto at last i saw a letter to mr addison and it looked like a rogues hand so i made the fellow give it me and opened it before him and saw three letters all for myself so truly i put them in my pocket and came home to my lodging well and so you shall hear well and so i found one of them in dingleys hand and tother in stellas and the third in domvilles18 well so you shall hear so said i to myself what now two letters from md together but i thought there was something in the wind so i opened one and i opened tother and so you shall hear one was from walls well but tother was from our own dear md yes it was o faith have you received my seventh young women already then i must send this tomorrow else there will be old19 doings at our house faithwell i wont answer your letter in this no faith catch me at that and i never saw the like well but as to walls tell him with service to him and wife etc that i have no imagination of mr pratts20 losing his place and while pratt continues clements is in no danger and i have already engaged lord hyde21 he speaks of for pratt and twenty others but if such a thing should happen i will do what i can i have above ten businesses of other peoples now on my hands and i believe shall miscarry in half it is your sixth i now have received i writ last post to the bishop of clogher again shall i send this tomorrow well i will to oblige md which would you rather a short letter every week or a long one every fortnight a long one well it shall be done and so goodnight well but is this a long one no i warrant you too long for naughty girls  23 i only ask have you got both the ten pounds or only the first i hope you mean both pray be good housewives and i beg you to walk when you can for health have you the horse in town and do you ever ride him how often confess ahhh sirrah have i caught you can you contrive to let mrs fenton22 know that the request she has made me in her letter i will use what credit i have to bring about although i hear it is very difficult and i doubt i shall not succeed cox is not to be your chancellor all joined against him i have been supping with lord peterborow at his house with prior lewis and dr freind tis the ramblingest lying rogue on earth dr raymond is come to town tis late and so i bid you goodnight  24 i tell you pretty management ned southwell told me the other day he had a letter from the bishops of ireland with an address to the duke of ormond to intercede with the queen to take off the firstfruits i dined with him today and saw it with another letter to him from the bishop of kildare23 to call upon me for the papers etc and i had last post one from the archbishop of dublin telling me the reason of this proceeding that upon hearing the duke of ormond was declared lord lieutenant they met and the bishops were for this project and talked coldly of my being solicitor as one that was favoured by tother party etc but desired that i would still solicit24 now the wisdom of this is admirable for i had given the archbishop an account of my reception from mr harley and how he had spoken to the queen and promised it should be done but mr harley ordered me to tell no person alive some time after he gave me leave to let the primate and archbishop know that the queen had remitted the firstfruits and that in a short time they should have an account of it in form from lord dartmouth secretary of state so while their letter was on the road to the duke of ormond and southwell mine was going to them with an account of the thing being done i writ a very warm answer25 to the archbishop immediately and showed my resentments as i ought against the bishops only in good manners excepting himself i wonder what they will say when they hear the thing is done i was yesterday forced to tell southwell so that the queen had done it etc for he said my lord duke would think of it some months hence when he was going for ireland and he had it three years in doing formerly without any success i give you free leave to say on occasion that it is done and that mr harley prevailed on the queen to do it etc as you please as i hope to live i despise the credit of it out of an excess of pride and desire you will not give me the least merit when you talk of it but i would vex the bishops and have it spread that mr harley had done it pray do so your mother sent me last night a parcel of wax candles and a bandbox full of small plumcakes i thought it had been something for you and without opening them sent answer by the maid that brought them that i would take care to send the things etc but i will write her thanks is this a long letter sirrahs now are you satisfied i have had no fit since the first i drink brandy every morning and take pills every night never fear i ant vexed at this puppy business of the bishops although i was a little at first i will tell you my reward mr harley will think he has done me a favour the duke of ormond perhaps that i have put a neglect on him and the bishops in ireland that i have done nothing at all so goes the world but i have got above all this and perhaps i have better reason for it than they know and so you shall hear no more of firstfruits dukes harleys archbishops and southwells  i have slipped off raymond upon some of his countrymen to show him the town etc and i lend him patrick he desires to sit with me in the evenings upon which i have given patrick positive orders that i am not within at evenings     letter 10  london nov 25 1710  i will tell you something thats plaguy silly i had forgot to say on the 23d in my last where i dined and because i had done it constantly i thought it was a great omission and was going to interline it but at last the silliness of it made me cry pshah and i let it alone i was today to see the parliament meet but only saw a great crowd and ford and i went to see the tombs at westminster and sauntered so long i was forced to go to an eatinghouse for my dinner bromley1 is chosen speaker nemine contradicente do you understand those two words and pompey colonel hills2 black designs to stand speaker for the footmen3 i am engaged to use my interest for him and have spoken to patrick to get him some votes we are now all impatient for the queens speech what she will say about removing the ministry etc i have got a cold and i dont know how but got it i have and am hoarse i dont know whether it will grow better or worse whats that to you i wont answer your letter tonight ill keep you a little longer in suspense i cant send it your mothers cakes are very good and one of them serves me for a breakfast and so ill go sleep like a good boy  26 i have got a cruel cold and stayed within all this day in my nightgown and dined on sixpennyworth of victuals and read and writ and was denied to everybody dr raymond4 called often and i was denied and at last when i was weary i let him come up and asked him without consequence how patrick denied me and whether he had the art of it so by this means he shall be used to have me denied to him otherwise he would be a plaguy trouble and hindrance to me he has sat with me two hours and drank a pint of ale cost me fivepence and smoked his pipe and it is now past eleven that he is just gone well my eighth is with you now young women and your seventh to me is somewhere in a postboys bag and so go to your gang of deans and stoytes and walls and lose your money go sauceboxes and so goodnight and be happy dear rogues oh but your box was sent to dr hawkshaw by sterne and you will have it with hawkshaw and spectacles etc etc  27 today mr harley met me in the court of requests5 and whispered me to dine with him at dinner i told him what those bishops had done and the difficulty i was under he bid me never trouble myself he would tell the duke of ormond the business was done and that he need not concern himself about it so now i am easy and they may hang themselves for a parcel of insolent ungrateful rascals i suppose i told you in my last how they sent an address to the duke of ormond and a letter to southwell to call on me for the papers after the thing was over but they had not received my letter though the archbishop might by what i writ to him have expected it would be done well there is an end of that and in a little time the queen will send them notice etc and so the methods will be settled and then i shall think of returning although the baseness of those bishops makes me love ireland less than i did  28 lord halifax sent to invite me to dinner where i stayed till six and crossed him in all his whig talk and made him often come over to me i know he makes court to the new men although he affects to talk like a whig i had a letter today from the bishop of clogher but i writ to him lately that i would obey his commands to the duke of ormond he says i bid him read the london shaver and that you both swore it was shaver and not shower6 you all lie and you are puppies and cant read prestos hand the bishop is out entirely in his conjectures of my share in the tatlersi have other things to mind and of much greater importance7 else i have little to do to be acquainted with a new ministry who consider me a little more than irish bishops do  29 now for your saucy good dear letter let me see what does it say come then i dined today with ford and went home early he debauched8 me to his chamber again with a bottle of wine till twelve so goodnight i cannot write an answer now you rogues  30 today i have been visiting which i had long neglected and i dined with mrs barton alone and sauntered at the coffeehouse till past eight and have been busy till eleven and now ill answer your letter saucebox well let me see now again my wax candles almost out but however ill begin well then do not be so tedious mr presto what can you say to mds letter make haste have done with your preambleswhy i say i am glad you are so often abroad your mother thinks it is want of exercise hurts you and so do i she called here tonight but i was not within thats by the bye sure you do not deceive me stella when you say you are in better health than you were these three weeks for dr raymond told me yesterday that smyth of the blind quay had been telling mr leigh that he left you extremely ill and in short spoke so that he almost put poor leigh into tears and would have made me run distracted though your letter is dated the 11th instant and i saw smyth in the city above a fortnight ago as i passed by in a coach pray pray dont write stella until you are mighty mighty mighty mighty well in your eyes and are sure it wont do you the least hurt or come ill tell you what you mistress stella shall write your share at five or six sittings one sitting a day and then comes dingley all together and then stella a little crumb towards the end to let us see she remembers presto and then conclude with something handsome and genteel as your most humblecumdumble or etc o lord does patrick write word of my not coming till spring insolent man he know my secrets no as my lord mayor said no if i thought my shirt knew etc faith i will come as soon as it is any way proper for me to come but to say the truth i am at present a little involved with the present ministry in some certain things which i tell you as a secret and soon as ever i can clear my hands i will stay no longer for i hope the firstfruit business will be soon over in all its forms but to say the truth the present ministry have a difficult task and want me etc perhaps they may be just as grateful as others but according to the best judgment i have they are pursuing the true interest of the public and therefore i am glad to contribute what is in my power for gods sake not a word of this to any aliveyour chancellor9 why madam i can tell you he has been dead this fortnight faith i could hardly forbear our little language about a nasty dead chancellor as you may see by the blot10 ploughing a pox plough them theyll plough me to nothing but have you got your money both the ten pounds how durst he pay you the second so soon pray be good huswifes ay well and joe why i had a letter lately from joe desiring i would take some care of their poor town11 who he says will lose their liberties to which i desired dr raymond would return answer that the town had behaved themselves so ill to me so little regarded the advice i gave them and disagreed so much among themselves that i was resolved never to have more to do with them but that whatever personal kindness i could do to joe should be done pray when you happen to see joe tell him this lest raymond should have blundered or forgottenpoor mrs wesleywhy these poligyes12 for being abroad why should you be at home at all until stella is quite wellso here is mistress stella again with her two eggs etc my shower admired with you why the bishop of clogher says he has seen something of mine of the same sort better than the shower i suppose he means the morning13 but it is not half so good i want your judgment of things and not your countrys how does md like it and do they taste it all etc i am glad dean bolton14 has paid the twenty pounds why should not i chide the bishop of clogher for writing to the archbishop of cashel15 without sending the letter first to me it does not signify a  for he has no credit at court stuffthey are all puppies i will break your head in good earnest young woman for your nasty jest about mrs barton16 unlucky sluttikin what a word is there faith i was thinking yesterday when i was with her whether she could break them or no and it quite spoilt my imagination mrs walls does stella win as she pretends no indeed doctor she loses always and will play so ventersomely how can she win see here now ant you an impudent lying slut do open domvilles letter what does it signify if you have a mind yes faith you write smartly with your eyes shut all was well but the n see how i can do it madam stella your humble servant17 o but one may look whether one goes crooked or no and so write on i will tell you what you may do you may write with your eyes half shut just as when one is going to sleep i have done so for two or three lines now it is but just seeing enough to go straightnow madam dingley i think i bid you tell mr walls that in case there be occasion i will serve his friend as far as i can but i hope there will be none yet i believe you will have a new parliament but i care not whether you have or no a better you are mistaken in all your conjectures about the tatlers i have given him one or two hints and you have heard me talk about the shilling18 faith these answering letters are very long ones you have taken up almost the room of a week in journals and i will tell you what i saw fellows wearing crosses today19 and i wondered what was the matter but just this minute i recollect it is little prestos birthday and i was resolved these three days to remember it when it came but could not pray drink my health today at dinner do you rogues do you like sid hamets rod do you understand it all well now at last i have done with your letter and so i will lay me down to sleep and about fair maids and i hope merry maids all  dec 1 morning i

desirous to talk with me and while he was wriggling himself into my favour that dog henley asked me aloud whether i would go to see lord somers as i had promised which was a lie and all to vex poor lord salisbury who is a high tory he played two or three other such tricks and i was forced to leave my lord and i came home at seven and have been writing ever since and will now go to bed the other day i saw jack temple24 in the court of requests it was the first time of seeing him so we talked two or three careless words and parted is it true that your recorder and mayor and fanatic aldermen a month or two ago at a solemn feast drank mr harleys lord rochesters25 and other tory healths let me know it was confidently said herethe scoundrels it shant do tom  6 when is this letter to go i wonder harkee young women tell me that saturday next for certain and not before then it will be just a fortnight time enough for naughty girls and long enough for two letters faith congreve and delaval have at last prevailed on sir godfrey kneller to entreat me to let him draw my picture for nothing but i know not yet when i shall sit26it is such monstrous rainy weather that there is no doing with it secretary st john sent to me this morning that my dining with him today was put off till tomorrow so i peaceably sat with my neighbour ford dined with him and came home at six and am now in bed as usual and now it is time to have another letter from md yet i would not have it till this goes for that would look like two letters for one is it not whimsical that the dean has never once written to me and i find the archbishop very silent to that letter i sent him with an account that the business was done i believe he knows not what to write or say and i have since written twice to him both times with a vengeance27 well go to bed sirrahs and so will i but have you lost today three shillings o fie o fie  7 no i wont send this letter today nor till saturday faith and i am so afraid of one from md between this and that if it comes i will just say i received a letter and that is all i dined today with mr secretary st john where were lord anglesea28 sir thomas hanmer prior freind etc and then made a debauch after nine at priors house and have eaten cold pie and i hate the thoughts of it and i am full and i dont like it and i will go to bed and it is late and so goodnight  8 today i dined with mr harley and prior but mr st john did not come though he promised he chid me for not seeing him oftener here is a damned libellous pamphlet come out against lord wharton giving the character first and then telling some of his actions the character is very well but the facts indifferent29 it has been sent by dozens to several gentlemens lodgings and i had one or two of them but nobody knows the author or printer we are terribly afraid of the plague they say it is at newcastle30 i begged mr harley for the love of god to take some care about it or we are all ruined there have been orders for all ships from the baltic to pass their quarantine before they land but they neglect it you remember i have been afraid these two years  9 o faith you are a saucy rogue i have had your sixth letter just now before this is gone but i will not answer a word of it only that i never was giddy since my first fit but i have had a cold just a fortnight and cough with it still morning and evening but it will go off it is however such abominable weather that no creature can walk they say here three of your commissioners will be turned out ogle south and st quintin31 and that dick stewart32 and ludlow will be two of the new ones i am a little soliciting for another it is poor lord abercorn33 but that is a secret i mean that i befriend him is a secret but i believe it is too late by his own fault and ill fortune i dined with him today i am heartily sorry you do not go to clogher faith i am and so god almighty protect poor dear dear dear dearest md farewell till tonight ill begin my eleventh tonight so i am always writing to little md     letter 11  london dec 9 1710  so young women i have just sent my tenth to the postoffice and as i told you have received

must go write idle things and twittle twattle1 whats here to do with your little mds and so i put this by for a while tis now late and i can only say md is a dear saucy rogue and what then presto loves them the better  10 this son of a b patrick is out of the way and i can do nothing am forced to borrow coals tis now six oclock and i am come home after a pure walk in the park delicate weather begun only today a terrible storm last night we hear one of your packetboats is cast away and young beau swift2 in it and general sankey3 i know not the truth you will before me raymond talks of leaving the town in a few days and going in a month to ireland for fear his wife should be too far gone and forced to be brought to bed here i think he is in the right but perhaps this packetboat will fright him he has no relish for london and i do not wonder at it he has got some templars from ireland that show him the town i do not let him see me above twice a week and that only while i am dressing in the morningso now the puppys come in and i have got my own ink but a new pen and so now you are rogues and sauceboxes till i go to bed for i must go study sirrahs now i think of it tell the bishop of clogher he shall not cheat me of one inch of my bell metal you know it is nothing but to save the town money and enniskillen can afford it better than laracor he shall have but one thousand five hundred weight i have been reading etc as usual and am now going to bed and i find this days article is long enough so get you gone till tomorrow and then i dined with sir matthew dudley  11 i am come home again as yesterday and the puppy had again locked up my ink notwithstanding all i said to him yesterday but he came home a little after me so all is well they are lighting my fire and ill go study the fair weather is gone again and it has rained all day i do not like this open weather though some say it is healthy they say it is a false report about the plague at newcastle4 i have no news today i dined with mrs vanhomrigh to desire them to buy me a scarf and lady abercorn5 is to buy me another to see who does best mine is all in rags i saw the duke of richmond6 yesterday at court again but would not speak to him i believe we are fallen out i am now in bed and it has rained all this evening like wildfire have you so much rain in your town raymond was in a fright as i expected upon the news of this shipwreck but i persuaded him and he leaves this town in a week i got him acquainted with sir robert raymond7 the solicitorgeneral who owns him to be of his family and i believe it may do him a kindness by being recommended to your new lord chancellori had a letter from mrs long that has quite turned my stomach against her no less than two nasty jests in it with dashes to suppose them she is corrupted in that country town8 with vile conversationi will not answer your letter till i have leisure so let this go on as it will what care i what cares saucy presto  12 i was today at the secretarys office with lewis and in came lord rivers9 who took lewis out and whispered him and then came up to me to desire my acquaintance etc so we bowed and complimented a while and parted and i dined with phil savage10 and his irish club at their boardingplace and passing an evening scurvily enough did not come home till eight mr addison and i hardly meet once a fortnight his parliament and my different friendships keep us asunder sir matthew dudley turned away his butler yesterday morning and at night the poor fellow died suddenly in the streets was not it an odd event but what care you but then i knew the butlerwhy it seems your packetboat is not lost psha how silly that is when i had already gone through the forms and said it was a sad thing and that i was sorry for it but when must i answer this letter of our mds here it is it lies between this paper on tother side of the leaf one of these oddcomeshortlys ill consider and so goodnight  13 morning

letter in a week but it is longer every day and so i keep it a fortnight and then tis cheaper by one half i have never been giddy dear stella since that morning i have taken a whole box of pills and kecked26 at them every night and drank a pint of brandy at morningsoh then you kept prestos little birthday27 would to god i had been with you i forgot it as i told you before rediculous madam i suppose you mean ridiculous let me have no more of that tis the author of the atalantiss28 spelling i have mended it in your letter and can stella read this writing without hurting her dear eyes o faith i am afraid not have a care of those eyes pray pray pretty stellatis well enough what you observe that if i writ better perhaps you would not read so well being used to this manner tis an alphabet you are used to you know such a pothook makes a letter and you know what letter and so and soill swear he told me so and that they were long letters too but i told him it was a gasconnade of yours etc i am talking of the bishop of clogher how he forgot turn over29 i had not room on tother side to say that so i did it on this i fancy thats a good irish blunder ah why do not you go down to clogher nautinautinautideargirls i dare not say nauti without dear o faith you govern me but seriously im sorry you dont go as far as i can judge at this distance no we would get you another horse i will make parvisol get you one i always doubted that horse of yours prythee sell him and let it be a present to me my heart aches when i think you ride him order parvisol to sell him and that you are to return me the money i shall never be easy until he is out of your hands faith i have dreamt five or six times of horses stumbling since i had your letter if he cant sell him let him run this winter faith if i was near you i would whip your  to some tune for your grave saucy answer about the dean and johnsonibus i would young women and did the dean preach for me30 very well why would they have me stand here and preach to them no the tatler of the shilling31 was not mine more than the hint and two or three general heads for it i have much more important business on my hands and besides the ministry hate to think that i should help him and have made reproaches on it and i frankly told them i would do it no more this is a secret though madam stella you win eight shillings you win eight fiddlesticks faith you say nothing of what you lose young womeni hope manley is in no great danger for ned southwell is his friend and so is sir thomas frankland and his brother john manley stands up heartily for him on tother side all the gentlemen of ireland here are furiously against him now mistress dingley ant you an impudent slut to expect a letter next packet from presto when you confess yourself that you had so lately two letters in four days unreasonable baggage no little dingley i am always in bed by twelve i mean my candle is out by twelve and i take great care of myself pray let everybody know upon occasion that mr harley got the firstfruits from the queen for the clergy of ireland and that nothing remains but the forms etc so you say the dean and you dined at stoytes and mrs stoyte was in raptures that i remembered her i must do it but seldom or it will take off her rapture but what now you saucy sluts all this written in a morning and i must rise and go abroad pray stay till night do not think i will squander mornings upon you pray good madam faith if i go on longer in this trick of writing in the morning i shall be afraid of leaving it off and think you expect it and be in awe goodmorrow sirrahs i will riseat night i went today to the court of requests i will not answer the rest of your letter yet that by the way in hopes to dine with mr harley but lord dupplin32 his soninlaw told me he did not dine at home so i was at a loss until i met with mr secretary st john and went home and dined with him where he told me of a good bite33 lord rivers told me two days ago that he was resolved to come sunday fortnight next to hear me preach before the queen i assured him the day was not yet fixed and i knew nothing of it today the secretary told me that his father sir harry st john34 and lord rivers were to be at st jamess church to hear me preach there and were assured i was to preach so there will be another bite for i know nothing of the matter but that mr harley and st john are resolved i must preach before the queen and the secretary of state has told me he will give me three weeks warning but i desired to be excused which he will not st john you shall not be excused however i hope they will forget it for if it should happen all the puppies hereabouts will throng to hear me and expect something wonderful and be plaguily baulked for i shall preach plain honest stuff i stayed with st john till eight and then came home and patrick desired leave to go abroad and by and by comes up the girl to tell me a gentleman was below in a coach who had a bill to pay me so i let him come up and who should it be but mr addison and sam dopping to haul me out to supper where i stayed till twelve if patrick had been at home i should have scaped this for i have taught him to deny me almost as well as mr harleys porterwhere did i leave off in mds letter let me see so now i have it you are pleased to say madam dingley that those who go for england can never tell when to come back do you mean this as a reflection upon presto madam sauceboxes i will come back as soon as i can as hope saved35 and i hope with some advantage unless all ministries be alike as perhaps they may i hope hawkshaw is in dublin before now and that you have your things and like your spectacles if you do not you shall have better i hope dingleys tobacco did not spoil stellas chocolate and that all is safe pray let me know mr addison and i are different as black and white and i believe our friendship will go off by this damned business of party he cannot bear seeing me fall in so with this ministry but i love him still as well as ever though we seldom meethussy stella you jest about poor congreves eyes36 you do so hussy but ill bang your bones faithyes steele was a little while in prison or at least in a spunginghouse some time before i came but not since37pox on your convocations and your lamberts38 they write with a vengeance i suppose you think it a piece of affectation in me to wish your irish folks would not like my shower but you are mistaken i should be glad to have the general applause there as i have here though i say it but i have only that of one or two and therefore i would have none at all but let you all be in the wrong i dont know this is not what i would say but i am so tosticated with supper and stuff that i cant express myselfwhat you say of sid hamet is well enough that an enemy should like it and a friend not and that telling the author would make both change their opinions why did you not tell griffyth39 that you fancied there was something in it of my manner but first spur up his commendation to the height as we served my poor uncle about the sconce that i mended well i desired you to give what i intended for an answer to mrs fenton40 to save her postage and myself trouble and i hope i have done it if you hant  15 lord what a long days writing was yesterdays answer to your letter sirrahs i dined today with lewis and ford whom i have brought acquainted lewis told me a pure thing i had been hankering with mr harley to save steele his other employment and have a little mercy on him and i had been saying the same thing to lewis who is mr harleys chief favourite lewis tells mr harley how kindly i should take it if he would be reconciled to steele etc mr harley on my account falls in with it and appoints steele a time to let him attend him which steele accepts with great submission but never comes nor sends any excuse whether it was blundering sullenness insolence or rancour of party i cannot tell but i shall trouble myself no more about him i believe addison hindered him out of mere spite being grated41 to the soul to think he should ever want my help to save his friend yet now he is soliciting me to make another of his friends queens secretary at geneva and ill do it if i can it is poor pastoral philips42  16 o why did you leave my picture behind you at tother lodgings forgot it well but pray remember it now and dont roll it up dye hear but hang it carefully in some part of your room where chairs and candles and mopsticks wont spoil it sirrahs no truly i will not be godfather to goody walls this bout and i hope she will have no more there will be no quiet nor cards for this child i hope it will die the day after the christening mr harley gave me a paper with an account of the sentence you speak of against the lads that defaced the statue43 and that ingoldsby44 reprieved that part of it of standing before the statue i hope it was never executed we have got your broderick out45 doyne46 is to succeed him and cox47 doyne and so theres an end of your letter tis all answered and now i must go on upon my own stock go on did i say why i have written enough but this is too soon to send it yet young women faith i dare not use you to it youll always expect it what remains shall be only short journals of a day and so ill rise for this morningat night i dined with my opposite neighbour darteneuf and i was soliciting this day to present the bishop of clogher vicechancellor48 but it wont do they are all set against him and the duke of ormond they say has resolved to dispose of it somewhere else well little saucy rogues do not stay out too late tonight because it is saturday night and young women should come home soon then  17 i went to court to seek a dinner but the queen was not at church she has got a touch of the gout so the court was thin and i went to the coffeehouse and sir thomas frankland and his eldest son and i went and dined with his son william49 i talked a great deal to sir thomas about manley and find he is his good friend and so has ned southwell been and i hope he will be safe though all the irish folks here are his mortal enemies there was a devilish bite today they had it i know not how that i was to preach this morning at st jamess church an abundance went among the rest lord radnor who never is abroad till three in the afternoon i walked all the way home from hatton garden at six by moonlight a delicate night raymond called at nine but i was denied and now i am in bed between eleven and twelve just going to sleep and dream of my own dear roguish impudent pretty md  18 you will now have short days works just a few lines to tell you where i am and what i am doing only i will keep room for the last day to tell you news if there be any worth sending i have been sometimes like to do it at the top of my letter until i remark it would be old before it reached you i was hunting to dine with mr harley today but could not find him and so i dined with honest dr cockburn and came home at six and was taken out to next door by dopping and ford to drink bad claret and oranges and we let raymond come to us who talks of leaving the town tomorrow but i believe will stay a day or two longer it is now late and i will say no more but end this line with bidding my own dear saucy md goodnight etc  19 i am come down proud stomach in one instance for i went today to see the duke of buckingham50 but came too late then i visited mrs barton51 and thought to have dined with some of the ministry but it rained and mrs vanhomrigh was nigh and i took the opportunity of paying her for a scarf she bought me and dined there at four i went to congratulate with lord shelburne for the death of poor lady shelburne dowager52 he was at his country house and returned while i was there and had not heard of it and he took it very well i am now come home before six and find a packet from the bishop of clogher with one enclosed to the duke of ormond which is ten days earlier dated than another i had from parvisol however tis no matter for the duke has already disposed of the vicechancellorship to the archbishop of tuam53 and i could not help it for it is a thing wholly you know in the dukes power and i find the bishop has enemies about the duke i write this while patrick is folding up my scarf and doing up the fire for i keep a fire it costs me twelvepence a week and so be quiet till i am gone to bed and then sit down by me a little and we will talk a few words more well now md is at my bedside and now what shall we say how does mrs stoyte what had the dean for supper how much did mrs walls win poor lady shelburne well go get you to bed sirrahs  20 morning i was up this morning early and shaved by candlelight and write this by the fireside poor raymond just came in and took his leave of me he is summoned by high order from his wife but pretends he has had enough of london i was a little melancholy to part with him he goes to bristol where they are to be with his merchant brother and now thinks of staying till may so she must be brought to bed in england he was so easy and manageable that i almost repent i suffered him to see me so seldom but he is gone and will save patrick some lies in a week patrick is grown admirable at it and will make his fortune how now sirrah must i write in a morning to your impudence       stay till night      and then ill write      in black and white      by candlelight      of wax so bright      it helps the sight      a bite a bite  marry come up mistress boldfaceat night dr raymond came back and goes tomorrow i did not come home till eleven and found him here to take leave of me i went to the court of requests thinking to find mr harley and dine with him and refused henley and everybody and at last knew not where to go and met jemmy leigh by chance and he was just in the same way so i dined at his lodgings on a beefsteak and drank your health then left him and went to the tavern with ben tooke and portlack the duke of ormonds secretary drinking nasty white wine till eleven i am sick and ashamed of it etc  21 i met that beast ferris lord berkeleys54 steward formerly i walked with him a turn in the park and that scoundrel dog is as happy as an emperor has married a wife with a considerable estate in land and houses about this town and lives at his ease at hammersmith see your confounded sect55 well i had the same luck today with mr harley twas a lovely day and went by water into the city and dined with stratford at a merchants house and walked home with as great a dunce as ferris i mean honest colonel caulfeild56 and came home by eight and now am in bed and going to sleep for a wager and will send this letter on saturday and so but first i will wish you a merry christmas and a happy new year and pray god we may never keep them asunder again  22 morning i am going now to mr harleys levee on purpose to vex him i will say i had no other way of seeing him etc patrick says it is a dark morning and that the duke of argyle57 is to be knighted today the booby means installed at windsor but i must rise for this is a shavingday and patrick says there is a good fire i wish md were by it or i by mdsat night i forgot to tell you madam dingley that i paid nine shillings for your glass and spectacles of which three were for the bishops case i am sorry i did not buy you such another case but if you like it i will bring one over with me pray tell me the glass to read was four shillings the spectacles two and have you had your chocolate leigh says he sent the petticoat by one mr spencer pray have you no further commissions for me i paid the glassman but last night and he would have made me a present of the microscope worth thirty shillings and would have sent it home along with me i thought the deuce was in the man he said i could do him more service than that was worth etc i refused his present but promised him all service i could do him and so now i am obliged in honour to recommend him to everybodyat night i went to mr harleys levee he came and asked me what i had to do there and bid me come and dine with him on a family dinner which i did and it was the first time i ever saw his lady58 and daughter59 at five my lord keeper60 came in i told mr harley he had formerly presented me to sir simon harcourt but now must to my lord keeper so he laughed etc  23 morning this letter goes tonight without fail i hope there is none from you yet at the coffeehouse i will send and see by and by and let you know and so and so patrick goes to see for a letter what will you lay is there one from md or no no i say done for sixpence why has the dean never once written to me i won sixpence i won sixpence there is not one letter to presto goodmorrow dear sirrahs stratford and i dine today with lord mountjoy god almighty preserve and bless you farewell etc  i have been dining at lord mountjoys and am come to study our news from spain this post takes off some of our fears the parliament is prorogued today or adjourned rather till after the holidays bank stock is 105 so i may get 12 shillings for my bargain already patrick the puppy is abroad and how shall i send this letter goodnight little dears both and be happy and remember your poor presto that wants you sadly as hope saved let me go study naughty girls and dont keep me at the bottom of the paper o faith if you knew what lies on my hands constantly you would wonder to see how i could write such long letters but well talk of that some other time goodnight again and god bless dear md with his best blessings yes yes and dingley and stella and me too etc  ask the bishop of clogher about the pun i sent him of lord stawels brother61 it will be a pure bite this letter has 199 lines in it beside all postscripts i had a curiosity to reckon  there is a long letter for you  it is longer than a sermon faith  i had another letter from mrs fenton who says you were with her i hope you did not go on purpose i will answer her letter soon it is about some money in lady giffards hands  they say you have had eight packets due to you so pray madams do not blame presto but the wind  my humble service to mrs walls and mrs stoyte i missed the former a good while     letter 12  london dec 23 1710  i have sent my 11th tonight as usual and begin the dozenth and i told you i dined with stratford at lord mountjoys and i will tell you no more at present guess for why because i am going to mind things and mighty affairs not your nasty firstfruitsi let them alone till mr harley gets the queens letterbut other things of greater moment that you shall know one day when the ducks have eaten up all the dirt so sit still a while just by me while i am studying and dont say a word i charge you and when i am going to bed i will take you along and talk with you a little while so there sit therecome then let us see what we have to say to these saucy brats that will not let us go sleep at past eleven why i am a little impatient to know how you do but that i take it for a standing maxim that when you are silent all is pretty well because that is the way i will deal with you and if there was anything you ought to know now i would write by the first post although i had written but the day before remember this young women and god almighty preserve you both and make us happy together and tell me how accompts stand between us that you may be paid long before it is due not to want i will return no more money while i stay so that you need not be in pain to be paid but let me know at least a month before you can want observe this dye hear little dear sirrahs and love presto as presto loves md etc  24 you will have a merrier christmas eve than we here i went up to court before church and in one of the rooms there being but little company a fellow in a red coat without a sword came up to me and after words of course asked me how the ladies did i asked what ladies he said mrs dingley and mrs johnson very well said i when i heard from them last and pray when came you from thence sir he said i never was in ireland and just at that word lord winchelsea1 comes up to me and the man went off as i went out i saw him again and recollected him it was vedeau2 with a pox i then went and made my apologies that my head was full of something i had to say to lord winchelsea etc and i asked after his wife and so all was well and he inquired after my lodging because he had some favour to desire of me in ireland to recommend somebody to somebody i know not what it is when i came from church i went up to court again where sir edmond bacon3 told me the bad news from spain4 which you will hear before this reaches you as we have it now we are undone there and it was odd to see the whole countenances of the court changed so in two hours lady mountjoy5 carried me home to dinner where i stayed not long after and came home early and now am got into bed for you must always write to your mds in bed that is a maxim       mr white and mr red      write to md when abed      mr black and mr brown      write to md when youre down      mr oak and mr willow      write to md on your pillow  what is this faith i smell fire what can it be this house has a thousand stinks in it i think to leave it on thursday and lodge over the way faith i must rise and look at my chimney for the smell grows stronger stayi have been up and in my room and found all safe only a mouse within the fender to warm himself which i could not catch i smelt nothing there but now in my bedchamber i smell it again i believe i have singed the woollen curtain and that is all though i cannot smoke it presto is plaguy silly tonight ant he yes and so he be ay but if i should wake and see fire well i will venture so goodnight etc  25 pray young women if i write so much as this every day how will this paper hold a fortnights work and answer one of yours into the bargain you never think of this but let me go on like a simpleton i wish you a merry christmas and many many a one with poor presto at some pretty place i was at church today by eight and received the sacrament and came home by ten then went to court at two it was a collarday that is when the knights of the garter wear their collars but the queen stayed so late at sacrament that i came back and dined with my neighbour ford because all people dine at home on this day this is likewise a collarday all over england in every house at least where there is brawn thats very welli tell you a good pun a fellow hard by pretends to cure agues and has set out a sign and spells it egoes a gentleman and i observing it he said how does that fellow pretend to cure agues i said i did not know but i was sure it was not by a spell that is admirable and so you asked the bishop about that pun of lord stawels brother bite have i caught you young women must you pretend to ask after roguish puns and latin ones too oh but you smoked me and did not ask the bishop oh but you are a fool and you did i met vedeau again at court today and i observed he had a sword on i fancy he was broke and has got a commission but i never asked him vedeau i think his name is yet parvisols man is vedel that is true bank stock will fall like stockfish by this bad news and two days ago i could have got twelve pounds by my bargain but i do not intend to sell and in time it will rise it is odd that my lord peterborow foretold this loss two months ago one night at mr harleys when i was there he bid us count upon it that stanhope would lose spain before christmas that he would venture his head upon it and gave us reasons and though mr harley argued the contrary he still held to his opinion i was telling my lord angelsea this at court this morning and a gentleman by said he had heard my lord peterborow affirm the same thing i have heard wise folks say an ill tongue may do much and tis an odd saying       once i guessed right       and i got credit byt       thrice i guessed wrong       and i kept my credit on  no it is you are sorry not i  26 by the lord harry i shall be undone here with christmas boxes the rogues of the coffeehouse have raised their tax everyone giving a crown and i gave mine for shame besides a great many halfcrowns to great mens porters etc i went today by water into the city and dined with no less a man than the city printer6 there is an intimacy between us built upon reasons that you shall know when i see you but the rain caught me within twelvepenny length of home i called at mr harleys who was not within dropped my halfcrown with his porter drove to the coffeehouse where the rain kept me till nine i had letters today from the archbishop of dublin and mr bernage7 the latter sends me a melancholy account of lady shelburnes8 death and his own disappointments and would gladly be a captain if i can help him i will  27 morning i bespoke a lodging over the way for tomorrow and the dog let it yesterday to another i gave him no earnest so it seems he could do it patrick would have had me give him earnest to bind him but i would not so i must go saunter today for a lodging somewhere else did you ever see so open a winter in england we have not had two frosty days but it pays it off in rain we have not had three fair days these six weeks o faith i dreamt mightily of md last night but so confused i cannot tell a word i have made ford acquainted with lewis and today we dined together in the evening i called at one or two neighbours hoping to spend a christmas evening but none were at home they were all gone to be merry with others i have often observed this that in merry times everybody is abroad where the deuce are they so i went to the coffeehouse and talked with mr addison an hour who at last remembered to give me two letters which i cannot answer tonight nor tomorrow neither i can assure you young women count upon that i have other things to do than to answer naughty girls an old saying and true       letters from mds      must not be answered in ten days  it is but bad rhyme etc  28 today i had a message from sir thomas hanmer to dine with him the famous dr smalridge9 was of the company and we sat till six and i came home to my new lodgings in st albans street10 where i pay the same rent eight shillings a week for an apartment two pair of stairs but i have the use of the parlour to receive persons of quality and i am got into my new bed etc  29 sir andrew fountaine has been very ill this week and sent to me early this morning to have prayers which you know is the last thing i found the doctors and all in despair about him i read prayers to him found he had settled all things and when i came out the nurse asked me whether i thought it possible he could live for the doctors thought not i said i believed he would live for i found the seeds of life in him which i observe seldom fail and i found them in poor dearest stella when she was ill many years ago and tonight i was with him again and he was mightily recovered and i hope he will do well and the doctor approved my reasons but if he should die i should come off scurvily the secretary of state mr st john sent to me to dine with him mr harley and lord peterborow dined there too and at night came lord rivers lord peterborow goes to vienna in a day or two he has promised to make me write to him mr harley went away at six but we stayed till seven i took the secretary aside and complained to him of mr harley that he had got the queen to grant the firstfruits promised to bring me to her and get her letter to the bishops of ireland but the last part he had not done in six weeks and i was in danger to lose reputation etc he took the matter right desired me to be with him on sunday morning and promises me to finish the affair in four days so i shall know in a little time what i have to trust toit is nine oclock and i must go study you little rogues and so goodnight etc  30 morning the weather grows cold you sauceboxes sir andrew fountaine they bring me word is better i will go rise for my hands are starving while i write in bed night now sir andrew fountaine is recovering he desires to be at ease for i called in the morning to read prayers but he had given orders not to be disturbed i have lost a legacy by his living for he told me he had left me a picture and some books etc i called to see my quondam neighbour ford do you know what quondam is though and he engaged me to dine with him for he always dines at home on operadays i came home at six writ to the archbishop then studied till past eleven and stole to bed to write to md these few lines to let you know i am in good health at the present writing hereof and hope in god md is so too i wonder i

proverbs have always old words in them lins is leave off       but if on new year you write nones      md then will bang your bones  but patrick says i must risenight i was early this morning with secretary st john and gave him a memorial to get the queens letter for the firstfruits who has promised to do it in a very few days he told me he had been with the duke of marlborough who was lamenting his former wrong steps in joining with the whigs and said he was worn out with age fatigues and misfortunes i swear it pitied me and i really think they will not do well in too much mortifying that man although indeed it is his own fault he is covetous as hell and ambitious as the prince of it he would fain have been general for life and has broken all endeavours for peace to keep his greatness and get money he told the queen he was neither covetous nor ambitious she said if she could have conveniently turned about she would have laughed and could hardly forbear it in his face he fell in with all the abominable measures of the late ministry because they gratified him for their own designs yet he has been a successful general and i hope he will continue his command o lord smoke the politics to md well but if you like them i will scatter a little now and then and mine are all fresh from the chief hands well i dined with mr harley and came away at six there was much company and i was not merry at all mr harley made me read a paper of verses of priors i read them plain without any fine manner and prior swore i should never read any of his again but he would be revenged and read some of mine as bad i excused myself and said i was famous for reading verses the worst in the world and that everybody snatched them from me when i offered to begin so we laughedsir andrew fountaine still continues ill he is plagued with some sort of bile  jan 1 morning i wish my dearest pretty dingley and stella a happy new year and health and mirth and good stomachs and frs company faith i did not know how to write fr i wondered what was the matter but now i remember i always write pdfr patrick wishes me a happy new year and desires i would rise for it is a good fire and faith tis cold i was so politic last night with md never saw the like get the examiners and read them the last nine or ten are full of the reasons for the late change and of the abuses of the last ministry and the great men assure me they are all true they are written by their encouragement and direction i must rise and go see sir andrew fountaine but perhaps tonight i may answer mds letter so goodmorrow my mistresses all goodmorrow       i wish you both a merry new year      roast beef minced pies and good strong beer      and me a share of your good cheer      that i was there or you were

presto madam stella you write your eighth when you receive mine now i write my twelfth when i receive your eighth do not you allow for what are upon the road simpleton what say you to that and so you kept prestos little birthday i warrant would to god i had been at the health rather than here where i have no manner of pleasure nothing but eternal business upon my hands i shall grow wise in time but no more of that only i say amen with my heart and vitals that we may never be asunder again ten days together while poor presto lives    i cant be merry so near any splenetic talk so i made that long line and now alls well again yes you are a pretending slut indeed with your fourth and fifth in the margin and your journal and everything windwe saw no wind here nothing at all extraordinary at any time we had it once when you had it not but an old saying and a true       i hate all wind       before and behind       from cheeks with eyes       or from blind  your chimney fall down god preserve you i suppose you only mean a brick or two but thats a dned lie of your chimney being carried to the next house with the wind dont put such things upon us those matters will not pass here keep a little to possibilities my lord hertford12 would have been ashamed of such a stretch you should take care of what company you converse with when one gets that faculty tis hard to break ones self of it jemmy leigh talks of going over but quando i do not know when he will go oh now you have had my ninth now you are come up with me marry come up with you indeed i know all that business of lady s13 will nobody cut that dys throat five hundred pounds do you call poor pay for living three months the life of a king they say she died with grief partly being forced to appear as a witness in court about some squabble among their servantsthe bishop of clogher showed you a pamphlet14 well but you must not give your mind to believe those things people will say anything the character is here reckoned admirable but most of the facts are trifles it was first printed privately here and then some bold cur ventured to do it publicly and sold two thousand in two days who the author is must remain uncertain do you pretend to know impudence how durst you think so pox on your parliaments the archbishop has told me of it but we do not vouchsafe to know anything of it here no no no more of your giddiness yet thank you stella for asking after it thank you god almighty bless you for your kindness to poor presto you write to lady giffard and your mother upon what i advise when it is too late but yet i fancy this bad news will bring down stocks so low that one might buy to great advantage i design to venture going to see your mother some day when lady giffard is abroad well keep your rathburn15 and stuff i thought he was to pay in your money upon his houses to be flung down about the what do you call itwell madam dingley i sent your enclosed to bristol but have not heard from raymond since he went come come young women i keep a good fire it costs me twelvepence a week and i fear something more vex me and i will have one in my bedchamber too no did not i tell you but just now we have no high winds here have you forgot alreadynow youre at it again silly stella why does your mother say my candles are scandalous they are good sixes in the pound and she said i was extravagant enough to burn them by daylight i never burn fewer at a time than one what would people have the d burst hawkshaw he told me he had not the box and the next day sterne told me he had sent it a fortnight ago patrick could not find him tother day but he shall tomorrow dear life and heart do you tease me does stella tease presto that palsywater was in the box it was too big for a packet and i was afraid of its breaking leigh was not in town then or i would not have trusted it to sterne whom yet i have befriended enough to do me more kindness than that ill never rest till you have it or till it is in a way for you to have it poor dear rogue naughty to think it teases me how could i ever forgive myself for neglecting anything that related to your health sure i were a devil if i did     see how far i am forced to stand from stella because i am afraid she thinks poor presto has not been careful about her little things i am sure i bought them immediately according to order and packed them up with my own hands and sent them to sterne and was six times with him about sending them away i am glad you are pleased with your glasses i have got another velvet cap a new one lord herbert16 bought and presented me one morning i was at breakfast with him where he was as merry and easy as ever i saw him yet had received a challenge half an hour before and half an hour after fought a duel it was about ten days ago you are mistaken in your guesses about tatlers i did neither write that on noses nor religion17 nor do i send him of late any hints at allindeed stella when i read your letter i was not uneasy at all but when i came to answer the particulars and found that you had not received your box it grated me to the heart because i thought through your little words that you imagined i had not taken the care i ought but there has been some blunder in this matter which i will know tomorrow and write to sterne for fear he should not be withinand pray pray presto pray now dono raymond was not above four times with me while he stayed and then only while i was dressing mrs fenton has written me another letter about some money of hers in lady giffards hands that is entrusted to me by my mother not to come to her husband i send my letters constantly every fortnight and if you will have them oftener you may but then they will be the shorter pray let parvisol sell the horse i think i spoke to you of it in a former letter i am glad you are rid of him and was in pain while i thought you rode him but if he would buy you another or anybody else and that you could be often able to ride why do not you do it  2 i went this morning early to the secretary of state mr st john and he told me from mr harley that the warrant was now drawn in order for a patent for the firstfruits it must pass through several offices and take up some time because in things the queen gives they are always considerate but that he assures me tis granted and done and past all dispute and desires i will not be in any pain at all i will write again to the archbishop tomorrow and tell him this and i desire you will say it on occasion from the secretary i went to mr sterne who said he would write to you tonight and that the box must be at chester and that some friend of his goes very soon and will carry it over i dined with mr secretary st john and at six went to darteneufs house to drink punch with him and mr addison and little harrison18 a young poet whose fortune i am making steele was to have been there but came not nor never did twice since i knew him to any appointment i stayed till past eleven and am now in bed steeles last tatler came out today you will see it before this comes to you and how he takes leave of the world he never told so much as mr addison of it who was surprised as much as i but to say the truth it was time for he grew cruel dull and dry to my knowledge he had several good hints to go upon but he was so lazy and weary of the work that he would not improve them i think i will send this after19 tomorrow shall i before tis full dingley  3 lord peterborow yesterday called me into a barbers shop and there we talked deep politics he desired me to dine with him today at the globe in the strand he said he would show me so clearly how to get spain that i could not possibly doubt it i went today accordingly and saw him among half a dozen lawyers and attorneys and hangdogs signing of deeds and stuff before his journey for he goes tomorrow to vienna i sat among that scurvy company till after four but heard nothing of spain only i find by what he told me before that he fears he shall do no good in his present journey20 we are to be mighty constant correspondents so i took my leave of him and called at sir andrew fountaines who mends much i came home ant please you at six and have been studying till now past eleven  4 morning morrow little dears o faith i have been dreaming i was to be put in prison i do not know why and i was so afraid of a black dungeon and then all i had been inquiring yesterday of sir andrew fountaines sickness i thought was of poor stella the worst of dreams is that one wakes just in the humour they leave one shall i send this today with all my heart it is two days within the fortnight but may be md are in haste to have a round dozen and then how are you come up to me with your eighth young women but you indeed ought to write twice slower than i because there are two of you i own that well then i will seal up this letter by my morning candle and carry it into the city with me where i go to dine and put it into the postoffice with my own fair hands so let me see whether i have any news to tell md they say they will very soon make some inquiries into the corruptions of the late ministry and they must do it to justify their turning them out atterbury21 we think is to be dean of christ church in oxford but the college would rather have smalridgewhats all this to you what care you for atterburys and smalridges no you care for nothing but presto faith so i will rise and bid you farewell yet i am loth to do so because there is a great bit of paper yet to talk upon but dingley will have it so yes says she make your journals shorter and send them oftener and so i will and i have cheated you another way too for this is clipped paper and holds at least six lines less than the former ones i will tell you a good thing i said to my lord carteret22 so says he my lord came up to me and asked me etc no said i my lord never did nor ever can come up to you we all pun here sometimes lord carteret set down prior tother day in his chariot and prior thanked him for his charity that was fit for dilly23 i do not remember i heard one good one from the ministry which is really a shame henley is gone to the country for christmas the puppy comes here without his wife24 and keeps no house and would have me dine with him at eatinghouses but i have only done it once and will do it no more he had not seen me for some time in the coffeehouse and asking after me desired lord herbert to tell me i was a beast for ever after the order of melchisedec did you ever read the scripture25 it is only changing the word priest to beasti think i am bewitched to write so much in a morning to you little md let me go will you and ill come again tonight in a fine clean sheet of paper but i can nor will stay no longer now no i wont for all your wheedling no no look off do not smile at me and say pray pray presto write a little more ah you are a wheedling slut you be so nay but prithee turn about and let me go do tis a good girl and do o faith my morning candle is just out and i must go now in spite of my teeth for my bedchamber is dark with curtains and i am at the wrong side so farewell etc etc  i am in the dark almost i must have another candle when i am up to seal this but i will fold it up in the dark and make what you can of this for i can only see this paper i am writing upon service to mrs walls and mrs stoyte  god almighty bless you etc what i am doing i cant see but i will fold it up and not look on it again     letter 13  london jan 4 171011  i was going into the city where i dined and put my 12th with my own fair hands into the postoffice as i came back which was not till nine this night i dined with people that you never heard of nor is it worth your while to know an authoress and a printer1 i walked home for exercise and at eleven got to bed and all the while i was undressing myself there was i speaking monkey things in air just as if md had been by and did not recollect myself till i got into bed i writ last night to the archbishop and told him the warrant was drawn for the firstfruits and i told him lord peterborow was set out for his journey to vienna but it seems the lords have addressed to have him stay to be examined about spanish affairs upon this defeat there and to know where the fault lay etc so i writ to the archbishop a lie but i think it was not a sin  5 mr secretary st john sent for me this morning so early that i was forced to go without shaving which put me quite out of method i called at mr fords and desired him to lend me a shaving and so made a shift to get into order again lord here is an impertinence sir andrew fountaines mother and sister2 are come above a hundred miles from worcester to see him before he died they got here but yesterday and he must have been past hopes or past fears before they could reach him i fell a scolding when i heard they were coming and the people about him wondered at me and said what a mighty content it would be on both sides to die when they were with him i knew the mother she is the greatest overdo3 upon earth and the sister they say is worse the poor man will relapse again among them here was the scoundrel brother always crying in the outer room till sir andrew was in danger and the dog was to have all his estate if he died and it is an ignorant worthless scoundrelrake and the nurses were comforting him and desiring he would not take on so i dined today the first time with ophy butler4 and his wife and you supped with the dean and lost twoandtwenty pence at cards and so mrs walls is brought to bed of a girl who died two days after it was christened and betwixt you and me she is not very sorry she loves her ease and diversions too well to be troubled with children i will go to bed  6 morning i went last night to put some coals on my fire after patrick was gone to bed and there i saw in a closet a poor linnet he has bought to bring over to dingley it cost him sixpence and is as tame as a dormouse i believe he does not know he is a bird where you put him there he stands and seems to have neither hope nor fear i suppose in a week he will die of the spleen patrick advised with me before he bought him i laid fairly before him the greatness of the sum and the rashness of the attempt showed how impossible it was to carry him safe over the salt sea but he would not take my counsel and he will repent it tis very cold this morning in bed and i hear there is a good fire in the room without what do you call it the diningroom i hope it will be good weather and so let me rise sirrahs do soat night i was this morning to visit the dean5 or mr prolocutor i think you call him dont you why should not i go to the deans as well as you a little black man of pretty near fifty ay the same a good pleasant man ay the same cunning enough yes one that understands his own interests as well as anybody how comes it md and i dont meet there sometimes a very good face and abundance of wit do you know his lady o lord whom do you mean6 i mean dr atterbury dean of carlisle and prolocutor pshaw presto you are a fool i thought you had meant our dean of st patrickssilly silly silly you are silly both are silly every kind of thing is silly as i walked into the city i was stopped with clusters of boys and wenches buzzing about the cakeshops like flies7 there had the fools let out their shops two yards forward into the streets all spread with great cakes frothed with sugar and stuck with streamers of tinsel and then i went to batemans the bookseller and laid out eightandforty shillings for books i bought three little volumes of lucian in french for our stella and so and so then i went to garraways8 to meet stratford and dine with him but it was an idle day with the merchants and he was gone to our end of the town so i dined with sir thomas frankland at the post office and we drank your manleys health it was in a newspaper that he was turned out but secretary st john told me it was false only that newswriter is a plaguy tory i have not seen one bit of christmas merriment  7 morning your new lord chancellor9 sets out tomorrow for ireland i never saw him he carries over one trapp10 a parson as his chaplain a sort of pretender to wit a secondrate pamphleteer for the cause whom they pay by sending him to ireland i never saw trapp neither i met tighe11 and your smyth of lovets yesterday by the exchange tighe and i took no notice of each other but i stopped smyth and told him of the box that lies for you at chester because he says he goes very soon to ireland i think this week and i will send this morning to sterne to take measures with smyth so goodmorrow sirrahs and let me rise pray i took up this paper when i came in at evening i mean this minute and then said i no no indeed md you must stay and then was laying it aside but could not for my heart though i am very busy till i just ask you how you do since morning by and by we shall talk more so let me leave you softly down little paper till then so therenow to business there i say get you gone no i will not push you neither but hand you on one sidesonow i am got into bed ill talk with you mr secretary st john sent for me this morning in all haste but i would not lose my shaving for fear of missing church i went to court which is of late always very full and young manley and i dined at sir matthew dudleysi must talk politics i protest i am afraid we shall all be embroiled with parties the whigs now they are fallen are the most malicious toads in the world we have had now a second misfortune the loss of several virginia ships i fear people will begin to think that nothing thrives under this ministry and if the ministry can once be rendered odious to the people the parliament may be chosen whig or tory as the queen pleases then i think our friends press a little too hard on the duke of marlborough the country members12 are violent to have past faults inquired into and they have reason but i do not observe the ministry to be very fond of it in my opinion we have nothing to save us but a peace and i am sure we cannot have such a one as we hoped and then the whigs will bawl what they would have done had they continued in power i tell the ministry this as much as i dare and shall venture to say a little more to them especially about the duke of marlborough who as the whigs give out will lay down his command and i question whether ever any wise state laid aside a general who had been successful nine years together whom the enemy so much dread and his own soldiers cannot but believe must always conquer and you know that in war opinion is nine parts in ten the ministry hear me always with appearance of regard and much kindness but i doubt they let personal quarrels mingle too much with their proceedings meantime they seem to value all this as nothing and are as easy and merry as if they had nothing in their hearts or upon their shoulders like physicians who endeavour to cure but feel no grief whatever the patient sufferspshaw what is all this do you know one thing that i find i can write politics to you much easier than to anybody alive but i swear my head is full and i wish i were at laracor with dear charming md etc  8 morning methinks young women i have made a great progress in four days at the bottom of this side already and no letter yet come from md that word interlined is morning i find i have been writing state affairs to md how do they relish it why anything that comes from presto is welcome though really to confess the truth if they had their choice not to disguise the matter they had rather etc now presto i must tell you you grow silly says stella that is but one bodys opinion madam i promised to be with mr secretary st john this morning but i am lazy and will not go because i had a letter from him yesterday to desire i would dine there today i shall be chid but what care ihere has been mrs south with me just come from sir andrew fountaine and going to market he is still in a fever and may live or die his mother and sister are now come up and in the house so there is a lurry13 i gave mrs south half a pistole for a new years gift so goodmorrow dears both till anonat night lord i have been with mr secretary from dinner till eight and though i drank wine and water i am so hot lady stanley14 came to visit mrs st john15 and sent up for me to make up a quarrel with mrs st john whom i never yet saw and do you think that devil of a secretary would let me go but kept me by main force though i told him i was in love with his lady and it was a shame to keep back a lover etc but all would not do so at last i was forced to break away but never went up it was then too late and here i am and have a great deal to do tonight though it be nine oclock but one must say something to these naughty mds else there will be no quiet  9 today ford and i set apart to go into the city to buy books but we only had a scurvy dinner at an alehouse and he made me go to the tavern and drink florence four and sixpence a flask damned wine so i spent my money which i seldom do and passed an insipid day and saw nobody and it is now ten oclock and i have nothing to say but that tis a fortnight tomorrow since i had a letter from md but if i have it time enough to answer here tis well enough otherwise woe betide you faith i will go to the toymans here just in pall mall and he sells great hugeous battoons16 yes faith and so he does does not he dingley yes faith dont lose your money this christmas  10 i must go this morning to mr secretary st john i promised yesterday but failed so cant write any more till night to poor dear mdat night o faith dingley i had company in the morning and could not go where i designed and i had a basket from raymond at bristol with six bottles of wine and a pound of chocolate and some tobacco to snuff and he writ under the carriage was paid but he lied or i am cheated or there is a mistake and he has written to me so confusedly about some things that lucifer could not understand him this wine is to be drunk with harleys brother17 and sir robert raymond solicitorgeneral in order to recommend the doctor to your new lord chancellor who left this place on monday and raymond says he is hasting to chester to go with himi suppose he leaves his wife behind for when he left london he had no thoughts of stirring till summer so i suppose he will be with you before this ford came and desired i would dine with him because it was operaday which i did and sent excuses to lord shelburne who had invited me  11 i am setting up a new tatler little harrison18 whom i have mentioned to you others have put him on it and i encourage him and he was with me this morning and evening showing me his first which comes out on saturday i doubt he will not succeed for i do not much approve his manner but the scheme is mr secretary st johns and mine and would have done well enough in good hands i recommended him to a printer19 whom i sent for and settled the matter between them this evening harrison has just left me and i am tired with correcting his trash  12 i was this morning upon some business with mr secretary st john and he made me promise to dine with him which otherwise i would have done with mr harley whom i have not been with these ten days i cannot but think they have mighty difficulties upon them yet i always find them as easy and disengaged as schoolboys on a holiday harley has the procuring of five or six millions on his shoulders and the whigs will not lend a groat20 which is the only reason of the fall of stocks for they are like quakers and fanatics that will only deal among themselves while all others deal indifferently with them lady marlborough offers if they will let her keep her employments never to come into the queens presence the whigs say the duke of marlborough will serve no more but i hope and think otherwise i would to heaven i were this minute with md at dublin for i am weary of politics that give me such melancholy prospects  13 o faith i had an ugly giddy fit last night in my chamber and i have got a new box of pills to take and hope i shall have no more this good while i would not tell you before because it would vex you little rogues but now it is over i dined today with lord shelburne and today little harrisons new tatler came out there is not much in it but i hope he will mend you must understand that upon steeles leaving off there were two or three scrub tatlers21 came out and one of them holds on still and today it advertised against harrisons and so there must be disputes which are genuine like the strops for razors22 i am afraid the little toad has not the true vein for it i will tell you a copy of verses when mr st john was turned out from being secretary at war three years ago he retired to the country there he was talking of something he would have written over his summerhouse and a gentleman gave him these verses       from business and the noisy world retired      nor vexed by love nor by ambition fired      gently i wait the call of charons boat      still drinking like a fish and  like a stoat  he swore to me he could hardly bear the jest for he pretended to retire like a philosopher though he was but twentyeight years old and i believe the thing was true for he had been a thorough rake i think the three grave lines do introduce the last well enough od so but i will go sleep i sleep early now  14 o faith young women i want a letter

crumb of an answer to any of mds theres for you now and yet presto bent angry faith not a bit only he will begin to be in pain next irish post except he sees mds little handwriting in the glassframe at the bar of st jamess coffeehouse where presto would never go but for that purpose presto is at home god help him every night from six till bedtime and has as little enjoyment or pleasure in life at present as anybody in the world although in full favour with all the ministry as hope saved nothing gives presto any sort of dream of happiness but a letter now and then from his own dearest md i love the expectation of it and when it does not come i comfort myself that i have it yet to be happy with yes faith and when i write to md i am happy too it is just as if methinks you were here and i prating to you and telling you where i have been well says you presto come where have you been today come lets hear now and so then i answer ford and i were visiting mr lewis and mr prior and prior has given me a fine plautus and then ford would have had me dine at his lodgings and so i would not and so i dined with him at an eatinghouse which i have not done five times since i came here and so i came home after visiting sir andrew fountaines mother and sister and sir andrew fountaine is mending though slowly  17 i was making this morning some general visits and at twelve i called at the coffeehouse for a letter from md so the man said he had given it to patrick then i went to the court of requests and treasury to find mr harley and after some time spent in mutual reproaches i promised to dine with him i stayed there till seven then called at sternes and leighs to talk about your box and to have it sent by smyth sterne says he has been making inquiries and will set things right as soon as possible i suppose it lies at chester at least i hope so and only wants a lift over to you here has little harrison been to complain that the printer i recommended to him for his tatler is a coxcomb and yet to see how things will happen for this very printer is my cousin his name is dryden leach1 did you never hear of dryden leach he that prints the postman he acted oroonoko2 hes in love with miss cross3well so i came home to read my letter from stella but the dog patrick was abroad at last he came and i got my letter i found another hand had superscribed it when i opened it i found it written all in french and subscribed bernage4 faith i was ready to fling it at patricks head bernage tells me he had been to desire your recommendation to me to make him a captain and your cautious answer that he had as much power with me as you was a notable one if you were here i would present you to the ministry as a person of ability bernage should let me know where to write to him this is the second letter i have had without any direction however i beg i may not have a third but that you will ask him and send me how i shall direct to him in the meantime tell him that if regiments are to be raised here as he says i will speak to george granville5 secretary at war to make him a captain and use what other interest i conveniently can i think that is enough and so tell him and do not trouble me with his letters when i expect them from md do you hear young women write to presto  18 i was this morning with mr secretary st john and we were to dine at mr harleys alone about some business of importance but there were two or three gentlemen there mr secretary and i went together from his office to mr harleys and thought to have been very wise but the deuce a bit the company stayed and more came and harley went away at seven and the secretary and i stayed with the rest of the company till eleven i would then have had him come away but he was in fort and though he swore he would come away at that flask there i left him i wonder at the civility of these people when he saw i would drink no more he would always pass the bottle by me and yet i could not keep the toad from drinking himself nor he would not let me go neither nor masham6 who was with us when i got home i found a parcel directed to me and opening it i found a pamphlet written entirely against myself not by name but against something i writ7 it is pretty civil and affects to be so and i think i will take no notice of it tis against something written very lately and indeed i know not what to say nor do i care and so you are a saucy rogue for losing your money today at stoytes to let that bungler beat you fie stella ant you ashamed well i forgive you this once never do so again no noooo kiss and be friends sirrahcome let me go sleep i go earlier to bed than formerly and have not been out so late these two months but the secretary was in a drinking humour so goodnight myownlittledearsaucyinsolentrogues  19 then you read that long word in the last line no8 faith hant you well when will this letter come from our md tomorrow or next day without fail yes faith and so it is coming this was an insipid snowy day no walking day and i dined gravely with mrs vanhomrigh and came home and am now got to bed a little after ten i remember old culpeppers maxim       would you have a settled head       you must early go to bed       i tell you and i tellt again       you must be in bed at ten  20 and so i went today with my new wig o hoao to visit lady worsley9 whom i had not seen before although she was near a month in town then i walked in the park to find mr ford whom i had promised to meet and coming down the mall who should come towards me but patrick and gives me

end of your letter when you got my eleventh tell me that huzzies base were we even then were we sirrah but i wont answer your letter now ill keep it for another time we had a great deal of snow today

vengeance cold i am not yet up but cannot write long my hands will freeze is there a good fire patrick yes sir then i will rise come take away the candle you must know i write on the dark side of my bedchamber and am forced to have a candle till i rise for the bed stands between me and the window and i keep the curtains shut this cold weather so pray let me rise and patrick here take away the candleat night we are now here in high frost and snow the largest fire can hardly keep us warm it is very ugly walking a bakers boy broke his thigh yesterday i walk slow make short steps and never tread on my heel tis a good proverb the devonshire people have       walk fast in snow       in frost walk slow       and still as you go       tread on your toe    when frost and snow are both together    sit by the fire and spare shoeleather  i dined today with dr cockburn10 but will not do so again in haste he has generally such a parcel of scots with him  22 morning starving starving uth uth uth uth uthdont you remember i used to come into your chamber and turn stella out of her chair and rake up the fire in a cold morning and cry uth uth uth etc o faith i must rise my hand is so cold i can write no more so goodmorrow sirrahsat night i went this morning to lady giffards house and saw your mother and made her give me a pint bottle of palsywater11 which i brought home in my pocket and sealed and tied up in a paper and sent it to mr smyth who goes tomorrow for ireland and sent a letter to him to desire his care of it and that he would inquire at chester about the box he was not within so the bottle and letter were left for him at his lodgings with strict orders to give them to him and i will send patrick in a day or two to know whether it was given etc dr stratford12 and i dined today with mr stratford13 in the city by appointment but i chose to walk there for exercise in the frost but the weather had given a little as you women call it so it was something slobbery i did not get home till nine       and now im in bed      to break your head  23 morning they tell me it freezes again but it is not so cold as yesterday so now i will answer a bit of your letterat night o faith i was just going to answer some of our mds letter this morning when a printer came in about some business and stayed an hour so i rose and then came in ben tooke and then i shaved and scribbled and it was such a terrible day i could not stir out till one and then i called at mrs bartons and we went to lady worsleys where we were to dine by appointment the earl of berkeley14 is going to be married to lady louisa lennox the duke of richmonds daughter i writ this night to dean sterne and bid him tell you all about the bottle of palsywater by smyth and tomorrow morning i will say something to your letter  24 morning come now to your letter as for your being even with me i have spoken to that already so now my dearly beloved let us proceed to the next you are always grumbling that you hant letters fast enough surely we shall have your tenth and yet before you end your letter you own you have my eleventhand why did not md go into the country with the bishop of clogher faith such a journey would have done you good stella should have rode and dingley gone in the coach the bishop of kilmore15 i know nothing of he is old and may die he lives in some obscure corner for i never heard of him as for my old friends if you mean the whigs i never see them as you may find by my journals except lord halifax and him very seldom lord somers never since the first visit for he has been a false deceitful rascal16 my new friends are very kind and i have promises enough but i do not count upon them and besides my pretences are very young to them however we will see what may be done and if nothing at all i shall not be disappointed although perhaps poor md may and then i shall be sorrier for their sakes than my owntalk of a merry christmas why do you write it so then young women sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander i have wished you all that two or three letters ago good lack and your news that mr st john is going to holland he has no such thoughts to quit the great station he is in nor if he had could i be spared to go with him so faith politic madam stella you come with your two eggs a penny etc well madam dingley and so mrs stoyte invites you and so you stay at donnybrook and so you could not write you are plaguy exact in your journals from dec 25 to jan 4 well smyth and the palsywater i have handled already and he does not lodge or rather did not for poor man now he is gone at mr jesses and all that stuff but we found his lodging and i went to stellas mother on my own head for i never remembered it was in the letter to desire another bottle but i was so fretted so tosticated and so impatient that stella should have her water i mean decently do not be rogues and so vexed with sternes carelessnesspray god stellas illness may not return if they come seldom they begin to be weary i judge by myself for when i seldom visit i grow weary of my acquaintanceleave a good deal of my tenth unanswered impudent slut when did you ever answer my tenth or ninth or any other number or who desires you to answer provided you write i defy the d to answer my letters sometimes there may be one or two things i should be glad you would answer but i forget them and you never think of them i shall never love answering letters again if you talk of answering answering quotha pretty answerers trulyas for the pamphlet you speak of and call it scandalous and that one mr presto is said to write it hear my answer fie child you must not mind what every idle body tells youi believe you lie and that the dogs were not crying it when you said so come tell truth i am sorry you go to st marys17 so soon you will be as poor as rats that place will drain you with a vengeance besides i would have you think of being in the country in summer indeed stella pippins produced plentifully parvisol could not send from laracor there were about half a score i would be glad to know whether they were good for anythingmrs walls at donnybrook with you why is not she brought to bed well well well dingley pray be satisfied you talk as if you were angry about the bishops not offering you conveniences for the journey and so he shouldwhat sort of christmas why i have had no christmas at all and has it really been christmas of late i never once thought of it my service to mrs stoyte and catherine and let catherine get the coffee ready against i come and not have so much care on her countenance for all will go wellmr bernage mr bernage mr fiddlenage i have had three letters from him now successively he sends no directions and how the d shall i write to him i would have burnt his last if i had not seen stellas hand at the bottom his request is all nonsense how can i assist him in buying and if he be ordered to go to spain go he must or else sell and i believe one can hardly sell in such a juncture if he had stayed and new regiments raised i would have used my endeavour to have had him removed although i have no credit that way or very little but if the regiment goes he ought to go too he has had great indulgence and opportunities of saving and i have urged him to it a hundred times what can i do whenever it lies in my power to do him a good office i will do it pray draw up this into a handsome speech and represent it to him from me and that i would write if i knew where to direct to him and so i have told you and desired you would tell him fifty times yes madam stella i think i can read your long concluding word but you cant read mine after bidding you goodnight and yet methinks i mend extremely in my writing but when stellas eyes are well i hope to write as bad as everso now i have answered your letter and mine is an answer for i lay yours before me and i look and write and write and look and look and write againso goodmorrow madams both and i will go rise for i must rise for i take pills at night and so i must rise early i dont know why  25 morning i did not tell you how i passed my time yesterday nor bid you goodnight and there was good reason i went in the morning to secretary st john about some business he had got a great whig with him a creature of the duke of marlborough who is a gobetween to make peace between the duke and the ministry so he came out of his closet and after a few words desired i would dine with him at three but mr lewis stayed till six before he came and there we sat talking and the time slipped so that at last when i was positive to go it was past two oclock so i came home and went straight to bed he would never let me look at his watch and i could not imagine it above twelve when we went away so i bid you goodnight for last night and now i bid you goodmorrow and i am still in bed though it be near ten but i must rise  26 27 28 29 30 i have been so lazy and negligent these last four days that i could not write to md my head is not in order and yet is not absolutely ill but giddyish and makes me listless i walk every day and take drops of dr cockburn and i have just done a box of pills and today lady kerry sent me some of her bitter drink which i design to take twice a day and hope i shall grow better i wish i were with md i long for spring and good weather and then i will come over my riding in ireland keeps me well i am very temperate and eat of the easiest meats as i am directed and hope the malignity will go off but one fit shakes me a long time i dined today with lord mountjoy yesterday at mr stones in the city on sunday at vanhomrighs saturday with ford and friday i think at vanhomrighs and that is all the journal i can send md for i was so lazy while i was well that i could not write i thought to have sent this tonight but tis ten and ill go to bed and write on tother side to parvisol tomorrow and send it on thursday and so goodnight my dears and love presto and be healthy and presto will be so too etc  cut off these notes handsomely dye hear sirrahs and give mrs brent hers and keep yours till you see parvisol and then make up the letter to him and send it him by the first opportunity and so god almighty bless you both here and ever and poor presto  what i warrant you thought at first that these last lines were another letter  dingley pray pay stella six fishes and place them to the account of your humble servant presto  stella pray pay dingley six fishes and place them to the account of your humble servant presto  there are bills of exchange for you     letter 15  london jan 31 171011  i am to send you my fourteenth tomorrow but my head having some little disorders confounds all my journals i was early this morning with mr secretary st john about some business so i could not scribble my morning lines to md they are here intending to tax all little printed penny papers a halfpenny every halfsheet which will utterly ruin grub street and i am endeavouring to prevent it1 besides i was forwarding an impeachment against a certain great person that was two of my businesses with the secretary were they not worthy ones it was fords birthday and i refused the secretary and dined with ford we are here in as smart a frost for the time as i have seen delicate walking weather and the canal and rosamonds pond2 full of the rabble sliding and with skates if you know what those are patricks birds water freezes in the gallipot and my hands in bed  feb 1 i was this morning with poor lady kerry who is much worse in her head than i she sends me bottles of her bitter and we are so fond of one another because our ailments are the same dont you know that madam stella hant i seen you conning ailments with joes wife3 and some others sirrah i walked into the city to dine because of the walk for we must take care of prestos health you know because of poor little md but i walked plaguy carefully for fear of sliding against my will but i am very busy  2 this morning mr ford came to me to walk into the city where he had business and then to buy books at batemans and i laid out one pound five shillings for a strabo and aristophanes and i have now got books enough to make me another shelf and i will have more or it shall cost me a fall and so as we came back we drank a flask of right french wine at ben tookes chamber and when i got home mrs vanhomrigh sent me word her eldest daughter4 was taken suddenly very ill and desired i would come and see her i went and found it was a silly trick of mrs armstrong5 lady lucys sister who with moll stanhope was visiting there however i rattled off the daughter  3 today i went and dined at lady lucys where you know i have not been this long time they are plaguy whigs especially the sister armstrong the most insupportable of all women pretending to wit without any taste she was running down the last examiner6 the prettiest i had read with a character of the present ministryi left them at five and came home but i forgot to tell you that this morning my cousin dryden leach the printer came to me with a heavy complaint that harrison the new tatler had turned him off and taken the last tatlers printers again he vowed revenge i answered gravely and so he left me and i have ordered patrick to deny me to him from henceforth and at night comes a letter from harrison telling me the same thing and excused his doing it without my notice because he would bear all the blame and in his tatler of this day7 he tells you the story how he has taken his old officers and there is a most humble letter from morphew and lillie to beg his pardon etc8 and lastly this morning ford sent me two letters from the coffeehouse where i hardly ever go one from the archbishop of dublin and tother fromwho do you think tother was fromill tell you because you are friends why then it was faith it was from my own dear little md n10 oh but will not answer it now no noooooh ill keep it between the two sheets here it is just under oh i lifted up the sheet and saw it there lie still you shant be answered yet little letter for i must go to bed and take care of my head  4 i avoid going to church yet for fear of my head though it has been much better these last five or six days since i have taken lady kerrys bitter our frost holds like a dragon i went to mr addisons and dined with him at his lodgings i had not seen him these three weeks we are grown common acquaintance yet what have not i done for his friend steele mr harley reproached me the last time i saw him that to please me he would be reconciled to steele and had promised and appointed to see him and that steele never came harrison whom mr addison recommended to me i have introduced to the secretary of state who has promised me to take care of him and i have represented addison himself so to the ministry that they think and talk in his favour though they hated him beforewell he is now in my debt and theres an end and i never had the least obligation to him and theres another end this evening i had a message from mr harley desiring to know whether i was alive and that i would dine with him tomorrow they dine so late that since my head has been wrong i have avoided being with thempatrick has been out of favour these ten days i talk dry and cross to him and have called him friend three or four times but sirrahs get you gone  5 morning i am going this morning to see prior who dines with me at mr harleys so i cant stay fiddling and talking with dear little brats in a morning and tis still terribly coldi wish my cold hand was in the warmest place about you young women id give ten guineas upon that account with all my heart faith oh it starves my thigh so ill rise and bid you goodmorrow my ladies both goodmorrow come stand away let me rise patrick take away the candle is there a good firesoupadazyat night mr harley did not sit down till six and i stayed till eleven henceforth i will choose to visit him in the evenings and dine with him no more if i can help it it breaks all my measures and hurts my health my head is disorderly but not ill and i hope it will mend  6 here has been such a hurry with the queens birthday so much fine clothes and the court so crowded that i did not go there all the frost is gone it thawed on sunday and so continues yet ice is still on the canal i did not mean that of laracor but st jamess park and boys sliding on it mr ford pressed me to dine with him in his chamberdid not i tell you patrick has got a bird a linnet to carry over to dingley it was very tame at first and tis now the wildest i ever saw he keeps it in a closet where it makes a terrible litter but i say nothing i am as tame as a clout when must we answer our mds letter one of these oddcomeshortlies this is a week old you see and no farther yet mr harley desired i would dine with him again today but i refused him for i fell out with him yesterday9 and will not see him again till he makes me amends and so i go to bed  7 i was this morning early with mr lewis of the secretarys office and saw a letter mr harley had sent to him desiring to be reconciled but i was deaf to all entreaties and have desired lewis to go to him and let him know i expect further satisfaction if we let these great ministers pretend too much there will be no governing them he promises to make me easy if i will but come and see him but i wont and he shall do it by message or i will cast him off ill tell you the cause of our quarrel when i see you and refer it to yourselves in that he did something which he intended for a favour and i have taken it quite otherwise disliking both the thing and the manner and it has heartily vexed me and all i have said is truth though it looks like jest and i absolutely refused to submit to his intended favour and expect further satisfaction mr ford and i dined with mr lewis we have a monstrous deal of snow and it has cost me two shillings today in chair and coach and walked till i was dirty besides i know not what it is now to read or write after i am in bed the last thing i do up is to write something to our md and then get into bed and put out my candle and so go sleep as fast as ever i can but in the mornings i do write sometimes in bed as you know  8 morning i have desired apronia to be always careful especially about the legs pray do you see any such great wit in that sentence i must freely own that i do not but party carries everything nowadays and what a splutter have i heard about the wit of that saying repeated with admiration above a hundred times in half an hour pray read it over again this moment and consider it i think the word is advised and not desired i should not have remembered it if i had not heard it so often whyayyou must know i dreamed it just now and waked with it in my mouth are you bit or are you not sirrahs i met mr harley in the court of requests and he asked me how long i had learnt the trick of writing to myself he had seen your letter through the glass case at the coffeehouse and would swear it was my hand and mr ford who took and sent it me was of the same mind i remember others have formerly said so too i think i was little mds writingmaster10but come what is here to do writing to young women in a morning i have other fish to fry so goodmorrow my ladies all goodmorrow perhaps ill answer your letter tonight perhaps i wont thats as saucy little presto takes the humourat night i walked in the park today in spite of the weather as i do always when it does not actually rain do you know what it has gone and done we had a thaw for three days then a monstrous dirt and snow and now it freezes like a potlid upon our snow i dined with lady betty germaine the first time since i came for england and there did i sit like a booby till eight looking over her and another lady at piquet when i had other business enough to do it was the coldest day i felt this year  9 morning after i had been abed an hour last night i was forced to rise and call to the landlady and maid to have the fire removed in a chimney below stairs which made my bedchamber smoke though i had no fire in it i have been twice served so i never lay so miserable an hour in my life is it not plaguy vexatiousit has snowed all night and rains this morningcome wheres mds letter come mrs letter make your appearance here am i says she answer me to my faceo faith i am sorry you had my twelfth so soon i doubt you will stay longer for the rest im so fraid you have got my fourteenth while i am writing this and i would always have one letter from presto reading one travelling and one writing as for the box i now believe it lost it is directed for mr curry at his house in capel street etc i had a letter yesterday from dr raymond in chester who says he sent his man everywhere and cannot find it and god knows whether mr smyth will have better success sterne spoke to him and i writ to him with the bottle of palsywater that bottle i hope will not miscarry i long to hear you have it o faith you have too good an opinion of prestos care i am negligent enough of everything but md and i should not have trusted sternebut it shall not go so i will have one more tug for itas to what you say of goodman peasly and isaac11 i answer as i did before fie child you must not give yourself the way to believe any such thing and afterwards only for curiosity you may tell me how these things are approved and how you like them and whether they instruct you in the present course of affairs and whether they are printed in your town or only sent from hencesir andrew fountaine is recovered so take your sorrow again but dont keep it fling it to the dogs and does little md walk indeedim glad of it at heartyes we have done with the plague here it was very saucy in you to pretend to have it before your betters your intelligence that the story is false about the officers forced to sell12 is admirable you may see them all three here every day no more in the army than you twelve shillings for mending the strong box that is for putting a farthings worth of iron on a hinge and gilding it give him six shillings and ill pay it and never employ him or his againno indeed i put off preaching as much as i can i am upon another foot nobody doubts here whether i can preach and you are foolsthe account you give of that weekly paper13 agrees with us here mr prior was like to be insulted in the street for being supposed the author of it but one of the last papers cleared him nobody knows who it is but those few in the secret i suppose the ministry and the printerpoor stellas eyes god bless them and send them better pray spare them and write not above two lines a day in broad daylight how does stella look madam dingley pretty well a handsome young woman still will she pass in a crowd will she make a figure in a country churchstay a little fair ladies i this minute sent patrick to sterne he brings back word that your box is very safe with one mr earls sister in chester and that colonel edgworths widow14 goes for ireland on monday next and will receive the box at chester and deliver it you safe so there are some hopes nowwell let us go on to your letterthe warrant is passed for the firstfruits the queen does not send a letter but a patent will be drawn here and that will take up time mr harley of late has said nothing of presenting me to the queen i was overseen15 when i mentioned it to you he has such a weight of affairs on him that he cannot mind all but he talked of it three or four times to me long before i dropped it to you what is not mrs walls business over yet i had hopes she was up and well and the child dead before this timeyou did right at last to send me your accompts but i did not stay for them i thank you i hope you have your bill sent in my last and there will be eight pounds interest soon due from hawkshaw pray look at his bond i hope you are good managers and that when i say so stella wont think i intend she should grudge herself wine but going to those expensive lodgings requires some fund i wish you had stayed till i came over for some reasons that frenchwoman16 will be grumbling again in a little time and if you are invited anywhere to the country it will vex you to pay in absence and the country may be necessary for poor stellas health but do as you like and do not blame prestooh but you are telling your reasonswell i have read them do as you pleaseyes raymond says he must stay longer than he thought because he cannot settle his affairs m is in the country at some friends comes to town in spring and then goes to settle in herefordshire her husband is a surly illnatured brute and cares not she should see anybody o lord see how i blundered and left two lines short it was that ugly score in the paper17 that made me mistakei believe you lie about the story of the fire only to make it more odd bernage must go to spain and i will see to recommend him to the duke of argyle his general when i see the duke next but the officers tell me it would be dishonourable in the last degree for him to sell now and he would never be preferred in the army so that unless he designs to leave it for good and all he must go tell him so and that i would write if i knew where to direct to him which i have said fourscore times already i had rather anything almost than that you should strain yourselves to send a letter when it is inconvenient we have settled that matter already ill write when i can and so shall md and upon occasions extraordinary i will write though it be a line and when we have not letters soon we agree that all things are well and so thats settled for ever and so hold your tonguewell you shall have your pins but for candles ends i cannot promise because i burn them to the stumps besides i remember what stella told dingley about them many years ago and she may think the same thing of meand dingley shall have her hinged spectaclespoor dear stella how durst you write those two lines by candlelight bang your bones faith this letter shall go tomorrow i think and that will be in ten days from the last young women thats too soon of all conscience but answering yours has filled it up so quick and i do not design to use you to three pages in folio no nooooh all this is one mornings

youat night i dined today with my neighbour vanhomrigh it was such dismal weather i could not stir further i have had some threatenings with my head but no fits i still drink dr radcliffes19 bitter and will continue it  10 i was this morning to see the secretary of state and have engaged him to give a memorial from me to the duke of argyle in behalf of bernage the duke is a man that distinguishes people of merit and i will speak to him myself but the secretary backing it will be very effectual and i will take care to have it done to purpose pray tell bernage so and that i think nothing can be luckier for him and that i would have him go by all means i will order it that the duke shall send for him when they are in spain or if he fails that he shall receive him kindly when he goes to wait on him can i do more is not this a great deali now send away this letter that you may not stayi dined with ford upon his operaday and am now come home and am going to study do not you

send it tonight20  o silly silly loggerhead  i send a letter this post to one mr staunton and i direct it to mr actons in st michaels lane he formerly lodged there but he has not told me where to direct pray send to that acton whether21 the letter is come there and whether he has sent it to staunton  if bernage designs to sell his commission and stay at home pray let him tell me so that my recommendation to the duke of argyle may not be in vain     letter 16  london feb 10 171011  i have just despatched my fifteenth to the post i tell you how things will be after i have got a letter from md i am in furious haste to finish mine for fear of having two of mds to answer in one of prestos which would be such a disgrace never saw the like but before you write to me i write at my leisure like a gentleman a little every day just to let you know how matters go and so and so and i hope before this comes to you youll have got your box and chocolate and presto will take more care another time  11 morning i must rise and go see my lord keeper1 which will cost me two shillings in coachhire dont you call them two thirteens2at night it has rained all day and there was no walking i read prayers to sir andrew fountaine in the forenoon and i dined with three irishmen at one mr copes3 lodgings the other two were one morris an archdeacon4 and mr ford when i came home this evening i expected that little jackanapes harrison would have come to get help about his tatler for tuesday i have fixed two evenings in the week which i allow him to come the toad never came and i expecting him fell a reading and left off other businesscome what are you doing how do you pass your time this ugly weather gaming and drinking i suppose fine diversions for young ladies truly i wish you had some of our seville oranges and we some of your wine we have the finest oranges for twopence apiece and the basest wine for six shillings a bottle they tell me wine grows cheap with you i am resolved to have half a hogshead when i get to ireland if it be good and cheap as it used to be and i will treat md at my table in an evening oh hoa and laugh at great ministers of state  12 the days are grown fine and long  be thanked o faith you forget all our little sayings and i am angry i dined today with mr secretary st john i went to the court of requests at noon and sent mr harley into the house to call the secretary to let him know i would not dine with him if he dined late by good luck the duke of argyle was at the lobby of the house too and i kept him in talk till the secretary came out then told them i was glad to meet them together and that i had a request to the duke which the secretary must second and his grace must grant the duke said he was sure it was something insignificant and wished it was ten times greater at the secretarys house i writ a memorial and gave it to the secretary to give the duke and shall see that he does it it is that his grace will please to take mr bernage into his protection and if he finds bernage answers my character to give him all encouragement colonel masham5 and colonel hill6 mrs mashams7 brother tell me my request is reasonable and they will second it heartily to the duke too so i reckon bernage is on a very good foot when he goes to spain pray tell him this though perhaps i will write to him before he goes yet where shall i direct for i suppose he has left connollys8  13 i have left off lady kerrys bitter and got another box of pills i have no fits of giddiness but only some little disorders towards it and i walk as much as i can lady kerry is just as i am only a great deal worse i dined today at lord shelburnes where she is and we con ailments which makes us very fond of each other i have taken mr harley into favour again and called to see him but he was not within i will use to visit him after dinner for he dines too late for my head then i went to visit poor congreve who is just getting out of a severe fit of the gout and i sat with him till near nine oclock he gave me a tatler9 he had written out as blind as he is for little harrison it is about a scoundrel that was grown rich and went and bought a coat of arms at the heralds and a set of ancestors at fleet ditch tis well enough and shall be printed in two or three days and if you read those kind of things this will divert you it is now between ten and eleven and i am going to bed  14 this was mrs vanhomrighs daughters10 birthday and mr ford and i were invited to dinner to keep it and we spent the evening there drinking punch that was our way of beginning lent and in the morning lord shelburne lady kerry mrs pratt and i went to hyde park instead of going to church for till my head is a little settled i think it better not to go it would be so silly and troublesome to go out sick dr duke11 died suddenly two or three nights ago he was one of the wits when we were children but turned parson and left it and never writ farther than a prologue or recommendatory copy of verses he had a fine living given him by the bishop of winchester12 about three months ago he got his living suddenly and he got his dying so too  15 i walked purely today about the park the rain being just over of which we have had a great deal mixed with little short frosts i went to the court of requests thinking if mr harley dined early to go with him but meeting leigh and sterne they invited me to dine with them and away we went when we got into his room one h a worthless irish fellow was there ready to dine with us so i stepped out and whispered them that i would not dine with that fellow they made excuses and begged me to stay but away i went to mr harleys and he did not dine at home and at last i dined at sir john germaines13 and found lady betty but just recovered of a miscarriage i am writing an inscription for lord berkeleys14 tomb you know the young rake his son the new earl is married to the duke of richmonds daughter15 at the dukes country house and are now coming to town she will be fluxed in two months and theyll be parted in a year you ladies are brave bold venturesome folks and the chit is but seventeen and is illnatured covetous vicious and proud in extremes and so get you gone to stoyte tomorrow  16 faith this letter goes on but slow tis a week old and the first side not written i went today into the city for a walk but the person i designed to dine with was not at home so i came back and called at congreves and dined with him and estcourt16 and laughed till six then went to mr harleys who was not gone to dinner there i stayed till nine and we made up our quarrel and he has invited me to dinner tomorrow which is the day of the week saturday that lord keeper and secretary st john dine with him privately and at last they have consented to let me among them on that day atterbury and prior went to bury poor dr duke congreves nasty white wine has given me the heartburn  17 i took some good walks in the park today and then went to mr harley lord rivers was got there before me and i chid him for presuming to come on a day when only lord keeper and the secretary and i were to be there but he regarded me not so we all dined together and sat down at four and the secretary has invited me to dine with him tomorrow i told them i had no hopes they could ever keep in but that i saw they loved one another so well as indeed they seem to do they call me nothing but jonathan and i said i believed they would leave me jonathan as they found me and that i never knew a ministry do anything for those whom they make companions of their pleasures and i believe you will find it so but i care not i am upon a project of getting five hundred pounds17 without being obliged to anybody but that is a secret till i see my dearest md and so hold your tongue and do not talk sirrahs for i am now about it  18 my head has no fits but a little disordered before dinner yet i walk stoutly and take pills and hope to mend secretary st john would needs have me dine with him today and there i found three persons i never saw two i had no acquaintance with and one i did not care for so i left them early and came home it being no day to walk but scurvy rain and wind the secretary tells me he has put a cheat on me for lord peterborow sent him twelve dozen flasks of burgundy on condition that i should have my share but he never was quiet till they were all gone so i reckon he owes me thirtysix pounds lord peterborow is now got to vienna and i must write to him tomorrow i begin now to be towards looking for a letter from some certain ladies of prestos acquaintance that live at st marys18 and are called in a certain language our little md no stay i dont expect one these six days that will be just three weeks ant i a reasonable creature we are plagued here with an october club that is a set of above a hundred parliament men of the country who drink october beer at home and meet every evening at a tavern near the parliament to consult affairs and drive things on to extremes against the whigs to call the old ministry to account and get off five or six heads19 the ministry seem not to regard them yet one of them in confidence told me that there must be something thought on to settle things better ill tell you one great state secret the queen sensible how much she was governed by the late ministry runs a little into tother extreme and is jealous in that point even of those who got her out of the others hands the ministry is for gentler measures and the other tories for more violent lord rivers talking to me the other day cursed the paper called the examiner for speaking civilly of the duke of marlborough this i happened to talk of to the secretary who blamed the warmth of that lord and some others and swore that if their advice were followed they would be blown up in twentyfour hours and i have reason to think that they will endeavour to prevail on the queen to put her affairs more in the hands of a ministry than she does at present and there are i believe two men thought on one of them you have often met the name of in my letters but so much for politics  19 this proved a terrible rainy day which prevented my walk into the city and i was only able to run and dine with my neighbour vanhomrigh where sir andrew fountaine dined too who has just began to sally out and has shipped his mother and sister who were his nurses back to the country this evening was fair and i walked a little in the park till prior made me go with him to the smyrna coffeehouse where i sat a while and saw four or five irish persons who are very handsome genteel fellows but i know not their names i came away at seven and got home two days ago i writ to bernage and told him what i had done and directed the letter to mr currys to be left with dingley brigadiers hill and masham brother and husband to mrs masham the queens favourite colonel disney20 and i have recommended bernage to the duke of argyle and secretary st john has given the duke my memorial and besides hill tells me that bernages colonel fielding21 designs to make him his captainlieutenant but i believe i said this to you before and in this letter but i will not look  20 morning it snows terribly again and tis mistaken for i now want a little good weather i bid you goodmorrow and if it clear up get you gone to poor mrs walls who has had a hard time of it but is now pretty well again i am sorry it is a girl the poor archdeacon too see how simply he looked when they told him what did it cost stella to be gossip ill rise so dye hear let me see you at night and do not stay late out and catch cold sirrahsat night it grew good weather and i got a good walk and dined with ford upon his operaday but now all his wine is gone i shall dine with him no more i hope to send this letter before i hear from md methinks there issomething great in doing so only i cant express where it lies and faith this shall go by saturday as sure as youre a rogue mrs edgworth was to set out but last monday so you wont have your box so soon perhaps as this letter but sterne told me since that it is safe at chester and that she will take care of it id give a guinea you had it  21 morning faith i hope it will be fair for me to walk into the city for i take all occasions of walkingi should be plaguy busy at laracor if i were there now cutting down willows planting others scouring my canal and every kind of thing if raymond goes over this summer you must submit and make them a visit that we may have another eel and trout fishing and that stella may ride by and see presto in his morninggown in the garden and so go up with joe to the hill of bree and round by scurlocks town o lord how i remember names faith it gives me short sighs therefore no more of that if you love me goodmorrow i will go rise like a gentleman my pills say i mustat night lady kerry sent to desire me to engage some lords about an affair she has in their house here i called to see her but found she had already engaged every lord i knew and that there was no great difficulty in the matter and it rained like a dog so i took coach for want of better exercise and dined privately with a hangdog in the city and walked back in the evening the days are now long enough to walk in the park after dinner and so i do whenever it is fair this walking is a strange remedy mr prior walks to make himself fat and i to bring myself down he has generally a cough which he only calls a cold we often walk round the park together so ill go sleep  22 it snowed all this morning prodigiously and was some inches thick in three or four hours i dined with mr lewis of the secretarys office at his lodgings the chairmen that carried me squeezed a great fellow against a wall who wisely turned his back and broke one of the sideglasses in a thousand pieces i fell a scolding pretended i was like to be cut to pieces and made them set down the chair in the park while they picked out the bits of glasses and when i paid them i quarrelled still so they dared not grumble and i came off for my fare but i was plaguily afraid they would have said god bless your honour wont you give us something for our glass lewis and i were forming a project how i might get three or four hundred pounds22 which i suppose may come to nothing i hope smyth has brought you your palsydrops how does stella do i begin more and more to desire to know the three weeks since i had your last is over within two days and i will allow three for accidents  23 the snow is gone every bit except the remainder of some great balls made by the boys mr sterne was with me this morning about an affair he has before the treasury that drab mrs edgworth is not yet set out but will infallibly next monday and this is the third infallible monday and pox take her so you will have this letter first and this shall go tomorrow and if i have one from md in that time i will not answer it till my next only i will say madam i received your letter and so and so i dined today with my mistress butler23 who grows very disagreeable  24 morning this letter certainly goes this evening sure as youre alive young women and then you will be so shamed that i have had none from you and if i was to reckon like you i would say i were six letters before you for this is n16 and i have had your n10 but i reckon you have received but fourteen and have sent eleven i think to go today a ministerofstatehunting in the court of requests for i have something to say to mr harley and it is fine cold sunshiny weather i wish dear md would walk this morning in your stephens green tis as good as our park but not so large24 faith this summer well take a coach for sixpence25 to the green well the two walks and thence all the way to stoytes26 my hearty service to goody stoyte and catherine and i hope mrs walls had a good time how inconstant i am i cant imagine i was ever in love with her well im going what have you to say i do not care how i write now27 i dont design to write on this side these few lines are but so much more than your due so i will write large or small as i please o faith my hands are starving in bed i believe it is a hard frost i must rise and bid you goodbye for ill seal this letter immediately and carry it in my pocket and put it into the postoffice with my own fair hands farewell  this letter is just a fortnights journal today yes and so it is im sure says you with your two eggs a penny  lele lele lele28  o lord i am saying lele lele to myself in all our little keys and now you talk of keys that dog patrick broke the keygeneral of the chest of drawers with six locks and i have been so plagued to get a new one besides my good two shillings     letter 17  london feb 24 171011  now young women i gave in my sixteenth this evening i dined with ford it was his operaday as usual it is very convenient to me to do so for coming home early after a walk in the park which now the days will allow i called on the secretary at his office and he had forgot to give the memorial about bernage to the duke of argyle but two days ago i met the duke who desired i would give it him myself which should have more power with him than all the ministry together as he protested solemnly repeated it two or three times and bid me count upon it so that i verily believe bernage will be in a very good way to establish himself i think i can do no more for him at present and theres an end of that and so get you gone to bed for it is late  25 the three weeks are out yesterday since i had your last and so now i will be expecting every day a pretty dear letter from my own md and hope to hear that stella has been much better in her head and eyes my head continues as it was no fits but a little disorder every day which i can easily bear if it will not grow worse i dined today with mr secretary st john on condition i might choose my company which were lord rivers lord carteret sir thomas mansel1 and mr lewis i invited masham hill sir john stanley and george granville but they were engaged and i did it in revenge of his having such bad company when i dined with him before so we laughed etc and i ventured to go to church today which i have not done this month before can you send me such a good account of stellas health pray now yes i hope and better too we dined says you at the deans and played at cards till twelve and there came in mr french and dr travors and dr whittingham and mr i forget his name that i always tell mrs walls of the bankers son a pox on him and we were so merry i vow they are pure good company but i lost a crown for you must know i had always hands tempting me to go out but never took in anything and often two black aces without a manilio was not that hard presto hold your tongue etc  26 i was this morning with mr secretary about some business and he tells me that colonel fielding is now going to make bernage his captainlieutenant that is a captain by commission and the perquisites of the company but not captains pay only the first step to it i suppose he will like it and the recommendation to the duke of argyle goes on and so trouble me no more about your bernage the jackanapes understands what fair solicitors he has got i warrant you sir andrew fountaine and i dined by invitation with mrs vanhomrigh you say they are of no consequence why they keep as good female company as i do male i see all the drabs of quality at this end of the town with them i saw two lady bettys2 there this afternoon the beauty of one the goodbreeding and nature of tother and the wit of neither would have made a fine woman rare walking in the park now why dont you walk in the green of st stephen the walks there are finer gravelled than the mall what beasts the irish women are never to walk  27 darteneuf and i and little harrison the new tatler and jervas the painter dined today with james3 i know not his other name but it is one of darteneufs diningplaces who is a true epicure james is clerk of the kitchen to the queen and has a little snug house at st jamess and we had the queens wine and such very fine victuals that i could not eat it three weeks and three days since my last letter from md rare doings why truly we were so busy with poor mrs walls that indeed presto we could not write we were afraid the poor woman would have died and it pitied us to see the archdeacon how concerned he was the dean never came to see her but once but now she is up again and we go and sit with her in the evenings the child died the next day after it was born and i believe between friends she is not very sorry for itindeed presto you are plaguy silly tonight and hant guessed one word right for she and the child are both well and it is a fine girl likely to live and the dean was godfather and mrs catherine and i were godmothers i was going to say stoyte but i think i have heard they dont put maids and married women together though i know not why i think so nor i dont care what care i but i must prate etc  28 i walked today into the city for my health and there dined which i always do when the weather is fair and business permits that i may be under a necessity of taking a good walk which is the best thing i can do at present for my health some bookseller has raked up everything i writ and published it tother day in one volume but i know nothing of it twas without my knowledge or consent it makes a fourshilling book and is called miscellanies in prose and verse4 tooke pretends he knows nothing of it but i doubt he is at the bottom one must have patience with these things the best of it is i shall be plagued no more however i will bring a couple of them over with me for md perhaps you may desire to see them i hear they sell mightily  march 1 morning i have been calling to patrick to look in his almanac for the day of the month i did not know but it might be leapyear the almanac says tis the third after leapyear and i always thought till now that every third year was leapyear i am glad they come so seldom but im sure twas otherwise when i was a young man i see times are mightily changed since thenwrite to me sirrahs be sure do by the time this side is done and ill keep tother side for the answer so ill go write to the bishop of clogher goodmorrow sirrahsnight i dined today at mrs vanhomrighs being a rainy day and lady betty butler knowing it sent to let me know she expected my company in the evening where the vans so we call them were to be the duchess5 and they do not go over this summer with the duke so i go to bed  2 this rainy weather undoes me in coaches and chairs i was traipsing today with your mr sterne to go along with them to moore6 and recommend his business to the treasury sterne tells me his dependence is wholly on me but i have absolutely refused to recommend it to mr harley because i have troubled him lately so much with other folks affairs and besides to tell the truth mr harley told me he did not like sternes business however i will serve him because i suppose md would have me but in saying his dependence lies wholly on me he lies and is a fool i dined with lord abercorn whose son peasley7 will be married at easter to ten thousand pounds  3 i forgot to tell you that yesterday morning i was at mr harleys levee he swore i came in spite to see him among a parcel of fools my business was to desire i might let the duke of ormond know how the affair stood of the firstfruits he promised to let him know it and engaged me to dine with him today every saturday lord keeper secretary st john and i dine with him and sometimes lord rivers and they let in none else patrick brought me some letters into the park among which one was from walls and tother yes faith tother was from our little md n11 i read the rest in the park and mds in a chair as i went from st jamess to mr harley and glad enough i was faith to read it and see all right oh but i wont answer it these three or four days at least or may be sooner ant i silly faith your letters would make a dog silly if i had a dog to be silly but it must be a little dogi stayed with mr harley till past nine where we had much discourse together after the rest were gone and i gave him very truly my opinion where he desired it he complained he was not very well and has engaged me to dine with him again on monday so i came home afoot like a fine gentleman to tell you all this  4 i dined today with mr secretary st john and after dinner he had a note from mr harley that he was much out of order8 pray god preserve his health everything depends upon it the parliament at present cannot go a step without him nor the queen neither i long to be in ireland but the ministry beg me to stay however when this parliament lurry9 is over i will endeavour to steal away by which time i hope the firstfruit business will be done this kingdom is certainly ruined as much as was ever any bankrupt merchant we must have peace let it be a bad or a good one though nobody dares talk of it the nearer i look upon things the worse i like them i believe the confederacy will soon break to pieces and our factions at home increase the ministry is upon a very narrow bottom and stand like an isthmus between the whigs on one side and violent tories on the other they are able seamen but the tempest is too great the ship too rotten and the crew all against them lord somers has been twice in the queens closet once very lately and your duchess of somerset10 who now has the key is a most insinuating woman and i believe they will endeavour to play the same game that has been played against themi have told them of all this which they know already but they cannot help it they have cautioned the queen so much against being governed that she observes it too much i could talk till tomorrow upon these things but they make me melancholy i could not but observe that lately after much conversation with mr harley though he is the most fearless man alive and the least apt to despond he confessed to me that uttering his mind to me gave him ease  5 mr harley continues out of order yet his affairs force him abroad he is subject to a sore throat and was cupped last night i sent and called two or three times i hear he is better this evening i dined today in the city with dr freind at a third bodys house where i was to pass for somebody else and there was a plaguy silly jest carried on that made me sick of it our weather grows fine and i will walk like camomile and pray walk you to your deans or your stoytes or your manleys or your walls but your new lodgings make you so proud you will walk less than ever come let me go to bed sirrahs  6 mr harleys going out yesterday has put him a little backwards i called twice and sent for i am in pain for him ford caught me and made me dine with him on his operaday so i brought mr lewis with me and sat with him till six i have not seen mr addison these three weeks all our friendship is over i go to no coffeehouse i presented a parson of the bishop of cloghers one richardson11 to the duke of ormond today he is translating prayers and sermons into irish and has a project about instructing the irish in the protestant religion  7 morning faith a little would make me i could find in my heart if it were not for one thing i have a good mind if i had not something else to do i would answer your dear saucy letter o lord i am going awry with writing in bed o faith but i must answer it or i shant have room for it must go on saturday and dont think i will fill the third side i ant come to that yet young women well then as for your bernage i have said enough i writ to him last weekturn over that leaf now what says md to the world to come i tell you madam stella my head is a great deal better and i hope will keep so how came yours to be fifteen days coming and you had my fifteenth in seven answer me that rogues your being with goody walls is excuse enough i find i was mistaken in the sex tis a boy12 yes i understand your cypher and stella guesses right as she always does he13 gave me al bsadnuk lboinlpl dfaonr ufainf btoy dpionufnad14 which i sent him again by mr lewis to whom i writ a very complaining letter that was showed him and so the matter ended he told me he had a quarrel with me i said i had another with him and we returned to our friendship and i should think he loves me as well as a great minister can love a man in so short a time did not i do right i am glad at heart you have got your palsywater15 pray god almighty it may do my dearest little stella good i suppose mrs edgworth set out last monday seennight yes i do read the examiners and they are written very finely as you judge i do not think they are too severe on the duke16 they only tax him of avarice and his avarice has ruined us you may count upon all things in them to be true the author has said it is not prior but perhaps it may be atterburynow madam dingley says she tis fine weather says she yes says she and we have got to our new lodgings i compute you ought to save eight pounds by being in the others five months and you have no more done it than eight thousand i am glad you are rid of that squinting blinking frenchman i will give you a bill on parvisol for five pounds for the halfyear and must i go on at four shillings a week and neither eat nor drink for it who the devil said atterbury and your dean were alike i never saw your chancellor nor his chaplain the latter has a good deal of learning and is a wellwisher to be an author your chancellor is an excellent man as for patricks bird he bought him for his tameness and is grown the wildest i ever saw his wings have been quilled thrice and are now up again he will be able to fly after us to ireland if he be willingyes mrs stella dingley writes more like presto than you for all you superscribed the letter as who should say why should not i write like our presto as well as dingley you with your awkward ss17 cannot you write them thus ss no but always sss spiteful sluts to affront prestos writing as that when you shut your eyes you write most like presto i know the time when i did not write to you half so plain as i do now but i take pity on you both i am very much concerned for mrs wallss eyes walls says nothing of it to me in his letter dated after yours you say if she recovers she may lose her sight i hope she is in no danger of her life yes ford is as sober as i please i use him to walk with me as an easy companion always ready for what i please when i am weary of business and ministers i dont go to a coffeehouse twice a month i am very regular in going to sleep before elevenand so you say that stella is a pretty girl and so she be and methinks i see her just now as handsome as the day is long do you know what when i am writing in our language i make up my mouth just as if i was speaking it i caught myself at it just now and i suppose dingley is so fair and so fresh as a lass in may and has her health and no spleenin your account you sent do you reckon as usual from the 1st of november18 was twelvemonth poor stella will not dingley leave her a little daylight to write to presto well well well have daylight shortly spite of her teeth and zoo19 must cly lele and hele and hele aden must loo mimitate pdfr pay iss and so la shall and so leles fol ee rettle doodmollowat night mrs barton sent this morning to invite me to dinner and there i dined just in that genteel manner that md used when they would treat some better sort of body than usual  8 o dear md my heart is almost broken you will hear the thing before this comes to you i writ a full account of it this night to the archbishop of dublin and the dean may tell you the particulars from the archbishop i was in a sorry way to write but thought it might be proper to send a true account of the fact for you will hear a thousand lying circumstances it is of mr harleys being stabbed this afternoon at three oclock at a committee of the council i was playing lady catharine morriss20 cards where i dined when young arundel21 came in with the story i ran away immediately to the secretary which was in my way no one was at home i met mrs st john in her chair she had heard it imperfectly i took a chair to mr harley who was asleep and they hope in no danger but he has been out of order and was so when he came abroad today and it may put him in a fever i am in mortal pain for him that desperate french villain marquis de guiscard22 stabbed mr harley guiscard was taken up by mr secretary st johns warrant for high treason and brought before the lords to be examined there he stabbed mr harley i have told all the particulars already to the archbishop i have now at nine sent again and they tell me he is in a fair way pray pardon my distraction i now think of all his kindness to methe poor creature now lies stabbed in his bed by a desperate french popish villain goodnight and god preserve you both and pity me i want it  9 morning seven in bed patrick is just come from mr harleys he slept well till four the surgeon sat23 up with him he is asleep again he felt a pain in his wound when he waked they apprehend him in no danger this account the surgeon left with the porter to tell people that send pray god preserve him i am rising and going to mr secretary st john they say guiscard will die with the wounds mr st john and the rest gave him i shall tell you more at nightnight mr harley still continues on the mending hand but he rested ill last night and felt pain i was early with the secretary this morning and i dined with him and he told me several particularities of this accident too long to relate now mr harley is still mending this evening but not at all out of danger and till then i can have no peace goodnight etc and pity presto  10 mr harley was restless last night but he has no fever and the hopes of his mending increase i had a letter from mr walls and one from mr bernage i will answer them here not having time to write mr walls writes about three things first about a hundred pounds from dr raymond of which i hear nothing and it is now too late secondly about mr clements24 i can do nothing in it because i am not to mention mr pratt and i cannot recommend without knowing mr pratts objections whose relation clements is and who brought him into the place the third is about my being godfather to the child25 that is in my power and since there is no remedy will submit i wish you could hinder it but if it cant be helped pay what you think proper and get the provost to stand for me and let his christian name be harley in honour of my friend now lying stabbed and doubtful of his life as for bernage he writes me word that his colonel has offered to make him captainlieutenant for a hundred pounds he was such a fool to offer him money without writing to me till it was done though i have had a dozen letters from him and then he desires i would say nothing of this for fear his colonel should be angry people are mad what can i do i engaged colonel disney who was one of his solicitors to the secretary and then told him the story he assured me that fielding bernages colonel said he might have got that sum but on account of those great recommendations he had would give it him for nothing and i would have bernage write him a letter of thanks as of a thing given him for nothing upon recommendations etc disney tells me he will again speak to fielding and clear up this matter then i will write to bernage a pox on him for promising money till i had it promised to me and then making it such a ticklish point that one cannot expostulate with the colonel upon it but let him do as i say and there is an end i engaged the secretary of state in it and am sure it was meant a kindness to me and that no money should be given and a hundred pounds is too much in a smithfield bargain26 as a majorgeneral told me whose opinion i asked i am now hurried and can say no more farewell etc etc  how shall i superscribe to your new lodgings pray madams tell me but that impudence and saucyface  are not you sauceboxes to write lele27 like presto o poor presto  mr harley is better tonight that makes me so pert you saucy gog and magog     letter 18  london march 10 171011  pretty little md must expect little from me till mr harley is out of danger we hope he is so now but i am subject to fear for my friends he has a head full of the whole business of the nation was out of order when the villain stabbed him and had a cruel contusion by the second blow but all goes on well yet mr ford and i dined with mr lewis and we hope the best  11 this morning mr secretary and i met at court where he went to the queen who is out of order and aguish i doubt the worse for this accident to mr harley we went together to his house and his wound looks well and he is not feverish at all and i think it is foolish in me to be so much in pain as i am i had the penknife in my hand which is broken within a quarter of an inch of the handle i have a mind to write and publish an account of all the particularities of this fact1 it will be very curious and i would do it when mr harley is past danger  12 we have been in terrible pain today about mr harley who never slept last night and has been very feverish but this evening i called there and young mr harley his only son tells me he is now much better and was then asleep they let nobody see him and that is perfectly right the parliament cannot go on till he is well and are forced to adjourn their money businesses which none but he can help them in pray god preserve him  13 mr harley is better today slept well all night and we are a little out of our fears i send and call three or four times every day i went into the city for a walk and dined there with a private man and coming home this evening broke my shin in the strand over a tub of sand left just in the way i got home dirty enough and went straight to bed where i have been cooking it with goldbeaters skin and have been peevish enough with patrick who was near an hour bringing a rag from next door it is my right shin where never any humour fell when tother used to swell so i apprehend it less however i shall not stir till tis well which i reckon will be in a week i am very careful in these sort of things but i wish i had mrs js water2 she is out of town and i must make a shift with alum i will dine with mrs vanhomrigh till i am well who lives but five doors off and that i may venture  14 my journals are like to be very diverting now i cannot stir abroad between accounts of mr harleys mending and of my broken shin i just walked to my neighbour vanhomrigh at two and came away at six when little harrison the tatler came to me and begged me to dictate a paper to him which i was forced in charity to do mr harley still mends and i hope in a day or two to trouble you no more with him nor with my shin go to bed and sleep sirrahs that you may rise tomorrow and walk to donnybrook and lose your money with stoyte and the dean do so dear little rogues and drink prestos health o pray dont you drink prestos health sometimes with your deans and your stoytes and your walls and your manleys and your everybodies pray now i drink mds to myself a hundred thousand times  15 i was this morning at mr secretary st johns for all my shin and he has given me for young harrison the tatler the prettiest employment in europe secretary to my lord raby3 who is to be ambassador extraordinary at the hague where all the great affairs will be concerted so we shall lose the tatlers in a fortnight i will send harrison tomorrow morning to thank the secretary poor biddy floyd4 has got the smallpox i called this morning to see lady betty germaine and when she told me so i fairly took my leave i have the luck of it5 for about ten days ago i was to see lord carteret6 and my lady was entertaining me with telling of a young lady a cousin who was then ill in the house of the smallpox and is since dead it was near lady bettys and i fancy biddy took the fright by it i dined with mr secretary and a physician came in just from guiscard who tells us he is dying of his wounds and can hardly live till tomorrow a poor wench that guiscard kept sent him a bottle of sack but the keeper would not let him touch it for fear it was poison he had two quarts of old clotted blood come out of his side today and is delirious i am sorry he is dying for they had found out a way to hang him he certainly had an intention to murder the queen  16 i have made but little progress in this letter for so many days thanks to guiscard and mr harley and it would be endless to tell you all the particulars of that odious fact i do not yet hear that guiscard is dead but they say tis impossible he should recover i walked too much yesterday for a man with a broken shin today i rested and went no farther than mrs vanhomrighs where i dined and lady betty butler coming in about six i was forced in good manners to sit with her till nine then i came home and mr ford came in to visit my shin and sat with me till eleven so i have been very idle and naughty it vexes me to the pluck7 that i should lose walking this delicious day have you seen the spectator8 yet a paper that comes out every day tis written by mr steele who seems to have gathered new life and have a new fund of wit it is in the same nature as his tatlers and they have all of them had something pretty i believe addison and he club i never see them and i plainly told mr harley and mr st john ten days ago before my lord keeper and lord rivers that i had been foolish enough to spend my credit with them in favour of addison and steele but that i would engage and promise never to say one word in their behalf having been used so ill for what i had already doneso now i am got into the way of prating again there will be no quiet for me       when presto begins to prate      give him a rap upon the pate  o lord how i blot it is time to leave off etc  17 guiscard died this morning at two and the coroners inquest have found that he was killed by bruises received from a messenger so to clear the cabinet councillors from whom he received his wounds i had a letter from raymond who cannot hear of your box but i hope you have it before this comes to your hands i dined today with mr lewis of the secretarys office mr harley has abundance of extravasated blood comes from his breast out of his wound and will not be well so soon as we expected i had something to say but cannot call it to mind what was it  18 i was today at court to look for the duke of argyle and gave him the memorial about bernage the duke goes with the first fair wind i could not find him but i have given the memorial to another to give him and however it shall be sent after him bernage has made a blunder in offering money to his colonel without my advice however he is made captainlieutenant only he must recruit the company which will cost him forty pounds and that is cheaper than an hundred i dined today with mr secretary st john and stayed till seven but would not drink his champagne and burgundy for fear of the gout my shin mends but is not well i hope it will by the time i send this letter next saturday  19 i went today into the city but in a coach and sossed9 up my leg on the seat and as i came home i went to see poor charles barnards10 books which are to be sold by auction and i itch to lay out nine or ten pounds for some fine editions of fine authors but tis too far and i shall let it slip as i usually do all such opportunities i dined in a coffeehouse with stratford upon chops and some of his wine where did md dine why poor md dined at home today because of the archbishop and they could not go abroad and had a breast of mutton and a pint of wine i hope mrs walls mends and pray give me an account what sort of godfather i made and whether i behaved myself handsomely the duke of argyle is gone and whether he has my memorial i know not till i see dr arbuthnot11 to whom i gave it that hard name belongs to a scotch doctor an acquaintance of the dukes and me stella cant pronounce it oh that we were at laracor this fine day the willows begin to peep and the quicks to bud my dream is out i was adreamed last night that i ate ripe cherriesand now they begin to catch the pikes and will shortly the trouts pox on these ministersand i would fain know whether the floods were ever so high as to get over the holly bank or the river walk if so then all my pikes are gone but i hope not why dont you ask parvisol these things sirrahs and then my canal and trouts and whether the bottom be fine and clear but harkee ought not parvisol to pay in my last years rents and arrears out of his hands i am thinking if either of you have heads to take his accounts it should be paid in to you otherwise to mr walls i will write an order on tother side and do as you will heres a world of business but i must go sleep im drowsy and so goodnight etc  20 this sore shin ruins me in coachhire no less than two shillings today going and coming from the city where i dined with one you never heard of and passed an insipid day i writ this post to bernage with the account i told you above i hope he will like it tis his own fault or it would have been better i reckon your next letter will be full of mr harleys stabbing he still mends but abundance of extravasated blood has come out of the wound he keeps his bed and sees nobody the speakers eldest son12 is just dead of the smallpox and the house is adjourned a week to give him time to wipe off his tears i think it very handsomely done but i believe one reason is that they want mr harley so much biddy floyd is like to do well and so go to your deans and roast his oranges and lose your money do so you saucy sluts stella you lost three shillings and fourpence tother night at stoytes yes you did and presto stood in a corner and saw you all the while and then stole away i dream very often i am in ireland and that i have left my clothes and things behind me and have not taken leave of anybody and that the ministry expect me tomorrow and such nonsense  21 i would not for a guinea have a letter from you till this goes and go it shall on saturday faith i dined with mrs vanhomrigh to save my shin and then went on some business to the secretary and he was not at home  22 yesterday was a short days journal but what care i what cares saucy presto darteneuf13 invited me to dinner today do not you know darteneuf thats the man that knows everything and that everybody knows and that knows where a knot of rabble are going on a holiday and when they were there last and then i went to the coffeehouse my shin mends but is not quite healed i ought to keep it up but i dont i een let it go as it comes pox take parvisol and his watch if i do not receive the tenpound bill i am to get towards it i will neither receive watch nor chain so let parvisol know  23 i this day appointed the duke of ormond to meet him at ned southwells about an affair of printing irish prayerbooks etc14 but the duke never came there southwell had letters that two packets are taken so if md writ then the letters are gone for they are packets coming hither mr harley is not yet well but his extravasated blood continues and i doubt he will not be quite well in a good while i find you have heard of the fact by southwells letters from ireland what do you think of it i dined with sir john perceval15 and saw his lady sitting in the bed in the forms of a lyingin woman and coming home my sore shin itched and i forgot what it was and rubbed off the scab and blood came but i am now got into bed and have put on alum curd and it is almost well lord rivers told me yesterday a piece of bad news as a secret that the pretender is going to be married to the duke of savoys daughter16 tis very bad if it be true we were walking in the mall with some scotch lords and he could not tell it until they were gone and he bade me tell it to none but the secretary of state and md this goes tomorrow and i have no room but to bid my dearest little md goodnight 24 i will now seal up this letter and send it for i reckon to have none from you tis morning now between this and night and i will put it in the post with my own hands i am going out in great haste so farewell etc     letter 19  london march 24 171011  it was a little cross in presto not to send today to the coffeehouse to see whether there was a letter from md before i sent away mine but faith i did it on purpose because i would scorn to answer two letters of yours successively this way of journal is the worst in the world for writing of news unless one does it the last day and so i will observe henceforward if there be any politics or stuff worth sending my shin mends in spite of the scratching last night i dined today at ned southwells with the bishop of ossory1 and a parcel of irish gentlemen have you yet seen any of the spectators just three weeks today since i had your last n11 i am afraid i have lost one by the packet that was taken that will vex me considering the pains md take to write especially poor pretty stella and her weak eyes god bless them and the owner and send them well and little me together i hope ere long this illness of mr harley puts everything backwards and he is still down and like to be so by that extravasated blood which comes from his breast to the wound it was by the second blow guiscard gave him after the penknife was broken i am shocked at that villainy whenever i think of it biddy floyd is past danger but will lose all her beauty she had them mighty thick especially about her nose  25 morning i wish you a merry new year this is the first day of the year you know with us and tis ladyday i must rise and go to my lord keeper it is not shavingday today so i shall be early i am to dine with mr secretary st john goodmorrow my mistresses both goodmorrow stella will be peeping out of her room at mrs de caudres2 down upon the folks as they come from church and there comes mrs proby3 and that is my lady southwell4 and there is lady betty rochfort5 i long to hear how you are settled in your new lodgings i wish i were rid of my old ones and that mrs brent could contrive to put up my books in boxes and lodge them in some safe place and you keep my papers of importance but i must rise i tell youat night so i visited and dined as i told you and what of that we have let guiscard be buried at last after showing him pickled in a trough this fortnight for twopence apiece and the fellow that showed would point to his body and see gentlemen this is the wound that was given him by his grace the duke of ormond and this is the wound etc and then the show was over and another set of rabble came in tis hard our laws would not suffer us to hang his body in chains because he was not tried and in the eye of our law every man is innocent till thenmr harley is still very weak and never out of bed  26 this was a most delicious day and my shin being past danger i walked like lightning above two hours in the park we have generally one fair day and then a great deal of rain for three or four days together all things are at a stop in parliament for want of mr harley they cannot stir an inch without him in their most material affairs and we fear by the caprice of radcliffe who will admit none but his own surgeon6 he has not been well looked after i dined at an alehouse with mr lewis but had his wine dont you begin to see the flowers and blossoms of the field how busy should i be now at laracor no news of your box i hope you have it and are this minute drinking the chocolate and that the smell of the brazil tobacco has not affected it i would be glad to know whether you like it because i would send you more by people that are now every day thinking of going to ireland therefore pray tell me and tell me soon and i will have the strong box  27 a rainy wretched scurvy day from morning till night and my neighbour vanhomrigh invited me to dine with them and this evening i passed at mr priors with dr freind and tis now past twelve so i must go sleep  28 morning o faith youre an impudent saucy couple of sluttikins for presuming to write so soon said i to myself this morning who knows but there may be a letter from md at the coffeehouse well you must know and so i just now sent patrick and he brought me three letters but not one from md no indeed for i read all the superscriptions and not one from md one i opened it was from the archbishop7 tother i opened it was from staunton8 the third i took and looked at the hand whose hand is this says i yes says i whose hand is this then there was wax between the folds then i began to suspect then i peeped faith it was wallss hand after all then i opened it in a rage and then it was little mds hand dear little pretty charming mds sweet hand again o lord ant here a clutter and a stir and a bustle never saw the like faith i believe yours lay some days at the postoffice and that it came before my eighteenth went but that i did not expect it and i hardly ever go there well and so you think ill answer this letter now no faith and so i wont ill make you wait young women but ill inquire immediately about poor dingleys exchequer trangum9 what is that vedel again a soldier was he broke ill put it in ben tookes hand i hope vedel could not sell itat night vedel vedel poh pox i think it is vedeau10 ay vedeau now i have it let me see do you name him in yours yes mr john vedeau is the brother but where does this brother live ill inquire this was a fastday for the public so i dined late with sir matthew dudley whom i have not been with a great while he is one of those that must lose his employment whenever the great shake comes and i cant contribute to keep him in though i have dropped words in his favour to the ministry but he is too violent a whig and friend to the lord treasurer11 to stay in tis odd to think how long they let those people keep their places but the reason is they have not enough to satisfy all expecters and so they keep them all in hopes that they may be good boys in the meantime and thus the old ones hold in still the comptroller12 told me that there are eight people expect his staff i walked after dinner today round the park what do i write politics to little young women hold your tongue and go to your deans  29 morning if this be a fine day i will walk into the city and see charles barnards library what care i for your letter saucy n12 i will say nothing to it yet faith i believe this will be full before its time and then go it must i will always write once a fortnight and if it goes sooner by filling sooner why then there is so much clear gain morrow morrow rogues and lasses both i cant lie scribbling here in bed for your play i must rise and so morrow againat night your friend montgomery and his sister are here as i am told by patrick i have seen him often but take no notice of him he is grown very ugly and pimpled they tell me he is a gamester and wins moneyhow could i help it pray patrick snuffed the candle too short and the grease ran down upon the paper13 it ant my fault tis patricks fault pray now dont blame presto i walked today in the city and dined at a private house and went to see the auction of poor charles barnards books they were in the middle of the physic books so i bought none and they are so dear i believe i shall buy none and there is an end and go to stoytes and ill go sleep  30 morning this is good friday you must know and i must rise and go to mr secretary about some business and mrs vanhomrigh desires me to breakfast with her because she is to intercede for patrick who is so often drunk and quarrelsome in the house that i was resolved to send him over but he knows all the places where i send and is so used to my ways that it would be inconvenient to me but when i come to ireland i will discharge him14 sir thomas mansel15 one of the lords of the treasury setting me down at my door today saw patrick and swore he was a teaguelander16 i am so used to his face i never observed it but thought him a pretty fellow sir andrew fountaine and i supped this fastday with mrs vanhomrigh we were afraid mr harleys wound would turn to a fistula but we think the danger is now past he rises every day and walks about his room and we hope he will be out in a fortnight prior showed me a handsome paper of verses he has writ on mr harleys accident17 they are not out i will send them to you if he will give me a copy  31 morning what shall we do to make april fools this year now it happens on sunday patrick brings word that mr harley still mends and is up every day i design to see him in a few days and he brings me word too that he has found out vedeaus brothers shop i shall call there in a day or two it seems the wife lodges next door to the brother i doubt the scoundrel was broke and got a commission or perhaps is a volunteer gentleman and expects to get one by his valour morrow sirrahs let me riseat night i dined today with sir thomas mansel we were walking in the park and mr lewis came to us mansel asked where we dined we said together he said we should dine with him only his wife18 desired him to bring nobody because she had only a leg of mutton i said i would dine with him to choose but he would send a servant to order a plate or two yet this man has ten thousand pounds a year in land and is a lord of the treasury and is not covetous neither but runs out merely by slattering19 and negligence the worst dinner i ever saw at the deans was better but so it is with abundance of people here i called at night at mr harleys who begins to walk in his room with a stick but is mighty weaksee how much i have lost with that ugly grease20 tis your fault pray and ill go to bed  april 1 the duke of buckinghams house fell down last night with an earthquake and is half swallowed up wont you go and see itan april fool an april fool oh ho young women well dont be angry i will make you an april fool no more till the next time we had no sport here because it is sunday and easter sunday i dined with the secretary who seemed terribly down and melancholy which mr prior and lewis observed as well as i perhaps something is gone wrong perhaps there is nothing in it god bless my own dearest md and all is well  2 we have such windy weather tis troublesome walking yet all the rabble have got into our park these easter holidays i am plagued with one richardson an irish parson and his project of printing irish bibles etc to make you christians in that country i befriend him what i can on account of the archbishop and bishop of clogherbut what business have i to meddle etc do not you remember that sirrah stella what was that about when you thought i was meddling with something that was not my business o faith you are an impudent slut i remember your doings ill never forget you as long as i live lewis and i dined together at his lodgings but wheres the answer to this letter of mds o faith presto you must think of that time enough says saucy presto  3 i was this morning to see mrs barton i love her better than anybody here and see her seldomer why really now so it often happens in the world that where one loves a body bestpshah pshah you are so silly with your moral observations well but she told me a very good story an old gentlewoman died here two months ago and left in her will to have eight men and eight maids bearers who should have two guineas apiece ten guineas to the parson for a sermon and two guineas to the clerk but bearers parson and clerk must be all true virgins and not to be admitted till they took their oaths of virginity so the poor woman still lies unburied and so must do till the general resurrectioni called at mr secretarys to see what the d ailed him on sunday i made him a very proper speech told him i observed he was much out of temper that i did not expect he would tell me the cause but would be glad to see he was in better and one thing i warned him of never to appear cold to me for i would not be treated like a schoolboy that i had felt too much of that in my life already meaning from sir william temple that i expected every great minister who honoured me with his acquaintance if he heard or saw anything to my disadvantage would let me know it in plain words and not put me in pain to guess by the change or coldness of his countenance or behaviour for it was what i would hardly bear from a crowned head and i thought no subjects favour was worth it and that i designed to let my lord keeper21 and mr harley know the same thing that they might use me accordingly he took all right said i had reason vowed nothing ailed him but sitting up whole nights at business and one night at drinking would have had me dine with him and mrs mashams brother to make up matters but i would not i dont know but i would not but indeed i was engaged with my old friend rollinson22 you never heard of him before  4 i sometimes look a line or two back and see plaguy mistakes of the pen how do you get over them you are puzzled sometimes why i think what i said to mr secretary was right dont you remember how i used to be in pain when sir william temple would look cold and out of humour for three or four days and i used to suspect a hundred reasons i have plucked up my spirit since then faith he spoilt a fine gentleman i dined with my neighbour vanhomrigh and md poor md at home on a loin of mutton and half a pint of wine and the mutton was raw poor stella could not eat poor dear rogue and dingley was so vexed but we will dine at stoytes tomorrow mr harley promised to see me in a day or two so i called this evening but his son and others were abroad and he asleep so i came away and found out mrs vedeau she drew out a letter from dingley and said she would get a friend to receive the money i told her i would employ mr tooke in it henceforward her husband bought a lieutenancy of foot and is gone to portugal he sold his share of the shop to his brother and put out the money to maintain her all but what bought the commission she lodges within two doors of her brother she told me it made her very melancholy to change her manner of life thus but trade was dead etc she says she will write to you soon i design to engage ben tooke and then receive the parchment from heri gave mr dopping a copy of priors verses on mr harley he sent them yesterday to ireland so go look for them for i wont be at the trouble to transcribe them here they will be printed in a day or two give my hearty service to stoyte and catherine upon my word i love them dearly and desire you will tell them so pray desire goody stoyte not to let mrs walls and mrs johnson cheat her of her money at ombre but assure her from me that she is a bungler dine with her today and tell her so and drink my health and good voyage and speedy return and so youre a rogue  5 morning now let us proceed to examine a saucy letter from one madam mdgod almighty bless poor dear stella and send her a great many birthdays all happy and healthy and wealthy and with me ever together and never asunder again unless by chance when i find you are happy or merry there it makes me so here and i can hardly imagine you absent when i am reading your letter or writing to you no faith you are just here upon this little paper and therefore i see and talk with you every evening constantly and sometimes in the morning but not always in the morning because that is not so modest to young ladieswhat you would fain palm a letter on me more than you sent and i like a fool must look over all yours to see whether this was really n12 or more patrick has this moment brought me letters from the bishop of clogher and parvisol my heart was at my mouth for fear of one from md what a disgrace would it be to have two of yours to answer together but faith this shall go tonight for fear and then come when it will i defy it no you are not naughty at all write when you are disposed and so the dean told you the story of mr harley from the archbishop i warrant it never spoiled your supper or broke off your game nor yet have not you the box i wish mrs edgworth had the  but you have it now i suppose and is the chocolate good or has the tobacco spoilt it leigh stays till sterne has done his business no longer and when that will be god knows i befriend him as much as i can but harleys accident stops that as well as all things else you guess madam dingley that i shall stay a round twelvemonth as hope saved i would come over if i could this minute but we will talk of that by and by your affair of vedeau i have told you of already now to the next turn over the leaf mrs dobbins lies i have no more provision here or in ireland than i had i am pleased that stella the conjurer approves what i did with mr harley23 but your generosity makes me mad i know you repine inwardly at prestos absence you think he has broken his word of coming in three months and that this is always his trick and now stella says she does not see possibly how i can come away in haste and that md is satisfied etc ant you a rogue to overpower me thus i did not expect to find such friends as i have done they may indeed deceive me too but there are important reasons pox on this grease this candle tallow why they should not24 i have been used barbarously by the late ministry i am a little piqued in honour to let people see i am not to be despised the assurances they give me without any scruple or provocation are such as are usually believed in the world they may come to nothing but the first opportunity that offers and is neglected i shall depend no more but come away i could say a thousand things on this head if i were with you i am thinking why stella should not go to the bath if she be told it will do her good i will make parvisol get up fifty pounds and pay it you and you may be good housewives and live cheap there some months and return in autumn or visit london as you please pray think of it i writ to bernage directed to currys i wish he had the letter i will send the bohea tea if i can the bishop of kilmore25 i dont keep such company an old dying fool whom i never was with in my life so i am no godfather26 all the better pray stella explain those two words of yours to me what you mean by villian and dainger27 and you madam dingley what is christianinglay your letter this way this way and the devil a bit of difference between this way and the other way no i will show you lay them this way this way and not that way that way28you shall have your aprons and i will put all your commissions as they come in a paper together and do not think i will forget mds orders because they are friends i will be as careful as if they were strangers i knew not what to do about this clements29 walls will not let me say anything as if mr pratt was against him and now the bishop of clogher has written to me in his behalf this thing does not rightly fall in my way and that people never consider i always give my good offices where they are proper and that i am judge of however i will do what i can but if he has the name of a whig it will be hard considering my lord anglesea and hyde30 are very much otherwise and you know they have the employment of deputy treasurer if the frolic should take you of going to the bath i here send you a note on parvisol if not you may tear it and theres an end farewell  if you have an imagination that the bath will do you good i say again i would have you go if not or it be inconvenient burn this note or if you would go and not take so much money take thirty pounds and i will return you twenty from hence do as you please sirrahs i suppose it will not be too late for the first season if it be i would have you resolve however to go the second season if the doctors say it will do you good and you fancy so     letter 20  london april 5 1711  i put my nineteenth in the postoffice just now myself as i came out of the city where i dined this rain ruins me in coachhire i walked away sixpennyworth and came within a shilling length and then took a coach1 and got a lift back for nothing and am now busy  6 mr secretary desired i would see him this morning said he had several things to say to me and said not one and the duke of ormond sent to desire i would meet him at mr southwells by ten this morning too which i did thinking it was some particular matter all the irish in town were there to consult upon preventing a bill for laying a duty on irish yarn so we talked a while and then all went to the lobby of the house of commons to solicit our friends and the duke came among the rest and lord anglesea solicited admirably and i did wonders but after all the matter was put off till monday and then we are to be at it again i dined with lord mountjoy and looked over him at chess which put me in mind of stella and griffyth2 i came home and that dog patrick was not within so i fretted and fretted and what good did that do me       and so get you gone to your deans      you couple of queans  i cannot find rhyme to walls and stoyteyes yes       you expect mrs walls      be dressed when she calls      to carry you to stoyte      or else honi soit  henley told me that the tories were insupportable people because they are for bringing in french claret and will not support mr harley will hardly get abroad this week or ten days yet i reckon when i send away this letter he will be just got into the house of commons my last letter went in twelve days and so perhaps may this no it wont for those letters that go under a fortnight are answers to one of yours otherwise you must take the days as they happen some dry some wet some barren some fruitful some merry some insipid some etci will write you word exactly the first day i see young gooseberries and pray observe how much later you are we have not had five fine days this five weeks but rain or wind tis a late spring they say herego to bed you two dear saucy brats and dont keep me up all night  7 ford has been at epsom to avoid good friday and easter sunday he forced me today to dine with him and tells me there are letters from ireland giving an account of a great indiscretion in the archbishop of dublin who applied a story out of tacitus very reflectingly on mr harley and that twenty people have written of it i do not believe it yet3 i called this evening to see mr secretary who has been very ill with the gravel and pain in his back by burgundy and champagne added to the sitting up all night at business i found him drinking tea while the rest were at champagne and was very glad of it i have chid him so severely that i hardly knew whether he would take it well then i went and sat an hour with mrs st john who is growing a great favourite of mine she goes to the bath on wednesday for she is much out of health and has begged me to take care of the secretary  8 i dined today with mr secretary st john he gave me a letter to read which was from the publisher of the newspaper called the postboy4 in it there was a long copy of a letter from dublin giving an account of what the whigs said upon mr harleys being stabbed and how much they abuse him and mr secretary st john and at the end there were half a dozen lines telling the story of the archbishop of dublin and abusing him horribly this was to be printed on tuesday i told the secretary i would not suffer that about the archbishop to be printed and so i crossed it out and afterwards to prevent all danger i made him give me the letter and upon further thought would let none of it be published and i sent for the printer and told him so and ordered him in the secretarys name to print nothing reflecting on anybody in ireland till he had showed it me thus i have prevented a terrible scandal to the archbishop by a piece of perfect good fortune i will let him know it by next post and pray if you pick it out let me know and whether he is thankful for it but say nothing  9 i was today at the house of commons again about their yarn at lord angleseas desire but the business is again put off till monday i dined with sir john stanley by an assignation i had made with mr st john and george granville the secretary at war but they let in other company some ladies and so we were not so easy as i intended my head is pretty tolerable but every day i feel some little disorders i have left off snuff since sunday finding myself much worse after taking a good deal at the secretarys i would not let him drink one drop of champagne or burgundy without water and in compliment i did so myself he is much better but when he is well he is like stella and will not be governed so go to your stoytes and ill go sleep  10 i have been visiting lady worsley and mrs barton today and dined soberly with my friend lewis the dauphin is dead of an apoplexy i wish he had lived till the finishing of this letter that it might be news to you duncombe5 the rich alderman died today and i hear has left the duke of argyle who married his niece two hundred thousand pounds i hope it is true for i love that duke mightily i writ this evening to the archbishop of dublin about what i told you and then went to take leave of poor mrs st john who gave me strict charge to take care of the secretary in her absence said she had none to trust but me and the poor creatures tears came fresh in her eyes before we took leave i was drawn in by the other ladies and sir john stanley to raffle for a fan with a pox it was four guineas and we put in seven shillings apiece several raffling for absent people but i lost and so missed an opportunity of showing my gallantry to mrs st john whom i designed to have presented it to if i had won is dilly6 gone to the bath his face will whizz in the water i suppose he will write to us from thence and will take london in his way backthe rabble will say there goes a drunken parson and which is worse they will say true oh but you must know i carried ford to dine with mr st john last sunday that he may brag when he goes back of dining with a secretary of state the secretary and i went away early and left him drinking with the rest and he told me that two or three of them were drunk they talk of great promotions to be made that mr harley is to be lord treasurer and lord poulett7 master of the horse etc but they are only conjecture the speaker is to make mr harley a compliment the first time he comes into the house which i hope will be in a week he has had an ill surgeon by the caprice of that puppy dr radcliffe which has kept him back so long and yesterday he got a cold but is better todaywhat i think i am stark mad to write so much in one day to little saucy md here is a deal of stuff indeed cant you bid those little dear rogues goodnight and let them go sleep mr presto when your tongue runs theres no ho with you pray  11 again at the lobby like a lobcock8 of the house of commons about your irish yarn and again put off till friday and i and patrick went into the city by water where i dined and then i went to the auction of charles barnards books but the good ones were so monstrous dear i could not reach them so i laid out one pound seven shillings but very indifferently and came away and will go there no more henley would fain engage me to go with steele and rowe etc to an invitation at sir william reads9 surely you have heard of him he has been a mountebank and is the queens oculist he makes admirable punch and treats you in gold vessels but i am engaged and will not go neither indeed am i fond of the jaunt so goodnight and go sleep  12 i went about noon to the secretary who is very ill with a cold and sometimes of the gravel with his champagne etc i scolded him like a dog and he promises faithfully more care for the future today my lord anglesea and sir thomas hammer and prior and i dined by appointment with lieutenantgeneral webb10 my lord and i stayed till ten oclock but we drank soberly and i always with water there was with us one mr campain11 one of the october club if you know what that is a club of country members who think the ministers are too backward in punishing and turning out the whigs i found my lord and the rest thought i had more credit with the ministry than i pretend to have and would have engaged me to put them upon something that would satisfy their desires and indeed i think they have some reason to complain however i will not burn my fingers i will remember stellas chiding what had you to do with what did not belong to you etc however you will give me leave to tell the ministry my thoughts when they ask them and other peoples thoughts sometimes when they do not ask so thinks dingley  13 i called this morning at mrs vedeaus again who has employed a friend to get the money it will be done in a fortnight and then she will deliver me up the parchment i went then to see mr harley who i hope will be out in a few days he was in excellent good humour only complained to me of the neglect of guiscards cure how glad he would have been to have had him live mr secretary came in to us and we were very merry till lord chamberlain duke of shrewsbury12 came up then colonel masham and i went off after i had been presented to the duke and that we made two or three silly compliments suitable to the occasion then i attended at the house of commons about your yarn and it is again put off then ford drew me to dine at a tavern it happened to be the day and the house where the october club dine after we had dined coming down we called to inquire whether our yarn business had been over that day and i sent into the room for sir george beaumont13 but i had like to be drawn into a difficulty for in two minutes out comes mr finch14 lord guernseys son to let me know that my lord compton15 the steward of this feast desired in the name of the club that i would do them the honour to dine with them i sent my excuses adorned with about thirty compliments and got off as fast as i could it would have been a most improper thing for me to dine there considering my friendship with the ministry the club is about a hundred and fifty and near eighty of them were then going to dinner at two long tables in a great groundroom at evening i went to the auction of barnards books and laid out three pounds three shillings but ill go there no more and so i said once before but now ill keep to it i forgot to tell that when i dined at webbs with lord anglesea i spoke to him of clements as one recommended for a very honest gentleman and good officer and hoped he would keep him he said he had not thought otherwise and that he should certainly hold his place while he continued to deserve it and i could not find there had been any intentions from his lordship against him but i tell you hunny the impropriety of this a great man will do a favour for me or for my friend but why should he do it for my friends friend recommendations should stop before they come to that let any friend of mine recommend one of his to me for a thing in my power i will do it for his sake but to speak to another for my friends friend is against all reason and i desire you will understand this and discourage any such troubles given mei hope this may do some good to clements it can do him no hurt and i find by mrs pratt16 that her husband is his friend and the bishop of clogher says clementss danger is not from pratt but from some other enemies that think him a whig  14 i was so busy this morning that i did not go out till late i writ today to the duke of argyle but said nothing of bernage who i believe will not see him till spain is conquered and that is not at all i was today at lord shelburnes and spoke to mrs pratt again about clements her husband himself wants some good offices and i have done him very good ones lately and told mrs pratt i expected her husband should stand by clements in return sir andrew fountaine and i dined with neighbour vanhomrigh he is mighty ill of an asthma and apprehends himself in much danger tis his own fault that will rake and drink when he is but just crawled out of his grave i will send this letter just now because i think my halfyear is out for my lodging and if you please i would be glad it were paid off and some deal boxes made for my books and kept in some safe place i would give something for their keeping but i doubt that lodging will not serve me when i come back i would have a larger place for books and a stable if possible so pray be so kind to pay the lodging and all accounts about it and get mrs brent to put up my things i would have no books put in that trunk where my papers are if you do not think of going to the bath i here send you a bill on parvisol for twenty pounds irish out of which you will pay for the lodging and score the rest to me do as you please and love poor presto that loves md better than his life a thousand millions of times farewell md etc etc     letter 21  london april 14 1711  remember sirrahs that there are but nine days between the dates of my two former letters i sent away my twentieth this moment and now am writing on like a fish as if nothing was done but there was a cause for my hasting away the last for fear it should not come time enough before a new quarter began i told you where i dined today but forgot to tell you what i believe that mr harley will be lord treasurer in a short time and other great removes and promotions made this is my thought etc  15 i was this morning with mr secretary and he is grown pretty well i dined with him today and drank some of that wine which the duke of tuscany used to send to sir william temple1 he always sends some to the chief ministers i liked it mightily but he does not and he ordered his butler to send me a chest of it tomorrow would to god md had it the queen is well again and was at chapel today etc  16 i went with ford into the city today and dined with stratford and drank tokay and then we went to the auction but i did not lay out above twelve shillings my head is a little out of order tonight though no formal fit my lord keeper has sent to invite me to dinner tomorrow and youll dine better with the dean and god bless you i forgot to tell you that yesterday was sent me a narrative printed with all the circumstances of mr harleys stabbing i had not time to do it myself so i sent my hints to the author of the atalantis2 and she has cooked it into a sixpenny pamphlet in her own style only the first page is left as i was beginning it but i was afraid of disobliging mr harley or mr st john in one critical point about it and so would not do it myself it is worth your reading for the circumstances are all true my chest of florence was sent me this morning and cost me seven and sixpence to two servants i would give two guineas you had it etc  17 i was so out of order with my head this morning that i was going to send my excuses to my lord keeper but however i got up at eleven and walked there after two and stayed till eight there was sir thomas mansel prior george granville and mr caesar3 and we were very merry my head is still wrong but i have had no formal fit only i totter a little i have left off snuff altogether i have a noble roll of tobacco for grating very good shall i send it to md if she likes that sort my lord keeper and our this days company are to dine on saturday with george granville and tomorrow i dine with lord anglesea  18 did you ever see such a blundering goosecap as presto i saw the number 21 at top and so i went on as if it were the day of the month whereas this is but wednesday the 18th how shall i do to blot and alter them i have made a shift to do it behind but it is a great botch i dined with lord anglesea today but did not go to the house of commons about the yarn my head was not well enough i know not what is the matter it has never been thus before two days together giddy from morning till night but not with any violence or pain and i totter a little but can make shift to walk i doubt i must fall to my pills again i think of going into the country a little way i tell you what you must do henceforward you must enclose your letter in a fair halfsheet of paper and direct the outside to erasmus lewis esquire at my lord dartmouths office at whitehall for i never go to the coffeehouse and they will grudge to take in my letters i forgot to tell you that your mother was to see me this morning and brought me a flask of sweetwater for a present admirable for my head but i shall not smell to it she is going to sheen with lady giffard she would fain send your papers over to you or give them to me say what you would have done and it shall be done because i love stella and she is a good daughter they say and so is dingley  19 this morning general webb was to give me a visit he goes with a crutch and stick yet was forced to come up two pair of stairs i promised to dine with him but afterwards sent my excuses and dined privately in my friend lewiss lodgings at whitehall with whom i had much business to talk of relating to the public and myself little harrison the tatler goes tomorrow to the secretaryship i got him at the hague and mr st john has made him a present of fifty guineas to bear his charges ant i a good friend why are not you a young fellow that i might prefer you i had a letter from bernage from kinsale he tells me his commission for captainlieutenant was ready for him at his arrival so there are two jackanapeses i have done with my head is something better this evening though not well  20 i was this morning with mr secretary whose packets were just come in and among them a letter from lord peterborow to me he writes so well i have no mind to answer him and so kind that i must answer him the emperors4 death must i think cause great alterations in europe and i believe will hasten a peace we reckon our king charles will be chosen emperor and the duke of savoy set up for spain but i believe he will make nothing of it dr freind and i dined in the city at a printers and it has cost me two shillings in coachhire and a great deal more this week and month which has been almost all rain with now and then sunshine and is the truest april that i have known these many years the limetrees in the park are all out in leaves though not large leaves yet wise people are going into the country but many think the parliament can hardly be up these six weeks mr harley was with the queen on tuesday i believe certainly he will be lord treasurer i have not seen him this week  21 morning lord keeper and i and prior and sir thomas mansel have appointed to dine this day with george granville my head i thank god is better but to be giddyish three or four days together mortified me i take no snuff and i will be very regular in eating little and the gentlest meats how does poor stella just now with her deans and her stoytes do they give you health for the money you lose at ombre sirrah what say you to that poor dingley frets to see stella lose that four and elevenpence the other night let us rise morrow sirrahs i will rise spite of your little teeth goodmorrowat night o faith you are little dear saucyboxes i was just going in the morning to tell you that i began to want a letter from md and in four minutes after mr ford sends me one that he had picked up at st jamess coffeehouse for i go to no coffeehouse at all and faith i was glad at heart to see it and to see stella so brisk o lord what pretending well but i will not answer it yet ill keep it for tother side well we dined today according to appointment lord keeper went away at near eight i at eight and i believe the rest will be fairly fuddled for young harcourt5 lord keepers son began to prattle before i came away it will not do with priors lean carcass i drink little miss my glass often put water in my wine and go away before the rest which i take to be a good receipt for sobriety let us put it into rhyme and so make a proverb       drink little at a time      put water with your wine      miss your glass when you can      and go off the first man  god be thanked i am much better than i was though something of a totterer i ate but little today and of the gentlest meat i refused ham and pigeons peasesoup stewed beef cold salmon because they were too strong i take no snuff at all but some herb snuff prescribed by dr radcliffe       go to your deans      you couple of queans  i believe i said that already what care i what cares presto  22 morning i must rise and go to the secretarys mr harley has been out of town this week to refresh himself before he comes into parliament oh but i must rise so there is no more to be said and so morrow sirrahs bothnight i dined today with the secretary who has engaged me for every sunday and i was an hour with him this morning deep in politics where i told him the objections of the october club and he answered all except one that no inquiries are made into past mismanagement but indeed i believe they are not yet able to make any the late ministry were too cunning in their rogueries and fenced themselves with an act of general pardon i believe mr harley must be lord treasurer yet he makes one difficulty which is hard to answer he must be made a lord and his estate is not large enough and he is too generous to make it larger and if the ministry should change soon by any accident he will be left in the suds another difficulty is that if he be made a peer they will want him prodigiously in the house of commons of which he is the great mover and after him the secretary and hardly any else of weight two shillings more today for coach and chair i shall be ruined  23 so you expect an answer to your letter do you so yes yes you shall have an answer you shall young women i made a good pun on saturday to my lord keeper after dinner we had coarse doiley napkins6 fringed at each end upon the table to drink with my lord keeper spread one of them between him and mr prior i told him i was glad to see there was such a fringeship friendship between mr prior and his lordship prior swore it was the worst he ever heard i said i thought so too but at the same time i thought it was most like one of stellas that ever i heard i dined today with lord mountjoy and this evening saw the venetian ambassador7 coming from his first public audience his coach was the most monstrous huge fine rich gilt thing that ever i saw i loitered this evening and came home late  24 i was this morning to visit the duchess of ormond8 who has long desired it or threatened she would not let me visit her daughters i sat an hour with her and we were good company when in came the countess of bellamont9 with a pox i went out and we did not know one another yet hearing me named she asked what is that dr swift said she and i were very well acquainted and fell a railing at me without mercy as a lady told me that was there yet i never was but once in the company of that drab of a countess sir andrew fountaine and i dined with my neighbour van i design in two days if possible to go lodge at chelsea for the air and put myself under a necessity of walking to and from london every day i writ this post to the bishop of clogher a long politic letter to entertain him i am to buy statues and harnese10 for them with a vengeance i have packed and sealed up mds twelve letters against i go to chelsea i have put the last commissions of md in my accountbook but if there be any former ones i have forgot them i have dingleys pocketbook down and stellas green silk apron and the pound of tea pray send me word if you have any other and down they shall go i will not answer your letter yet saucy boxes you are with the dean just now madam stella losing your money why do not you name what number you have received you say you have received my letters but do not tell the number  25 i was this day dining in the city with very insignificant low and scurvy company i had a letter from the archbishop of dublin with a long denial of the report raised on him11 which yet has been since assured to me from those who say they have it from the first hand but i cannot believe them i will show it to the secretary tomorrow i will not answer yours till i get to chelsea  26 chelsea i have sent two boxes of lumber to my friend darteneufs house and my chest of florence and other things to mrs vanhomrigh where i dined today i was this morning with the secretary and showed him the archbishops letter and convinced him of his graces innocence and i will do the same to mr harley i got here in the stagecoach with patrick and my portmanteau for sixpence and pay six shillings a week for one silly room with confounded coarse sheets12 we have had such a horrible deal of rain that there is no walking to london and i must go as i came until it mends and besides the whelp has taken my lodging as far from london as this town could afford at least half a mile farther than he need but i must be content the best is i lodge just over against dr atterburys house and yet perhaps i shall not like the place the better for that well i will stay till tomorrow before i answer your letter and you must suppose me always writing at chelsea from henceforward till i alter and say london this letter goes on saturday which will be just a fortnight so go and cheat goody stoyte etc  27 do you know that i fear my whole chest of florence is turned sour at least the two first flasks were so and hardly drinkable how plaguy unfortunate am i and the secretarys own is the best i ever tasted and i must not tell him but be as thankful as if it were the best in christendom i went to town in the sixpenny stage today and hearing mr harley was not at home i went to see him because i knew by the message of his lying porter that he was at home he was very well and just going out but made me promise to dine with him and betwixt that and indeed strolling about i lost four pound seven shillings at playwith aaabookseller and got but about half a dozen books13 i will buy no more books now thats certain well i dined at mr harleys came away at six shifted my gown cassock and periwig and walked hither to chelsea as i always design to do when it is fair i am heartily sorry to find my friend the secretary stand a little ticklish with the rest of the ministry there have been one or two disobliging things that have happened too long to tell and tother day in parliament upon a debate of about thirtyfive millions that have not been duly accounted for mr secretary in his warmth of speech and zeal for his friend mr brydges14 on whom part of the blame was falling said he did not know that either mr brydges or the late ministry were at all to blame in this matter which was very desperately spoken and giving up the whole cause for the chief quarrel against the late ministry was the ill management of the treasure and was more than all the rest together i had heard of this matter but mr foley15 beginning to discourse today at table without naming mr st john i turned to mr harley and said if the late ministry were not to blame in that article he mr harley ought to lose his head for putting the queen upon changing them he made it a jest but by some words dropped i easily saw that they take things ill of mr st john and by some hints given me from another hand that i deal with i am afraid the secretary will not stand long this is the fate of courts i will if i meet mr st john alone on sunday tell him my opinion and beg him to set himself right else the consequences may be very bad for i see not how they can well want him neither and he would make a troublesome enemy but enough of politics  28 morning i forgot to tell you that mr harley asked me yesterday how he came to disoblige the archbishop of dublin upon which having not his letter about me i told him what the bishop had written to me on that subject16 and desired i might read him the letter some other time but after all from what i have heard from other hands i am afraid the archbishop is a little guilty here is one brent spencer a brother of mr probys17 who affirms it and says he has leave to do so from charles dering18 who heard the words and that ingoldsby19 abused the archbishop etc well but now for your saucy letter i have no room to answer it o yes enough on tother side are you no sicker stella jeers presto for not coming over by christmas but indeed stella does not jeer but reproach poor poor presto and how can i come away and the firstfruits not finished i am of opinion the duke of ormond will do nothing in them before he goes which will be in a fortnight they say and then they must fall to me to be done in his absence no indeed i have nothing to print you know they have printed the miscellanies20 already are they on your side yet if you have my snuff box i will have your strong box hi does stella take snuff again or is it only because it is a fine box not the meddle but the medley21 you fool yes yes a wretched thing because it is against you tories now i think it very fine and the examiner a wretched thingtwist your mouth sirrah guiscard and what you will read in the narrative22 i ordered to be written and nothing else the spectator is written by steele with addisons help it is often very pretty yesterday it was made of a noble hint i gave him long ago for his tatlers about an indian supposed to write his travels into england23 i repent he ever had it i intended to have written a book on that subject i believe he has spent it all in one paper and all the underhints there are mine too but i never see him or addison the queen is well but i fear will be no long liver for i am told she has sometimes the gout in her bowels i hate the word bowels my ears have been these three months past much better than any time these two years but now they begin to be a little out of order again my head is better though not right but i trust to air and walking you have got my letter but what number i suppose 18 well my shin has been well this month no mrs westley24 came away without her husbands knowledge while she was in the country she has written to me for some tea they lie mr harleys wound was very terrible he had convulsions and very narrowly escaped the bruise was nine times worse than the wound he is weak still well brooks married i know all that i am sorry for mrs wallss eye i hope tis better o yes you are great walkers but i have heard them say much talkers little walkers and i believe i may apply the old proverb to you       if you talked no more than you walked      those that think you wits would be baulked  yes stella shall have a large printed bible i have put it down among my commissions for md i am glad to hear you have taken the fancy of intending to read the bible pox take the box is not it come yet this is trusting to your young fellows young women tis your fault i thought you had such power with sterne that he would fly over mount atlas to serve you you say you are not splenetic but if you be faith you will break poor prestosi will not say the rest but i vow to god if i could decently come over now i would and leave all schemes of politics and ambition for ever i have not the opportunities here of preserving my health by riding etc that i have in ireland and the want of health is a great cooler of making ones court you guess right about my being bit with a direction from walls and the letter from md i believe i described it in one of my last this goes tonight and i must now rise and walk to town and walk back in the evening god almighty bless and preserve poor md farewell  o faith dont think saucy noses that ill fill this third side i cant stay a letter above a fortnight it must go then and you would rather see a short one like this than want it a week longer  my humble service to the dean and mrs walls and good kind hearty mrs stoyte and honest catherine     letter 22  chelsea april 28 1711  at night i say at night because i finished my twentyfirst this morning here and put it into the postoffice my own self like a good boy i think i am a little before you now young women i am writing my twentysecond and have received your thirteenth i got to town between twelve and one and put on my new gown and periwig and dined with lord abercorn where i had not been since the marriage of his son lord peasley1 who has got ten thousand pounds with a wife i am now a country gentleman i walked home as i went and am a little weary and am got into bed i hope in god the air and exercise will do me a little good i have been inquiring about statues for mrs ashe i made lady abercorn2 go with me and will send them word next post to clogher i hate to buy for her i am sure she will maunder i am going to study  29 i had a charming walk to and from town today i washed shaved and all and changed gown and periwig by half an hour after nine and went to the secretary who told me how he had differed with his friends in parliament i apprehended this division and told him a great deal of it i went to court and there several mentioned it to me as what they much disliked i dined with the secretary and we proposed doing some business of importance in the afternoon which he broke to me first and said how he and mr harley were convinced of the necessity of it yet he suffered one of his undersecretaries to come upon us after dinner who stayed till six and so nothing was done and what care i he shall send to me the next time and ask twice tomorrow i go to the election at westminster school where lads are chosen for the university they say it is a sight and a great trial of wits our expedition fleet is but just sailed i believe it will come to nothing mr secretary frets at their tediousness but hopes great things from it though he owns four or five princes are in the secret and for that reason i fear it is no secret to france there are eight regiments and the admiral3 is your walkers brother the midwife  30 morn i am here in a pretty pickle it rains hard and the cunning natives of chelsea have outwitted me and taken up all the three stage coaches what shall i do i must go to town this is your fault i cannot walk i will borrow a coat this is the blind side of my lodging out of town i must expect such inconveniences as these faith ill walk in the rain morrowat night i got a gentlemans chaise by chance and so went to town for a shilling and lie this night in town i was at the election of lads at westminster today and a very silly thing it is but they say there will be fine doings tomorrow i dined with dr freind4 the second master of the school with a dozen parsons and others prior would make me stay mr harley is to hear the election tomorrow and we are all to dine with tickets and hear fine speeches tis terrible rainy weather again i lie at a friends in the city  may 1 i wish you a merry may day and a thousand more i was baulked at westminster i came too late i heard no speeches nor verses they would not let me in to their diningplace for want of a ticket and i would not send in for one because mr harley excused his coming and atterbury was not there and i cared not for the rest and so my friend lewis and i dined with kitt musgrave5 if you know such a man and the weather mending i walked gravely home this evening and so i design to walk and walk till i am well i fancy myself a little better already how does poor stella dingley is well enough go get you gone naughty girl you are well enough o dear md contrive to have some share of the country this spring go to finglas or donnybrook or clogher or killala or lowth have you got your box yet yes yes do not write to me again till this letter goes i must make haste that i may write two for one go to the bath i hope you are now at the bath if you had a mind to go or go to wexford do something for your living have you given up my lodging according to order i have had just now a compliment from dean atterburys lady6 to command the garden and library and whatever the house affords i lodge just over against them but the dean is in town with his convocation so i have my dean and prolocutor as well as you young women though he has not so good wine nor so much meat  2 a fine day but begins to grow a little warm and that makes your little fat presto sweat in the forehead pray are not the fine buns sold here in our town was it not rrrrrrrrrare chelsea buns7 i bought one today in my walk it cost me a penny it was stale and i did not like it as the man said etc sir andrew fountaine and i dined at mrs vanhomrighs and had a flask of my florence which lies in their cellar and so i came home gravely and saw nobody of consequence today i am very easy here nobody plaguing me in a morning and patrick saves many a score lies i sent over to mrs atterbury to know whether i might wait on her but she is gone a visiting we have exchanged some compliments but i have not seen her yet we have no news in our town  3 i did not go to town today it was so terrible rainy nor have i stirred out of my room till eight this evening when i crossed the way to see mrs atterbury and thank her for her civilities she would needs send me some veal and small beer and ale today at dinner and i have lived a scurvy dull splenetic day for want of md i often thought how happy i could have been had it rained eight thousand times more if md had been with a body my lord rochester8 is dead this morning they say at one oclock and i hear he died suddenly tomorrow i shall know more he is a great loss to us i cannot think who will succeed him as lord president i have been writing a long letter to lord peterborow and am dull  4 i dined today at lord shelburnes where lady kerry9 made me a present of four india handkerchiefs which i have a mind to keep for little md only that i had rather etc i have been a mighty handkerchiefmonger and have bought abundance of snuff ones since i have left off taking snuff and i am resolved when i come over md shall be acquainted with lady kerry we have struck up a mighty friendship and she has much better sense than any other lady of your country we are almost in love with one another but she is most egregiously ugly but perfectly wellbred and governable as i please i am resolved when i come to keep no company but md you know i kept my resolution last time and except mr addison conversed with none but you and your club of deans and stoytes tis three weeks young women since i had a letter from you and yet methinks i would not have another for five pounds till this is gone and yet i send every day to the coffeehouse and i would fain have a letter and not have a letter and i do not know what nor i do not know how and this goes on very slow it is a week tomorrow since i began it i am a poor country gentleman and do not know how the world passes do you know that every syllable i write i hold my lips just for all the world as if i were talking in our own little language to md faith i am very silly but i cannot help it for my life i got home early tonight my solicitors that used to ply me every morning knew not where to find me and i am so happy not to hear patrick patrick called a hundred times every morning but i looked backward and find i have said this before what care i go to the dean and roast the oranges  5 i dined today with my friend lewis and we were deep in politics how to save the present ministry for i am afraid of mr secretary as i believe i told you i went in the evening to see mr harley and upon my word i was in perfect joy mr secretary was just going out of the door but i made him come back and there was the old saturday club lord keeper lord rivers mr secretary mr harley and i the first time since his stabbing mr secretary went away but i stayed till nine and made mr harley show me his breast and tell all the story and i showed him the archbishop of dublins letter and defended him effectually we were all in mighty good humour lord keeper and i left them together and i walked here after nine two miles and i found a parson drunk fighting with a seaman and patrick and i were so wise to part them but the seaman followed him to chelsea cursing at him and the parson slipped into a house and i know no more it mortified me to see a man in my coat so overtaken a pretty scene for one that just came from sitting with the prime ministers i had no money in my pocket and so could not be robbed however nothing but mr harley shall make me take such a journey again we dont yet know who will be president in lord rochesters room i measured and found that the penknife would have killed mr harley if it had gone but half the breadth of my thumbnail lower so near was he to death i was so curious as to ask him what were his thoughts while they were carrying him home in the chair he said he concluded himself a dead man he will not allow that guiscard gave him the second stab though my lord keeper who is blind and i that was not there are positive in it he wears a plaster still as broad as half a crown smoke how wide the lines are but faith i dont do it on purpose but i have changed my side in this new chelsea bed and i do not know how methinks but it is so unfit and so awkward never saw the like  6 you must remember to enclose your letters in a fair paper and direct the outside thus to erasmus lewis esq at my lord dartmouths office at whitehall i said so before but it may miscarry you know yet i think none of my letters did ever miscarry faith i think never one among all the privateers and the storms o faith my letters are too good to be lost mds letters may tarry but never miscarry as the old woman used to say and indeed how should they miscarry when they never come before their time it was a terrible rainy day yet i made a shift to steal fair weather overhead enough to go and come in i was early with the secretary and dined with him afterwards in the morning i began to chide him and tell him my fears of his proceedings but arthur moore10 came up and relieved him but i forgot for you never heard of arthur moore but when i get mr harley alone i will know the bottom you will have dr raymond over before this letter and what care you  7 i hope and believe my walks every day do me good i was busy at home and set out late this morning and dined with mrs vanhomrigh at whose lodgings i always change my gown and periwig i visited this afternoon and among others poor biddy floyd11 who is very red but i believe wont be much marked as i was coming home i met sir george beaumont12 in the pall mall who would needs walk with me as far as buckingham house i was telling him of my head he said he had been ill of the same disorder and by all means forbid me bohea tea which he said always gave it him and that dr radcliffe said it was very bad now i had observed the same thing and have left it off this month having found myself ill after it several times and i mention it that stella may consider it for her own poor little head a pound lies ready packed up and directed for mrs walls to be sent by the first convenience mr secretary told me yesterday that mr harley would this week be lord treasurer and a peer so i expect it every day yet perhaps it may not be till parliament is up which will be in a fortnight  8 i was today with the duke of ormond and recommended to him the care of poor joe beaumont who promises me to do him all justice and favour and give him encouragement and desired i would give a memorial to ned southwell about it which i will and so tell joe when you see him though he knows it already by a letter i writ to mr warburton13 it was bloody hot walking today i dined in the city and went and came by water and it rained so this evening again that i thought i should hardly be able to get a dry hour to walk home in i will send tomorrow to the coffeehouse for a letter from md but i would not have one methinks till this is gone as it shall on saturday i visited the duchess of ormond this morning she does not go over with the duke i spoke to her to get a lad touched for the evil14 the son of a grocer in capel street one bell the ladies have bought sugar and plums of him mrs mary used to go there often this is patricks account and the poor fellow has been here some months with his boy but the queen has not been able to touch and it now grows so warm i fear she will not at all go go go to the deans and let him carry you to donnybrook and cut asparagus has parvisol sent you any this year i cannot sleep in the beginnings of the nights the heat or something hinders me and i am drowsy in the mornings  9 dr freind came this morning to visit atterburys lady and children as physician and persuaded me to go with him to town in his chariot he told me he had been an hour before with sir cholmley dering charles derings nephew and head of that family in kent for which he is knight of the shire he said he left him dying of a pistolshot quite through the body by one mr thornhill15 they fought at sword and pistol this morning in tuttle fields16 their pistols so near that the muzzles touched thornhill discharged first and dering having received the shot discharged his pistol as he was falling so it went into the air the story of this quarrel is long thornhill had lost seven teeth by a kick in the mouth from dering who had first knocked him down this was above a fortnight ago dering was next week to be married to a fine young lady this makes a noise here but you will not value it well mr harley lord keeper and one or two more are to be made lords immediately their patents are now passing and i read the preamble to mr harleys full of his praises lewis and i dined with ford i found the wine two flasks of my florence and two bottles of six that dr raymond sent me of french wine he sent it to me to drink with sir robert raymond and mr harleys brother17 whom i had introduced him to but they never could find time to come and now i have left the town and it is too late raymond will think it a cheat what care i sirrah  10 pshaw pshaw patrick brought me four letters today from dilly at bath joe parvisol and what was the fourth who can tell stand away wholl guess who can it be you old man with a stick can you tell who the fourth is from iss an please your honour it is from one madam md number fourteen well but i cant send this away now because it was here and i was in town but it shall go on saturday and this is thursday night and it will be time enough for wexford take my method i write here to parvisol to lend stella twenty pounds and to take her note promissory to pay it in half a year etc you shall see and if you want more let me know afterwards and be sure my money shall be always paid constantly too have you been good or ill housewives pray  11 joe has written me to get him a collectors place nothing less he says all the world knows of my great intimacy with mr harley and that the smallest word to him will do this is the constant cant of puppies who are at a distance and strangers to courts and ministers my answer is this which pray send that i am ready to serve joe as far as i can that i have spoken to the duke of ormond about his money as i writ to warburton that for the particular he mentions it is a work of time which i cannot think of at present but if accidents and opportunities should happen hereafter i would not be wanting that i know best how far my credit goes that he is at a distance and cannot judge that i would be glad to do him good and if fortune throws an opportunity in my way i shall not be wanting this is my answer which you may send or read to him pray contrive that parvisol may not run away with my two hundred pounds but get burtons18 note and let the money be returned me by bill dont laugh for i will be suspicious teach parvisol to enclose and direct the outside to mr lewis i will answer your letter in my next only what i take notice of here excepted i forgot to tell you that at the court of requests today i could not find a dinner i liked and it grew late and i dined with mrs vanhomrigh etc  12 morning i will finish this letter before i go to town because i shall be busy and have neither time nor place there farewell etc etc     letter 23  chelsea may 12 1711  i sent you my twentysecond this afternoon in town i dined with mr harley and the old club lord rivers lord keeper and mr secretary they rallied me last week and said i must have mr st johns leave so i writ to him yesterday that foreseeing i should never dine again with sir simon harcourt knight and robert harley esq i was resolved to do it today the jest is that before saturday1 next we expect they will be lords for mr harleys patent is drawing to be earl of oxford mr secretary and i came away at seven and he brought me to our towns end in his coach so i lost my walk st john read my letter to the company which was all raillery and passed purely  13 it rained all last night and this morning as heavy as lead but i just got fair weather to walk to town before church the roads are all over in deep puddle the hay of our town is almost fit to be mowed i went to court after church as i always do on sundays and then dined with mr secretary who has engaged me for every sunday and poor md dined at home upon a bit of veal and a pint of wine is it not plaguy insipid to tell you every day where i dine yet now i have got into the way of it i cannot forbear it neither indeed mr presto you had better go answer mds letter n14 i will answer it when i please mr doctor what is that you say the court was very full this morning expecting mr harley would be declared earl of oxford and have the treasurers staff mr harley never comes to court at all somebody there asked me the reason why said i the lord of oxford knows he always goes to the queen by the back stairs i was told for certain you jackanapes lord santry2 was dead captain cammock3 assured me so and now hes alive again they say but that shant do he shall be dead to me as long as he lives dick tighe4 and i meet and never stir our hats i am resolved to mistake him for witherington the little nasty lawyer that came up to me so sternly at the castle the day i left ireland ill ask the gentleman i saw walking with him how long witherington has been in town  14 i went to town today by water the hail quite discouraged me from walking and there is no shade in the greatest part of the way i took the first boat and had a footman my companion then i went again by water and dined in the city with a printer to whom i carried a pamphlet in manuscript that mr secretary gave me the printer sent it to the secretary for his approbation and he desired me to look it over which i did and found it a very scurvy piece the reason i tell you so is because it was done by your parson slap scrap flap what dye call him trapp5 your chancellors chaplain tis called a character of the present set of whigs and is going to be printed and no doubt the author will take care to produce it in ireland dr freind was with me and pulled out a twopenny pamphlet just published called the state of wit6 giving a character of all the papers that have come out of late the author seems to be a whig yet he speaks very highly of a paper called the examiner and says the supposed author of it is dr swift but above all things he praises the tatlers and spectators and i believe steele and addison were privy to the printing of it thus is one treated by these impudent dogs and that villain curll7 has scraped up some trash and calls it dr swifts miscellanies with the name at large and i can get no satisfaction of him nay mr harley told me he had read it and only laughed at me before lord keeper and the rest since i came home i have been sitting with the prolocutor dean atterbury who is my neighbour over the way but generally keeps in town with his convocation tis late etc  15 my walk to town today was after ten and prodigiously hot i dined with lord shelburne and have desired mrs pratt who lodges there to carry over mrs wallss tea i hope she will do it and they talk of going in a fortnight my way is this i leave my best gown and periwig at mrs vanhomrighs then walk up the pall mall through the park out at buckingham house and so to chelsea a little beyond the church i set out about sunset and get here in something less than an hour it is two good miles and just five thousand seven hundred and fortyeight steps so there is four miles a day walking without reckoning what i walk while i stay in town when i pass the mall in the evening it is prodigious to see the number of ladies walking there and i always cry shame at the ladies of ireland who never walk at all as if their legs were of no use but to be laid aside i have been now almost three weeks here and i thank god am much better in my head if it does but continue i tell you what if i was with you when we went to stoyte at donnybrook we would only take a coach to the hither end of stephens green and from thence go every step on foot yes faith every step it would do dd8 good as well as presto9 everybody tells me i look better already for faith i looked sadly that is certain my breakfast is milk porridge i do not love it faith i hate it but it is cheap and wholesome and i hate to be obliged to either of those qualities for anything10  16 i wonder why presto will be so tedious in answering mds letters because he would keep the best to the last i suppose well presto must be humoured it must be as he will have it or there will be an old to do11 dead with heat are not you very hot my walks make my forehead sweat rarely sometimes my morning journey is by water as it was today with one parson richardson12 who came to see me on his going to ireland and with him i send mrs wallss tea and three books13 i got from the lords of the treasury for the college i dined with lord shelburne today lady kerry and mrs pratt are going likewise for irelandlord i forgot i dined with mr prior today at his house with dean atterbury and others and came home pretty late and i think im in a fuzz and dont know what i say never saw the like  17 sterne came here by water to see me this morning and i went back with him to his boat he tells me that mrs edgworth14 married a fellow in her journey to chester so i believe she little thought of anybodys box but her own i desired sterne to give me directions where to get the box in chester which he says he will tomorrow and i will write to richardson to get it up there as he goes by and whip it over it is directed to mrs curry you must caution her of it and desire her to send it you when it comes sterne says jemmy leigh loves london mightily that makes him stay so long i believe and not sternes business which mr harleys accident has put much backward we expect now every day that he will be earl of oxford and lord treasurer his patent is passing but they say lord keepers not yet at least his son young harcourt told me so tother day i dined today privately with my friend lewis at his lodgings at whitehall tother day at whitehall i met a lady of my acquaintance whom i had not seen before since i came to england we were mighty glad to see each other and she has engaged me to visit her as i design to do it is one mrs colledge she has lodgings at whitehall having been seamstress to king william worth three hundred a year her father was a fanatic joiner15 hanged for treason in shaftesburys plot this noble person and i were brought acquainted some years ago by lady berkeley16 i love good creditable acquaintance i love to be the worst of the company i am not of those that say for want of company welcome trumpery i was this evening with lady kerry and mrs pratt at vauxhall to hear the nightingales but they are almost past singing  18 i was hunting the secretary today in vain about some business and dined with colonel crowe late governor of barbados17 and your friend sterne was the third he is very kind to sterne and helps him in his business which lies asleep till mr harley is lord treasurer because nothing of moment is now done in the treasury the change being expected every day i sat with dean atterbury till one oclock after i came home so tis late etc  19 do you know that about our town we are mowing already and making hay and it smells so sweet as we walk through the flowery meads but the haymaking nymphs are perfect drabs nothing so clean and pretty as farther in the country there is a mighty increase of dirty wenches in straw hats since i knew london i stayed at home till five oclock and dined with dean atterbury then went by water to mr harleys where the saturday club was met with the addition of the duke of shrewsbury i whispered lord rivers that i did not like to see a stranger among us and the rogue told it aloud but mr secretary said the duke writ to have leave so i appeared satisfied and so we laughed mr secretary told me the duke of buckingham18 had been talking to him much about me and desired my acquaintance i answered it could not be for he had not made sufficient advances then the duke of shrewsbury said he thought that duke was not used to make advances i said i could not help that for i always expected advances in proportion to mens quality and more from a duke than any other man the duke replied that he did not mean anything of his quality which was handsomely said enough for he meant his pride and i have invented a notion to believe that nobody is proud at ten all the company went away and from ten to twelve mr harley and i sat together where we talked through a great deal of matters i had a mind to settle with him and then walked in a fine moonshine night to chelsea where i got by one lord rivers conjured me not to walk so late but i would because i had no other way but i had no money to lose  20 by what the lord keeper told me last night i find he will not be made a peer so soon but mr harleys patent for earl of oxford is now drawing and will be done in three days we made him own it which he did scurvily and then talked of it like the rest mr secretary had too much company with him today so i came away soon after dinner i give no man liberty to swear or talk bdy and i found some of them were in constraint so i left them to themselves i wish you a merry whitsuntide and pray tell me how you pass away your time but faith you are going to wexford and i fear this letter is too late it shall go on thursday and sooner it cannot i have so much business to hinder me answering yours where must i direct in your absence do you quit your lodgings  21 going to town this morning i met in the pall mall a clergyman of ireland whom i love very well and was glad to see and with him a little jackanapes of ireland too who married nanny swift uncle adams19 daughter one perry perhaps you may have heard of him his wife has sent him here to get a place from lowndes20 because my uncle and lowndes married two sisters and lowndes is a great man here in the treasury but by good luck i have no acquaintance with him however he expected i should be his friend to lowndes and one word of mine etc the old cant but i will not go two yards to help him i dined with mrs vanhomrigh where i keep my best gown and periwig to put on when i come to town and be a spark  22 i dined today in the city and coming home this evening i met sir thomas mansel and mr lewis in the park lewis whispered me that mr harleys patent for the earl of oxford was passed in mr secretary st johns office so tomorrow or next day i suppose he will be declared earl of oxford and have the staff21 this man has grown by persecutions turnings out and stabbing what waiting and crowding and bowing will be at his levee yet if human nature be capable of so much constancy i should believe he will be the same man still bating the necessary forms of grandeur he must keep up tis late sirrahs and ill go sleep  23 morning i sat up late last night and waked late today but will now answer your letter in bed before i go to town and i will send it tomorrow for perhaps you maynt go so soon to wexfordno you are not out in your number the last was number 14 and so i told you twice or thrice will you never be satisfied what shall we do for poor stella go to wexford for gods sake i wish you were to walk there by three miles a day with a good lodging at every miles end walking has done me so much good that i cannot but prescribe it often to poor stella parvisol has sent me a bill for fifty pounds which i am sorry for having not written to him for it only mentioned it two months ago but i hope he will be able to pay you what i have drawn upon him for he never sent me any sum before but one bill of twenty pounds half a year ago you are welcome as my blood to every farthing i have in the world and all that grieves me is i am not richer for mds sake as hope saved22 i suppose you give up your lodgings when you go to wexford yet that will be inconvenient too yet i wish again you were under a necessity of rambling the country until michaelmas faith no let them keep the shelves with a pox yet they are exacting people about those four weeks or mrs brent may have the shelves if she please i am obliged to your dean for his kind offer of lending me money will that be enough to say a hundred people would lend me money or to any man who has not the reputation of a squanderer o faith i should be glad to be in the same kingdom with md however although you are at wexford but i am kept here by a most capricious fate which i would break through if i could do it with decency or honourto return without some mark of distinction would look extremely little and i would likewise gladly be somewhat richer than i am i will say no more but beg you to be easy till fortune take her course and to believe that mds felicity is the great end i aim at in all my pursuits and so let us talk no more on this subject which makes me melancholy and that i would fain divert believe me no man breathing at present has less share of happiness in life than i i do not say i am unhappy at all but that everything here is tasteless to me for want of being as i would be and so a short sigh and no more of this well come and lets see whats next young women pox take mrs edgworth and sterne i will take some methods about that box what orders would you have me give about the picture cant you do with it as if it were your own no i hope manley will keep his place for i hear nothing of sir thomas franklands losing his send nothing under cover to mr addison but to erasmus lewis esq at my lord dartmouths office at whitehall direct your outside sopoor dear stella dont write in the dark nor in the light neither but dictate to dingley she is a naughty healthy girl and may drudge for both are you good company together and dont you quarrel too often pray love one another and kiss one another just now as dingley is reading this for you quarrelled this morning just after mrs marget23 had poured water on stellas head i heard the little bird say so well i have answered everything in your letter that required it and yet the second side is not full ill come home at night and say more and tomorrow this goes for certain go get you gone to your own chambers and let presto rise like a modest gentleman and walk to town i fancy i begin to sweat less in the forehead by constant walking than i used to do but then i shall be so sunburnt the ladies will not like me come let me rise sirrahs morrowat night i dined with ford today at his lodgings and i found wine out of my own cellar some of my own chest of the great dukes wine it begins to turn they say wine with you in ireland is half a crown a bottle tis as stella says nothing that once grows dear in ireland ever grows cheap again except corn with a pox to ruin the parson i had a letter today from the archbishop of dublin giving me further thanks about vindicating him to mr harley and mr st john and telling me a long story about your mayors election24 wherein i find he has had a finger and given way to further talk about him but we know nothing of it here yet this walking to and fro and dressing myself takes up so much of my time that i cannot go among company so much as formerly yet what must a body do i thank god i yet continue much better since i left the town i know not how long it may last i am sure it has done me some good for the present i do not totter as i did but walk firm as a cock only once or twice for a minute i do not know how but it went off and i never followed it does dingley read my hand as well as ever do you sirrah poor stella must not read prestos ugly small hand       preserve your eyes      if you be wise  your friend wallss tea will go in a day or two towards chester by one parson richardson my humble service to her and to good mrs stoyte and catherine and pray walk while you continue in dublin i expect your next but one will be from wexford god bless dearest md  24 morning mr secretary has sent his groom hither to invite me to dinner today etc god almighty for ever bless and preserve you both and give you health etc amen farewell etc  do not i often say the same thing two or three times in the same letter sirrah  great wits they say have but short memories thats good vile conversation     letter 24  chelsea may 24 1711  morning once in my life the number of my letters and of the day of the month is the same thats lucky boys thats a sign that things will meet and that we shall make a figure together what will you still have the impudence to say london england because i say dublin ireland is there no difference between london and dublin saucyboxes i have sealed up my letter and am going to town morrow sirrahsat night i dined with the secretary today we sat down between five and six mr harleys patent passed this morning he is now earl of oxford earl mortimer and lord harley of wigmore castle my letter was sealed or i would have told you this yesterday but the public news may tell it you the queen for all her favour has kept a rod1 for him in her closet this week i suppose he will take it from her though in a day or two at eight oclock this evening it rained prodigiously as it did from five however i set out and in halfway the rain lessened and i got home but tolerably wet and this is the first wet walk i have had in a months time that i am here but however i got to bed after a short visit to atterbury  25 it rained this morning and i went to town by water and ford and i dined with mr lewis by appointment i ordered patrick to bring my gown and periwig to mr lewis because i designed to go to see lord oxford and so i told the dog but he never came though i stayed an hour longer than i appointed so i went in my old gown and sat with him two hours but could not talk over some business i had with him so he has desired me to dine with him on sunday and i must disappoint the secretary my lord set me down at a coffeehouse where i waited for the dean of carlisles chariot to bring me to chelsea for it has rained prodigiously all this afternoon the dean did not come himself but sent me his chariot which has cost me two shillings to the coachman and so i am got home and lord knows what is become of patrick i think i must send him over to you for he is an intolerable rascal if i had come without a gown he would have served me so though my life and preferment should have lain upon it and i am making a livery for him will cost me four pounds but i will order the tailor tomorrow to stop till further orders my lord oxford cant yet abide to be called my lord and when i called him my lord he called me dr thomas swift2 which he always does when he has a mind to tease me by a second hand he proposed my being his chaplain which i by a second hand excused but we had no talk of it today but i will be no mans chaplain alive but i must go and be busy  26 i never saw patrick till this morning and that only once for i dressed myself without him and when i went to town he was out of the way i immediately sent for the tailor and ordered him to stop his hand in patricks clothes till further orders oh if it were in ireland i should have turned him off ten times ago and it is no regard to him but myself that has made me keep him so long now i am afraid to give the rogue his clothes what shall i do i wish md were here to entreat for him just here at the beds side lady ashburnham3 has been engaging me this long time to dine with her and i set today apart for it and whatever was the mistake she sent me word she was at dinner and undressed but would be glad to see me in the afternoon so i dined with mrs vanhomrigh and would not go to see her at all in a huff my fine florence is turning sour with a vengeance and i have not drunk half of it as i was coming home tonight sir thomas mansel and tom harley4 met me in the park and made me walk with them till nine like unreasonable whelps so i got not here till ten but it was a fine evening and the footpath clean enough already after this hard rain  27 going this morning to town i saw two old lame fellows walking to a brandyshop and when they got to the door stood a long time complimenting who should go in first though this be no jest to tell it was an admirable one to see i dined today with my lord oxford and the ladies the new countess and lady betty5 who has been these three days a lady born my lord left us at seven and i had no time to speak to him about some affairs but he promises in a day or two we shall dine alone which is mighty likely considering we expect every moment that the queen will give him the staff and then he will be so crowded he will be good for nothing for aught i know he may have it tonight at council  28 i had a petition sent me tother day from one stephen gernon setting forth that he formerly lived with harry tenison6 who gave him an employment of gauger and that he was turned out after harrys death and came for england and is now starving or as he expresses it that the staff of life has been of late a stranger to his appetite today the poor fellow called and i knew him very well a young slender fellow with freckles in his face you must remember him he waited at table as a better sort of servant i gave him a crown and promised to do what i could to help him to a service which i did for harry tenisons memory it was bloody hot walking today and i was so lazy i dined where my new gown was at mrs vanhomrighs and came back like a fool and the dean of carlisle has sat with me till eleven lord oxford has not the staff yet  29 i was this morning in town by ten though it was shavingday and went to the secretary about some affairs then visited the duke and duchess of ormond but the latter was dressing to go out and i could not see her my lord oxford had the staff given him this morning so now i must call him lord oxford no more but lord treasurer i hope he will stick there this is twice he has changed his name this week and i heard today in the city where i dined that he will very soon have the garterprythee do not you observe how strangely i have changed my company and manner of living i never go to a coffeehouse you hear no more of addison steele henley lady lucy mrs finch7 lord somers lord halifax etc i think i have altered for the better did i tell you the archbishop of dublin has writ me a long letter of a squabble in your town about choosing a mayor and that he apprehended some censure for the share he had in it8 i have not heard anything of it here but i shall not be always able to defend him we hear your bishop hickman is dead9 but nobody here will do anything for me in ireland so they may die as fast or slow as they pleasewell you are constant to your deans and your stoyte and your walls walls will have her tea soon parson richardson is either going or gone to ireland and has it with him i hear mr lewis has two letters for me i could not call for them today but will tomorrow and perhaps one of them may be from our little md who knows man who can tell many a more unlikely thing has happenedpshaw i write so plaguy little i can hardly see it myself write bigger sirrah10 presto no but i wont oh you are a saucy rogue mr presto you are so impudent come dear rogues let presto go to sleep i have been with the dean and tis near twelve  30 i am so hot and lazy after my mornings walk that i loitered at mrs vanhomrighs where my best gown and periwig are and out of mere listlessness dine there very often so i did today but i got little mds letter n15 you see sirrahs i remember to tell the number from mr lewis and i read it in a closet they lend me at mrs vans and i find stella is a saucy rogue and a great writer and can write finely still when her hand is in and her pen good when i came here tonight i had a mighty mind to go swim after i was cool for my lodging is just by the river and i went down with only my nightgown and slippers on at eleven but came up again however one of these nights i will venture  31 i was so hot this morning with my walk that i resolve to do so no more during this violent burning weather it is comical that now we happen to have such heat to ripen the fruit there has been the greatest blast that was ever known and almost all the fruit is despaired of i dined with lord shelburne lady kerry and mrs pratt are going to ireland i went this evening to lord treasurer and sat about two hours with him in mixed company he left us and went to court and carried two staves with him so i suppose we shall have a new lord steward or comptroller tomorrow i smoked that state secret out by that accident i will not answer your letter yet sirrahs no i wont madam  june 1 i wish you a merry month of june i dined again with the vans and sir andrew fountaine i always give them a flask of my florence which now begins to spoil but it is near an end i went this afternoon to mrs vedeaus and brought away madam dingleys parchment and letter of attorney mrs vedeau tells me she has sent the bill a fortnight ago i will give the parchment to ben tooke and you shall send him a letter of attorney at your leisure enclosed to mr presto yes i now think your mackerel is full as good as ours which i did not think formerly i was bit about two staves for there is no new officer made today this letter will find you still in dublin i suppose or at donnybrook or losing your money at walls how does she do  2 i missed this day by a blunder and dining in the city11  3 no boats on sunday never so i was forced to walk and so hot by the time i got to fords lodging that i was quite spent i think the weather is mad i could not go to church i dined with the secretary as usual and old colonel graham12 that lived at bagshot heath and they said it was colonel grahams house pshaw i remember it very well when i used to go for a walk to london from moor park what i warrant you do not remember the golden farmer13 neither figgarkick soley14  4 when must we answer this letter this n15 of our little md heat and laziness and sir andrew fountaine made me dine today again at mrs vans and in short this weather is unsupportable how is it with you lady betty butler and lady ashburnham sat with me two or three hours this evening in my closet at mrs vans they are very good girls and if lady betty went to ireland you should let her be acquainted with you how does dingley do this hot weather stella i think never complains of it she loves hot weather there has not been a drop of rain since friday seennight yes you do love hot weather naughty stella you do so and presto cant abide it be a good girl then and i will love you and love one another and dont be quarrelling girls  5 i dined in the city today and went from hence early to town and visited the duke of ormond and mr secretary they say my lord treasurer has a dead warrant in his pocket they mean a list of those who are to be turned out of employment and we every day now expect those changes i passed by the treasury today and saw vast crowds waiting to give lord treasurer petitions as he passes by he is now at the top of power and favour he keeps no levees yet i am cruel thirsty this hot weatheri am just this minute going to swim i take patrick down with me to hold my nightgown shirt and slippers and borrow a napkin of my landlady for a cap so farewell till i come up but there is no danger dont be frightedi have been swimming this halfhour and more and when i was coming out i dived to make my head and all through wet like a cold bath but as i dived the napkin fell off and is lost and i have that to pay for o faith the great stones were so sharp i could hardly set my feet on them as i came out it was pure and warm i got to bed and will now go sleep  6 morning this letter shall go tomorrow so i will answer yours when i come home tonight i feel no hurt from last nights swimming i lie with nothing but the sheet over me and my feet quite bare i must rise and go to town before the tide is against me morrow sirrahs dear sirrahs morrowat night i never felt so hot a day as this since i was born i dined with lady betty germaine and there was the young earl of berkeley15 and his fine lady i never saw her before nor think her near so handsome as she passes forafter dinner mr bertue16 would not let me put ice in my wine but said my lord dorchester17 got the bloody flux with it and that it was the worst thing in the world thus are we plagued thus are we plagued yet i have done it five or six times this summer and was but the drier and the hotter for it nothing makes me so excessively peevish as hot weather lady berkeley after dinner clapped my hat on another ladys head and she in roguery put it upon the rails i minded them not but in two minutes they called me to the window and lady carteret18 showed me my hat out of her window five doors off where i was forced to walk to it and pay her and old lady weymouth19 a visit with some more beldames then i went and drank coffee and made one or two puns with lord pembroke20 and designed to go to lord treasurer but it was too late and beside i was half broiled and broiled without butter for i never sweat after dinner if i drink any wine then i sat an hour with lady betty butler at tea and everything made me hotter and drier then i walked home and was here by ten so miserably hot that i was in as perfect a passion as ever i was in my life at the greatest affront or provocation then i sat an hour till i was quite dry and cool enough to go swim which i did but with so much vexation that i think i have given it over for i was every moment disturbed by boats rot them and that puppy patrick standing ashore would let them come within a yard or two and then call sneakingly to them the only comfort i proposed here in hot weather is gone for there is no jesting with those boats after it is dark i had none last night i dived to dip my head and held my cap on with both my hands for fear of losing it pox take the boats amen tis near twelve and so ill answer your letter it strikes twelve now tomorrow morning  7 morning well now let us answer mds letter n15 15 15 15 now have i told you the number 15 15 there impudence to call names in the beginning of your letter before you say how do you do mr presto there is your breeding where is your manners sirrah to a gentleman get you gone you couple of jadesno i never sit up late now but this abominable hot weather will force me to eat or drink something that will do me hurt i do venture to eat a few strawberrieswhy then do you know in ireland that mr st john talked so in parliament21 your whigs are plaguily bit for he is entirely for their being all outand are you as vicious in snuff as ever i believe as you say it does neither hurt nor good but i have left it off and when anybody offers me their box i take about a tenth part of what i used to do and then just smell to it and privately fling the rest away i keep to my tobacco still22 as you say but even much less of that than formerly only mornings and evenings and very seldom in the dayas for joe23 i have recommended his case heartily to my lord lieutenant and by his direction given a memorial of it to mr southwell to whom i have recommended it likewise i can do no more if he were my brother his business will be to apply himself to southwell and you must desire raymond if price of galway comes to town to desire him to wait on mr southwell as recommended by me for one of the dukes chaplains which was all i could do for him and he must be presented to the duke and make his court and ply about and find out some vacancy and solicit early for it the bustle about your mayor i had before as i told you from the archbishop of dublin was raymond not come till may 18 so he says fine things of me certainly he lies i am sure i used him indifferently enough and we never once dined together or walked or were in any third place only he came sometimes to my lodgings and even there was oftener denied than admittedwhat an odd bill is that you sent of raymonds a bill upon one murry in chester which depends entirely not only upon raymonds honesty but his discretion and in money matters he is the last man i would depend on why should sir alexander cairnes24 in london pay me a bill drawn by god knows who upon murry in chester i was at cairness and they can do no such thing i went among some friends who are merchants and i find the bill must be sent to murry accepted by him and then returned back and then cairnes may accept or refuse it as he pleases accordingly i gave sir thomas frankland the bill who has sent it to chester and ordered the postmaster there to get it accepted and then send it back and in a day or two i shall have an answer and therefore this letter must stay a day or two longer than i intended and see what answer i get raymond should have written to murry at the same time to desire sir alexander cairnes to have answered such a bill if it come but cairness clerks himself was not at home said they had received no notice of it and could do nothing and advised me to send to murryi have been six weeks today at chelsea and you know it but just now and so dean  thinks i write the medley pox of his judgment it is equal to his honesty then you hant seen the miscellany yet25 why tis a fourshilling book has nobody carried it overno i believe manley26 will not lose his place for his friend27 in england is so far from being out that he has taken a new patent since the post office act and his brother jack manley28 here takes his part firmly and i have often spoken to southwell in his behalf and he seems very well inclined to him but the irish folks here in general are horribly violent against him besides he must consider he could not send stella wine if he were put out and so he is very kind and sends you a dozen bottles of wine at a time and you win eight shillings at a time and how much do you lose no no never one syllable about that i warrant youwhy this same stella is so unmerciful a writer she has hardly left any room for dingley if you have such summer there as here sure the wexford waters are good by this time i forgot what weather we had may 6th go look in my journal we had terrible rain the 24th and 25th and never a drop since yes yes i remember beresteds bridge the coach sosses up and down as one goes that way just as at hockleyinthehole29 i never impute any illness or health i have to good or ill weather but to want of exercise or ill air or something i have eaten or hard study or sitting up and so i fence against those as well as i can but who a deuce can help the weather will seymour30 the general was excessively hot with the sun shining full upon him so he turns to the sun and says harkee friend you had better go and ripen cucumbers than plague me at this rate etc another time fretting at the heat a gentleman by said it was such weather as pleased god seymour said perhaps it may but i am sure it pleases nobody else why madam dingley the firstfruits are done southwell told me they went to inquire about them and lord treasurer said they were done and had been done long ago and ill tell you a secret you must not mention that the duke of ormond is ordered to take notice of them in his speech in your parliament and i desire you will take care to say on occasion that my lord treasurer harley did it many months ago before the duke was lord lieutenant and yet i cannot possibly come over yet so get you gone to wexford and make stella well yes yes i take care not to walk late i never did but once and there are five hundred people on the way as i walk tisdall is a puppy and i will excuse him the halfhour he would talk with me as for the examiner i have heard a whisper that after that of this day31 which tells us what this parliament has done you will hardly find them so good i prophesy they will be trash for the future and methinks in this days examiner the author talks doubtfully as if he would write no more32 observe whether the change be discovered in dublin only for your own curiosity thats all make a mouth there mrs vedeaus business i have answered and i hope the bill is not lost morrow tis stewing hot but i must rise and go to town between fire and water morrow sirrahs both morrowat night i dined today with colonel crowe governor of jamaica and your friend sterne i presented sterne to my lord treasurers brother33 and gave him his case and engaged him in his favour at dinner there fell the swingingest long shower and the most grateful to me that ever i saw it thundered fifty times at least and the air is so cool that a body is able to live and i walked home tonight with comfort and without dirt i went this evening to lord treasurer and sat with him two hours and we were in very good humour and he abused me and called me dr thomas swift fifty times i have told you he does that when he has mind to make me mad34 sir thomas frankland gave me today a letter from murry accepting my bill so all is well only by a letter from parvisol i find there are some perplexitiesjoe has likewise written to me to thank me for what i have done for him and desires i would write to the bishop of clogher that tom ashe35 may not hinder his father36 from being portreve i have written and sent to joe several times that i will not trouble myself at all about trim i wish them their liberty but they do not deserve it so tell joe and send to him i am mighty happy with this rain i was at the end of my patience but now i live again this cannot go till saturday and perhaps i may go out of town with lord shelburne and lady kerry tomorrow for two or three days lady kerry has written to desire it but tomorrow i shall know farthero this dear rain i cannot forbear praising it i never felt myself to be revived so in my life it lasted from three till five hard as a horn and mixed with hail  8 morning i am going to town and will just finish this there if i go into the country with lady kerry and lord shelburne so morrow till an hour or two hencein town i met cairnes who i suppose will pay me the money though he says i must send him the bill first and i will get it done in absence farewell etc etc     letter 25  chelsea june 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20  i have been all this time at wycombe between oxford and london with lord shelburne who has the squires house at the towns end and an estate there in a delicious country lady kerry and mrs pratt were with us and we passed our time well enough and there i wholly disengaged myself from all public thoughts and everything but md who had the impudence to send me a letter there but ill be revenged i will answer it this day the 20th i came from wycombe with lady kerry after dinner lighted at hyde park corner and walked it was twentyseven miles and we came it in about five hours  21 i went at noon to see mr secretary at his office and there was lord treasurer so i killed two birds etc and we were glad to see one another and so forth and the secretary and i dined at sir william wyndhams1 who married lady catharine seymour your acquaintance i suppose there were ten of us at dinner it seems in my absence they had erected a club2 and made me one and we made some laws today which i am to digest and add to against next meeting our meetings are to be every thursday we are yet but twelve lord keeper and lord treasurer were proposed but i was against them and so was mr secretary though their sons are of it and so they are excluded but we design to admit the duke of shrewsbury the end of our club is to advance conversation and friendship and to reward deserving persons with our interest and recommendation we take in none but men of wit or men of interest and if we go on as we begin no other club in this town will be worth talking of the solicitorgeneral sir robert raymond is one of our club and i ordered him immediately to write to your lord chancellor in favour of dr raymond so tell raymond if you see him but i believe this will find you at wexford this letter will come three weeks after the last so there is a week lost but that is owing to my being out of town yet i think it is right because it goes enclosed to mr reading3 and why should he know how often presto writes to md prayi sat this evening with lady betty butler and lady ashburnham and then came home by eleven and had a good cool walk for we have had no extreme hot weather this fortnight but a great deal of rain at times and a body can live and breathe i hope it will hold so we had peaches today  22 i went late today to town and dined with my friend lewis i saw will congreve attending at the treasury by order with his brethren the commissioners of the wine licences i had often mentioned him with kindness to lord treasurer and congreve told me that after they had answered to what they were sent for my lord called him privately and spoke to him with great kindness promising his protection etc the poor man said he had been used so ill of late years that he was quite astonished at my lords goodness etc and desired me to tell my lord so which i did this evening and recommended him heartily my lord assured me he esteemed him very much and would be always kind to him that what he said was to make congreve easy because he knew people talked as if his lordship designed to turn everybody out and particularly congreve which indeed was true for the poor man told me he apprehended it as i left my lord treasurer i called on congreve knowing where he dined and told him what had passed between my lord and me so i have made a worthy man easy and that is a good days work4 i am proposing to my lord to erect a society or academy for correcting and settling our language that we may not perpetually be changing as we do he enters mightily into it so does the dean of carlisle5 and i design to write a letter to lord treasurer with the proposals of it and publish it6 and so i told my lord and he approves it yesterdays7 was a sad examiner and last week was very indifferent though some little scraps of the old spirit as if he had given some hints but yesterdays is all trash it is plain the hand is changed  23 i have not been in london today for dr gastrell8 and i dined by invitation with the dean of carlisle my neighbour so i know not what they are doing in the world a mere country gentleman and are not you ashamed both to go into the country just when i did and stay ten days just as i did saucy monkeys but i never rode i had no horses and our coach was out of order and we went and came in a hired one do you keep your lodgings when you go to wexford i suppose you do for you will hardly stay above two months i have been walking about our town tonight and it is a very scurvy place for walking i am thinking to leave it and return to town now the irish folks are gone ford goes in three days how does dingley divert herself while stella is riding work or read or walk does dingley ever read to you had you ever a book with you in the country is all that left off confess well ill go sleep tis past eleven and i go early to sleep i write nothing at night but to md  24 stratford and i and pastoral philips just come from denmark dined at fords today who paid his way and goes for ireland on tuesday the earl of peterborow is returned from vienna without one servant he left them scattered in several towns of germany i had a letter from him four days ago from hanover where he desires i would immediately send him an answer to his house at parsons green9 about five miles off i wondered what he meant till i heard he was come he sent expresses and got here before them he is above fifty and as active as one of fiveandtwenty i have not seen him yet nor know when i shall or where to find him  25 poor duke of shrewsbury has been very ill of a fever we were all in a fright about him i thank god he is better i dined today at lord ashburnhams with his lady for he was not at home she is a very good girl and always a great favourite of mine sterne tells me he has desired a friend to receive your box in chester and carry it over i fear he will miscarry in his business which was sent to the treasury before he was recommended for i was positive only to second his recommendations and all his other friends failed him however on your account i will do what i can for him tomorrow with the secretary of the treasury  26 we had much company today at dinner at lord treasurers prior never fails he is a much better courtier than i and we expect every day that he will be a commissioner of the customs and that in a short time a great many more will be turned out they blame lord treasurer for his slowness in turning people out but i suppose he has his reasons they still keep my neighbour atterbury in suspense about the deanery of christ church10 which has been above six months vacant and he is heartily angry i reckon you are now preparing for your wexford expedition and poor dingley is full of carking and caring scolding how long will you stay shall i be in dublin before you return dont fall and hurt yourselves nor overturn the coach love one another and be good girls and drink prestos health in water madam stella and in good ale madam dingley  27 the secretary appointed me to dine with him today and we were to do a world of business he came at four and brought prior with him and had forgot the appointment and no business was done i left him at eight and went to change my gown at mrs vanhomrighs and there was sir andrew fountaine at ombre with lady ashburnham and lady frederic schomberg and lady mary schomberg11 and lady betty butler and others talking and it put me in mind of the dean and stoyte and walls and stella at play and dingley and i looking on i stayed with them till ten like a fool lady ashburnham is something like stella so i helped her and wished her good cards it is late etc  28 well but i must answer this letter of our mds saturday approaches and i hant written down this side o faith presto has been a sort of a lazy fellow but presto will remove to town this day seennight the secretary has commanded me to do so and i believe he and i shall go for some days to windsor where he will have leisure to mind some business we have together today our society it must not be called a club dined at mr secretarys we were but eight the rest sent excuses or were out of town we sat till eight and made some laws and settlements and then i went to take leave of lady ashburnham who goes out of town tomorrow as a great many of my acquaintance are already and left the town very thin i shall make but short journeys this summer and not be long out of london the days are grown sensibly short already all our fruit blasted your duke of ormond is still at chester and perhaps this letter will be with you as soon as he sternes business is quite blown up they stand to it to send him back to the commissioners of the revenue in ireland for a reference and all my credit could not alter it though i almost fell out with the secretary of the treasury12 who is my lord treasurers cousingermain and my very good friend it seems every step he has hitherto taken hath been wrong at least they say so and that is the same thing i am heartily sorry for it and i really think they are in the wrong and use him hardly but i can do no more  29 steele has had the assurance to write to me that i would engage my lord treasurer to keep a friend of his in an employment i believe i told you how he and addison served me for my good offices in steeles behalf and i promised lord treasurer never to speak for either of them again sir andrew fountaine and i dined today at mrs vanhomrighs dilly ashe has been in town this fortnight i saw him twice he was four days at lord pembrokes in the country punning with him his face is very well i was this evening two or three hours at lord treasurers who called me dr thomas swift twenty times thats his way of teasing i left him at nine and got home here by ten like a gentleman and tomorrow morning ill answer your little letter sirrahs  30 morning i am terribly sleepy always in a morning i believe it is my walk overnight that disposes me to sleep faith tis now striking eight and i am but just awake patrick comes early and wakes me five or six times but i have excuses though i am three parts asleep i tell him i sat up late or slept ill in the night and often it is a lie i have now got little mds letter before me n16 no more nor no less no mistake dingley says this letter wont be above six lines and i was afraid it was true though i saw it filled on both sides the bishop of clogher writ me word you were in the country and that he heard you were well i am glad at heart md rides and rides and rides our hot weather ended in may and all this month has been moderate it was then so hot i was not able to endure it i was miserable every moment and found myself disposed to be peevish and quarrelsome i believe a very hot country would make me stark madyes my head continues pretty tolerable and i impute it all to walking does stella eat fruit i eat a little but i always repent and resolve against it no in very hot weather i always go to town by water but i constantly walk back for then the sun is down and so mrs proby13 goes with you to wexford shes admirable company youll grow plaguy wise with those you frequent mrs taylor and mrs proby take care of infection i believe my two hundred pounds will be paid but that sir alexander cairnes is a scrupulous puppy i left the bill with mr stratford who is to have the money now madam stella what say you you ride every day i know that already sirrah and if you rid every day for a twelvemonth you would be still better and better no i hope parvisol will not have the impudence to make you stay an hour for the money if he does ill unparvisol him pray let me know o lord how hasty we are stella cant stay writing and writing she must write and go a cockhorse pray now well but the horses are not come to the door the fellow cant find the bridle your stirrup is broken where did you put the whips dingley marget where have you laid mrs johnsons ribbon to tie about her reach me my mask sup up this before you go so so a gallop a gallop sit fast sirrah and dont ride hard upon the stoneswell now stella is gone tell me dingley is she a good girl and what news is that you are to tell meno i believe the box is not lost sterne says it is notno faith you must go to wexford without seeing your duke of ormond unless you stay on purpose perhaps you may be so wisei tell you this is your sixteenth letter will you never be satisfied no no i will walk late no more i ought less to venture it than other people and so i was told but i will return to lodge in town next thursday when you come from wexford i would have you send a letter of attorney to mr benjamin tooke bookseller in london directed to me and he shall manage your affair i have your parchment safely locked up in londono madam stella welcome home was it pleasant riding did your horse stumble how often did the man light to settle your stirrup ride nine miles faith you have galloped indeed well but where is the fine thing you promised me i have been a good boy ask dingley else i believe you did not meet the finethingman faith you are a cheat so you will see raymond and his wife in town faith that riding to laracor gives me short sighs as well as you all the days i have passed here have been dirt to those i have been gaining enemies by the scores and friends by the couples which is against the rules of wisdom because they say one enemy can do more hurt than ten friends can do good but i have had my revenge at least if i get nothing else and so let fate governnow i think your letter is answered and mine will be shorter than ordinary because it must go today we have had a great deal of scattering rain for some days past yet it hardly keeps down the dustwe have plays acted in our town and patrick was at one of them oh oh he was damnably mauled one day when he was drunk he was at cuffs with a brotherfootman who dragged him along the floor upon his face which looked for a week after as if he had the leprosy and i was glad enough to see it i have been ten times sending him over to you yet now he has new clothes and a laced hat which the hatter brought by his orders and he offered to pay for the lace out of his wagesi am to dine today with dilly at sir andrew fountaines who has bought a new house and will be weary of it in half a year i must rise and shave and walk to town unless i go with the dean in his chariot at twelve which is too late and i have not seen that lord peterborow yet the duke of shrewsbury is almost well again and will be abroad in a day or two what care you there it is now you do not care for my friends farewell my dearest lives and delights i love you better than ever if possible as hope saved i do and ever will god almighty bless you ever and make us happy together i pray for this twice every day and i hope god will hear my poor hearty prayersremember if i am used ill and ungratefully as i have formerly been tis what i am prepared for and shall not wonder at it yet i am now envied and thought in high favour and have every day numbers of considerable men teasing me to solicit for them and the ministry all use me perfectly well and all that know them say they love me yet i can count upon nothing nor will but upon mds love and kindnessthey think me useful they pretended they were afraid of none but me and that they resolved to have me they have often confessed this yet all makes little impression on mepox of these speculations they give me the spleen and that is a disease i was not born to let me alone sirrahs and be satisfied i am as long as md and presto are well       little wealth      and much health      and a life by stealth  that is all we want and so farewell dearest md stella dingley presto all together now and for ever all together farewell again and again

at sir andrew fountaines there were we wretchedly punning and writing together to lord pembroke dilly is just such a puppy as ever and it is so uncouth after so long an intermission my twentyfifth is gone this evening to the post i think i will direct my next which is this to mr currys and let them send it to wexford and then the next enclosed to reading instruct me how i shall do i long to hear from you from wexford and what sort of place it is the town grows very empty and dull this evening i have had a letter from mr philips the pastoral poet to get him a certain employment from lord treasurer i have now had almost all the whig poets my solicitors and i have been useful to congreve steele and harrison but i will do nothing for philips i find he is more a puppy than ever so dont solicit for him besides i will not trouble lord treasurer unless upon some very extraordinary occasion  july 1 dilly lies conveniently for me when i come to town from chelsea of a sunday and go to the secretarys so i called at his lodgings this morning and sent for my gown and dressed myself there he had a letter from the bishop with an account that you were set out for wexford the morning he writ which was june 26 and he had the letter the 30th that was very quick the bishop says you design to stay there two months or more dilly had also a letter from tom ashe full of irish news that your lady lyndon1 is dead and i know not what besides of dr coghill2 losing his drab etc the secretary was gone to windsor and i dined with mrs vanhomrigh lord treasurer is at windsor too they will be going and coming all summer while the queen is there and the town is empty and i fear i shall be sometimes forced to stoop beneath my dignity and send to the alehouse for a dinner well sirrahs had you a good journey to wexford did you drink ale by the way were you never overturned how many things did you forget do you lie on straw in your new town where you are cudshoe3 the next letter to presto will be dated from wexford what fine company have you there what new acquaintance have you got you are to write constantly to mrs walls and mrs stoyte and the dean said shall we never hear from you yes mr dean well make bold to trouble you with a letter then at wexford when you meet a lady did your waters pass well this morning madam will dingley drink them too yes i warrant to get her a stomach i suppose you are all gamesters at wexford do not lose your money sirrah far from home i believe i shall go to windsor in a few days at least the secretary tells me so he has a small house there with just room enough for him and me and i would be satisfied to pass a few days there sometimes sirrahs let me go to sleep it is past twelve in our town  2 sterne came to me this morning and tells me he has yet some hopes of compassing his business he was with tom harley the secretary of the treasury and made him doubt a little he was in the wrong the poor man tells me it will almost undo him if he fails i called this morning to see will congreve who lives much by himself is forced to read for amusement and cannot do it without a magnifyingglass i have set him very well with the ministry and i hope he is in no danger of losing his place i dined in the city with dr freind not among my merchants but with a scrub instrument of mischief of mine whom i never mentioned to you nor am like to do you two little saucy wexfordians you are now drinking waters you drink waters you go fiddlestick pray god send them to do you good if not faith next summer you shall come to the bath  3 lord peterborow desired to see me this morning at nine i had not seen him before since he came home i met mrs manley4 there who was soliciting him to get some pension or reward for her service in the cause by writing her atalantis and prosecution etc upon it i seconded her and hope they will do something for the poor woman my lord kept me two hours upon politics he comes home very sanguine he has certainly done great things at savoy and vienna by his negotiations he is violent against a peace and finds true what i writ to him that the ministry seems for it he reasons well yet i am for a peace i took leave of lady kerry who goes tomorrow for ireland she picks up lord shelburne and mrs pratt at lord shelburnes house i was this evening with lord treasurer tom harley was there and whispered me that he began to doubt about sternes business i told him he would find he was in the wrong i sat two or three hours at lord treasurers he rallied me sufficiently upon my refusing to take him into our club and told a judge who was with us that my name was thomas swift i had a mind to prevent sir h belasyse5 going to spain who is a most covetous cur and i fell a railing against avarice and turned it so that he smoked me and named belasyse i went on and said it was a shame to send him to which he agreed but desired i would name some who understood business and do not love money for he could not find them i said there was something in a treasurer different from other men that we ought not to make a man a bishop who does not love divinity or a general who does not love war and i wondered why the queen would make a man lord treasurer who does not love money he was mightily pleased with what i said he was talking of the firstfruits of england and i took occasion to tell him that i would not for a thousand pounds anybody but he had got them for ireland who got them for england too he bid me consider what a thousand pounds was i said i would have him to know i valued a thousand pounds as little as he valued a millionis it not silly to write all this but it gives you an idea what our conversation is with mixed company i have taken a lodging in suffolk street and go to it on thursday and design to walk the park and the town to supply my walking here yet i will walk here sometimes too in a visit now and then to the dean6 when i was almost at home patrick told me he had two letters for me and gave them to me in the dark yet i could see one of them was from saucy md i went to visit the dean for half an hour and then came home and first read the other letter which was from the bishop of clogher who tells me the archbishop of dublin mentioned in a full assembly of the clergy the queens granting the firstfruits said it was done by the lord treasurer and talked much of my merit in it but reading yours i find nothing of that perhaps the bishop lies out of a desire to please me i dined with mrs vanhomrigh well sirrahs you are gone to wexford but ill follow you  4 sterne came to me again this morning to advise about reasons and memorials he is drawing up and we went to town by water together and having nothing to do i stole into the city to an instrument of mine and then went to see poor patty rolt7 who has been in town these two months with a cousin of hers her life passes with boarding in some country town as cheap as she can and when she runs out shifting to some cheaper place or coming to town for a month if i were rich i would ease her which a little thing would do some months ago i sent her a guinea and it patched up twenty circumstances she is now going to berkhamstead in hertfordshire it has rained and hailed prodigiously today with some thunder this is the last night i lie at chelsea and i got home early and sat two hours with the dean and ate victuals having had a very scurvy dinner ill answer your letter when i come to live in town you shall have a fine london answer but first i will go sleep and dream of md  london july 5 this day i left chelsea for good thats a genteel phrase and am got into suffolk street i dined today at our society and we are adjourned for a month because most of us go into the country we dined at lord keepers with young harcourt and lord keeper was forced to sneak off and dine with lord treasurer who had invited the secretary and me to dine with him but we scorned to leave our company as george granville did whom we have threatened to expel however in the evening i went to lord treasurer and among other company found a couple of judges with him one of them judge powell8 an old fellow with grey hairs was the merriest old gentleman i ever saw spoke pleasant things and laughed and chuckled till he cried again i stayed till eleven because i was not now to walk to chelsea  6 an ugly rainy day i was to visit mrs barton then called at mrs vanhomrighs where sir andrew fountaine and the rain kept me to dinner and there did i loiter all the afternoon like a fool out of perfect laziness and the weather not permitting me to walk but ill do so no more are your waters at wexford good in this rain i long to hear how you are established there how and whom you visit what is your lodging what are your entertainments you are got far southwards but i think you must eat no fruit while you drink the waters i ate some kentish cherries tother day and i repent it already i have felt my head a little disordered we had not a hot day all june or since which i reckon a mighty happiness have you left a direction with reading for wexford i will as i said direct this to currys and the next to reading or suppose i send this at a venture straight to wexford it would vex me to have it miscarry i had a letter tonight from parvisol that white has paid me most of my remaining money and another from joe that they have had their election at trim but not a word of who is chosen portreeve9 poor joe is full of complaints says he has enemies and fears he will never get his two hundred pounds and i fear so too although i have done what i couldill answer your letter when i think fit when saucy presto thinks fit sirrahs i am not at leisure yet when i have nothing to do perhaps i may vouchsafeo lord the two wexford ladies ill go dream of you both  7 it was the dismallest rainy day i ever saw i went to the secretary in the morning and he was gone to windsor then it began raining and i struck in to mrs vanhomrighs and dined and stayed till night very dull and insipid i hate this town in summer ill leave it for a while if i can have time  8 i have a fellow of your town one tisdall10 lodges in the same house with me patrick told me squire tisdall and his lady lodged here i pretended i never heard of him but i knew his ugly face and saw him at church in the next pew to me and he often looked for a bow but it would not do i think he lives in capel street and has an ugly fine wife in a fine coach dr freind and i dined in the city by invitation and i drank punch very good but it makes me hot people here are troubled with agues by this continuance of wet cold weather but i am glad to find the season so temperate i was this evening to see will congreve who is a very agreeable companion  9 i was today in the city and dined with mr stratford who tells me sir alexander cairnes makes difficulties about paying my bill so that i cannot give order yet to parvisol to deliver up the bond to dr raymond tomorrow i shall have a positive answer that cairnes is a shuffling scoundrel and several merchants have told me so what can one expect from a scot and a fanatic i was at batemans the booksellers to see a fine old library he has bought and my fingers itched as yours would do at a chinashop but i resisted and found everything too dear and i have fooled away too much money that way already so go and drink your waters saucy rogue and make yourself well and pray walk while you are there i have a notion there is never a good walk in ireland11 do you find all places without trees pray observe the inhabitants about wexford they are old english see what they have particular in their manners names and language magpies have been always there and nowhere else in ireland till of late years they say the cocks and dogs go to sleep at noon and so do the people write your travels and bring home good eyes and health  10 i dined today with lord treasurer we did not sit down till four i despatched three businesses with him and forgot a fourth i think i have got a friend an employment and besides i made him consent to let me bring congreve to dine with him you must understand i have a mind to do a small thing only turn out all the queens physicians for in my conscience they will soon kill her among them and i must talk over that matter with some people my lord treasurer told me the queen and he between them have lost the paper about the firstfruits but desires i will let the bishops know it shall be done with the first opportunity  11 i dined today with neighbour van and walked pretty well in the park this evening stella hussy dont you remember sirrah you used to reproach me about meddling in other folks affairs i have enough of it now two people came to me tonight in the park to engage to speak to lord treasurer in their behalf and i believe they make up fifty who have asked me the same favour i am hardened and resolve to trouble him or any other minister less than ever and i observe those who have ten times more credit than i will not speak a word for anybody i met yesterday the poor lad i told you of who lived with mr tenison12 who has been ill of an ague ever since i saw him he looked wretchedly and was exceeding thankful for half a crown i gave him he had a crown from me before  12 i dined today with young manley13 in the city who is to get me out a box of books and a hamper of wine from hamburg i inquired of mr stratford who tells me that cairnes has not yet paid my two hundred pounds but shams and delays from day to day young manleys wife is a very indifferent person of a young woman goggleeyed and looks like a fool yet he is a handsome fellow and married her for love after long courtship and she refused him until he got his last employmenti believe i shall not be so good a boy for writing as i was during your stay at wexford unless i may send my letters every second time to currys pray let me know this i think shall go there or why not to wexford itself that is right and so it shall this next tuesday although it costs you tenpence what care i  13 this toad of a secretary is come from windsor and i cannot find him and he goes back on sunday and i cant see him tomorrow i dined scurvily today with mr lewis and a parson and then went to see lord treasurer and met him coming from his house in his coach he smiled and i shrugged and we smoked each other and so my visit is paid i now confine myself to see him only twice a week he has invited me to windsor and betwixt two stools etc i will go live at windsor if possible thats pozzz i have always the luck to pass my summer in london i called this evening to see poor sir matthew dudley a commissioner of the customs i know he is to be out for certain he is in hopes of continuing i would not tell him bad news but advised him to prepare for the worst dilly was with me this morning to invite me to dine at kensington on sunday with lord mountjoy who goes soon for ireland your late chiefjustice broderick14 is here and they say violent as a tiger how is party among you at wexford are the majority of ladies for the late or present ministry write me wexford news and love presto because he is a good boy  14 although it was shavingday i walked to chelsea and was there by nine this morning and the dean of carlisle and i crossed the water to battersea and went in his chariot to greenwich where we dined at dr gastrells and passed the afternoon at lewisham at the dean of canterburys15 and there i saw moll stanhope16 who is grown monstrously tall but not so handsome as formerly it is the first little rambling journey i have had this summer about london and they are the agreeablest pastimes one can have in a friends coach and to good company bank stock is fallen three or four per cent by the whispers about the town of the queens being ill who is however very well  15 how many books have you carried with you to wexford what not one single book oh but your time will be so taken up and you can borrow of the parson i dined today with sir andrew fountaine and dilly at kensington with lord mountjoy and in the afternoon stratford came there and told me my two hundred pounds were paid at last so that business is over and i am at ease about it and i wish all your money was in the bank too i will have my other hundred pounds there that is in hawkshaws hands have you had the interest of it paid yet i ordered parvisol to do it what makes presto write so crooked i will answer your letter tomorrow and send it on tuesday heres hot weather come again yesterday and today fine drinking waters now we had a sad pert dull parson at kensington today i almost repent my coming to town i want the walks i had  16 i dined in the city today with a hedge17 acquaintance and the day passed without any consequence i will answer your letter tomorrow  17 morning i have put your letter before me and am going to answer it hold your tongue stand by your weather and ours were not alike we had not a bit of hot weather in june yet you complain of it on the 19th day what you used to love hot weather then i could never endure it i detest and abominate it i would not live in a hot country to be king of it what a splutter you keep about my bonds with raymond and all to affront presto presto will be suspicious of everything but md in spite of your little nose soft and fair madam stella how you gallop away in your spleen and your rage about repenting my journey and preferment here and sixpence a dozen and nasty england and laracor all my life heydazy will you never have done i had no offers of any living lord keeper told me some months ago he would give me one when i pleased but i told him i would not take any from him and the secretary told me tother day he had refused a very good one for me but it was in a place he did not like and i know nothing of getting anything here and if they would give me leave i would come over just now addison i hear has changed his mind about going over but i have not seen him these four monthsoh ay thats true dingley thats like herself millions of businesses to do before she goes yes my head has been pretty well but threatening within these two or three days which i impute to some fruit i ate but i will eat no more not a bit of any sort i suppose you had a journey without dust and that was happy i long for a wexford letter but must not think of it yet your last was finished but three weeks ago it is dd news you tell me of mrs f it makes me love england less a great deal i know nothing of the trunk being left or taken so tis odd enough if the things in it were mine and i think i was told that there are some things for me that my mother left particularly to me i am really sorry for  that scoundrel  will have his estate after his mothers death let me know if mrs walls has got her tea i hope richardson18 stayed in dublin till it came mrs walls needed not have that blemish in her eye for i am not in love with her at all no i do not like anything in the examiner after the 45th except the first part of the 46th19 all the rest is trash and if you like them especially the 47th your judgment is spoiled by ill company and want of reading which i am more sorry for than you think and i have spent fourteen years in improving you to little purpose mr tooke is come here and i must stopat night i dined with lord treasurer today and he kept me till nine so i cannot send this tonight as i intended nor write some other letters green20 his surgeon was there and dressed his breast that is put on a plaster which is still requisite and i took an opportunity to speak to him of the queen but he cut me short with this saying laissez faire a don antoine which is a french proverb expressing leave that to me i find he is against her taking much physic and i doubt he cannot persuade her to take dr radcliffe however she is very well now and all the story of her illness except the first day or two was a lie we had some business that company hindered us from doing though he is earnest for it yet would not appoint me a certain day but bids me come at all times till we can have leisure this takes up a great deal of my time and i can do nothing i would do for them i was with the secretary this morning and we both think to go to windsor for some days to despatch an affair if we can have leisure sterne met me just now in the street by his lodgings and i went in for an hour to jemmy leigh who loves london dearly he asked after you with great respect and friendshipto return to your letter your bishop mills21 hates me mortally i wonder he should speak well of me having abused me in all places where he went so you pay your way cudsho you had a fine supper i warrant two pullets and a bottle of wine and some currantsit is just three weeks today since you set out to wexford you were three days going and i do not expect a letter these ten days yet or rather this fortnight i got a grant of the gazette22 for ben tooke this morning from mr secretary it will be worth to him a hundred pounds a year  18 today i took leave of mrs barton who is going into the country and i dined with sir john stanley23 where i have not been this great while there dined with us lord rochester and his fine daughter lady jane24 just growing a toptoast i have been endeavouring to save sir matthew dudley25 but fear i cannot i walked the mall six times tonight for exercise and would have done more but as empty as the town is a fool got hold of me and so i came home to tell you this shall go tomorrow without fail and follow you to wexford like a dog  19 dean atterbury sent to me to dine with him at chelsea i refused his coach and walked and am come back by seven because i would finish this letter and some others i am writing patrick tells me the maid says one mr walls a clergyman a tall man was here to visit me is it your irish archdeacon i shall be sorry for it but i shall make shift to see him seldom enough as i do dilly what can he do here or is it somebody else the duke of newcastle26 is dead by the fall he had from his horse god send poor stella her health and keep md happy farewell and love presto who loves md above all things ten million of times god bless the dear wexford girls farewell again etc etc     letter 27  london july 19 1711  i have just sent my 26th and have nothing to say because i have other letters to write pshaw i began too high but i must lay the beginning like a nestegg tomorrow i will say more and fetch up this line to be straight this is enough at present for two dear saucy naughty girls  20 have i told you that walls has been with me and leaves the town in three days he has brought no gown with him dilly carried him to a play he has come upon a foolish errand and goes back as he comes i was this day with lord peterborow who is going another ramble i believe i told you so i dined with lord treasurer but cannot get him to do his own business with me he has put me off till tomorrow  21 22 i dined yesterday with lord treasurer who would needs take me along with him to windsor although i refused him several times having no linen etc i had just time to desire lord forbes1 to call at my lodging and order my man to send my things today to windsor by his servant i lay last night at the secretarys lodgings at windsor and borrowed one of his shirts to go to court in the queen is very well i dined with mr masham and not hearing anything of my things i got lord winchelsea to bring me to town here i found that patrick had broke open the closet to get my linen and nightgown and sent them to windsor and there they are and he not thinking i would return so soon is gone upon his rambles so here i am left destitute and forced to borrow a nightgown of my landlady and have not a rag to put on tomorrow faith it gives me the spleen  23 morning it is a terrible rainy day and rained prodigiously on saturday night patrick lay out last night and is not yet returned faith poor presto is a desolate creature neither servant nor linen nor anythingnight lord forbess man has brought back my portmantua and patrick is come so i am in christian circumstances i shall hardly commit such a frolic again i just crept out to mrs vans and dined and stayed there the afternoon it has rained all this day windsor is a delicious place i never saw it before except for an hour about seventeen years ago walls has been here in my absence i suppose to take his leave for he designed not to stay above five days in london he says he and his wife will come here for some months next year and in short he dares not stay now for fear of her  24 i dined today with a hedge2 friend in the city and walls overtook me in the street and told me he was just getting on horseback for chester he has as much curiosity as a cow he lodged with his horse in aldersgate street he has bought his wife a silk gown and himself a hat and what are you doing what is poor md doing now how do you pass your time at wexford how do the waters agree with you let presto know soon for presto longs to know and must know is not madam proby curious company i am afraid this rainy weather will spoil your waters we have had a great deal of wet these three days tell me all the particulars of wexford the place the company the diversions the victuals the wants the vexations poor dingley never saw such a place in her life sent all over the town for a little parsley to a boiled chicken and it was not to be had the butter is stark naught except an old english womans and it is such a favour to get a pound from her now and then i am glad you carried down your sheets with you else you must have lain in sackcloth o lord  25 i was this forenoon with mr secretary at his office and helped to hinder a man of his pardon who is condemned for a rape the under secretary was willing to save him upon an old notion that a woman cannot be ravished but i told the secretary he could not pardon him without a favourable report from the judge besides he was a fiddler and consequently a rogue and deserved hanging for some thing else and so he shall swing what i must stand up for the honour of the fair sex tis true the fellow had lain with her a hundred times before but what care i for that what must a woman be ravished because she is a whorethe secretary and i go on saturday to windsor for a week i dined with lord treasurer and stayed with him till past ten i was today at his levee where i went against my custom because i had a mind to do a good office for a gentleman so i talked with him before my lord that he might see me and then found occasion to recommend him this afternoon i was forced to excuse my coming to the levee that i did it to see the sight for he was going to chide me away i had never been there but once and that was long before he was treasurer the rooms were all full and as many whigs as tories he whispered me a jest or two and bid me come to dinner i left him but just now and tis late  26 mr addison and i have at last met again i dined with him and steele today at young jacob tonsons the two jacobs3 think it is i who have made the secretary take from them the printing of the gazette which they are going to lose and ben tooke and another4 are to have it jacob came to me the other day to make his court but i told him it was too late and that it was not my doing i reckon they will lose it in a week or two mr addison and i talked as usual and as if we had seen one another yesterday and steele and i were very easy though i writ him lately a biting letter in answer to one of his where he desired me to recommend a friend of his to lord treasurer go get you gone to your waters sirrah do they give you a stomach do you eat heartilywe have had much rain today and yesterday  27 i dined today in the city and saw poor patty rolt and gave her a pistole to help her a little forward against she goes to board in the country she has but eighteen pounds a year to live on and is forced to seek out for cheap places sometimes they raise their price and sometimes they starve her and then she is forced to shift patrick the puppy put too much ink in my standish5 and carrying too many things together i spilled it on my paper and floor the town is dull wet and empty wexford is worth two of it i hope so at least and that poor little md finds it so i reckon upon going to windsor tomorrow with mr secretary unless he changes his mind or some other business prevents him i shall stay there a week i hope  28 morning mr secretary sent me word he will call at my lodgings by two this afternoon to take me to windsor so i must dine nowhere and i promised lord treasurer to dine with him today but i suppose we shall dine at windsor at five for we make but three hours there6 i am going abroad but have left patrick to put up my things and to be sure to be at home half an hour before twowindsor at night we did not leave london till three and dined here between six and seven at nine i left the company and went to see lord treasurer who is just come i chid him for coming so late he chid me for not dining with him said he stayed an hour for me then i went and sat with mr lewis till just now and it is past eleven i lie in the same house with the secretary one of the prebendarys houses the secretary is not come from his apartment in the castle do you think that abominable dog patrick was out after two today and i in a fright every moment for fear the chariot should come and when he came in he had not put up one rag of my things i never was in a greater passion and would certainly have cropped one of his ears if i had not looked every moment for the secretary who sent his equipage to my lodging before and came in a chair from whitehall to me and happened to stay half an hour later than he intended one of lord treasurers servants gave me a letter tonight i found it was from  with an offer of fifty pounds to be paid me in what manner i pleased because he said he desired to be well with me i was in a rage7 but my friend lewis cooled me and said it is what the best men sometimes meet with and i have been not seldom served in the like manner although not so grossly in these cases i never demur a moment nor ever found the least inclination to take anything well i will go try to sleep in my new bed and to dream of poor wexford md and stella that drinks water and dingley that drinks ale  29 i was at court and church today as i was this day seennight i generally am acquainted with about thirty in the drawingroom and i am so proud i make all the lords come up to me one passes half an hour pleasant enough we had a dunce to preach before the queen today which often happens windsor is a delicious situation but the town is scoundrel i have this morning got the gazette for ben tooke and one barber a printer it will be about three hundred pounds a year between them the other fellow was printer of the examiner which is now laid down8 i dined with the secretary we were a dozen in all three scotch lords and lord peterborow the duke of hamilton9 would needs be witty and hold up my train as i walked upstairs it is an ill circumstance that on sundays much company always meet at the great tables lord treasurer told at court what i said to mr secretary on this occasion the secretary showed me his bill of fare to encourage me to dine with him poh said i show me a bill of company for i value not your dinner see how this is all blotted10 i can write no more here but to tell you i love md dearly and god bless them  30 in my conscience i fear i shall have the gout i sometimes feel pains about my feet and toes i never drank till within these two years and i did it to cure my head i often sit evenings with some of these people and drink in my turn but i am now resolved to drink ten times less than before but they advise me to let what i drink be all wine and not to put water to it tooke and the printer stayed today to finish their affair and treated me and two of the under secretaries upon their getting the gazette then i went to see lord treasurer and chid him for not taking notice of me at windsor he said he kept a place for me yesterday at dinner and expected me there but i was glad i did not go because the duke of buckingham was there and that would have made us acquainted which i have no mind to however we appointed to sup at mr mashams and there stayed till past one oclock and that is late sirrahs and i have much business  31 i have sent a noble haunch of venison this afternoon to mrs vanhomrigh i wish you had it sirrahs i dined gravely with my landlord the secretary the queen was abroad today in order to hunt but finding it disposed to rain she kept in her coach she hunts in a chaise with one horse which she drives herself and drives furiously like jehu and is a mighty hunter like nimrod dingley has heard of nimrod but not stella for it is in the bible i was today at eton which is but just cross the bridge to see my lord kerrys son11 who is at school there mr secretary has given me a warrant for a buck i cant send it to md it is a sad thing faith considering how presto loves md and how md would love prestos venison for prestos sake god bless the two dear wexford girls  aug 1 we had for dinner the fellow of that haunch of venison i sent to london twas mighty fat and good and eight people at dinner that was bad the queen and i were going to take the air this afternoon but not together and were both hindered by a sudden rain her coaches and chaises all went back and the guards too and i scoured into the marketplace for shelter i intended to have walked up the finest avenue i ever saw two miles long with two rows of elms on each side i walked in the evening a little upon the terrace and came home at eight mr secretary came soon after and we were engaging in deep discourse and i was endeavouring to settle some points of the greatest consequence and had wormed myself pretty well into him when his under secretary came in who lodges in the same house with us and interrupted all my scheme i have just left him it is late etc  2 i have been now five days at windsor and patrick has been drunk three times that i have seen and oftener i believe he has lately had clothes that have cost me five pounds and the dog thinks he has the whiphand of me he begins to master me so now i am resolved to part with him and will use him without the least pity the secretary and i have been walking three or four hours today the duchess of shrewsbury12 asked him was not that drdrand she could not say my name in english but said dr presto which is italian for swift whimsical enough as billy swift13 says i go tomorrow with the secretary to his house at bucklebury twentyfive miles from hence and return early on sunday morning i will leave this letter behind me locked up and give you an account of my journey when i return i had a letter yesterday from the bishop of clogher who is coming up to his parliament have you any correspondence with him to wexford methinks i now long for a letter from you dated wexford july 24 etc o lord that would be so pretending14 and then says you stella cant write much because it is bad to write when one drinks the waters and i think says you i find myself better already but i cannot tell yet whether it be the journey or the waters presto is so silly tonight yes he be but presto loves md dearly as hope saved  3 morning i am to go this day at noon as i told you to bucklebury we dine at twelve and expect to be there in four hours i cannot bid you goodnight now because i shall be twentyfive miles from this paper tonight and so my journal must have a break so goodmorrow etc  4 5 i dined yesterday at bucklebury where we lay two nights and set out this morning at eight and were here at twelve in four hours we went twentysix miles mr secretary was a perfect country gentleman at bucklebury he smoked tobacco with one or two neighbours he inquired after the wheat in such a field he went to visit his hounds and knew all their names he and his lady saw me to my chamber just in the country fashion his house is in the midst of near three thousand pounds a year he had by his lady15 who is descended from jack newbury of whom books and ballads are written and there is an old picture of him in the house she is a great favourite of mine i lost church today but i dressed and shaved and went to court and would not dine with the secretary but engaged myself to a private dinner with mr lewis and one friend more we go to london tomorrow for lord dartmouth the other secretary is come and they are here their weeks by turns  6 lord treasurer comes every saturday to windsor and goes away on monday or tuesday i was with him this morning at his levee for one cannot see him otherwise here he is so hurried we had some talk and i told him i would stay this week at windsor by myself where i can have more leisure to do some business that concerns them lord treasurer and the secretary thought to mortify me for they told me they had been talking a great deal of me today to the queen and she said she had never heard of me i told them that was their fault and not hers etc and so we laughed i dined with the secretary and let him go to london at five without me and here am i alone in the prebendarys house which mr secretary has taken only mr lewis is in my neighbourhood and we shall be good company the vicechamberlain16 and mr masham and the green cloth17 have promised me dinners i shall want but four till mr secretary returns we have a musicmeeting in our town tonight i went to the rehearsal of it and there was margarita18 and her sister and another drab and a parcel of fiddlers i was weary and would not go to the meeting which i am sorry for because i heard it was a great assembly mr lewis came from it and sat with me till just now and tis late  7 i can do no business i fear because mr lewis who has nothing or little to do here sticks close to me i dined today with the gentlemen ushers among scurvy company but the queen was hunting the stag till four this afternoon and she drove in her chaise above forty miles and it was five before we went to dinner here are fine walks about this town i sometimes walk up the avenue  8 there was a drawingroom today at court but so few company that the queen sent for us into her bedchamber where we made our bows and stood about twenty of us round the room while she looked at us round with her fan in her mouth and once a minute said about three words to some that were nearest her and then she was told dinner was ready and went out i dined at the green cloth by mr scarborows19 invitation who is in waiting it is much the best table in england and costs the queen a thousand pounds a month while she is at windsor or hampton court and is the only mark of magnificence or hospitality i can see in the queens family it is designed to entertain foreign ministers and people of quality who come to see the queen and have no place to dine at  9 mr coke the vicechamberlain made me a long visit this morning and invited me to dinner but the toast his lady20 was unfortunately engaged to lady sunderland21 lord treasurer stole here last night but did not lie at his lodgings in the castle and after seeing the queen went back again i just drank a dish of chocolate with him i fancy i shall have reason to be angry with him very soon but what care i i believe i shall die with ministries in my debtthis night i received a certain letter from a place called wexford from two dear naughty girls of my acquaintance but faith i will not answer it here no in troth i will send this to mr reading supposing it will find you returned and i hope better for the waters  10 mr vicechamberlain lent me his horses to ride about and see the country this morning dr arbuthnot the queens physician and favourite went out with me to show me the places we went a little after the queen and overtook miss forester22 a maid of honour on her palfrey taking the air we made her go along with us we saw a place they have made for a famous horserace tomorrow where the queen will come we met the queen coming back and miss forester stood like us with her hat off while the queen went by the doctor and i left the lady where we found her but under other conductors and we dined at a little place he has taken about a mile offwhen i came back i found mr scarborow had sent all about to invite me to the green cloth and lessened his company on purpose to make me easy it is very obliging and will cost me thanks much company is come to town this evening to see tomorrows race i was tired with riding a trotting mettlesome horse a dozen miles having not been on horseback this twelvemonth and miss forester did not make it easier she is a silly true maid of honour and i did not like her although she be a toast and was dressed like a man23  11 i will send this letter today i expect the secretary by noon i will not go to the race unless i can get room in some coach it is now morning i must rise and fold up and seal my letter farewell and god preserve dearest md  i believe i shall leave this town on monday     letter 28  windsor aug 11 1711  i sent away my twentyseventh this morning in an express to london and directed to mr reading this shall go to your lodgings where i reckon you will be returned before it reaches you i intended to go to the race1 today but was hindered by a visit i believe i told you so in my last i dined today at the green cloth where everybody had been at the race but myself and we were twenty in all and very noisy company but i made the vicechamberlain and two friends more sit at a side table to be a little quiet at six i went to see the secretary who is returned but lord keeper sent to desire i would sup with him where i stayed till just now lord treasurer and secretary were to come to us but both failed tis late etc  12 i was this morning to visit lord keeper who made me reproaches that i had never visited him at windsor he had a present sent him of delicious peaches and he was champing and champing but i durst not eat one i wished dingley had some of them for poor stella can no more eat fruit than presto dilly ashe is come to windsor and after church i carried him up to the drawingroom and talked to the keeper and treasurer on purpose to show them to him and he saw the queen and several great lords and the duchess of montagu2 he was mighty happy and resolves to fill a letter to the bishop3 my friend lewis and i dined soberly with dr adams4 the only neighbour prebendary one of the prebendaries here is lately a peer by the death of his father he is now lord willoughby of broke5 and will sit in the house of lords with his gown i supped tonight at mashams with lord treasurer mr secretary and prior the treasurer made us stay till twelve before he came from the queen and tis now past two  13 i reckoned upon going to london today but by an accident the cabinet council did not sit last night and sat today so we go tomorrow at six in the morning i missed the race today by coming out too late when everybodys coach was gone and ride i would not i felt my last riding three days after we had a dinner today at the secretarys lodgings without him mr hare6 his under secretary mr lewis brigadier sutton7 and i dined together and i made the vicechamberlain take a snap with us rather than stay till five for his lady who was gone to the race the reason why the cabinet council was not held last night was because mr secretary st john would not sit with your duke of somerset8 so today the duke was forced to go to the race while the cabinet was held we have musicmeetings in our town and i was at the rehearsal tother day but i did not value it nor would go to the meeting did i tell you this before  london 14 we came to town this day in two hours and forty minutes twenty miles are nothing here i found a letter from the archbishop of dublin sent me the lord knows how he says some of the bishops will hardly believe that lord treasurer got the queen to remit the firstfruits before the duke of ormond was declared lord lieutenant and that the bishops have written a letter to lord treasurer to thank him he has sent me the address of the convocation ascribing in good part that affair to the duke who had less share in it than md for if it had not been for md i should not have been so good a solicitor i dined today in the city about a little bit of mischief with a printeri found mrs vanhomrigh all in combustion squabbling with her rogue of a landlord she has left her house and gone out of our neighbourhood a good way her eldest daughter is come of age and going to ireland to look after her fortune and get it in her own hands9  15 i dined today with mrs van who goes tonight to her new lodgings i went at six to see lord treasurer but his company was gone contrary to custom and he was busy and i was forced to stay some time before i could see him we were together hardly an hour and he went away being in haste he desired me to dine with him on friday because there would be a friend of his that i must see my lord harley told me when he was gone that it was mrs masham his father meant who is come to town to liein and whom i never saw though her husband is one of our society god send her a good time her death would be a terrible thing10do you know that i have ventured all my credit with these great ministers to clear some misunderstandings betwixt them and if there be no breach i ought to have the merit of it tis a plaguy ticklish piece of work and a man hazards losing both sides it is a pity the world does not know my virtuei thought the clergy in convocation in ireland would have given me thanks for being their solicitor but i hear of no such thing pray talk occasionally on that subject and let me know what you hear do you know the greatness of my spirit that i value their thanks not a rush but at my return shall freely let all people know that it was my lord treasurers action wherein the duke of ormond had no more share than a cat and so they may go whistle and ill go sleep  16 i was this day in the city and dined at pontacks11 with stratford and two other merchants pontack told us although his wine was so good he sold it cheaper than others he took but seven shillings a flask are not these pretty rates the books he sent for from hamburg are come but not yet got out of the customhouse my library will be at least double when i come back i shall go to windsor again on saturday to meet our society who are to sup at mr secretarys but i believe i shall return on monday and then i will answer your letter that lies here safe underneathi see it lie still i will answer you when the ducks have eaten up the dirt  17 i dined today at lord treasurers with mrs masham and she is extremely like one mrs malolly that was once my landlady in trim she was used with mighty kindness and respect like a favourite it signifies nothing going to this lord treasurer about business although it be his own he was in haste and desires i will come again and dine with him tomorrow his famous lying porter is fallen sick and they think he will die i wish i had all my halfcrowns again i believe i have told you he is an old scotch fanatic and the damndest liar in his office alive12 i have a mind to recommend patrick to succeed him i have trained him up pretty well i reckon for certain you are now in town the weather now begins to alter to rain  windsor 18 i dined today with lord treasurer and he would make me go with him to windsor although i was engaged to the secretary to whom i made my excuses we had in the coach besides his son and soninlaw lord harley and lord dupplin who are two of our society and seven of us met by appointment and supped this night with the secretary it was past nine before we got here but a fine moonshiny night i shall go back i believe on monday tis very late  19 the queen did not stir out today she is in a little fit of the gout i dined at mr mashams we had none but our society members six in all and i supped with lord treasurer the queen has ordered twenty thousand pounds to go on with the building at blenheim which has been starved till now since the change of the ministry13 i suppose it is to reward his last action of getting into the french lines14 lord treasurer kept me till past twelve  london 20 it rained terribly every step of our journey today i returned with the secretary after a dinner of cold meat and went to mrs vans where i sat the evening i grow very idle because i have a great deal of business tell me how you passed your time at wexford and are not you glad at heart you have got home safe to your lodgings at st marys pray and so your friends come to visit you and mrs walls is much better of her eye and the dean is just as he used to be and what does walls say of london tis a reasoning coxcomb and goody stoyte and hannah what dye call her no her name ant hannah catherine i mean they were so glad to see the ladies again and mrs manley wanted a companion at ombre  21 i writ today to the archbishop of dublin and enclosed a long politic paper by itself you know the bishops are all angry smoke the waxcandle drop at the bottom of this paper i have let the world know the firstfruits were got by lord treasurer before the duke of ormond was governor i told lord treasurer all this and he is very angry but i pacified him again by telling him they were fools and knew nothing of what passed here but thought all was well enough if they complimented the duke of ormond lord treasurer gave me tother day a letter of thanks he received from the bishops of ireland signed by seventeen and says he will write them an answer the dean of carlisle sat with me today till three and i went to dine with lord treasurer who dined abroad so did the secretary and i was left in the suds twas almost four and i got to sir matthew dudley who had half dined thornhill who killed sir cholmley dering15 was murdered by two men on turnham green last monday night as they stabbed him they bid him remember sir cholmley dering they had quarrelled at hampton court and followed and stabbed him on horseback we have only a grub street paper of it but i believe it is true i went myself through turnham green the same night which was yesterday  22 we have had terrible rains these two or three days i intended to dine at lord treasurers but went to see lady abercorn who is come to town and my lord and i dined with them and visited lord treasurer this evening his porter is mending i sat with my lord about three hours and am come home early to be busy passing by whites chocolatehouse16 my brother masham called me and told me his wife was brought to bed of a boy and both very well our society you must know are

fear of your dearest eyes  theres enough for this side these ministers hinder me pretty dear little naughty saucy md  silly impudent loggerhead presto  23 dilly and i dined today with lord abercorn and had a fine fat haunch of venison that smelt rarely on one side and after dinner dilly won half a crown of me at backgammon at his lodgings to his great content it is a scurvy empty town this melancholy season of the year but i think our weather begins to mend the roads are as deep as in winter the grapes are sad things but the peaches are pretty good and there are some figs i sometimes venture to eat one but always repent it you say nothing of the box sent half a year ago i wish you would pay me for mrs wallss tea your mother is in the country i suppose pray send me the account of md madam dingley as it stands since november19 that is to say for this year excluding the twenty pounds lent stella for wexford for i cannot look in your letters i think i ordered that hawkshaws interest should be paid to you when you think proper i will let parvisol know you have paid that twenty pounds or part of it and so go play with the dean and i will answer your letter tomorrow goodnight sirrahs and love presto and be good girls  24 i dined today with lord treasurer who chid me for not dining with him yesterday for it seems i did not understand his invitation and their club of the ministry dined together and expected me lord radnor20 and i were walking the mall this evening and mr secretary met us and took a turn or two and then stole away and we both believed it was to pick up some wench and tomorrow he will be at the cabinet with the queen so goes the world prior has been out of town these two months nobody knows where and is lately returned people confidently affirm he has been in france and i half believe it it is said he was sent by the ministry and for some overtures towards a peace the secretary pretends he knows nothing of it i believe your parliament will be dissolved i have been talking about the quarrel between your lords and commons with lord treasurer and did at the request of some people desire that the queens answer to the commons address might express a dislike of some principles etc but was answered dubiouslyand so now to your letter fair ladies i know drinking is bad i mean writing is bad in drinking the waters and was angry to see so much in stellas hand but why dingley drinks them i cannot imagine but truly shell drink waters as well as stella why not i hope you now find the benefit of them since you are returned pray let me know particularly i am glad you are forced upon exercise which i believe is as good as the waters for the heart of them tis now past the middle of august so by your reckoning you are in dublin it would vex me to the dogs that letters should miscarry between dublin and wexford after scaping the salt seas i will write no more to that nasty town in haste again i warrant you i have been four sundays together at windsor of which a fortnight together but i believe i shall not go tomorrow for i will not unless the secretary asks me i know all your news about the mayor it makes no noise here at all but the quarrel of your parliament does it is so very extraordinary and the language of the commons so very pretty the examiner has been down this month and was very silly the five or six last papers but there is a pamphlet come out in answer to a letter to the seven lords who examined gregg21 the answer22 is by the real author of the examiner as i believe for it is very well written we had trapps poem on the duke of ormond23 printed here and the printer sold just eleven of them tis a dull piece not half so good as stellas and she is very modest to compare herself with such a poetaster i am heartily sorry for poor mrs parnells24 death she seemed to be an excellent goodnatured young woman and i believe the poor lad is much afflicted they appeared to live perfectly well together dilly is not tired at all with england but intends to continue here a good while he is mighty easy to be at distance from his two sistersinlaw he finds some sort of scrub acquaintance goes now and then in disguise to a play smokes his pipe reads now and then a little trash and what else the lord knows i see him now and then for he calls here and the town being thin i am less pestered with company than usual i have got rid of many of my solicitors by doing nothing for them i have not above eight or nine left and ill be as kind to them did i tell you of a knight who desired me to speak to lord treasurer to give him two thousand pounds or five hundred pounds a year until he could get something better i honestly delivered my message to the treasurer adding the knight was a puppy whom i would not give a groat to save from the gallows cole readings fatherinlaw has been two or three times at me to recommend his lights to the ministry assuring me that a word of mine would etc did not that dog use to speak ill of me and profess to hate me he knows not where i lodge for i told him i lived in the country and i have ordered patrick to deny me constantly to himdid the bishop of london25 die in wexford poor gentleman did he drink the waters were you at his burial was it a great funeral so far from his friends but he was very old we shall all follow and yet it was a pity if god pleased he was a good man not very learned i believe he died but poor did he leave any charity legacies who held up his pall was there a great sight of clergy do they design a tomb for himare you sure it was the bishop of london because there is an elderly gentleman here that we give the same title to or did you fancy all this in your water as others do strange things in their wine they say these waters trouble the head and make people imagine what never came to pass do you make no more of killing a bishop are these your whiggish tricksyes yes i see you are in a fret o faith says you saucy presto ill break your head what cant one report what one hears without being made a jest and a laughingstock are these your english tricks with a murrain and sacheverell will be the next bishop he would be glad of an addition of two hundred pounds a year to what he has and that is more than they will give him for aught i see he hates the new ministry mortally and they hate him and pretend to despise him too they will not allow him to have been the occasion of the late change at least some of them will not but my lord keeper owned it to me the other day no mr addison does not go to ireland this year he pretended he would but he is gone to bath with pastoral philips for his eyesso now i have run over your letter and i think this shall go tomorrow which will be just a fortnight from the last and bring things to the old form again after your rambles to wexford and mine to windsor are there not many literal faults in my letters i never read them over and i fancy there are what do you do then do you guess my meaning or are you acquainted with my manner of mistaking i lost my handkerchief in the mall tonight with lord radnor but i made him walk with me to find it and find it i did not tisdall26 that lodges with me and i have had no conversation nor do we pull off our hats in the streets there is a cousin of his i suppose a young parson that lodges in the house too a handsome genteel fellow dick tighe27 and his wife lodged over against us and he has been seen out of our upper windows beating her two or three times they are both gone to ireland but not together and he solemnly vows never to live with her neighbours do not stick to say that she has a tongue in short i am told she is the most urging provoking devil that ever was born and he a hot whiffling28 puppy very apt to resent ill keep this bottom till tomorrow im sleepy  25 i was with the secretary this morning who was in a mighty hurry and went to windsor in a chariot with lord keeper so i was not invited and am forced to stay at home but not at all against my will for i could have gone and would not i dined in the city with one of my printers for whom i got the gazette and am come home early and have nothing to say to you more but finish this letter and not send it by the bellman days grow short and the weather grows bad and the town is splenetic and things are so oddly contrived that i cannot be absent otherwise i would go for a few days to oxford as i promisedthey say it is certain that prior has been in france29 nobody doubts it i had not time to ask the secretary he was in such haste well i will take my leave of dearest md for a while for i must begin my next letter tonight consider that young women and pray be merry and good girls and love presto there is now but one business the ministry want me for and when that is done i will take my leave of them i never got a penny from them nor expect it in my opinion some things stand very ticklish i dare say nothing at this distance farewell dear sirrahs dearest lives there is peace and quiet with md and nowhere else they have not leisure here to think of small things which may ruin them and i have been forward enough farewell again dearest rogues i am never happy but when i write or think of md i have enough of courts and ministries and wish i were at laracor and if i could with honour come away this moment i would bernage30 came to see me today he is just landed from portugal and come to raise recruits he looks very well and seems pleased with his station and manner of life he never saw london nor england before he is ravished with kent which was his first prospect when he landed farewell again etc etc     letter 29  london aug 25 1711  i have got a pretty small gilt sheet of paper to write to md i have this moment sent my 28th by patrick who tells me he has put it in the postoffice tis directed to your lodgings if it wants more particular direction you must set me right it is now a solar month and two days since the date of your last n18 and i reckon you are now quiet at home and thinking to begin your 19th which will be full of your quarrel between the two houses all which i know already where shall i dine tomorrow can you tell mrs vanhomrigh boards now and cannot invite one and there i used to dine when i was at a loss and all my friends are gone out of town and your town is now at the fullest with your parliament and convocation but let me alone sirrahs for presto is going to be very busy not presto but the other i  26 people have so left the town that i am at a loss for a dinner it is a long time since i have been at london upon a sunday and the ministers are all at windsor it cost me eighteenpence in coachhire before i could find a place to dine in i went to franklands1 and he was abroad and the drab his wife looked out at window and bowed to me without inviting me up so i dined with mr coote2 my lord mountraths brother my lord is with you in ireland this morning at five my lord jersey3 died of the gout in his stomach or apoplexy or both he was abroad yesterday and his death was sudden he was chamberlain to king william and a great favourite turned out by the queen as a tory and stood now fair to be privy seal and by his death will i suppose make that matter easier which has been a very stubborn business at court as i have been informed i never remember so many people of quality to have died in so short a time  27 i went today into the city to thank stratford for my books and dine with him and settle my affairs of my money in the bank and receive a bill for mrs wesley for some things i am to buy for her and the d a one of all these could i do the merchants were all out of town and i was forced to go to a little hedge place for my dinner may my enemies live here in summer and yet i am so unlucky that i cannot possibly be out of the way at this juncture people leave the town so late in summer and return so late in winter that they have almost inverted the seasons it is autumn this good while in st jamess park the limes have been losing their leaves and those remaining on the trees are all parched i hate this season where everything grows worse and worse the only good thing of it is the fruit and that i dare not eat had you any fruit at wexford a few cherries and durst not eat them i do not hear we have yet got a new privy seal the whigs whisper that our new ministry differ among themselves and they begin to talk out mr secretary they have some reasons for their whispers although i thought it was a greater secret i do not much like the posture of things i always apprehended that any falling out would ruin them and so i have told them several times the whigs are mighty full of hopes at present and whatever is the matter all kind of stocks fall i have not yet talked with the secretary about priors journey i should be apt to think it may foretell a peace and that is all we have to preserve us the secretary is not come from windsor but i expect him tomorrow burn all politics  28 we begin to have fine weather and i walked today to chelsea and dined with the dean of carlisle who is laid up with the gout it is now fixed that he is to be dean of christ church in oxford i was advising him to use his interest to prevent any misunderstanding between our ministers but he is too wise to meddle though he fears the thing and the consequences as much as i he will get into his own warm quiet deanery and leave them to themselves and he is in the rightwhen i came home tonight i found a letter from mr lewis who is now at windsor and in it forsooth another which looked like prestos hand and what should it be but a 19th from md o faith i scaped narrowly for i sent my 28th but on saturday and what should i have done if i had two letters to answer at once i did not expect another from wexford that is certain well i must be contented but you are dear saucy girls for all that to write so soon again faith ant you  29 i dined today with lord abercorn and took my leave of them they set out tomorrow for chester and i believe will now fix in ireland they have made a pretty good journey of it his eldest son4 is married to a lady with ten thousand pounds and his second son5 has tother day got a prize in the lottery of four thousand pounds beside two small ones of two hundred pounds each nay the family was so fortunate that my lord bestowing one ticket which is a hundred pounds to one of his servants who had been his page the young fellow got a prize which has made it another hundred i went in the evening to lord treasurer who desires i will dine with him tomorrow when he will show me the answer he designs to return to the letter of thanks from your bishops in ireland the archbishop of dublin desired me to get myself mentioned in the answer which my lord would send but i sent him word i would not open my lips to my lord upon it he says it would convince the bishops of what i have affirmed that the firstfruits were granted before the duke of ormond was declared governor and i writ to him that i would not give a farthing to convince them my lord treasurer began a health to my lord privy seal prior punned and said it was so privy he knew not who it was but i fancy they have fixed it all and we shall know tomorrow but what care you who is privy seal saucy sluttikins  30 when i went out this morning i was surprised with the news that the bishop of bristol is made lord privy seal you know his name is robinson6 and that he was many years envoy in sweden all the friends of the present ministry are extremely glad and the clergy above the rest the whigs will fret to death to see a civil employment given to a clergyman it was a very handsome thing in my lord treasurer and will bind the church to him for ever i dined with him today but he had not written his lettersee above 29th aug but told me he would not offer to send it without showing it to me he thought that would not be just since i was so deeply concerned in the affair we had much company lord rivers mar7 and kinnoull8 mr secretary george granville and masham the last has invited me to the christening of his son tomorrow seennight and on saturday i go to windsor with mr secretary  31 dilly and i walked today to kensington to lady mountjoy who invited us to dinner he returned soon to go to a play it being the last that will be acted for some time he dresses himself like a beau and no doubt makes a fine figure i went to visit some people at kensington ophy butlers wife9 there lies very ill of an ague which is a very common disease here and little known in ireland i am apt to think we shall soon have a peace by the little words i hear thrown out by the ministry i have just thought of a project to bite the town i have told you that it is now known that mr prior has been lately in france i will make a printer of my own sit by me one day and i will dictate to him a formal relation of priors journey10 with several particulars all pure invention and i doubt not but it will take  sept 1 morning i go today to windsor with mr secretary and lord treasurer has promised to bring me back the weather has been fine for some time and i believe we shall have a great deal of dustat night windsor the secretary and i dined today at parsons green at my lord peterborows house who has left it and his gardens to the secretary during his absence it is the finest garden i have ever seen about this town and abundance of hot walls for grapes where they are in great plenty and ripening fast i durst not eat any fruit but one fig but i brought a basket full to my friend lewis here at windsor does stella never eat any what no apricots at donnybrook nothing but claret and ombre i envy people maunching and maunching peaches and grapes and i not daring to eat a bit my head is pretty well only a sudden turn any time makes me giddy for a moment and sometimes it feels very stuffed but if it grows no worse i can bear it very well i take all opportunities of walking and we have a delicious park here just joining to the castle and an avenue in the great park very wide and two miles long set with a double row of elms on each side were you ever at windsor i was once a great while ago but had quite forgotten it  2 the queen has the gout and did not come to chapel nor stir out from her chamber but received the sacrament there as she always does the first sunday in the month yet we had a great court and among others i saw your ingoldsby11 who seeing me talk very familiarly with the keeper treasurer etc came up and saluted me and began a very impertinent discourse about the siege of bouchain i told him i could not answer his questions but i would bring him one that should so i went and fetched sutton who brought over the express about a month ago and delivered him to the general and bid him answer his questions and so i left them together sutton after some time comes back in a rage finds me with lord rivers and masham and there complains of the trick i had played him and swore he had been plagued to death with ingoldsbys talk but he told me ingoldsby asked him what i meant by bringing him so i suppose he smoked me a little so we laughed etc my lord willoughby12 who is one of the chaplains and prebendary of windsor read prayers last night to the family and the bishop of bristol who is dean of windsor officiated last night at the cathedral this they do to be popular and it pleases mightily i dined with mr masham because he lets me have a select company for the court here have got by the end a good thing i said to the secretary some weeks ago he showed me his bill of fare to tempt me to dine with him poh said i i value not your bill of fare give me your bill of company lord treasurer was mightily pleased and told it everybody as a notable thing i reckon upon returning tomorrow they say the bishop will then have the privy seal delivered him at a great council  3 windsor still the council was held so late today that i do not go back to town till tomorrow the bishop was sworn privy councillor and had the privy seal given him and now the patents are passed for those who were this long time to be made lords or earls lord raby13 who is earl of strafford is on thursday to marry a namesake of stellas the daughter of sir h johnson in the city he has threescore thousand pounds with her ready money besides the rest at the fathers death i have got my friend stratford to be one of the directors of the south sea company who were named today my lord treasurer did it for me a month ago and one of those whom i got to be printer of the gazette i am recommending to be printer to the same company he treated mr lewis and me today at dinner i supped last night and this with lord treasurer keeper etc and took occasion to mention the printer i said it was the same printer whom my lord treasurer has appointed to print for the south sea company he denied and i insisted on it and i got the laugh on my side  london 4 i came as far as brentford in lord riverss chariot who had business with lord treasurer then i went into lord treasurers we stopped at kensington where lord treasurer went to see mrs masham who is now what they call in the straw we got to town by three and i lighted at lord treasurers who commanded me not to stir but i was not well and when he went up i begged the young lord to excuse me and so went into the city by water where i could be easier and dined with the printer and dictated to him some part of priors journey to france i walked from the city for i take all occasions of exercise our journey was horridly dusty  5 when i went out today i found it had rained mightily in the night and the streets were as dirty as winter it is very refreshing after ten days dryi went into the city and dined with stratford thanked him for his books gave him joy of his being director of which he had the first notice by a letter from me i ate sturgeon and it lies on my stomach i almost finished priors journey at the printers and came home pretty late with patrick at my heels  7 morning but what shall we do about this letter of mds n19 not a word answered yet and so much paper spent i cannot do anything in it sweethearts till nightat night o lord o lord the greatest disgrace that ever was has happened to presto what do you think but when i was going out this forenoon a letter came from md n20 dated dublin o dear o dear o sad o sadnow i have two letters together to answer here they are lying together but i will only answer the first for i came in late i dined with my friend lewis at his lodgings and walked at six to kensington to mrs mashams sons christening it was very private nobody there but my lord treasurer his son and soninlaw that is to say lord harley and lord dupplin and lord rivers and i the dean of rochester14 christened the child but soon went away lord treasurer and lord rivers were godfathers and mrs hill15 mrs mashams sister godmother the child roared like a bull and i gave mrs masham joy of it and she charged me to take care of my nephew because mr masham being a brother of our society his son you know is consequently a nephew mrs masham sat up dressed in bed but not as they do in ireland with all smooth about her as if she was cut off in the middle for you might see the counterpane what dye call it rise about her hips and body there is another name of the counterpane and you will laugh now sirrahs george granville came in at supper and we stayed till eleven and lord treasurer set me down at my lodging in suffolk street did i ever tell you that lord treasurer hears ill with the left ear just as i do he always turns the right and his servants whisper him at that only i dare not tell him that i am so too for fear he should think i counterfeited to make my court  6 you must read this before the other for i mistook and forgot to write yesterdays journal it was so insignificant i dined with dr cockburn and sat the evening with lord treasurer till ten oclock on thursdays he has always a large select company and expects me so goodnight for last night etc  8 morning i go to windsor with lord treasurer today and will leave this behind me to be sent to the post and now let us hear what says the first letter n19 you are still at wexford as you say madam dingley i think no letter from me ever yet miscarried and so inishcorthy16 and the river slainy fine words those in a ladys mouth your hand like dingleys you scambling17 scattering sluttikin yes mighty like indeed is not it18 pisshh do not talk of writing or reading till your eyes are well and long well only i would have dingley read sometimes to you that you may not lose the desire of it god be thanked that the ugly numbing is gone pray use exercise when you go to town what game is that ombra which dr elwood19 and you play at is it the spanish game ombre your cardpurse you a cardpurse you a fiddlestick you have luck indeed and luck in a bag what a devil is that eightshilling teakettle copper or tin japanned it is like your irish politeness raffling for teakettles what a splutter you keep to convince me that walls has no taste my head continues pretty well why do you write dear sirrah stella when you find your eyes so weak that you cannot see what comfort is there in reading what you write when one knows that so dingley cannot write because of the clutter of new company come to wexford i suppose the noise of their hundred horses disturbs you or do you lie in one gallery as in an hospital what you are afraid of losing in dublin the acquaintance you have got in wexford and chiefly the bishop of raphoe20 an old doting perverse coxcomb twenty at a time at breakfast that is like five pounds at a time when it was never but once i doubt madam dingley you are apt to lie in your travels though not so bad as stella she tells thumpers as i shall prove in my next if i find this receives encouragementso dr elwood says there are a world of pretty things in my works a pox on his praises an enemy here would say more the duke of buckingham would say as much though he and i are terribly fallen out and the great men are perpetually inflaming me against him they bring me all he says of me and i believe make it worse out of rogueryno tis not your pen is bewitched madam stella but your old scrawling splayfoot pothooks s s21 ay thats it there the s s s there there thats exact farewell etc  our fine weather is gone and i doubt we shall have a rainy journey today faith tis shavingday and i have much to do when stella says her pen was bewitched it was only because there was a hair in it you know the fellow they call godhelpit had the same thoughts of his wife and for the same reason i think this is very well observed and i unfolded the letter to tell you it  cut off those two notes above and see the nine pounds indorsed and receive the other and send me word how my accounts stand that they may be adjusted by nov 122 pray be very particular but the twenty pounds i lend you is not to be included so make no blunder i wont wrong you nor you shant wrong me that is the short o lord how stout presto is of late but he loves md more than his life a thousand times for all his stoutness tell them that and that ill swear it as hope saved ten millions of times etc etc  i open my letter once more to tell stella that if she does not use exercise after her waters it will lose all the effects of them i should not live if i did not take all opportunities of walking pray pray do this to oblige poor presto     letter 30  windsor sept 8 1711  i made the coachman stop and put in my twentyninth at the postoffice at two oclock today as i was going to lord treasurer with whom i dined and came here by a quarterpast eight but the moon shone and so we were not in much danger of overturning which however he values not a straw and only laughs when i chide at him for it there was nobody but he and i and we supped together with mr masham and dr arbuthnot the queens favourite physician a scotchman i could not keep myself awake after supper but did all i was able to disguise it and thought i came off clear but at parting he told me i had got my nap already it is now one oclock but he loves sitting up late  9 the queen is still in the gout but recovering she saw company in her bedchamber after church but the crowd was so great i could not see her i dined with my brother sir william wyndham1 and some others of our society to avoid the great tables on sunday at windsor which i hate the usual company supped tonight at lord treasurers which was lord keeper mr secretary george granville masham arbuthnot and i but showers have hindered me from walking today and that i do not lovenoble fruit and i dare not eat a bit i ate one fig today and sometimes a few mulberries because it is said they are wholesome and you know a good name does much i shall return to town tomorrow though i thought to have stayed a week to be at leisure for something i am doing but i have put it off till next for i shall come here again on saturday when our society are to meet at supper at mr secretarys my life is very regular here on sunday morning i constantly visit lord keeper and sup at lord treasurers with the same set of company i was not sleepy tonight i resolved i would not yet it is past midnight at this present writing  london 10 lord treasurer and masham and i left windsor at three this afternoon we dropped masham at kensington with his lady and got home by six it was seven before we sat down to dinner and i stayed till past eleven patrick came home with the secretary i am more plagued with patrick and my portmantua than with myself i forgot to tell you that when i went to windsor on saturday i overtook lady giffard and mrs fenton2 in a chariot going i suppose to sheen i was then in a chariot too of lord treasurers brother who had business with the treasurer and my lord came after and overtook me at turnham green four miles from london and then the brother went back and i went in the coach with lord treasurer so it happened that those people saw me and not with lord treasurer mrs f was to see me about a week ago and desired i would get her son into the charterhouse  11 this morning the printer sent me an account of priors journey3 it makes a twopenny pamphlet i suppose you will see it for i dare engage it will run tis a formal grave lie from the beginning to the end i writ all but about the last page that i dictated and the printer writ mr secretary sent to me to dine where he did it was at priors when i came in prior showed me the pamphlet seemed to be angry and said here is our english liberty i read some of it and said i liked it mightily and envied the rogue the thought for had it come into my head i should have certainly done it myself we stayed at priors till past ten and then the secretary received a packet with the news of bouchain being taken for which the guns will go off tomorrow prior owned his having been in france for it was past denying it seems he was discovered by a rascal at dover who had positive orders to let him pass i believe we shall have a peace  12 it is terrible rainy weather and has cost me three shillings in coaches and chairs today yet i was dirty into the bargain i was three hours this morning with the secretary about some business of moment and then went into the city to dine the printer tells me he sold yesterday a thousand of priors journey and had printed five hundred more it will do rarely i believe and is a pure bite and what is md doing all this while got again to their cards their walls their deans their stoytes and their claret pray present my service to mr stoyte and catherine tell goody stoyte she owes me a world of dinners and i will shortly come over and demand themdid i tell you of the archbishop of dublins last letter he had been saying in several of his former that he would shortly write to me something about myself and it looked as if he intended something for me at last out it comes and consists of two parts first he advises me to strike in for some preferment now i have friends and secondly he advises me since i have parts and learning and a happy pen to think of some new subject in divinity not handled by others which i should manage better than anybody a rare spark this with a pox but i shall answer him as rarely methinks he should have invited me over and given me some hopes or promises but hang him and so goodnight etc  13 it rained most furiously all this morning till about twelve and sometimes thundered i trembled for my shillings but it cleared up and i made a shift to get a walk in the park and then went with the secretary to dine with lord treasurer upon thursdays there is always a select company we had the duke of shrewsbury lord rivers the two secretaries mr granville and mr prior half of them went to council at six but rivers granville prior and i stayed till eight prior was often affecting to be angry at the account of his journey to paris and indeed the two last pages which the printer got somebody to add4 are so romantic they spoil all the rest dilly ashe pretended to me that he was only going to oxford and cambridge for a fortnight and then would come back i could not see him as i appointed tother day but some of his friends tell me he took leave of them as going to ireland and so they say at his lodging i believe the rogue was ashamed to tell me so because i advised him to stay the winter and he said he would i find he had got into a good set of scrub acquaintance and i thought passed his time very merrily but i suppose he languished after balderig and the claret of dublin and after all i think he is in the right for he can eat drink and converse better there than here bernage was with me this morning he calls now and then he is in terrible fear of a peace he said he never had his health so well as in portugal he is a favourite of his colonel  14 i was mortified enough today not knowing where in the world to dine the town is so empty i met h coote5 and thought he would invite me but he did not sir john stanley did not come into my head so i took up with mrs van and dined with her and her damned landlady who i believe by her eyebrows is a bawd this evening i met addison and pastoral philips in the park and supped with them at addisons lodgings we were very good company and i yet know no man half so agreeable to me as he is i sat with them till twelve so you may think it is late young women however i would have some little conversation with md before your presto goes to bed because it makes me sleep and dream and so forth faith this letter goes on slowly enough sirrahs but i cannot write much at a time till you are quite settled after your journey you know and have gone all your visits and lost your money at ombre you never play at chess now stella that puts me in mind of dick tighe i fancy i told you he used to beat his wife here and she deserved it and he resolves to part with her and they went to ireland in different coaches o lord i said all this before i am sure go to bed sirrahs  windsor 15 i made the secretary stop at brentford because we set out at two this afternoon and fasting would not agree with me i only designed to eat a bit of breadandbutter but he would light and we ate roast beef like dragons and he made me treat him and two more gentlemen faith it cost me a guinea i do not like such jesting yet i was mightily pleased with it too tonight our society met at the secretarys there were nine of us and we have chosen a new member the earl of jersey6 whose father died lately tis past one and i have stolen away  16 i design to stay here this week by myself about some business that lies on my hands and will take up a great deal of time dr adams7 one of the canons invited me today to dinner the tables are so full here on sunday that it is hard to dine with a few and dr adams knows i love to do so which is very obliging the queen saw company in her bedchamber she looks very well but she sat down i supped with lord treasurer as usual and stayed till past one as usual and with our usual company except lord keeper who did not come this time to windsor i hate these suppers mortally but i seldom eat anything  17 lord treasurer and mr secretary stay here till tomorrow some business keeps them and i am sorry for it for they hinder me a day mr lewis and i were going to dine soberly with a little court friend at one but lord harley and lord dupplin kept me by force and said we should dine at lord treasurers who intended to go at four to london i stayed like a fool and went with the two young lords to lord treasurer who very fairly turned us all three out of doors they both were invited to the duke of somerset but he was gone to a horserace and would not come till five so we were forced to go to a tavern and sent for wine from lord treasurers who at last we were told did not go to town till the morrow and at lord treasurers we supped again and i desired him to let me add four shillings to the bill i gave him we sat up till two yet i must write to little md  18 they are all gone early this morning and i am alone to seek my fortune but dr arbuthnot engages me for my dinners and he yesterday gave me my choice of place person and victuals for today so i chose to dine with mrs hill who is one of the dressers and mrs mashams sister no company but us three and to have a shoulder of mutton a small one which was exactly only there was too much victuals besides and the doctors wife8 was of the company and tomorrow mrs hill and i are to dine with the doctor i have seen a fellow often about court whom i thought i knew i asked who he was and they told me it was the gentleman porter then i called him to mind he was killys acquaintance i wont say yours i think his name is lovet9 or lovel or something like it i believe he does not know me and in my present posture i shall not be fond of renewing old acquaintance i believe i used to see him with the bradleys and by the way i have not seen mrs bradley since i came to england i left your letter in london like a fool and cannot answer it till i go back which will not be until monday next so this will be above a fortnight from my last but i will fetch it up in my next so go and walk to the deans for your health this fine weather  19 the queen designs to have cards and dancing here next week which makes us think she will stay here longer than we believed mrs masham is not well after her lyingin i doubt she got some cold she is lame in one of her legs with a rheumatic pain dr arbuthnot and mrs hill go tomorrow to kensington to see her and return the same night mrs hill and i dined with the doctor today i rode out this morning with the doctor to see cranburn a house of lord ranelaghs10 and the duchess of marlboroughs lodge and the park the finest places they are for nature and plantations that ever i saw and the finest riding upon artificial roads made on purpose for the queen arbuthnot made me draw up a sham subscription for a book called a history of the maids of honour since harry the eighth showing they make the best wives with a list of all the maids of honour since etc to pay a crown in hand and the other crown upon delivery of the book and all in common forms of those things we got a gentleman to write it fair because my hand is known and we sent it to the maids of honour when they came to supper if they bite at it it will be a very good court jest and the queen will certainly have it we did not tell mrs hill  20 today i was invited to the green cloth by colonel godfrey who married the duke of marlboroughs sister11 mother to the duke of berwick by king james i must tell you those things that happened before you were born but i made my excuses and young harcourt lord keepers son and i dined with my next neighbour dr adams12 mrs masham is better and will be here in three or four days she had need for the duchess of somerset is thought to gain ground dailywe have not sent you over all your bills and i think we have altered your moneybill the duke of ormond is censured here by those in power for very wrong management in the affair of the mayoralty13 he is governed by fools and has usually much more sense than his advisers but never proceeds by it i must know how your health continues after wexford walk and use exercise sirrahs both and get somebody to play at shuttlecock with you madam stella and walk to the deans and donnybrook  21 colonel godfrey sent to me again today so i dined at the green cloth and we had but eleven at dinner which is a small number there the court being always thin of company till saturday nightthis new ink and pen make a strange figure i must write larger yes i must or stella will not be able to read this14 s s s there is your ss for you stella the maids of honour are bit and have all contributed their crowns and are teasing others to subscribe for the book i will tell lord keeper and lord treasurer tomorrow and i believe the queen will have it after a little walk this evening i squandered away the rest of it in sitting at lewiss lodging while he and dr arbuthnot played at picquet i have that foolish pleasure which i believe nobody has beside me except old lady berkeley15 but i fretted when i came away i will loiter so no more for i have a plaguy deal of business upon my hands and very little time to do it the pamphleteers begin to be very busy against the ministry i have begged mr secretary to make examples of one or two of them and he assures me he will they are very bold and abusive  22 this being the day the ministry come to windsor i ate a bit or two at mr lewiss lodgings because i must sup with lord treasurer and at half an hour after one i led mr lewis a walk up the avenue which is two miles long we walked in all about five miles but i was so tired with his slow walking that i left him here and walked two miles towards london hoping to meet lord treasurer and return with him but it grew darkish and i was forced to walk back so i walked nine miles in all and lord treasurer did not come till after eight which is very wrong for there was no moon and i often tell him how ill he does to expose himself so but he only makes a jest of it i supped with him and stayed till now when it is half an hour after two he is as merry and careless and disengaged as a young heir at oneandtwenty tis late indeed  23 the secretary did not come last night but at three this afternoon i have not seen him yet but i verily think they are contriving a peace as fast as they can without which it will be impossible to subsist the queen was at church today but was carried in a chair i and mr lewis dined privately with mr lowman16 clerk of the kitchen i was to see lord keeper this morning and told him the jest of the maids of honour and lord treasurer had it last night that rogue arbuthnot puts it all upon me the court was very full today i expected lord treasurer would have invited me to supper but he only bowed to me and we had no discourse in the drawingroom it is now seven at night and i am at home and i hope lord treasurer will not send for me to supper if he does not i will reproach him and he will pretend to chide me for not comingso farewell till i go to bed for i am going to be busyit is now past ten and i went down to ask the servants about mr secretary they tell me the queen is yet at council and that she went to supper and came out to the council afterwards it is certain they are managing a peace i will go to bed and there is an endit is now eleven and a messenger is come from lord treasurer to sup with them but i have excused myself and am glad i am in bed for else i should sit up till two and drink till i was hot now ill go sleep  london 24 i came to town by six with lord treasurer and have stayed till ten that of the queens going out to sup and coming in again is a lie as the secretary told me this morning but i find the ministry are very busy with mr prior and i believe he will go again to france i am told so much that we shall certainly have a peace very soon i had charming weather all last week at windsor but we have had a little rain today and yesterday was windy priors journey sells still they have sold two thousand although the town is empty i found a letter from mrs fenton here desiring me in lady giffards name to come and pass a week at sheen while she is at moor park i will answer it with a vengeance and now you talk of answering there is mds n20 is yet to be answered i had put it up so safe i could hardly find it but here it is faith and i am afraid i cannot send this till thursday for i must see the secretary tomorrow morning and be in some other place in the evening  25 stella writes like an emperor and gives such an account of her journey never saw the like let me see stand away let us compute you stayed four days at inishcorthy two nights at mrs probys mothers and yet was but six days in journey for your words are we left wexford this day seennight and came here last night i have heard them say that travellers may lie by authority make up this if you can how far is it from wexford to dublin how many miles did you travel in a day17 let me seethirty pounds in two months is nine score pounds a year a matter of nothing in stellas purse i dreamed billy swift was alive and that i told him you writ me word he was dead and that you had been at his funeral and i admired at your impudence and was in mighty haste to run and let you know what lying rogues you were poor lad he is dead of his mothers former folly and fondness and yet now i believe as you say that her grief will soon wear offo yes madam dingley mightily tired of the company no doubt of it at wexford and your description of it is excellent clean sheets but bare walls i suppose then you lay upon the wallsmrs walls has got her tea but who pays me the money come i shall never get it so i make a present of it to stop some gaps etc wheres the thanks of the house so thats well why it cost fourandthirty shillings englishyou must adjust that with mrs walls i think that is so many pence more with youno leigh and sterne i suppose were not at the waterside i fear sternes business will not be done i have not seen him this good while i hate him for the management of that box and i was the greatest fool in nature for trusting to such a young jackanapes i will speak to him once more about it when i see him mr addison and i met once more since and i supped with him i believe i told you so somewhere in this letter the archbishop chose an admirable messenger in walls to send to me yet i think him fitter for a messenger than anythingthe d she has i did not observe her looks will she rot out of modesty with lady giffard i pity poor jenny18but her husband is a dunce and with respect to him she loses little by her deafness i believe madam stella in your accounts you mistook one liquor for another and it was an hundred and forty quarts of wine and thirtytwo of waterthis is all written in the morning before i go to the secretary as i am now doing i have answered your letter a little shorter than ordinary but i have a mind it should go today and i will give you my journal at night in my next for im so afraid of another letter before this goes i will never have two together again unansweredwhat care i for dr tisdall and dr raymond or how many children they have i wish they had a hundred apiecelord treasurer promises me to answer the bishops letter tomorrow and show it me and i believe it will confirm all i said and mortify those that threw the merit on the duke of ormond for i have made him jealous of it and tother day talking of the matter he said i am your witness you got it for them before the duke was lord lieutenant my humble service to mrs walls mrs stoyte and catherine farewell etc  what do you do when you see any literal mistakes in my letters how do you set them right for i never read them over to correct them farewell again  pray send this note to mrs brent to get the money when parvisol comes to town or she can send to him     letter 31  london sept 25 1711  i dined in the city today and at my return i put my 30th into the postoffice and when i got home i found for me one of the noblest letters i ever read it was from  three sides and a half in folio on a large sheet of paper the two first pages made up of satire upon london and crowds and hurry stolen from some of his own schoolboys exercises the side and a half remaining is spent in desiring me to recommend mrs south your commissioners widow1 to my lord treasurer for a pension he is the prettiest discreetest fellow that ever my eyes beheld or that ever dipped pen into ink i know not what to say to him a pox on him i have too many such customers on this side already i think i will send him word that i never saw my lord treasurer in my life i am sure i industriously avoided the name of any great person when i saw him for fear of his reporting it in ireland and this recommendation must be a secret too for fear the duke of bolton2 should know it and think it was too mean i never read so dd a letter in my life a little would make me send it over to youi must send you a pattern the first place i cast my eyes on i will not pick and choose in this place meaning the exchange in london which is the compendium of old troynovant as that is of the whole busy world i got such a surfeit that i grew sick of mankind and resolved for ever after to bury myself in the shady retreat of  you must know that london has been called by some troynovant or new troy will you have any more yes one little bit for stella because shell be fond of it this wondrous theatre meaning london was no more to me than a desert and i should less complain of solitude in a connaught shipwreck or even the great bog of allen a little scrap for mrs marget3 and then i have done their royal fanum wherein the idol pecunia is daily worshipped seemed to me to be just like a hive of bees working and labouring under huge weights of cares fanum is a temple but he means the exchange and pecunia is money so now mrs marget will understand her part one more paragraph and i well come dont be in such a rage you shall have no more pray stella be satisfied tis very pretty and that i must be acquainted with such a dog as thisour peace goes on fast prior was with the secretary two hours this morning i was there a little after he went away and was told it i believe he will soon be despatched again to france and i will put somebody to write an account of his second journey i hope you have seen the other this latter has taken up my time with storming at it  26 bernage has been with me these two days yesterday i sent for him to let him know that dr arbuthnot is putting in strongly to have his brother made a captain over bernages4 head arbuthnots brother is but an ensign but the doctor has great power with the queen yet he told me he would not do anything hard to a gentleman who is my friend and i have engaged the secretary and his colonel5 for him today he told me very melancholy that the other had written from windsor where he went to solicit that he has got the company and bernage is full of the spleen i made the secretary write yesterday a letter to the colonel in bernages behalf i hope it will do yet and i have written to dr arbuthnot to windsor not to insist on doing such a hardship i dined in the city at pontacks with stratford it cost me seven shillings he would have treated but i did not let him i have removed my money from the bank to another fund i desire parvisol may speak to hawkshaw to pay in my money when he can for i will put it in the funds and in the meantime borrow so much of mr secretary who offers to lend it me go to the deans sirrahs  27 bernage was with me again today and is in great fear and so was i but this afternoon at lord treasurers where i dined my brother george granville secretary at war after keeping me a while in suspense told me that dr arbuthnot had waived the business because he would not wrong a friend of mine that his brother is to be a lieutenant and bernage is made a captain i called at his lodging and the soldiers coffeehouse to put him out of pain but cannot find him so i have left word and shall see him tomorrow morning i suppose bernage is now easy he has ten shillings a day beside lawful cheating however he gives a private sum to his colonel but it is very cheap his colonel loves him well but is surprised to see him have so many friends so he is now quite off my hands i left the company early tonight at lord treasurers but the secretary followed me to desire i would go with him to w mr lewiss man came in before i could finish that word beginning with a w which ought to be windsor and brought me a very handsome rallying letter from dr arbuthnot to tell me he had in compliance to me given up his brothers pretensions in favour of bernage this very morning that the queen had spoken to mr granville to make the company easy in the others having the captainship whether they have done it to oblige me or no i must own it so he says he this very morning begged her majesty to give mr bernage the company i am mighty well pleased to have succeeded so well but you will think me tedious although you like the man as i think  windsor 28 i came here a day sooner than ordinary at mr secretarys desire and supped with him and prior and two private ministers from france and a french priest6 i know not the two ministers names but they are come about the peace the names the secretary called them i suppose were feigned they were good rational men we have already settled all things with france and very much to the honour and advantage of england and the queen is in mighty good humour all this news is a mighty secret the people in general know that a peace is forwarding the earl of strafford7 is to go soon to holland and let them know what we have been doing and then there will be the devil and all to pay but well make them swallow it with a pox the french ministers stayed with us till one and the secretary and i sat up talking till two so you will own tis late sirrahs and time for your little saucy presto to go to bed and sleep adazy and god bless poor little md i hope they are now fast asleep and dreaming of presto  29 lord treasurer came tonight as usual at half an hour after eight as dark as pitch i am weary of chiding him so i commended him for observing his friends advice and coming so early etc i was two hours with lady oglethorpe8 tonight and then supped with lord treasurer after dining at the green cloth i stayed till two this is the effect of lord treasurers being here i must sup with him and he keeps cursed hours lord keeper and the secretary were absent they cannot sit up with him this long sitting up makes the periods in my letters so short i design to stay here all the next week to be at leisure by myself to finish something of weight i have upon my hands and which must soon be done i shall then think of returning to ireland if these people will let me and i know nothing else they have for me to do i gave dr arbuthnot my thanks for his kindness to bernage whose commission is now signed methinks i long to know something of stellas health how it continues after wexford waters  30 the queen was not at chapel today and all for the better for we had a dunce to preach she has a little of the gout i dined with my brother masham and a moderate company and would not go to lord treasurers till after supper at eleven oclock and pretended i had mistaken the hour so i ate nothing and a little after twelve the company broke up the keeper and secretary refusing to stay so i saved this nights debauch prior went away yesterday with his frenchmen and a thousand reports are raised in this town some said they knew one to be the abbe de polignac others swore it was the abbe du bois the whigs are in a rage about the peace but well wherret9 them i warrant boys go go go to the deans and dont mind politics young women they are not good after the waters they are stark naught they strike up into the head go get two black aces and fish for a manilio  oct 1 sir john walter10 an honest drunken fellow is now in waiting and invited me to the green cloth today that he might not be behindhand with colonel godfrey who is a whig i was engaged to the mayors feast with mr masham but waiting to take leave of lord treasurer i came too late and so returned sneaking to the green cloth and did not see my lord treasurer neither but was resolved not to lose two dinners for him i took leave today of my friend and solicitor lord rivers who is commanded by the queen to set out for hanover on thursday the secretary does not go to town till tomorrow he and i and two friends more drank a sober bottle of wine here at home and parted at twelve he goes by seven tomorrow morning so i shall not see him i have power over his cellar in his absence and make little use of it lord dartmouth and my friend lewis stay here this week but i can never work out a dinner from dartmouth masham has promised to provide for me i squired his lady out of her chaise today and must visit her in a day or two so you have had a long fit of the finest weather in the world but i am every day in pain that it will go off i have done no business today i am very idle  2 my friend lewis and i to avoid over much eating and great tables dined with honest jemmy eckershall11 clerk of the kitchen now in waiting and i bespoke my dinner but the cur had your acquaintance lovet the gentleman porter to be our company lovet towards the end of dinner after twenty wrigglings said he had the honour to see me formerly at moor park and thought he remembered my face i said i thought i remembered him and was glad to see him etc and i escaped for that much for he was very pert it has rained all this day and i doubt our good weather is gone i have been very idle this afternoon playing at twelvepenny picquet with lewis i won seven shillings which is the only money i won this year i have not played above four times and i think always at windsor cards are very dear there is a duty on them of sixpence a pack which spoils small gamesters  3 mr masham sent this morning to desire i would ride out with him the weather growing again very fine i was very busy and sent my excuses but desired he would provide me a dinner i dined with him his lady and her sister mrs hill who invites us tomorrow to dine with her and we are to ride out in the morning i sat with lady oglethorpe till eight this evening then was going home to write looked about for the woman that keeps the key of the house she told me patrick had it i cooled my heels in the cloisters till nine then went in to the musicmeeting where i had been often desired to go but was weary in half an hour of their fine stuff and stole out so privately that everybody saw me and cooled my heels in the cloisters again till after ten then came in patrick i went up shut the chamber door and gave him two or three swinging cuffs on the ear and i have strained the thumb of my left hand with pulling him which i did not feel until he was gone he was plaguily afraid and humbled  4 it was the finest day in the world and we got out before eleven a noble caravan of us the duchess of shrewsbury in her own chaise with one horse and miss touchet12 with her mrs masham and mrs scarborow one of the dressers in one of the queens chaises miss forester and miss scarborow13 two maids of honour and mrs hill on horseback the duke of shrewsbury mr masham george fielding14 arbuthnot and i on horseback too mrs hills horse was hired for miss scarborow but she took it in civility her own horse was galled and could not be rid but kicked and winced the hired horse was not worth eighteenpence i borrowed coat boots and horse and in short we had all the difficulties and more than we used to have in making a party from trim to longfields15 my coat was light camlet faced with red velvet and silver buttons we rode in the great park and the forest about a dozen miles and the duchess and i had much conversation we got home by two and mr masham his lady arbuthnot and i dined with mrs hill arbuthnot made us all melancholy by some symptoms of bloody ue he expects a cruel fit of the stone in twelve hours he says he is never mistaken and he appears like a man that was to be racked tomorrow i cannot but hope it will not be so bad he is a perfectly honest man and one i have much obligation to it rained a little this afternoon and grew fair again lady oglethorpe sent to speak to me and it was to let me know that lady rochester16 desires she and i may be better acquainted tis a little too late for i am not now in love with lady rochester they shame me out of her because she is old arbuthnot says he hopes my strained thumb is not the gout for he has often found people so mistaken i do not remember the particular thing that gave it me only i had it just after beating patrick and now it is better so i believe he is mistaken  5 the duchess of shrewsbury sent to invite me to dinner but i was abroad last night when her servant came and this morning i sent my excuses because i was engaged which i was sorry for mrs forester taxed me yesterday about the history of the maids of honour17 but i told her fairly it was no jest of mine for i found they did not relish it altogether well and i have enough already of a quarrel with that brute sir john walter who has been railing at me in all companies ever since i dined with him that i abused the queens meat and drink and said nothing at the table was good and all a dd lie for after dinner commending the wine i said i thought it was something small you would wonder how all my friends laugh at this quarrel it will be such a jest for the keeper treasurer and secretaryi dined with honest colonel godfrey took a good walk of an hour on the terrace and then came up to study but it grows bloody cold and i have no waistcoat here  6 i never dined with the chaplains till today but my friend gastrell and the dean of rochester18 had often invited me and i happened to be disengaged it is the worst provided table at court we ate on pewter every chaplain when he is made a dean gives a piece of plate and so they have got a little some of it very old one who was made dean of peterborough a small deanery said he would give no plate he was only dean of pewterborough the news of mr hills miscarriage in his expedition19 came today and i went to visit mrs masham and mrs hill his two sisters to condole with them i advised them by all means to go to the musicmeeting tonight to show they were not cast down etc and they thought my advice was right and went i doubt mr hill and his admiral made wrong steps however we lay it all to a storm etc i sat with the secretary at supper then we both went to lord treasurers supper and sat till twelve the secretary is much mortified about hill because this expedition was of his contriving and he counted much upon it but lord treasurer was just as merry as usual and old laughing at sir john walter and me falling out i said nothing grieved me but that they would take example and perhaps presume upon it and get out of my government but that i thought i was not obliged to govern bears though i governed men they promise to be as obedient as ever and so we laughed and so i go to bed for it is colder still and you have a fire now and are at cards at home  7 lord harley and i dined privately today with mrs masham and mrs hill and my brother masham i saw lord halifax at court and we joined and talked and the duchess of shrewsbury came up and reproached me for not dining with her i said that was not so soon done for i expected more advances from ladies especially duchesses she promised to comply with any demands i pleased and i agreed to dine with her tomorrow if i did not go to london too soon as i believe i shall before dinner lady oglethorpe brought me and the duchess of hamilton20 together today in the drawingroom and i have given her some encouragement but not much everybody has been teasing walter he told lord treasurer that he took his company from him that were to dine with him my lord said i will send you dr swift lord keeper bid him take care what he did for said he dr swift is not only all our favourite but our governor the old company supped with lord treasurer and got away by twelve  london 8 i believe i shall go no more to windsor for we expect the queen will come in ten days to hampton court it was frost last night and cruel cold today i could not dine with the duchess for i left windsor half an hour after one with lord treasurer and we called at kensington where mrs masham was got to see her children for two days i dined or rather supped with lord treasurer and stayed till after ten tisdall21 and his family are gone from hence upon some wrangle with the family yesterday i had two letters brought

who talks  10 it cost me two shillings in coachhire to dine in the city with a printer i have sent and caused to be sent three pamphlets out in a fortnight i will ply the rogues warm and whenever anything of theirs makes a noise it shall have an answer i have instructed an under spurleather to write so that it is taken for mine a rogue that writes a newspaper called the protestant postboy has reflected on me in one of his papers but the secretary has taken him up and he shall have a squeeze extraordinary he says that an ambitious tantivy2 missing of his towering hopes of preferment in ireland is come over to vent his spleen on the late ministry etc ill tantivy him with a vengeance i sat the evening at home and am very busy and can hardly find time to write unless it were to md i am in furious haste  11 i dined today with lord treasurer thursdays are now his days when his choice company comes but we are too much multiplied george granville sent his excuses upon being ill i hear he apprehends the apoplexy which would grieve me much lord treasurer calls prior nothing but monsieur baudrier which was the feigned name of the frenchman that writ his journey to paris3 they pretend to suspect me so i talk freely of it and put them out of their play lord treasurer calls me now dr martin because martin4 is a sort of a swallow and so is a swift when he and i came last monday from windsor we were reading all the signs on the road5 he is a pure trifler tell the bishop of clogher so i made him make two lines in verse for the bell and dragon and they were rare bad ones i suppose dilly is with you by this time what could his reason be of leaving london and not owning it twas plaguy silly i believe his natural inconstancy made him weary i think he is the king of inconstancy i stayed with lord treasurer till ten we had five lords and three commoners go to ombre sirrahs  12 mrs vanhomrigh has changed her lodging as well as i she found she had got with a bawd and removed i dined with her today for though she boards her landlady does not dine with her i am grown a mighty lover of herrings but they are much smaller here than with you in the afternoon i visited an old majorgeneral and ate six oysters then sat an hour with mrs colledge6 the joiners daughter that was hanged it was the joiner was hanged and not his daughter with thompsons wife a magistrate there was the famous mrs floyd of chester who i think is the handsomest woman except md that ever i saw she told me that twenty people had sent her the verses upon biddy7 as meant to her and indeed in point of handsomeness she deserves them much better i will not go to windsor tomorrow and so i told the secretary today i hate the thoughts of saturday and sunday suppers with lord treasurer jack hill is come home from his unfortunate expedition and is i think now at windsor i have not yet seen him he is privately blamed by his own friends for want of conduct he called a council of war and therein it was determined to come back but they say a general should not do that because the officers will always give their opinion for returning since the blame will not lie upon them but the general i pity him heartily bernage received his commission today  13 i dined today with colonel crowe8 late governor of barbadoes he is a great acquaintance of your friend sterne to whom i trusted the box lord treasurer has refused sternes business and i doubt he is a rake jemmy leigh stays for him and nobody knows where to find him i am so busy now i have hardly time to spare to write to our little md but in a fortnight i hope it will be over i am going now to be busy etc  14 i was going to dine with dr cockburn but sir andrew fountaine met me and carried me to mrs vans where i drank the last bottle of raymonds wine admirable good better than any i get among the ministry i must pick up time to answer this letter of mds ill do it in a day or two for certaini am glad i am not at windsor for it is very cold and i wont have a fire till november i am contriving how to stop up my grate with bricks patrick was drunk last night but did not come to me else i should have given him tother cuff i sat this evening with mrs barton it is the first day of her seeing company but i made her merry enough and we were three hours disputing upon whig and tory she grieved for her brother only for form and he was a sad dog is stella well enough to go to church pray no numbings left no darkness in your eyes do you walk and exercise your exercise is ombrepeople are coming up to town the queen will be at hampton court in a week lady betty germaine i hear is come and lord pembroke is coming his wife9 is as big with child as she can tumble  15 i sat at home till four this afternoon today writing and ate a roll and butter then visited will congreve an hour or two and supped with lord treasurer who came from windsor today and brought prior with him the queen has thanked prior for his good service in france and promised to make him a commissioner of the customs several of that commission are to be out among the rest my friend sir matthew dudley i can do nothing for him he is so hated by the ministry lord treasurer kept me till twelve so i need not tell you it is now late  16 i dined today with mr secretary at dr coatesworths10 where he now lodges till his house be got ready in golden square one boyer11 a french dog has abused me in a pamphlet and i have got him up in a messengers hands the secretary promises me to swinge him lord treasurer told me last night that he had the honour to be abused with me in a pamphlet i must make that rogue an example for warning to others i was to see jack hill this morning who made that unfortunate expedition and there is still more misfortune for that ship which was admiral of his fleet12 is blown up in the thames by an accident and carelessness of some rogue who was going as they think to steal some gunpowder five hundred men are lost we dont yet know the particulars i am got home by seven and am going to be busy and you are going to play and supper you live ten times happier than i but i should live ten times happier than you if i were with md i saw jemmy leigh today in the street who tells me that sterne has not lain above once these three weeks in his lodgings and he doubts he takes ill courses he stays only till he can find sterne to go along with him and he cannot hear of him i begged him to inquire about the box when he comes to chester which he promises  17 the secretary and i dined today with brigadier britton13 a great friend of his the lady of the house is very gallant about thirtyfive she is said to have a great deal of wit but i see nothing among any of them that equals md by a bars length as hope saved my lord treasurer is much out of order he has a sore throat and the gravel and a pain in his breast where the wound was pray god preserve him the queen comes to hampton court on tuesday next people are coming fast to town and i must answer mds letter which i can hardly find time to do though i am at home the greatest part of the day lady betty germaine and i were disputing whig and tory to death this morning she is grown very fat and looks mighty well biddy floyd was there and she is i think very much spoiled with the smallpox  18 lord treasurer is still out of order and that breaks our method of dining there today he is often subject to a sore throat and some time or other it will kill him unless he takes more care than he is apt to do it was said about the town that poor lord peterborow was dead at frankfort but he is something better and the queen is sending him to italy where i hope the warm climate will recover him he has abundance of excellent qualities and we love one another mightily i was this afternoon in the city ate a bit of meat and settled some things with a printer i will answer your letter on saturday if possible and then send away this so to fetch up the odd days i lost at windsor and keep constant to my fortnight ombre time is now coming on and we shall have nothing but manley and walls and stoytes and the dean have you got no new acquaintance poor girls nobody knows mds good qualitiestis very cold but i will not have a fire till november thats pozzwell but coming home tonight i found on my table a letter from md faith i was angry that is with myself and i was afraid too to see mds hand so soon for fear of something i dont know what at last i opened it and it was over well and a bill for the two hundred guineas however tis a sad thing that this letter is not gone nor your twentyfirst answered yet  19 i was invited today to dine with mrs van with some company who did not come but i ate nothing but herrings you must know i hardly ever eat of above one thing and that the plainest ordinary meat at table i love it best and believe it wholesomest you love rarities yes you do i wish you had all that i ever see where i go i was coming home early and met the secretary in his chair who persuaded me to go with him to brittons for he said he had been all day at business and had eaten nothing so i went and the time passed so that we stayed till two so you may believe tis late enough  20 this day has gone all wrong by sitting up so late last night lord treasurer is not yet well and cant go to windsor i dined with sir matthew dudley and took occasion to hint to him that he would lose his employment for which i am very sorry lord pembroke and his family are all come to town i was kept so long at a friends this evening that i cannot send this tonight when i knocked at my lodgings a fellow asked me where lodged dr swift i told him i was the person he gave me a letter he brought from the secretarys office and i gave him a shilling when i came up i saw dingleys hand faith i was afraid i do not know what at last it was a formal letter from dingley about her exchequer business well ill do it on monday and settle it with tooke and now boys for your letter i mean the first n21 lets see come out little letter i never had the letter from the bishop that raymond mentions but i have written to ned southwell to desire the duke of ormond to speak to his reverence that he may leave off his impertinence what a pox can they think i am doing for the archbishop here you have a pretty notion of me in ireland to make me an agent for the archbishop of dublinwhy do you think i value your peoples ingratitude about my part in serving them i remit them their firstfruits of ingratitude as freely as i got the other remitted to them the lord treasurer defers writing his letter to them or else they would be plaguily confounded by this time for he designs to give the merit of it wholly to the queen and me and to let them know it was done before the duke of ormond was lord lieutenant you visit you dine abroad you see friends you pilgarlick14 you walk from finglas you a cats foot o lordlady gore15 hung her child by the waist what is that waist16 i dont understand that word he must hang on till you explain or spell iti dont believe he was pretty thats a liiiipish burn your firstfruits again at it stella has made twenty false spellings in her writing ill send them to you all back again on the other side of this letter to mend them i wont miss one why i think there were seventeen bishops names to the letter lord oxford receivedi will send you some pamphlets by leigh put me in mind of it on monday for i shall go then to the printer yes and the miscellany i am mightily obliged to walls but i dont deserve it by any usage of him here having seen him but twice and once en passant mrs manley forsworn ombre what and no blazing star appear no monsters born no whale thrown up have you not found out some evasion for her she had no such regard to oaths in her younger days i got the books for nothing madam dingley but the wine i got not it was but a promiseyes my head is pretty well in the main only now and then a little threatening or soyou talk of my reconciling some great folks i tell you what the secretary told me last night that he had found the reason why the queen was cold to him for some months past that a friend had told it him yesterday and it was that they suspected he was at the bottom with the duke of marlborough then he said he had reflected upon all i had spoken to him long ago but he thought it had only been my suspicion and my zeal and kindness for him i said i had reason to take that very ill to imagine i knew so little of the world as to talk at a venture to a great minister that i had gone between him and lord treasurer often and told each of them what i had said to the other and that i had informed him so before he said all that you may imagine to excuse himself and approve my conduct i told him i knew all along that this proceeding of mine was the surest way to send me back to my willows in ireland but that i regarded it not provided i could do the kingdom service in keeping them well together i minded him how often i had told lord treasurer lord keeper and him together that all things depended on their union and that my comfort was to see them love one another and i had told them all singly that i had not said this by chance etc he was in a rage to be thus suspected swears he will be upon a better foot or none at all and i do not see how they can well want him in this juncture i hope to find a way of settling this matter i act an honest part that will bring me neither honour nor praise md must think the better of me for it nobody else shall ever know of it heres politics enough for once but madam dd gave me occasion for it i think i told you i have got into lodgings that dont smell illo lord the spectacles well ill do that on monday too although it goes against me to be employed for folks that neither you nor i care a groat for is the eight pounds from hawkshaw included in the thirtynine pounds five shillings and twopence how do i know by this how my account stands cant you write five or six lines to cast it up mine is fortyfour pounds per annum and eight pounds from hawkshaw makes fiftytwo pounds pray set it right and let me know you had bestand so now i have answered n21 and tis late and i will answer n22 in my next this cannot go tonight but shall on tuesday and so go to your play and lose your money with your two eggs a penny silly jade you witty very pretty  21 mrs van would have me dine with her again today and so i did though lady mountjoy has sent two or three times to have me see and dine with her and she is a little body i love very well my head has ached a little in the evenings these three or four days but it is not of the giddy sort so i do not much value it i was to see lord harley today but lord treasurer took physic and i could not see him he has voided much gravel and is better but not well he talks of going on tuesday to see the queen at hampton court i wish he may be able i never saw so fine a summer day as this was how is it with you pray and cant you remember naughty packs i hant seen lord pembroke yet he will be sorry to miss dilly i wonder you say nothing of dillys being got to ireland if he be not there soon i shall have some certain odd thoughts guess them if you can  22 i dined in the city today with dr freind at one of my printers i inquired for leigh but could not find him i have forgot what sort of apron you want i must rout among your letters a needle in a bottle of hay i gave sterne directions but where to find him lord knows i have bespoken the spectacles got a set of examiners and five pamphlets which i have either written or contributed to except the best which is the vindication of the duke of marlborough and is entirely of the author of the atalantis17 i have settled dingleys affair with tooke who has undertaken it and understands it i have bespoken a miscellany what would you have me do more it cost me a shilling coming home it rains terribly and did so in the morning lord treasurer has had an ill day in much pain he writes and does business in his chamber now he is ill the man is bewitched he desires to see me and ill maul him but he will not value it a rush i am half weary of them all i often burst out into these thoughts and will certainly steal away as soon as i decently can i have many friends and many enemies and the last are more constant in their nature i have no shuddering at all to think of retiring to my old circumstances if you can be easy but i will always live in ireland as i did the last time i will not hunt for dinners there nor converse with more than a very few  23 morning this goes today and shall be sealed by and by lord treasurer takes physic again today i believe i shall dine with lord dupplin mr tooke brought me a letter directed for me at morphews the bookseller i suppose by the postage it came from ireland it is a womans hand and seems false spelt on purpose it is in such sort of verse as harriss petition18 rallies me for writing merry things and not upon divinity and is like the subject of the archbishops last letter as i told you can you guess whom it came from it is not ill written pray find it out there is a latin verse at the end of it all rightly spelt yet the english as i think affectedly wrong in many places my plaguing time is coming a young fellow brought me a letter from judge coote19 with recommendation to be lieutenant of a manofwar he is the son of one echlin20 who was minister of belfast before tisdall and i have got some other new customers but i shall trouble my friends as little as possible saucy stella used to jeer me for meddling with other folks affairs but now i am punished for itpatrick has brought the candle and i have no more room farewell etc etc  here is a full and true account of stellas new spelling21  plaguely plaguily dineing dining straingers strangers chais chase waist wast houer hour immagin imagine a bout about intellegence intelligence merrit merit aboundance abundance secreet secret phamphlets pamphlets bussiness business  tell me truly sirrah how many of these are mistakes of the pen and how many are you to answer for as real ill spelling there are but fourteen i said twenty by guess you must not be angry for i will have you spell right let the world go how it will though after all there is but a mistake of one letter in any of these words i allow you henceforth but six false spellings in every letter you send me     letter 33  london oct 23 1711  i dined with lord dupplin as i told you i would and put my thirtysecond into the postoffice my own self and i believe there has not been one moment since we parted wherein a letter was not upon the road going or coming to or from pmd if the queen knew it she would give us a pension for it is we bring good luck to their postboys and their packets else they would break their necks and sink but an old saying and a true one       be it snow or storm or hail      pmds letters never fail      cross winds may sometimes make them tarry      but pmds letters cant miscarry  terrible rain today but it cleared up at night enough to save my twelvepence coming home lord treasurer is much better this evening i hate to have him ill he is so confoundedly careless i wont answer your letter yet so be satisfied  24 i called at lord treasurers today at noon he was eating some broth in his bedchamber undressed with a thousand papers about him he has a little fever upon him and his eye terribly bloodshot yet he dressed himself and went out to the treasury he told me he had a letter from a lady with a complaint against me it was from mrs cutts a sister of lord cutts who writ to him that i had abused her brother1 you remember the salamander it is printed in the miscellany i told my lord that i would never regard complaints and that i expected whenever he received any against me he would immediately put them into the fire and forget them else i should have no quiet i had a little turn in my head this morning which though it did not last above a moment yet being of the true sort has made me as weak as a dog all this day tis the first i have had this halfyear i shall take my pills if i hear of it again i dined at lady mountjoys with harry coote2 and went to see lord pembroke upon his coming to townthe whig party are furious against a peace and every day some ballad comes out reflecting on the ministry on that account the secretary st john has seized on a dozen booksellers and publishers into his messengers hands3 some of the foreign ministers have published the preliminaries agreed on here between france and england and people rail at them as insufficient to treat a peace upon but the secret is that the french have agreed to articles much more important which our ministers have not communicated and the people who think they know all are discontented that there is no more this was an inconvenience i foretold to the secretary but we could contrive no way to fence against it so theres politics for you  25 the queen is at hampton court she went on tuesday in that terrible rain i dined with lewis at his lodgings to despatch some business we had i sent this morning and evening to lord treasurer and he is much worse by going out i am in pain about evening he has sent for dr radcliffe pray god preserve him the chancellor of the exchequer4 showed me today a ballad5 in manuscript against lord treasurer and his south sea project it is very sharply written if it be not printed i will send it you if it be it shall go in your packet of pamphletsi found out your letter about directions for the apron and have ordered to be bought a cheap green silk work apron i have it by heart i sat this evening with mrs barton who is my near neighbour it was a delicious day and i got my walk and was thinking whether md was walking too just at that time that presto was this paper does not cost me a farthing i have it from the secretarys office i long till tomorrow to know how my lord treasurer sleeps this night and to hear he mends we are all undone without him so pray for him sirrahs and dont stay too late at the deans  26 i dined with mrs van for the weather is so bad and i am so busy that i cant dine with great folks and besides i dare eat but little to keep my head in order which is better lord treasurer is very ill but i hope in no danger we have no quiet with the whigs they are so violent against a peace but ill cool them with a vengeance very soon i have not heard from the bishop of clogher whether he has got his statues6 i writ to him six weeks ago hes so busy with his parliament i wont answer your letter yet say what you will saucy girls  27 i forgot to go about some business this morning which cost me double the time and i was forced to be at the secretarys office till four and lose my dinner so i went to mrs vans and made them get me three herrings which i am very fond of and they are a light victuals besides i was to have supped at lady ashburnhams but the drab did not call for us in her coach as she promised but sent for us and so i sent my excuses it has been a terrible rainy day but so flattering in the morning that i would needs go out in my new hat i met leigh and sterne as i was going into the park leigh says he will go to ireland in ten days if he can get sterne to go with him so i will send him the things for md and i have desired him to inquire about the box i hate that sterne for his carelessness about it but it was my fault  29 i was all this terrible rainy day with my friend lewis upon business of importance and i dined with him and came home about seven and thought i would amuse myself a little after the pains i had taken i saw a volume of congreves plays in my room that patrick had taken to read and i looked into it and in mere loitering read in it till twelve like an owl and a fool if ever i do so again never saw the like count gallas7 the emperors envoy you will hear is in disgrace with us the queen has ordered her ministers to have no more commerce with him the reason is the fool writ a rude letter to lord dartmouth secretary of state complaining of our proceedings about a peace and he is always in close confidence with lord wharton and sunderland and others of the late ministry i believe you begin to think there will be no peace the whigs here are sure it cannot be and stocks are fallen again but i am confident there will unless france plays us tricks and you may venture a wager with any of your whig acquaintance that we shall not have another campaign you will get more by it than by ombre sirrahi let slip telling you yesterdays journal which i thought to have done this morning but blundered i dined yesterday at harry cootes with lord hatton8 mr finch a son of lord nottingham and sir andrew fountaine i left them soon but hear they stayed till two in the morning and were all drunk and so goodnight for last night and goodnight for tonight you blundering goosecap ant you ashamed to blunder to young ladies i shall have a fire in three or four days now oh ho  30 i was today in the city concerting some things with a printer and am to be tomorrow all day busy with mr secretary about the same i wont tell you now but the ministers reckon it will do abundance of good and open the eyes of the nation who are half bewitched against a peace few of this generation can remember anything but war and taxes and they think it is as it should be whereas tis certain we are the most undone people in europe as i am afraid i shall make appear beyond all contradiction but i forgot i wont tell you what i will do nor what i will not do so let me alone and go to stoyte and give goody stoyte and catherine my humble service i love goody stoyte better than goody walls wholl pay me for this green apron i will have the money it cost ten shillings and sixpence i think it plaguy dear for a cheap thing but they said that english silk would cockle9 and i know not what you have the making into the bargain tis right italian i have sent it and the pamphlets to leigh and will send the miscellanies and spectacles in a day or two i would send more but faith im plaguy poor at present  31 the devils in this secretary when i went this morning he had people with him but says he we are to dine with prior today and then will do all our business in the afternoon at two prior sends word he is otherwise engaged then the secretary and i go and dine with brigadier britton sit till eight grow merry no business done he is in haste to see lady jersey10 we part and appoint no time to meet again this is the fault of all the present ministers teasing me to death for my assistance laying the whole weight of their affairs upon it yet slipping opportunities lord treasurer mends every day though slowly i hope he will take care of himself pray will you send to parvisol to send me a bill of twenty pounds as soon as he can for i want money i must have money i will have money sirrahs  nov 1 i went today into the city to settle some business with stratford and to dine with him but he was engaged and i was so angry i would not dine with any other merchant but went to my printer and ate a bit and did business of mischief with him and i shall have the spectacles and miscellany tomorrow and leave them with leigh a fine day always makes me go into the city if i can spare time because it is exercise and that does me more good than anything i have heard nothing since of my head but a little i dont know how sometimes but i am very temperate especially now the treasurer is ill and the ministers often at hampton court and the secretary not yet fixed in his house and i hate dining with many of my old acquaintance here has been a fellow discovered going out of the east india house with sixteen thousand pounds in money and bills he would have escaped if he had not been so uneasy with thirst that he stole out before his time and was caught but what is that to md i wish we had the money provided the east india company was never the worse you know we must not covet etc our weather for this fortnight past is chequered a fair and a rainy day this was very fine and i have walked four miles wish md would do so lazy sluttikins  2 it has rained all day with a continuendo and i went in a chair to dine with mrs van always there in a very rainy day but i made a shift to come back afoot i live a very retired life pay very few visits and keep but very little company i read no newspapers i am sorry i sent you the examiner for the printer is going to print them in a small volume it seems the author is too proud to have them printed by subscription though his friends offered they say to make it worth five hundred pounds to him the spectators are likewise printing in a larger and a smaller volume so i believe they are going to leave them off and indeed people grow weary of them though they are often prettily written we have had no news for me to send you now towards the end of my letter the queen has the gout a little i hoped the lord treasurer would have had it too but radcliffe told me yesterday it was the rheumatism in his knee and foot however he mends and i hope will be abroad in a short time i am told they design giving away several employments before the parliament sits which will be the thirteenth instant i either do not like or not understand this policy and if lord treasurer does not mend soon they must give them just before the session but he is the greatest procrastinator in the world  3 a fine day this and i walked a pretty deal i stuffed the secretarys pockets with papers which he must read and settle at hampton court where he went today and stays some time they have no lodgings for me there so i cant go for the town is small chargeable and inconvenient lord treasurer had a very ill night last night with much pain in his knee and foot but is easier todayand so i went to visit prior about some business and so he was not within and so sir andrew fountaine made me dine today again with mrs van and i came home soon remembering this must go tonight and that i had a letter of mds to answer o lord where is it let me see so so here it is you grudge writing so soon pox on that bill the woman would have me manage that money for her i do not know what to do with it now i have it i am like the unprofitable steward in the gospel i laid it up in a napkin there thou hast what is thine own etc well well i know of your new mayor ill tell you a pun a fishmonger owed a man two crowns so he sent him a piece of bad ling and a tench and then said he was paid how is that now find it out for i wont tell it you which of you finds it out well but as i was saying what care i for your mayor i fancy ford may tell forbes right about my returning to ireland before christmas or soon after im sorry you did not go on with your story about pray god you be john i never heard it in my life and wonder what it can beah stella faith you leaned upon your bible to think what to say when you writ that yes that story of the secretarys making me an example is true never heard it before why how could you hear it is it possible to tell you the hundredth part of what passes in our companies here the secretary is as easy with me as mr addison was i have often thought what a splutter sir william temple makes about being secretary of state11 i think mr st john the greatest young man i ever knew wit capacity beauty quickness of apprehension good learning and an excellent taste the best orator in the house of commons admirable conversation good nature and good manners generous and a despiser of money his only fault is talking to his friends in way of complaint of too great a load of business which looks a little like affectation and he endeavours too much to mix the fine gentleman and man of pleasure with the man of business what truth and sincerity he may have i know not he is now but thirtytwo and has been secretary above a year is not all this extraordinary how he stands with the queen and lord treasurer i have told you before this is his character and i believe you will be diverted by knowing it i writ to the archbishop of dublin bishop of cloyne12 and of clogher together five weeks ago from windsor i hope they had my letters pray know if clogher had hisfig for your physician and his advice madam dingley if i grow worse i will otherwise i will trust to temperance and exercise your fall of the leaf what care i when the leaves fall i am sorry to see them fall with all my heart but why should i take physic because leaves fall off from trees that wont hinder them from falling if a man falls from a horse must i take physic for thatthis arguing makes you mad but it is true right reason not to be disprovedi am glad at heart to hear poor stella is better use exercise and walk spend pattens and spare potions wear out clogs and waste claret have you found out my pun of the fishmonger dont read a word more till you have got it and stella is handsome again you say and is she fat i have sent to leigh the set of examiners the first thirteen were written by several hands some good some bad the next threeandthirty were all by one hand that makes fortysix then that author13 whoever he was laid it down on purpose to confound guessers and the last six were written by a woman14 then there is an account of guiscard by the same woman but the facts sent by presto then an answer to the letter to the lords about gregg by presto priors journey by presto vindication of the duke of marlborough entirely by the same woman comment on hares sermon by the same woman only hints sent to the printer from presto to give her15 then theres the miscellany an apron for stella a pound of chocolate without sugar for stella a fine snuffrasp of ivory given me by mrs st john for dingley and a large roll of tobacco which she must hide or cut shorter out of modesty and four pair of spectacles for the lord knows who theres the cargo i hope it will come safe oh mrs masham and i are very well we write to one another but it is upon business i believe i told you so before pray pardon my forgetfulness in these cases poor presto cant help it md shall have the money as soon as tooke gets it and so i think i have answered all and the paper is out and now i have fetched up my week and will send you another this day fortnightwhy you rogues two crowns make tenchillling16 you are so dull you could never have found it out farewell etc etc     letter 34  london nov 3 1711  my thirtythird lies now before me just finished and i am going to seal and send it so let me know whether you would have me add anything i gave you my journal of this day and it is now nine at night and i am going to be busy for an hour or two  4 i left a friends house today where i was invited just when dinner was setting on and pretended i was engaged because i saw some fellows i did not know and went to sir matthew dudleys where i had the same inconvenience but he would not let me go otherwise i would have gone home and sent for a slice of mutton and a pot of ale rather than dine with persons unknown as bad for aught i know as your deans parsons and curates bad slabby weather todaynow methinks i write at ease when i have no letter of mds to answer but i mistook and have got the large paper the queen is laid up with the gout at hampton court she is now seldom without it any long time together i fear it will wear her out in a very few years i plainly find i have less twitchings about my toes since these ministers are sick and out of town and that i dont dine with them i would compound for a light easy gout to be perfectly well in my headpray walk when the frost comes young ladies go a frostbiting it comes into my head that from the very time you first went to ireland i have been always plying you to walk and read the young fellows here have begun a kind of fashion to walk and many of them have got swingeing strong shoes on purpose it has got as far as several young lords if it hold it would be a very good thing lady lucy1 and i are fallen out she rails at me and i have left visiting her  5 md was very troublesome to me last night in my sleep i was a dreamed methought that stella was here i asked her after dingley and she said she had left her in ireland because she designed her stay to be short and such stuffmonsieur pontchartain the secretary of state in france and monsieur fontenelle the secretary of the royal academy there who writ the dialogues des morts etc have sent letters to lord pembroke that the academy have with the kings consent chosen him one of their members in the room of one who is lately dead but the cautious gentleman has given me the letters to show my lord dartmouth and mr st john our two secretaries and let them see there is no treason in them which i will do on wednesday when they come from hampton court the letters are very handsome and it is a very great mark of honour and distinction to lord pembroke i hear the two french ministers are come over again about the peace but i have seen nobody of consequence to know the truth i dined today with a lady of my acquaintance who was sick in her bedchamber upon three herrings and a chicken the dinner was my bespeaking we begin now to have chestnuts and seville oranges have you the latter yet twas a terrible windy day and we had processions in carts of the pope and the devil and the butchers rang their cleavers you know this is the fifth of november popery and gunpowder  6 since i am used to this way of writing i fancy i could hardly make out a long letter to md without it i think i ought to allow for every line taken up by telling you where i dined but that will not be above seven lines in all half a line to a dinner your ingoldsby2 is going over and they say here he is to be made a lordhere was i staying in my room till two this afternoon for that puppy sir andrew fountaine who was to go with me into the city and never came and if i had not shot a dinner flying with one mr murray i might have fasted or gone to an alehouseyou never said one word of goody stoyte in your letter but i suppose these winter nights we shall hear more of her does the provost3 laugh as much as he used to do we reckon him here a goodfornothing fellowi design to write to your dean one of these days but i can never find time nor what to sayi will think of something but if dd4 were not in ireland i believe seriously i should not think of the place twice a year nothing there ever makes the subject of talk in any company where i am  7 i went today to the city on business but stopped at a printers and stayed there it was a most delicious day i hear the parliament is to be prorogued for a fortnight longer i suppose either because the queen has the gout or that lord treasurer is not well or that they would do something more towards a peace i called at lord treasurers at noon and sat a while with lord harley but his father was asleep a bookseller has reprinted or newtitled a sermon of tom swifts5 printed last year and publishes an advertisement calling it dr swifts sermon some friend of lord galway6 has by his directions published a fourshilling book about his conduct in spain to defend him i have but just seen it but what care you for books except prestos miscellanies leigh promised to call and see me but has not yet i hope he will take care of his cargo and get your chester box a murrain take that box everything is spoiled that is in it how does the strong box do you say nothing of raymond is his wife brought to bed again or how has he finished his house paid his debts and put out the rest of the money to use i am glad to hear poor joe is like to get his two hundred pounds i suppose trim is now reduced to slavery again i am glad of it the people were as great rascals as the gentlemen but i must go to bed sirrahs the secretary is still at hampton court with my papers or is come only tonight they plague me with attending them  8 i was with the secretary this morning and we dined with prior and did business this afternoon till about eight and i must alter and undo and a clutter i am glad the parliament is prorogued i stayed with prior till eleven the secretary left us at eight prior i believe will be one of those employed to make the peace when a congress is opened lord ashburnham told today at the coffeehouse that lord harley7 was yesterday morning married to the duke of newcastles daughter the great heiress and it got about all the town but i saw lord harley yesterday at noon in his nightgown and he dined in the city with prior and others so it is not true but i hope it will be so for i know it has been privately managing this long time8 the lady will not have half her fathers estate for the duke left lord pelhams son his heir9 the widow duchess will not stand to the will and she is now at law with pelham however at worst the girl will have about ten thousand pounds a year to support the honour for lord treasurer will never save a groat for himself lord harley is a very valuable young gentleman and they say the girl is handsome and has good sense but red hair  9 i designed a jaunt into the city today to be merry but was disappointed so one always is in this life and i could not see lord dartmouth today with whom i had some business business and pleasure both disappointed you can go to your dean and for want of him goody stoyte or walls or manley and meet everywhere with cards and claret i dined privately with a friend on a herring and chicken and half a flask of bad florence i begin to have fires now when the mornings are cold i have got some loose bricks at the back of my grate for good husbandry fine weather patrick tells me my caps are wearing out i know not how to get others i want a necessary woman strangely i am as helpless as an elephanti had three packets from the archbishop of dublin cost me four shillings all about higgins10 printed stuff and two long letters his people forgot to enclose them to lewis and they were only directed to doctor swift without naming london or anything else i wonder how they reached me unless the postmaster directed them i have read all the trash and am weary  10 why if you must have it out something is to be published of great moment11 and three or four great people are to see there are no mistakes in point of fact and tis so troublesome to send it among them and get their corrections that i am weary as a dog i dined today with the printer and was there all the afternoon and it plagues me and theres an end and what would you have lady dupplin lord treasurers daughter12 is brought to bed of a son lord treasurer has had an ugly return of his gravel tis good for us to live in gravel pits13 but not for gravel pits to live in us a man in this case should leave no stone unturned lord treasurers sickness the queens gout the forwarding the peace occasion putting off the parliament a fortnight longer my head has had no ill returns i had good walking today in the city and take all opportunities of it on purpose for my health but i cant walk in the park because that is only for walkings sake and loses time so i mix it with business i wish md walked half as much as presto if i was with you id make you walk i would walk behind or before you and you should have masks on and be tucked up like anything and stella is naturally a stout walker and carries herself firm methinks i see her strut and step clever over a kennel and dingley would do well enough if her petticoats were pinned up but she is so embroiled and so fearful and then stella scolds and dingley stumbles and is so daggled14 have you got the whalebone petticoats among you yet i hate them a woman here may hide a moderate gallant under them pshaw whats all this im saying methinks i am talking to md face to face  11 did i tell you that old frowde15 the old fool is selling his estate at pepperhara and is skulking about the town nobody knows where and who do you think manages all this for him but that rogue child16 the double squire of farnham i have put mrs masham the queens favourite upon buying it but that is yet a great secret and i have employed lady oglethorpe to inquire about it i was with lady oglethorpe today who is come to town for a week or two and tomorrow i will see to hunt out the old fool he is utterly ruined and at this present in some blind alley with some dirty wench he has two sons that must starve and he never gives them a farthing if mrs masham buys the land i will desire her to get the queen to give some pension to the old fool to keep him from absolutely starving what do you meddle with other peoples affairs for says stella oh but mr masham and his wife are very urgent with me since i first put them in the head of it i dined with sir matthew dudley who i doubt will soon lose his employment  12 morning i am going to hunt out old frowde and to do some business in the city i have not yet called to patrick to know whether it be fairit has been past dropping these two days rainy weather hurts my pate and my purse he tells me tis very windy and begins to look dark woe be to my shillings an old saying and a true       few fillings      many shillings  if the day be dark my purse will be light       to my enemies be this curse      a dark day and a light purse  and so ill rise and go to my fire for patrick tells me i have a fire yet it is not shavingday nor is the weather cold this is too extravagant what is become of dilly i suppose you have him with you stella is just now showing a white leg and putting it into the slipper present my service to her and tell her i am engaged to the dean and desire she will come too or dingley cant you write a note this is stellas morning dialogue no morning speech i meanmorrow sirrahs and let me rise as well as you but i promise you walls cant dine with the dean today for she is to be at mrs probys just after dinner and to go with gracy spencer17 to the shops to buy a yard of muslin and a silver lace for an under petticoat morrow again sirrahsat night i dined with stratford in the city but could not finish my affairs with him but now i am resolved to buy five hundred pounds south sea stock which will cost me three hundred and eighty ready money and i will make use of the bill of a hundred pounds you sent me and transfer mrs walls over to hawkshaw or if she dislikes it i will borrow a hundred pounds of the secretary and repay her three shillings coachhire today i have spoken to frowdes brother to get me the lowest price of the estate to tell mrs masham  13 i dined privately with a friend today in the neighbourhood last saturday night i came home and the drab had just washed my room and my bedchamber was all wet and i was forced to go to bed in my own defence and no fire i was sick on sunday and now have got a swingeing cold i scolded like a dog at patrick although he was out with me i detest washing of rooms cant they wash them in a morning and make a fire and leave open the windows i slept not a wink last night for hawking18 and spitting and now everybody has colds heres a clutter ill go to bed and sleep if i can  14 lady mountjoy sent to me two days ago so i dined with her today and in the evening went to see lord treasurer i found patrick had been just there with a how dye19 and my lord had returned answer that he desired to see me mrs masham was with him when i came and they are never disturbed tis well she is not very handsome they sit alone together settling the nation i sat with lady oxford and stopped mrs masham as she came out and told her what progress i had made etc and then went to lord treasurer he is very well only uneasy at rising or sitting with some rheumatic pain in his thigh and a foot weak he showed me a small paper sent by an unknown hand to one mr cook who sent it to my lord it was written in plain large letters thus       though gds knife did not succeed       a fns yet may do the deed  and a little below burn this you dog my lord has frequently such letters as these once he showed me one which was a vision describing a certain man his dress his sword and his countenance who was to murder my lord and he told me he saw a fellow in the chapel at windsor with a dress very like it they often send him letters signed your humble servant the devil and such stuff i sat with him till after ten and have business to do  15 the secretary came yesterday to town from hampton court so i went to him early this morning but he went back last night again and coming home tonight i found a letter from him to tell me that he was just come from hampton court and just returning and will not be here till saturday night a pox take him he stops all my business ill beg leave to come back when i have got over this and hope to see md in ireland soon after christmasim weary of courts and want my journeys to laracor they did me more good than all the ministries these twenty years i dined today in the city but did no business as i designed lady mountjoy tells me that dilly is got to ireland and that the archbishop of dublin was the cause of his returning so soon the parliament was prorogued two days ago for a fortnight which with the queens absence makes the town very dull and empty they tell me the duke of ormond brings all the world away with him from ireland london has nothing so bad in it in winter as your knots of irish folks but i go to no coffeehouse and so i seldom see them this letter shall go on saturday and then i am even with the world again i have lent money and cannot get it and am forced to borrow for myself  16 my man made a blunder this morning and let up a visitor when i had ordered to see nobody so i was forced to hurry a hangdog instrument of mine into my bedchamber and keep him cooling his heels there above an houri am going on fairly in the common forms of a great cold i believe it will last me about ten days in alli should have told you that in those two verses sent to lord treasurer gd stands for guiscard that is easy but we differed about fn i thought it was for frenchman because he hates them and they him and so it would be that although guiscards knife missed its design the knife of a frenchman might yet do it my lord thinks it stands for felton the name of him that stabbed the first duke of buckingham sir andrew fountaine and i dined with the vans today and my cold made me loiter all the evening stay young women dont you begin to owe me a letter just a month today since i had your n22 ill stay a week longer and then ill expect like agog till then you may play at ombre and so forth as you please the whigs are still crying down our peace but we will have it i hope in spite of them the emperor comes now with his two eggs a penny and promises wonders to continue the war but it is too late only i hope the fear of it will serve to spur on the french to be easy and sincere night sirrahs ill go early to bed  17 morning this goes tonight i will put it myself in the postoffice i had just now a long letter from the archbishop of dublin giving me an account of the ending your session how it ended in a storm which storm by the time it arrives here will be only half nature i cant help it i wont hide i often advised the dissolution of that parliament although i did not think the scoundrels had so much courage but they have it only in the wrong like a bully that will fight for a whore and run away in an army i believe by several things the archbishop says he is not very well either with the government or clergysee how luckily my paper ends with a fortnightgod almighty bless and preserve dearest little mdi suppose your lord lieutenant is now setting out for england i wonder the bishop of clogher does not write to me or let me know of his statues and how he likes them i will write to him again as soon as i have leisure farewell dearest md and love presto who loves md infinitely above all earthly things and who willmy service to mrs stoyte and catherine im sitting in my bed but will rise to seal this morrow dear rogues farewell again dearest md etc     letter 35  london nov 17 1711  i put my last this evening in the postoffice i dined with dr cockburn this being queen elizabeths birthday we have the d and all to do among us i just heard of the stir as my letter was sealed this morning and was so cross i would not open it to tell you i have been visiting lady oglethorpe1 and lady worsley2 the latter is lately come to town for the winter and with child and what care you this is queen elizabeths birthday usually kept in this town by apprentices etc but the whigs designed a mighty procession by midnight and had laid out a thousand pounds to dress up the pope devil cardinals sacheverell etc and carry them with torches about and burn them they did it by contribution garth gave five guineas dr garth i mean if ever you heard of him but they were seized last night by order from the secretary you will have an account of it for they bawl it about the streets already3 they had some very foolish and mischievous designs and it was thought they would have put the rabble upon assaulting my lord treasurers house and the secretarys and other violences the militia was raised to prevent it and now i suppose all will be quiet the figures are now at the secretarys office at whitehall i design to see them if i can  18 i was this morning with mr secretary who just came from hampton court he was telling me more particulars about this business of burning the pope it cost a great deal of money and had it gone on would have cost three times as much but the town is full of it and half a dozen grub street papers already the secretary and i dined at brigadier brittons but i left them at six upon an appointment with some sober company of men and ladies to drink punch at sir andrew fountaines we were not very merry and i dont love rack punch i love it better with brandy are you of my opinion why then twelvepenny weather sirrahs why dont you play at shuttlecock i have thought of it a hundred times faith presto will come over after christmas and will play with stella before the cold weather is gone do you read the spectators i never do they never come in my way i go to no coffeehouses they say abundance of them are very pretty they are going to be printed in small volumes ill bring them over with me i shall be out of my hurry in a week and if leigh be not gone over i will send you by him what i am now finishing i dont know where leigh is i have not seen him this good while though he promised to call i shall send to him the queen comes to town on thursday for good and all  19 i was this morning at lord dartmouths office and sent out for him from the committee of council about some business i was asking him more concerning this bustle about the figures in waxwork of the pope and devil etc he was not at leisure or he would have seen them i hear the owners are so impudent that they design to replevin them by law i am assured that the figure of the devil is made as like lord treasurer as they could why i dined with a friend in st jamess street lord treasurer i am told was abroad today i will know tomorrow how he does after it the duke of marlborough is come and was yesterday at hampton court with the queen no it was tother day no it was yesterday for today i remember mr secretary was going to see him when i was there not at the duke of marlboroughs but at the secretarys the duke is not so fond of me what care i i won seven shillings tonight at picquet i play twice a year or so  20 i have been so teased with whiggish discourse by mrs barton and lady betty germaine never saw the like they turn all this affair of the popeburning into ridicule and indeed they have made too great a clutter about it if they had no real reason to apprehend some tumults i dined with lady betty i hear priors commission is passed to be ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary for the peace my lord privy seal who you know is bishop of bristol is the other and lord strafford already ambassador at the hague the third i am forced to tell you ignorant sluts who is who i was punning scurvily with sir andrew fountaine and lord pembroke this evening do you ever pun now sometimes with the dean or tom leigh4 prior puns very well odso i must go see his excellency tis a noble advancement but they could do no less after sending him to france lord strafford is as proud as hell and how he will bear one of priors mean birth on an equal character with him i know not and so i go to my business and bid you goodnight  21 i was this morning busy with my printer i gave him the fifth sheet5 and then i went and dined with him in the city to correct something and alter etc and i walked home in the dusk and the rain overtook me and i found a letter here from mr lewis well and so i opened it and he says the peace is past danger etc well and so there was another letter enclosed in his well and so i looked on the outside of this tother letter well and so who do you think this tother letter was from well and so ill tell you it was from little md n23 23 23 23 i tell you it is no more i have told you so before but i just looked again to satisfy you hie stella you write like an emperor a great deal together a very good hand and but four false spellings in all shall i send them to you i am glad you did not take my correction ill well but i wont answer your letter now sirrah saucyboxes no no not yet just a month and three days from the last which is just five weeks you see it comes just when i begin to grumble  22 morning tooke has just brought me dingleys money i will give you a note for it at the end of this letter there was half a crown for entering the letter of attorney but i swore to stop that ill spend your money bravely here morrow dear sirrahsat night i dined today with sir thomas hanmer his wife the duchess of grafton6 dined with us she wears a great high headdress such as was in fashion fifteen years ago and looks like a mad woman in it yet she has great remains of beauty i was this evening to see lord harley and thought to have sat with lord treasurer but he was taken up with the dutch envoy and such folks and i would not stay one particular in life here different from what i have in dublin is that whenever i come home i expect to find some letter for me and seldom miss and never any worth a farthing but often to vex me the queen does not come to town till saturday prior is not yet declared but these ministers being at hampton court i know nothing and if i write news from common hands it is always lies you will think it affectation but nothing has vexed me more for some months past than people i never saw pretending to be acquainted with me and yet speak ill of me too at least some of them an old crooked scotch countess whom i never heard of in my life told the duchess of hamilton7 tother day that i often visited her people of worth never do that so that a man only gets the scandal of having scurvy acquaintance three ladies were railing against me some time ago and said they were very well acquainted with me two of which i had never heard of and the third i had only seen twice where i happened to visit a man who has once seen me in a coffeehouse will ask me how i do when he sees me talking at court with a minister of state who is sure to ask me how i came acquainted with that scoundrel but come sirrahs this is all stuff to you so ill say no more on this side the paper but turn over  23 my printer invited mr lewis and me to dine at a tavern today which i have not done five times since i came to england i never will call it britain pray dont call it britain my week is not out and one side of this paper is out and i have a letter to answer of mds into the bargain must i write on the third side faith that will give you an ill habit i saw leigh last night he gives a terrible account of sterne he reckons he is seduced by some wench he is over head and ears in debt and has pawned several things leigh says he goes on monday next for ireland but believes sterne will not go with him sterne has kept him these three months leigh has got the apron and things and promises to call for the box at chester but i despair of it goodnight sirrahs i have been late abroad  24 i have finished my pamphlet8 today which has cost me so much time and trouble it will be published in three or four days when the parliament begins sitting i suppose the queen is come to town but know nothing having been in the city finishing and correcting with the printer when i came home i found letters on my table as usual and one from your mother to tell me that you desire your writings and a picture should be sent to me to be sent over to you i have just answered her letter and promised to take care of them if they be sent to me she is at farnham it is too late to send them by leigh besides i will wait your orders madam stella i am going to finish a letter to lord treasurer about reforming our language9 but first i must put an end to a ballad and go you to your cards sirrahs this is card season  25 i was early with the secretary today but he was gone to his devotions and to receive the sacrament several rakes did the same it was not for piety but employments according to act of parliament i dined with lady mary dudley10 and passed my time since insipidly only i was at court at noon and saw fifty acquaintance i had not met this long time that is the advantage of a court and i fancy i am better known than any man that goes there sir john walters11 quarrel with me has entertained the town ever since and yet we never had a word only he railed at me behind my back the parliament is again to be prorogued for eight or nine days for the whigs are too strong in the house of lords other reasons are pretended but that is the truth the prorogation is not yet known but will be tomorrow  26 mr lewis and i dined with a friend of his and unexpectedly there dined with us an irish knight one sir john st leger12 who follows the law here but at a great distance he was so pert i was forced to take him down more than once i saw today the pope and devil and the other figures of cardinals etc fifteen in all which have made such a noise i have put an understrapper upon writing a twopenny pamphlet13 to give an account of the whole design my large pamphlet14 will be published tomorrow copies are sent to the great men this night domville15 is come home from his travels i am vexed at it i have not seen him yet i design to present him to all the great men  27 domville came to me this morning and we dined at pontacks and were all day together till six this evening he is perfectly as fine a gentleman as i know he set me down at lord treasurers with whom i stayed about an hour till monsieur buys the dutch envoy came to him about business my lord treasurer is pretty well but stiff in the hips with the remains of the rheumatism i am to bring domville to my lord harley in a day or two it was the dirtiest rainy day that ever i saw the pamphlet is published lord treasurer had it by him on the table and was asking me about the mottoes in the titlepage he gave me one of them himself16 i must send you the pamphlet if i can  28 mrs van sent to me to dine with her today because some ladies of my acquaintance were to be there and there i dined i was this morning to return domville his visit and went to visit mrs masham who was not within i am turned out of my lodging by my landlady it seems her husband and her son are coming home but i have taken another lodging hard by in leicester fields i presented mr domville to mr lewis and mr prior this morning prior and i are called the two sosias17 in a whig newspaper sosias can you read it the pamphlet begins to make a noise i was asked by several whether i had seen it and they advised me to read it for it was something very extraordinary i shall be suspected and it will have several paltry answers it must take its fate as savage18 said of his sermon that he preached at farnham on sir william temples death domville saw savage in italy and says he is a coxcomb and half mad he goes in red and with yellow waistcoats and was at ceremony kneeling to the pope on a palm sunday which is much more than kissing his toe and i believe it will ruin him here when tis told ill answer your letter in my new lodgings i have hardly room i must borrow from the other side  29 new lodgings my printer came this morning to tell me he must immediately print a second edition19 and lord treasurer made one or two small additions they must work day and night to have it out on saturday they sold a thousand in two days our society met today nine of us were present we dined at our brother bathursts20 we made several regulations and have chosen three new members lord orrery21 jack hill who is mrs mashams brother he that lately miscarried in the expedition to quebec and one colonel disney22we have taken a room in a house near st jamess to meet in i left them early about correcting the pamphlet etc and am now got home etc  30 this morning i carried domville to see my lord harley and i did some business with lord treasurer and have been all this afternoon with the printer adding something to the second edition i dined with the printer the pamphlet makes a world of noise and will do a great deal of good it tells abundance of most important facts which were not at all known ill answer your letter tomorrow morning or suppose i answer it just now though it is pretty late come thenyou say you are busy with parliaments etc thats more than ever i will be when i come back but you will have none these two years lord santry etc yes i have had enough ont23 i am glad dilly is mended does not

womans to what members i know thats all i can do lord treasurers lameness goes off daily pray god preserve poor good mrs stoyte she would be a great loss to us all pray give her my service and tell her she has my heartiest prayers i pity poor mrs manley but i think the child is happy to die considering how little provision it would have hadpoh every pamphlet abuses me and for things that i never writ joe26 should have written me thanks for his two hundred pounds i reckon he got it by my means and i must thank the duke of ormond who i dare swear will say he did it on my account are they golden pippins those seven apples we have had much rain every day as well as you 7 pounds 17 shillings 8 pence old blunderer not 18 shillings i have reckoned it eighteen times hawkshaws eight pounds is not reckoned and if it be secure it may lie where it is unless they desire to pay it so parvisol may let it drop till further orders for i have put mrs wesleys money into the bank and will pay her with hawkshawsi mean that hawkshaws money goes for an addition to md you know but be good housewives bernage never comes now to see me he has no more to ask but i hear he has been illa pox on mrs souths27 affair i can do nothing in it but by way of assisting anybody else that solicits it by dropping a favourable word if it comes in my way tell walls i do no more for anybody with my lord treasurer especially a thing of this kind tell him i have spent all my discretion and have no more to useand so i have answered your letter fully and plainlyand so i have got to the third side of my paper which is more than belongs to you young women       it goes tomorrow      to nobodys sorrow  you are silly not i im a poet if i had but etcwhos silly now rogues and lasses tinderboxes and buzzards o lord i am in a high vein of silliness methought i was speaking to dearest little md face to face there so lads enough for tonight to cards with the blackguards goodnight my delight etc  dec 1 pish sirrahs put a date always at the bottom of your letter as well as the top that i may know when you send it your last is of november 3 yet i had others at the same time written a fortnight after whenever you would have any money send me word three weeks before and in that time you will certainly have an answer with a bill on parvisol pray do this for my head is full and it will ease my memory why i think i quoted to you some of s letter so you may imagine how witty the rest was for it was all of a bunch as goodman peesley28 says pray let us have no more bussiness but busyness the deuce take me if i know how to spell it your wrong spelling madam stella has put me out it does not look right let me see bussiness busyness business bisyness bisness bysness faith i know not which is right i think the second i believe i never writ the word in my life before yes sure i must though business busyness bisynessi have perplexed myself and cant do it prithee ask walls business i fancy thats right yes it is i looked in my own pamphlet and found it twice in ten lines to convince you that i never writ it before oh now i see it as plain as can be so yours is only an s too much the parliament will certainly meet on friday next the whigs will have a great majority in the house of lords no care is taken to prevent it there is too much neglect they are warned of it and that signifies nothing it was feared there would be some peevish address from the lords against a peace tis said about the town that several of the allies begin now to be content that a peace should be treated this is all the news i have the queen is pretty well and so now i bid poor dearest md farewell till tonight then i will talk with them again  the fifteen images that i saw were not worth forty pounds so i stretched a little when i said a thousand the grub street account of that tumult is published the devil is not like lord treasurer they were all in your odd antic masks bought in common shops29 i fear prior will not be one of the plenipotentiaries  i was looking over this letter and find i make many mistakes of leaving out words so tis impossible to find my meaning unless you be conjurers i will take more care for the future and read over every day just what i have written that day which will take up no time to speak of     letter 36  london dec 1 1711  my last was put in this evening i intended to dine with mr masham today and called at whites chocolate house to see if he was there lord wharton saw me at the door and i saw him but took no notice and was going away but he came through the crowd called after me and asked me how i did etc this was pretty and i believe he wished every word he spoke was a halter to hang me masham did not dine at home so i ate with a friend in the neighbourhood the printer has not sent me the second edition i know not the reason for it certainly came out today perhaps they are glutted with it already i found a letter from lord harley on my table to tell me that his father desires i would make two small alterations i am going to be busy etc  2 morning see the blunder i was making it the 37th day of the month from the number above well but i am staying here for old frowde who appointed to call this morning i am ready dressed to go to church i suppose he dare not stir out but on sundays1 the printer called early this morning told me the second edition went off yesterday in five hours and he must have a third ready tomorrow for they might have sold half another his men are all at work with it though it be sunday this old fool will not come and i shall miss church morrow sirrahsat night i was at court today the queen is well and walked through part of the rooms i dined with the secretary and despatched some business he tells me the dutch envoy designs to complain of that pamphlet the noise it makes is extraordinary it is fit it should answer the pains i have been at about it i suppose it will be printed in ireland some lay it to prior others to mr secretary st john but i am always the first they lay everything to ill go sleep etc  3 i have ordered patrick not to let any odd fellow come up to me and a fellow would needs speak with me from sir george pretyman2 i had never heard of him and would not see the messenger but at last it proved that this sir george has sold his estate and is a beggar smithers the farnham carrier brought me this morning a letter from your mother with three papers enclosed of lady giffards writing one owning some exchequer business of 100 pounds to be stellas3 another for 100 pounds that she has of yours which i made over to you for mariston and a third for 300 pounds the last is on stamped paper i think they had better lie in england in some good hand till lady giffard dies and i will think of some such hand before i come over i was asking smithers about all the people of farnham mrs white4 has left off dressing is troubled with lameness and swelled legs and seldom stirs out but her old hangdog husband as hearty as ever i was this morning with lord treasurer about something he would have altered in the pamphlet5 but it cant be till the fourth edition which i believe will be soon for i dined with the printer and he tells me they have sold off half the third mrs perceval6 and her daughter have been in town these three weeks which i never heard till today and mrs wesley7 is come to town too to consult dr radcliffe the whigs are resolved to bring that pamphlet into the house of lords to have it condemned so i hear but the printer will stand to it and not own the author he must say he had it from the pennypost some people talk as if the house of lords would do some peevish thing for the whigs are now a great majority in it our ministers are too negligent of such things i have never slipped giving them warning some of them are sensible of it but lord treasurer stands too much upon his own legs i fancy his good fortune will bear him out in everything but in reason i should think this ministry to stand very unsteady if they can carry a peace they may hold i believe not else  4 mr secretary sent to me today to dine with him alone but we had two more with us which hindered me doing some business i was this morning with young harcourt secretary to our society to take a room for our weekly meetings and the fellow asked us five guineas a week only to have leave to dine once a week was not that pretty so we broke off with him and are to dine next thursday at harcourts he is lord keepers son they have sold off above half the third edition and answers are coming out the dutch envoy refused dining with dr davenant8 because he was suspected to write it i have made some alterations in every edition and it has cost me more trouble for the time since the printing than before tis sent over to ireland and i suppose you will have it reprinted  5 they are now printing the fourth edition which is reckoned very extraordinary considering tis a dear twelvepenny book and not bought up in numbers by the party to give away as the whigs do but purely upon its own strength i have got an under spurleather to write an examiner again9 and the secretary and i will now and then send hints but we would have it a little upon the grub street to be a match for their writers i dined with lord treasurer today at five he dined by himself after his family and drinks no claret yet for fear of his rheumatism of which he is almost well he was very pleasant as he is always yet i fancied he was a little touched with the present posture of affairs the elector of hanovers minister here has given in a violent memorial against the peace and caused it to be printed the whig lords are doing their utmost for a majority against friday and design if they can to address the queen against the peace lord nottingham10 a famous tory and speechmaker is gone over to the whig side they toast him daily and lord wharton says it is dismal so they call him from his looks will save england at last lord treasurer was hinting as if he wished a ballad was made on him and i will get up one against tomorrow11 he gave me a scurrilous printed paper of bad verses on himself under the name of the english catiline and made me read them to the company it was his birthday which he would not tell us but lord harley whispered it to me  6 i was this morning making the ballad two degrees above grub street at noon i paid a visit to mrs masham and then went to dine with our society poor lord keeper dined below stairs i suppose on a bit of mutton we chose two members we were eleven met the greatest meeting we ever had i am next week to introduce lord orrery the printer came before we parted and brought the ballad which made them laugh very heartily a dozen times he is going to print the pamphlet12 in small a fifth edition to be taken off by friends and sent into the country a sixpenny answer is come out good for nothing but guessing me among others for the author tomorrow is the fatal day for the parliament meeting and we are full of hopes and fears we reckon we have a majority of ten on our side in the house of lords yet i observed mrs masham a little uneasy she assures me the queen is stout the duke of marlborough has not seen the queen for some days past mrs masham is glad of it because she says he tells a hundred lies to his friends of what she says to him he is one day humble and the next day on the high ropes the duke of ormond they say will be in town tonight by twelve  7 this being the day the parliament was to meet and the great question to be determined i went with dr freind to dine in the city on purpose to be out of the way and we sent our printer to see what was our fate but he gave us a most melancholy account of things the earl of nottingham began and spoke against a peace and desired that in their address they might put in a clause to advise the queen not to make a peace without spain which was debated and carried by the whigs by about six voices and this has happened entirely by my lord treasurers neglect who did not take timely care to make up all his strength although every one of us gave him caution enough nottingham has certainly been bribed the question is yet only carried in the committee of the whole house and we hope when it is reported to the house tomorrow we shall have a majority by some scotch lords coming to town however it is a mighty blow and loss of reputation to lord treasurer and may end in his ruin i hear the thing only as the printer brought it who was at the debate but how the ministry take it or what their hopes and fears are i cannot tell until i see them i shall be early with the secretary tomorrow and then i will tell you more and shall write a full account to the bishop of clogher tomorrow and to the archbishop of dublin if i have time i am horribly down at present i long to know how lord treasurer bears this and what remedy he has the duke of ormond came this day to town and was there  8 i was early this morning with the secretary and talked over this matter he hoped that when it was reported this day in the house of lords they would disagree with their committee and so the matter would go off only with a little loss of reputation to the lord treasurer i dined with mr cockburn and after a scotch member came in and told us that the clause was carried against the court in the house of lords almost two to one i went immediately to mrs masham and meeting dr arbuthnot the queens favourite physician we went together she was just come from waiting at the queens dinner and going to her own she had heard nothing of the thing being gone against us it seems lord treasurer had been so negligent that he was with the queen while the question was put in the house i immediately told mrs masham that either she and lord treasurer had joined with the queen to betray us or that they two were betrayed by the queen she protested solemnly it was not the former and i believed her but she gave me some lights to suspect the queen is changed for yesterday when the queen was going from the house where she sat to hear the debate the duke of shrewsbury lord chamberlain asked her whether he or the great chamberlain lindsey13 ought to lead her out she answered short neither of you and gave her hand to the duke of somerset who was louder than any in the house for the clause against peace she gave me one or two more instances of this sort which convince me that the queen is false or at least very much wavering mr masham begged us to stay because lord treasurer would call and we were resolved to fall on him about his negligence in securing a majority he came and appeared in good humour as usual but i thought his countenance was much cast down i rallied him and desired him to give me his staff which he did i told him if he would secure it me a week i would set all right he asked how i said i would immediately turn lord marlborough his two daughters14 the duke and duchess of somerset and lord cholmondeley15 out of all their employments and i believe he had not a friend but was of my opinion arbuthnot asked how he came not to secure a majority he could answer nothing but that he could not help it if people would lie and forswear a poor answer for a great minister there fell from him a scripture expression that the hearts of kings are unsearchable16 i told him it was what i feared and was from him the worst news he could tell me i begged him to know what he had to trust to he stuck a little but at last bid me not fear for all would be well yet we would fain have had him eat a bit where he was but he would go home it was past six he made me go home with him there we found his brother and mr secretary he made his son take a list of all in the house of commons who had places and yet voted against the court in such a manner as if they should lose their places i doubt he is not able to compass it lord keeper came in an hour and they were going upon business so i left him and returned to mrs masham but she had company with her and i would not staythis is a long journal and of a day that may produce great alterations and hazard the ruin of england the whigs are all in triumph they foretold how all this would be but we thought it boasting nay they said the parliament should be dissolved before christmas and perhaps it may this is all your dd duchess of somersets doings i warned them of it nine months ago and a hundred times since the secretary always dreaded it i told lord treasurer i should have the advantage of him for he would lose his head and i should only be hanged and so carry my body entire to the grave  9 i was this morning with mr secretary we are both of opinion that the queen is false i told him what i heard and he confirmed it by other circumstances i then went to my friend lewis who had sent to see me he talks of nothing but retiring to his estate in wales he gave me reasons to believe the whole matter is settled between the queen and the whigs he hears that lord somers is to be treasurer and believes that sooner than turn out the duchess of somerset she will dissolve the parliament and get a whiggish one which may be done by managing elections things are now in the crisis and a day or two will determine i have desired him to engage lord treasurer that as soon as he finds the change is resolved on he will send me abroad as queens secretary somewhere or other where i may remain till the new ministers recall me and then i will be sick for five or six months till the storm has spent itself i hope he will grant me this for i should hardly trust myself to the mercy of my enemies while their anger is fresh i dined today with the secretary who affects mirth and seems to hope all will yet be well i took him aside after dinner told him how i had served them and had asked no reward but thought i might ask security and then desired the same thing of him to send me abroad before a change he embraced me and swore he would take the same care of me as himself etc but bid me have courage for that in two days my lord treasurers wisdom would appear greater than ever that he suffered all that had happened on purpose and had taken measures to turn it to advantage i said god send it but i do not believe a syllable and as far as i can judge the game is lost i shall know more soon and my letters will at least be a good history to show you the steps of this change  10 i was this morning with lewis who thinks they will let the parliament sit till they have given the money and then dissolve them in spring and break the ministry he spoke to lord treasurer about what i desired him my lord desired him with great earnestness to assure me that all would be well and that i should fear nothing i dined in the city with a friend this day the commons went to the queen with their address and all the lords who were for the peace went with them to show their zeal i have now some further conviction that the queen is false and it begins to be known  11 i went between two and three to see mrs masham while i was there she went to her bedchamber to try a petticoat lord treasurer came in to see her and seeing me in the outer room fell a rallying me says he you had better keep company with me than with such a fellow as lewis who has not the soul of a chicken nor the heart of a mite then he went in to mrs masham and as he came back desired her leave to let me go home with him to dinner he asked whether i was not afraid to be seen with him i said i never valued my lord treasurer in my life and therefore should have always the same esteem for mr harley and lord oxford he seemed to talk confidently as if he reckoned that all this would turn to advantage i could not forbear hinting that he was not sure of the queen and that those scoundrel starving lords would never have dared to vote against the court if somerset had not assured them that it would please the queen he said that was true and somerset did so i stayed till six then de buys the dutch envoy came to him and i left him prior was with us a while after dinner i see him and all of them cast down though they make the best of it  12 ford is come to town i saw him last night he is in no fear but sanguine although i have told him the state of things this change so resembles the last that i wonder they do not observe it the secretary sent for me yesterday to dine with him but i was abroad i hope he had something to say to me this is morning and i write in bed i am going to the duke of ormond whom i have not yet seen morrow sirrahsat night i was to see the duke of ormond this morning he asked me two or three questions after his civil way and they related to ireland at last i told him that from the time i had seen him i never once thought of irish affairs he whispered me that he hoped i had done some good things here i said if everybody else had done half as much we should not be as we are then we went aside and talked over affairs i told him how all things stood and advised him what was to be done i then went and sat an hour with the duchess then as long with lady oglethorpe17 who is so cunning a devil that i believe she could yet find a remedy if they would take her advice i dined with a friend at court  13 i was this morning with the secretary he will needs pretend to talk as if things would be well will you believe it said he if you see these people turned out i said yes if i saw the duke and duchess of somerset out he swore if they were not he would give up his place our society dined today at sir william wyndhams we were thirteen present lord orrery and two other members were introduced i left them at seven i forgot to tell you that the printer told me yesterday that morphew the publisher was sent for by that lord chiefjustice who was a manager against sacheverell he showed him two or three papers and pamphlets among the rest mine of the conduct of the allies threatened him asked who was the author and has bound him over to appear next term he would not have the impudence to do this if he did not foresee what was coming at court  14 lord shelburne was with me this morning to be informed of the state of affairs and desired i would answer all his objections against a peace which was soon done for he would not give me room to put in a word he is a man of good sense enough but argues so violently that he will some day or other put himself into a consumption he desires that he may not be denied when he comes to see me which i promised but will not perform leigh and sterne set out for ireland on monday sennight i suppose they will be with you long before thisi was tonight drinking very good wine in scurvy company at least some of them i was drawn in but will be more cautious for the future tis late etc  15 morning they say the occasional bill19 is brought today into the house of lords but i know not i will now put an end to my letter and give it into the posthouse myself this will be a memorable letter and i shall sigh to see it some years hence here are the first steps toward the ruin of an excellent ministry for i look upon them as certainly ruined and god knows what may be the consequencesi now bid my dearest md farewell for company is coming and i must be at lord dartmouths office by noon farewell dearest md i wish you a merry christmas i believe you will have this about that time love presto who loves md above all things a thousand times farewell again dearest md etc     letter 37  london dec 15 1711  i put in my letter this evening myself i was today inquiring at the secretarys office of mr lewis how things went i there met prior who told me he gave all for gone etc and was of opinion the whole ministry would give up their places next week lewis thinks they will not till spring when the session is over both of them entirely despair i went to see mrs masham who invited me to dinner but i was engaged to lewis at four i went to mashams he came and whispered me that he had it from a very good hand that all would be well and i found them both very cheerful the company was going to the opera but desired i would come and sup with them i did so at ten and lord treasurer was there and sat with us till past twelve and was more cheerful than i have seen him these ten days mrs masham told me he was mightily cast down some days ago and he could not indeed hide it from me arbuthnot is in good hopes that the queen has not betrayed us but only has been frightened and flattered etc but i cannot yet be of his opinion whether my reasons are better or that my fears are greater i do resolve if they give up or are turned out soon to retire for some months and i have pitched upon the place already but i will take methods for hearing from md and writing to them but i would be out of the way upon the first of the ferment for they lay all things on me even some i have never read  16 i took courage today and went to court with a very cheerful countenance it was mightily crowded both parties coming to observe each others faces i have avoided lord halifaxs bow till he forced it on me but we did not talk together i could not make less than fourscore bows of which about twenty might be to whigs the duke of somerset is gone to petworth and i hear the duchess too of which i shall be very glad prince eugene1 who was expected here some days ago we are now told will not come at all the whigs designed to have met him with forty thousand horse lord treasurer told me some days ago of his discourse with the emperors resident that puppy hoffman about prince eugenes coming by which i found my lord would hinder it if he could and we shall be all glad if he does not come and think it a good point gained sir andrew fountaine ford and i dined today with mrs van by invitation  17 i have mistaken the day of the month and been forced to mend it thrice i dined today with mr masham and his lady by invitation lord treasurer was to be there but came not it was to entertain buys the dutch envoy who speaks english well enough he was plaguily politic telling a thousand lies of which none passed upon any of us we are still in the condition of suspense and i think have little hopes the duchess of somerset is not gone to petworth only the duke and that is a poor sacrifice i believe the queen certainly designs to change the ministry but perhaps may put it off till the session is over and i think they had better give up now if she will not deal openly and then they need not answer for the consequences of a peace when it is in other hands and may yet be broken they say my lord privy seal sets out for holland this week so the peace goes on  18 it has rained hard from morning till night and cost me three shillings in coachhire we have had abundance of wet weather i dined in the city and was with the printer who has now a fifth edition of the conduct etc it is in small and sold for sixpence they have printed as many as three editions because they are to be sent in numbers into the country by great men etc who subscribe for hundreds it has been sent a fortnight ago to ireland i suppose you will print it there the tory lords and commons in parliament argue all from it and all agree that never anything of that kind was of so great consequence or made so many converts by the time i have sent this letter i expect to hear from little md it will be a month two days hence since i had your last and i will allow ten days for accidents i cannot get rid of the leavings of a cold i got a month ago or else it is a new one i have been writing letters all this evening till i am weary and i am sending out another little thing which i hope to finish this week and design to send to the printer in an unknown hand there was printed a grub street speech of lord nottingham2 and he was such an owl to complain of it in the house of lords who have taken up the printer for it i heard at court that walpole3 a great whig member said that i and my whimsical club writ it at one of our meetings and that i should pay for it he will find he lies and i shall let him know by a third hand my thoughts of him he is to be secretary of state if the ministry changes but he has lately had a bribe proved against him in parliament while he was secretary at war he is one of the whigs chief speakers  19 sad dismal weather i went to the secretarys office and lewis made me dine with him i intended to have dined with lord treasurer i have not seen the secretary this week things do not mend at all lord dartmouth despairs and is for giving up lewis is of the same mind but lord treasurer only says poh poh all will be well i am come home early to finish something i am doing but i find i want heart and humour and would read any idle book that came in my way i have just sent away a penny paper to make a little mischief patrick is gone to the burial of an irish footman who was dr kings4 servant he died of a consumption a fit death for a poor starving wits footman the irish servants always club to bury a countryman  20 i was with the secretary this morning and for aught i can see we shall have a languishing death i can know nothing nor themselves neither i dined you know with our society and that odious secretary would make me president next week so i must entertain them this day sennight at the thatched house tavern5 where we dined today it will cost me five or six pounds yet the secretary says he will give me wine i found a letter when i came home from the bishop of clogher  21 this is the first time i ever got a new cold before the old one was going it came yesterday and appeared in all due forms eyes and nose running etc and is now very bad and i cannot tell how i got it sir andrew fountaine and i were invited to dine with mrs van i was this morning with the duke of ormond and neither he nor i can think of anything to comfort us in present affairs we must certainly fall if the duchess of somerset be not turned out and nobody believes the queen will ever part with her the duke and i were settling when mr secretary and i should dine with him and he fixes upon tuesday and when i came away i remembered it was christmas day i was to see lady  who is just up after lyingin and the ugliest sight i have seen pale dead old and yellow for want of her paint she has turned my stomach but she will soon be painted and a beauty again  22 i find myself disordered with a pain all round the small of my back which i imputed to champagne i had drunk but find it to have been only my new cold it was a fine frosty day and i resolved to walk into the city i called at lord treasurers at eleven and stayed some time with himhe showed me a letter from a great presbyterian parson6 to him complaining how their friends had betrayed them by passing this conformity bill and he showed me the answer he had written which his friends would not let him send but was a very good one he is very cheerful but gives one no hopes nor has any to give i went into the city and there i dined  23 morning as i was dressing to go to church a friend that was to see me advised me not to stir out so i shall keep at home today and only eat some broth if i can get it it is a terrible cold frost and snow fell yesterday which still remains look there you may see it from the penthouses the lords made yesterday two or three votes about peace and hanover of a very angry kind to vex the ministry and they will meet sooner by a fortnight than the commons and they say are preparing some knocking addresses morrow sirrahs ill sit at home and when i go to bed i will tell you how i ami have sat at home all day and eaten only a mess of broth and a roll i have written a prophecy7 which i design to print i did it today and some other verses  24 i went into the city today in a coach and dined there my cold is going it is now bitter hard frost and has been so these three or four days my prophecy is printed and will be published after christmas day i like it mightily i dont know how it will pass you will never understand it at your distance without help i believe everybody will guess it to be mine because it is somewhat in the same manner with that of merlin8 in the miscellanies my lord privy seal set out this day for holland hell have a cold journey i gave patrick half a crown for his christmas box on condition he would be good and he came home drunk at midnight i have taken a memorandum of it because i never design to give him a groat more tis cruel cold  25 i wish md a merry christmas and many a one but mine is melancholy i durst not go to church today finding myself a little out of order and it snowing prodigiously and freezing at noon i went to mrs van who had this week engaged me to dine there today and there i received the news that poor mrs long9 died at lynn in norfolk on saturday last at four in the morning she was sick but four hours we suppose it was the asthma which she was subject to as well as the dropsy as she sent me word in her last letter written about five weeks ago but then said she was recovered i never was more afflicted at any death the poor creature had retired to lynn two years ago to live cheap and pay her debts in her last letter she told me she hoped to be easy by christmas and she kept her word although she meant it otherwise she had all sorts of amiable qualities and no ill ones but the indiscretion of too much neglecting her own affairs she had two thousand pounds left her by an old grandmother10 with which she intended to pay her debts and live on an annuity she had of one hundred pounds a year and newburg house which would be about sixty pounds more that odious grandmother living so long forced her to retire for the two thousand pounds was settled on her after the old womans death yet her brute of a brother sir james long11 would not advance it for her else she might have paid her debts and continued here and lived still i believe melancholy helped her on to her grave i have ordered a paragraph to be put in the postboy12 giving an account of her death and making honourable mention of her which is all i can do to serve her memory but one reason was spite for her brother would fain have her death a secret to save the charge of bringing her up here to bury her or going into mourning pardon all this for the sake of a poor creature i had so much friendship for  26 i went to mr secretary this morning and he would have me dine with him i called at noon at mrs mashams who desired me not to let the prophecy be published for fear of angering the queen about the duchess of somerset so i writ to the printer to stop them they have been printed and given about but not sold i saw lord treasurer there who had been two hours with the queen and mrs masham is in hopes things will do well again i went at night again and supped at mr mashams and lord treasurer sat with us till one oclock so tis late etc  27 i entertained our society at the thatched house tavern today at dinner but brother bathurst sent for wine the house affording none the printer had not received my letter and so he brought up dozens apiece of the prophecy but i ordered him to part with no more tis an admirable good one and people are mad for it the frost still continues violently cold mrs masham invited me to come tonight and play at cards but our society did not part till nine but i supped with mrs hill her sister and there was mrs masham and lord treasurer and we stayed till twelve he is endeavouring to get a majority against next wednesday when the house of lords is to meet and the whigs intend to make some violent addresses against a peace if not prevented god knows what will become of usit is still prodigiously cold but so i told you already we have eggs on the spit i wish they may not be addled when i came home tonight i found forsooth a letter from md n24 24 24 24 there do you know the numbers now and at the same time one from joe13 full of thanks let him know i have received it and am glad of his success but wont put him to the charge of a letter i had a letter some time ago from mr warburton14 and i beg one of you will copy out what i shall tell you and send it by some opportunity to warburton tis as follows the doctor has received mr warburtons letter and desires he will let the doctor know where15 that accident he mentions is like soon to happen and he will do what he can in itand pray madam let them know that i do this to save myself the trouble and them the expense of a letter and i think that this is enough for one that comes home at twelve from a lord treasurer and mrs masham oh i could tell you ten thousand things of our mad politics upon what small circumstances great affairs have turned but i will go rest my busy head  28 i was this morning with brother bathurst to see the duke of ormond we have given his grace some hopes to be one of our society the secretary and i and bathurst are to dine with him on sunday next the duke is not in much hopes but has been very busy in endeavouring to bring over some lords against next wednesday the duchess caught me as i was going out she is sadly in fear about things and blames me for not mending them by my credit with lord treasurer and i blame her she met me in the street at noon and engaged me to dine with her which i did and we talked an hour after dinner in her closet if we miscarry on wednesday i believe it will be by some strange sort of neglect they talk of making eight new lords by calling up some peers eldest sons but they delay strangely i saw judge coote16 today at the duke of ormonds he desires to come and see me to justify his principles  29 morning this goes today i will not answer yours your 24th till next which shall begin tonight as usual lord shelburne has sent to invite me to dinner but i am engaged with lewis at ned southwells lord northampton and lord aylesburys sons17 are both made peers but we shall want more i write this post to your dean i owe the archbishop a letter this long time all people that come from ireland complain of him and scold me for protecting him pray madam dingley let me know what presto has received for this year or whether anything is due to him for last i cannot look over your former letters now as for dingleys own account of her exchequer money i will give it on tother side farewell my own dearest md and love presto and god ever bless dearest md etc etc i wish you many happy christmases and new years  i have owned to the dean a letter i just had from you but that i had not one this great while before   dingleys account    received of mr tooke                                 6 17 6   deducted for entering the letter of attorney            0 2 6   for the three halfcrowns it used to cost you

pounds irish and pray be satisfied  churchwardens accounts boys  saturday night i have broke open my letter and tore it into the bargain to let you know that we are all safe the queen has made no less than twelve lords18 to have a majority nine new ones the other three peers sons and has turned out the duke of somerset she is awaked at last and so is lord treasurer i want nothing now but to see the duchess out but we shall do without her we are all extremely happy give me joy sirrahs this is written in a coffeehouse three of the new lords are of our society     letter 38  london dec 29 1711  i put my letter in this evening after coming from dinner at ned southwells where i drank very good irish wine and we are in great joy at this happy turn of affairs the queen has been at last persuaded to her own interest and security and i freely think she must have made both herself and kingdom very unhappy if she had done otherwise it is still a mighty secret that masham is to be one of the new lords they say he does not yet know it himself but the queen is to surprise him with it mr secretary will be a lord at the end of the session but they want him still in parliament after all it is a strange unhappy necessity of making so many peers together but the queen has drawn it upon herself by her confounded trimming and moderation three as i told you are of our society  30 i writ the dean and you a lie yesterday for the duke of somerset is not yet turned out i was today at court and resolved to be very civil to the whigs but saw few there when i was in the bedchamber talking to lord rochester he went up to lady burlington1 who asked him who i was and lady sunderland and she whispered about me i desired lord rochester to tell lady sunderland i doubted she was not as much in love with me as i was with her but he would not deliver my message the duchess of shrewsbury came running up to me and clapped her fan up to hide us from the company and we gave one another joy of this change but sighed when we reflected on the somerset family not being out the secretary and i and brother bathurst and lord windsor dined with the duke of ormond bathurst and windsor2 are to be two of the new lords i desired my lord radnors brother3 at court today to let my lord know i would call on him at six which i did and was arguing with him three hours to bring him over to us and i spoke so closely that i believe he will be tractable but he is a scoundrel and though i said i only talked for my love to him i told a lie for i did not care if he were hanged but everyone gained over is of consequence the duke of marlborough was at court today and nobody hardly took notice of him mashams being a lord begins to take wind nothing at court can be kept a secret wednesday will be a great day you shall know more  31 our frost is broken since yesterday and it is very slabbery4 yet i walked to the city and dined and ordered some things with the printer i have settled dr king in the gazette it will be worth two hundred pounds a year to him our new lords patents are passed i dont like the expedient if we could have found any other i see i have said this before i hear the duke of marlborough is turned out of all his employments i shall know tomorrow when i am to carry dr king to dine with the secretarythese are strong remedies pray god the patient is able to bear them the last ministry people are utterly desperate  jan 1 now i wish my dearest little md many happy new years yes both dingley and stella ay and presto too many happy new years i dined with the secretary and it is true that the duke of marlborough is turned out of all the duke of ormond has got his regiment of footguards i know not who has the rest if the ministry be not sure of a peace i shall wonder at this step and do not approve it at best the queen and lord treasurer mortally hate the duke of marlborough and to that he owes his fall more than to his other faults unless he has been tampering too far with his party of which i have not heard any particulars however it be the world abroad will blame us i confess my belief that he has not one good quality in the world beside that of a general and even that i have heard denied by several great soldiers but we have had constant success in arms while he commanded opinion is a mighty matter in war and i doubt the french think it impossible to conquer an army that he leads and our soldiers think the same and how far even this step may encourage the french to play tricks with us no man knows i do not love to see personal resentment mix with public affairs  2 this being the day the lords meet and the new peers to be introduced i went to westminster to see the sight but the crowd was too great in the house so i only went into the robingroom to give my four brothers joy and sir thomas mansel5 and lord windsor the other six i am not acquainted with it was apprehended the whigs would have raised some difficulties but nothing happened i went to see lady masham at noon and wish her joy of her new honour and a happy new year i found her very well pleased for peerage will be some sort of protection to her upon any turn of affairs she engaged me to come at night and sup with her and lord treasurer i went at nine and she was not at home so i would not stayno no i wont answer your letter yet young women i dined with a friend in the neighbourhood i see nothing here like christmas except brawn or mincepies in places where i dine and giving away my halfcrowns like farthings to great mens porters and butlers yesterday i paid seven good guineas to the fellow at the tavern where i treated the society i have a great mind to send you the bill i think i told you some articles i have not heard whether anything was done in the house of lords after introducing the new ones ford has been sitting with me till peeast tweeleve a clock  3 this was our society day lord dupplin was president we choose every week the last president treats and chooses his successor i believe our dinner cost fifteen pounds beside wine the secretary grew brisk and would not let me go nor lord lansdowne6 who would fain have gone home to his lady being newly married to lady mary thynne it was near one when we parted so you must think i cannot write much tonight the adjourning of the house of lords yesterday as the queen desired was just carried by the twelve new lords and one more lord radnor was not there i hope i have cured him did i tell you that i have brought dr king in to be gazetteer it will be worth above two hundred pounds a year to him i believe i told you so before but i am forgetful go get you gone to ombre and claret and toasted oranges ill go sleep  4 i cannot get rid of the leavings of my cold i was in the city today and dined with my printer and gave him a ballad made by several hands i know not whom i believe lord treasurer had a finger in it i added three stanzas i suppose dr arbuthnot had the greatest share i had been overseeing some other little prints and a pamphlet made by one of my understrappers somerset is not out yet i doubt not but you will have the prophecy in ireland although it is not published here only printed copies given to friends tell me do you understand it no faith not without help tell me what you stick at and ill explain we turned out a member of our society yesterday for gross neglect and nonattendance i writ to him by order to give him notice of it it is tom harley7 secretary to the treasurer and cousingerman to lord treasurer he is going to hanover from the queen i am to give the duke of ormond notice of his election as soon as i can see him  5 i went this morning with a parishioner of mine one nuttal who came over here for a legacy of one hundred pounds and a roguish lawyer had refused to pay him and would not believe he was the man i writ to the lawyer a sharp letter that i had taken nuttal into my protection and was resolved to stand by him and the next news was that the lawyer desired i would meet him and attest he was the man which i did and his money was paid upon the spot i then visited lord treasurer who is now right again and all well only that the somerset family is not out yet i hate that i dont like it as the man said by etc then i went and visited poor will congreve who had a french fellow tampering with one of his eyes he is almost blind of both i dined with some merchants in the city but could not see stratford with whom i had business presto leave off your impertinence and answer our letter saith md yes yes one of these days when i have nothing else to do o faith this letter is a week written and not one side done yet these ugly spots are not tobacco but this is the last gilt sheet i have of large paper therefore hold your tongue nuttal was surprised when they gave him bits of paper instead of money but i made ben tooke put him in his geers8 he could not reckon ten pounds but was puzzled with the irish way ben tooke and my printer have desired me to make them stationers to the ordnance of which lord rivers is master instead of the duke of marlborough it will be a hundred pounds a year apiece to them if i can get it i will try tomorrow  6 i went this morning to earl rivers gave him joy of his new employment and desired him to prefer my printer and bookseller to be stationers to his office he immediately granted it me but like an old courtier told me it was wholly on my account but that he heard i had intended to engage mr secretary to speak to him and desired i would engage him to do so but that however he did it only for my sake this is a court trick to oblige as many as you can at once i read prayers to poor mrs wesley who is very much out of order instead of going to church and then i went to court which i found very full in expectation of seeing prince eugene who landed last night and lies at leicester house he was not to see the queen till six this evening i hope and believe he comes too late to do the whigs any good i refused dining with the secretary and was like to lose my dinner which was at a private acquaintances i went at six to see the prince at court but he was gone in to the queen and when he came out mr secretary who introduced him walked so near him that he quite screened me from him with his great periwig ill tell you a good passage as prince eugene was going with mr secretary to court he told the secretary that hoffman the emperors resident said to his highness that it was not proper to go to court without a long wig and his was a tiedup one now says the prince i knew not what to do for i never had a long periwig in my life and i have sent to all my valets and footmen to see whether any of them have one that i might borrow it but none of them has anywas not this spoken very greatly with some sort of contempt but the secretary said it was a thing of no consequence and only observed by gentlemen ushers i supped with lord masham where lord treasurer and mr secretary supped with us the first left us at twelve but the rest did not part till two yet i have written all this because it is fresh and now ill go sleep if i can that is i believe i shall because i have drank a little  7 i was this morning to give the duke of ormond notice of the honour done him to make him one of our society and to invite him on thursday next to the thatched house he has accepted it with the gratitude and humility such a preferment deserves but cannot come till the next meeting because prince eugene is to dine with him that day which i allowed for a good excuse and will report accordingly i dined with lord masham and sat there till eight this evening and came home because i was not very well but a little griped but now i am well again i will not go at least but very seldom to lord mashams suppers lord treasurer is generally there and that tempts me but late sitting up does not agree with me theres the short and the long and i wont do it so take your answer dear little young women and i have no more to say to you tonight because of the archbishop for i am going to write a long letter to him but not so politely as formerly i wont trust him  8 well then come let us see this letter if i must answer it i must whats here now yes faith i lamented my birthday9 two days after and thats all and you rhyme madam stella were those verses

finer thing for her is not the apron as good im sure i shall never be paid it so alls well againwhat the quarrel with sir john walter12 why we had not one word of quarrel only he railed at me when i

peace there will be lord treasurer told me that connolly13 was going to hanover your provost14 is a coxcomb stella is a good girl for not being angry when i tell her of spelling i see none wrong in this god almighty be praised that your disorder lessens it increases my hopes mightily that they will go off and have you been plagued with the fear of the plague never mind those reports i have heard

and so and so well when i expected we were all undone i designed to retire for six months and then steal over to laracor and i had in my mouth a thousand times two lines of shakespeare where cardinal wolsey says       a weak old man battered with storms of state       is come to lay his weary bones among you15  i beg your pardon i have cheated you all this margin i did not perceive it and i went on wider and wider like stella awkward sluts she writes so so there16 thats as like as two eggs a pennya weak old man now i am saying it and shall till tomorrowthe duke of marlborough says there is nothing he now desires so much as to contrive some way how to soften dr swift he is mistaken for those things that have been hardest against him were not written by me mr secretary told me this from a friend of the dukes and im sure now he is down i shall not trample on him although i love him not i dislike his being outbernage was to see me this morning and gave some very indifferent excuses for not calling here so long i care not twopence prince eugene did not dine with the duke of marlborough on sunday but was last night at lady betty germaines assemblee and a vast number of ladies to see him mr lewis and i dined with a private friend i was this morning to see the duke of ormond who appointed me to meet him at the cockpit at one but never came i sat too some time with the duchess we dont like things very well yet i am come home early and going to be busy ill go write  9 i could not go sleep last night till past two and was waked before three by a noise of people endeavouring to break open my window for a while i would not stir thinking it might be my imagination but hearing the noise continued i rose and went to the window and then it ceased i went to bed again and heard it repeated more violently then i rose and called up the house and got a candle the rogues had lifted up the sash a yard there are great sheds before my windows although my lodgings be a storey high and if they get upon the sheds they are almost even with my window we observed their track and panes of glass fresh broken the watchmen told us today they saw them but could not catch them they attacked others in the neighbourhood about the same time and actually robbed a house in suffolk street which is the next street but one to us it is said they are seamen discharged from service i went up to call my man and found his bed empty it seems he often lies abroad i challenged him this morning as one of the robbers he is a sad dog and the minute i come to ireland i will discard him i have this day got double iron bars to every window in my diningroom and bedchamber and i hide my purse in my thread stocking between the beds head and the wainscot lewis and i dined with an old scotch friend who brought the duke of douglas17 and three or four more scots upon us  10 this was our society day you know but the duke of ormond could not be with us because he dined with prince eugene it cost me a guinea contribution to a poet who had made a copy of verses upon monkeys applying the story to the duke of marlborough the rest gave two guineas except the two physicians18 who followed my example i dont like this custom the next time i will give nothing i sat this evening at lord mashams with lord treasurer i dont like his countenance nor i dont like the posture of things well       we cannot be stout      till somersets out  as the old saying is  11 mr lewis and i dined with the chancellor of the exchequer who eats the most elegantly of any man i know in town i walked lustily in the park by moonshine till eight to shake off my dinner and wine and then went to sup at mr domvilles with ford and stayed till twelve it is told me today as a great secret that the duke of somerset will be out soon that the thing is fixed but what shall we do with the duchess they say the duke will make her leave the queen out of spite if he be out it has stuck upon that fear a good while already well but lewis gave me a letter from md n25 o lord i did not expect one this fortnight faith you are mighty good thats certain but i wont answer it because this goes tomorrow only what you say of the printer being taken up i value it not alls safe there nor do i fear anything unless the ministry be changed i hope that danger is over however i shall be in ireland before such a change which could not be i think till the end of the session if the whigs designs had gone onhave not you an apron by leigh madam stella have you all i mentioned in a former letter  12 morning this goes today as usual i think of going into the city but of that at night tis fine moderate weather these two or three days last farewell etc etc     letter 39  london jan 12171112  when i sealed up my letter this morning i looked upon myself to be not worth a groat in the world last night after mr ford and i left domville ford desired me to go with him for a minute upon earnest business and then told me that both he and i were ruined for he had trusted stratford with five hundred pounds for tickets for the lottery and he had been with stratford who confessed he had lost fifteen thousand pounds by sir stephen evans1 who broke last week that he concluded stratford must break too that he could not get his tickets but stratford made him several excuses which seemed very blind ones etc and stratford had near four hundred pounds of mine to buy me five hundred pounds in the south sea company i came home reflecting a little nothing concerned me but md i called all my philosophy and religion up and i thank god it did not keep me awake beyond my usual time above a quarter of an hour this morning i sent for tooke whom i had employed to buy the stock of stratford and settle things with him he told me i was secure for stratford had transferred it to me in form in the south sea house and he had accepted it for me and all was done on stamped parchment however he would be further informed and at night sent me a note to confirm me however i am not yet secure and besides am in pain for ford whom i first brought acquainted with stratford i dined in the city  13 domville and i dined with ford today by appointment the lord mansel told me at court today that i was engaged to him but stratford had promised ford to meet him and me tonight at fords lodgings he did so said he had hopes to save himself in his affair with evans ford asked him for his tickets he said he would send them tomorrow but looking in his pocketbook said he believed he had some of them about him and gave him as many as came to two hundred pounds which rejoiced us much besides he talked so frankly that we might think there is no danger i asked him was there any more to be settled between us in my affair he said no and answered my questions just as tooke had got them from others so i hope i am safe this has been a scurvy affair i believe stella would have half laughed at me to see a suspicious fellow like me overreached i saw prince eugene today at court i dont think him an uglyfaced fellow but well enough and a good shape  14 the parliament was to sit today and met but were adjourned by the queens directions till thursday she designs to make some important speech then she pretended illness but i believe they were not ready and they expect some opposition and the scotch lords are angry2 and must be pacified i was this morning to invite the duke of ormond to our society on thursday where he is then to be introduced he has appointed me at twelve tomorrow about some business i would fain have his help to impeach a certain lord but i doubt we shall make nothing of it i intended to have dined with lord treasurer but i was told he would be busy so i dined with mrs van and at night i sat with lord masham till one lord treasurer was there and chid me for not dining with him he was in very good humour i brought home two flasks of burgundy in my chair i wish md had them you see it is very late so ill go to bed and bid md good night  15 this morning i presented my printer and bookseller to lord rivers to be stationers to the ordnance stationers thats the word i did not write it plain at first i believe it will be worth three hundred pounds a year between them this is the third employment i have got for them rivers told them the doctor commanded him and he durst not refuse it i would have dined with lord treasurer today again but lord mansel would not let me and forced me home with him i was very deep with the duke of ormond today at the cockpit where we met to be private but i doubt i cannot do the mischief i intended my friend penn came there will penn the quaker at the head of his brethren to thank the duke for his kindness to their people in ireland to see a dozen scoundrels with their hats on and the duke complimenting with his off was a good sight enough i sat this evening with sir william robinson3 who has mighty often invited me to a bottle of wine and it is past twelve  16 this being fastday dr freind and i went into the city to dine late like good fasters my printer and bookseller want me to hook in another employment for them in the tower because it was enjoyed before by a stationer although it be to serve the ordnance with oil tallow etc and is worth four hundred pounds per annum more i will try what i can do they are resolved to ask several other employments of the same nature to other offices and i will then grease fat sows and see whether it be possible to satisfy them why am not i a stationer the parliament sits tomorrow and walpole late secretary at war is to be swinged for bribery and the queen is to communicate something of great importance to the two houses at least they say so but i must think of answering your letter in a day or two  17 i went this morning to the duke of ormond about some business and he told me he could not dine with us today being to dine with prince eugene those of our society of the house of commons could not be with us the house sitting late on walpole i left them at nine and they were not come we kept some dinner for them i hope walpole will be sent to the tower and expelled the house but this afternoon the members i spoke with in the court of requests talked dubiously of it it will be a leading card to maul the duke of marlborough for the same crime or at least to censure him the queens message was only to give them notice of the peace she is treating and to desire they will make some law to prevent libels against the government so farewell to grub street  18 i heard today that the commoners of our society did not leave the parliament till eleven at night then went to those i left and stayed till three in the morning walpole is expelled and sent to the tower i was this morning again with lord rivers and have made him give the other employment to my printer and bookseller tis worth a great deal i dined with my friend lewis privately to talk over affairs we want to have this duke of somerset out and he apprehends it will not be but i hope better they are going now at last to change the commissioners of the customs my friend sir matthew dudley will be out and three more and prior will be in i have made ford copy out a small pamphlet and sent it to the press that i might not be known for author tis a letter to the october club4 if ever you heard of such a thingmethinks this letter goes on but slowly for almost a week i want some little conversation with md and to know what they are doing just now i am sick of politics i have not dined with lord treasurer these three weeks he chides me but i dont care i dont  19 i dined today with lord treasurer this is his day of choice company where they sometimes admit me but pretend to grumble and today they met on some extraordinary business the keeper steward both secretaries lord rivers and lord anglesea i left them at seven and came away and have been writing to the bishop of clogher i forgot to know where to direct to him since sir george st georges death5 but i have directed to the same house you must tell me better for the letter is sent by the bellman dont write to me again till this is gone i charge you for i wont answer two letters together the duke of somerset is out and was with his yellow liveries at parliament today you know he had the same with the queen when he was master of the horse we hope the duchess will follow or that he will take her away in spite lord treasurer i hope has now saved his head has the dean received my letter ask him at cards tonight  20 there was a world of people today at court to see prince eugene but all bit for he did not come i saw the duchess of somerset talking with the duke of buckingham she looked a little down but was extremely courteous the queen has the gout but is not in much pain must i fill this line too6 well then so let it be the duke of beaufort7 has a mighty mind to come into our society shall we let him i spoke to the duke of ormond about it and he doubts a little whether to let him in or no they say the duke of somerset is advised by his friends to let his wife stay with the queen i am sorry for it i dined with the secretary today with mixed company i dont love it our society does not meet till friday because thursday will be a busy day in the house of commons for then the duke of marlboroughs bribery is to be examined into about the pension paid him by those that furnished bread to the army  21 i have been five times with the duke of ormond about a perfect trifle and he forgets it i used him like a dog this morning for it i was asked today by several in the court of requests whether it was true that the author of the examiner was taken up in an action of twenty thousand pounds by the duke of marlborough8 i dined in the city where my printer showed me a pamphlet called advice to the october club which he said was sent him by an unknown hand i commended it mightily he never suspected me tis a twopenny pamphlet i came home and got timely to bed but about eleven one of the secretarys servants came to me to let me know that lord treasurer would immediately speak to me at lord mashams upon earnest business and that if i was abed i should rise and come i did so lord treasurer was above with the queen and when he came down he laughed and said it was not he that sent for me the business was of no great importance only to give me a paper which might have been done tomorrow i stayed with them till past one and then got to bed again pize9 take their frolics i thought to have answered your letter  22 dr gastrell was to see me this morning he is an eminent divine one of the canons of christ church and one i love very well he said he was glad to find i was not with james broad i asked what he meant why says he have you not seen the grub street paper that says dr swift was taken up as author of the examiner on an action of twenty thousand pounds and was now at james broads who i suppose is some bailiff i knew of this but at the court of requests twenty people told me they heard i had been taken up lord lansdowne observed to the secretary and me that the whigs spread three lies yesterday that about me and another that maccartney who was turned out last summer10 is again restored to his places in the army and the third that jack hills commission for lieutenant of the tower is stopped and that cadogan is to continue lansdowne thinks they have some design by these reports i cannot guess it did i tell you that sacheverell has desired mightily to come and see me but i have put it off he has heard that i have spoken to the secretary in behalf of a brother whom he maintains and who desires an employment11 tother day at the court of requests dr yalden12 saluted me by name sacheverell who was just by came up to me and made me many acknowledgment and compliments last night i desired lord treasurer to do something for that brother of sacheverells he said he never knew he had a brother but thanked me for telling him and immediately put his name in his tablebook13 i will let sacheverell know this that he may take his measures accordingly but he shall be none of my acquaintance i dined today privately with the secretary left him at six paid a visit or two and came home  23 i dined again today with the secretary but could not despatch some business i had with him he has so much besides upon his hands at this juncture and preparing against the great business tomorrow which we are top full of the ministers design is that the duke of marlborough shall be censured as gently as possible provided his friends will not make head to defend him but if they do it may end in some severer votes a gentleman who was just now with him tells me he is much cast down and fallen away but he is positive if he has but ten friends in the house that they shall defend him to the utmost and endeavour to prevent the least censure upon him which i think cannot be since the bribery is manifest sir solomon medina14 paid him six thousand pounds a year to have the employment of providing bread for the army and the duke owns it in his letter to the commissioners of accounts i was tonight at lord mashams lord dupplin took out my new little pamphlet and the secretary read a great deal of it to lord treasurer they all commended it to the skies and so did i and they began a health to the author but i doubt lord treasurer suspected for he said this is mr davenants style which is his cant when he suspects me15 but i carried the matter very well lord treasurer put the pamphlet in his pocket to read at home ill answer your letter tomorrow  24 the secretary made me promise to dine with him today after the parliament was up i said i would come but i dined at my usual time knowing the house would sit late on this great affair i dined at a tavern with mr domville and another gentleman i have not done so before these many months at ten this evening i went to the secretary but he was not come home i sat with his lady till twelve then came away and he just came as i was gone and he sent to my lodgings but i would not go back and so i know not how things have passed but hope all is well and i will tell you tomorrow day it is late etc  25 the secretary sent to me this morning to know whether we should dine together i went to him and there i learned that the question went against the duke of marlborough by a majority of a hundred so the ministry is mighty well satisfied and the duke will now be able to do no hurt the secretary and i and lord masham etc dined with lieutenantgeneral withers16 who is just going to look after the army in flanders the secretary and i left them a little after seven and i am come home and will now answer your letter because this goes tomorrow let me seethe box at chester oh burn that box and hang that sterne i have desired one to inquire for it who went toward ireland last monday but i am in utter despair of it no i was not splenetic you see what plunges the court has been at to set all right again and that duchess is not out yet and may one day cause more mischief somerset shows all about a letter from the queen desiring him to let his wife continue with her is not that rare i find dingley smelled a rat because the whigs are upish but if ever i hear that word again ill uppish you i am glad you got your rasp safe and sound does stella like her apron your critics about guarantees of succession are puppies thats an answer to the objection the answerers here made the same objection but it is wholly wrong i am of your opinion that lord marlborough is used too hardly i have often scratched out passages from papers and pamphlets sent me before they were printed because i thought them too severe but he is certainly a vile man and has no sort of merit beside the military the examiners are good for little i would fain have hindered the severity of the two or three last but could not i will either bring your papers over or leave them with tooke for whose honesty i will engage and i think it is best not to venture them with me at sea stella is a prophet by foretelling so very positively that all would be well duke of ormond speak against peace no simpleton he is one of the staunchest we have for the ministry neither trouble yourself about the printer he appeared the first day of the term and is to appear when summoned again but nothing else will come of it lord chiefjustice17 is cooled since this new settlement no i will not split my journals in half i will write but once a fortnight but you may do as you will which is read only half at once and tother half next week so now your letter is answered p on these blots what must i say more i will set out in march if there be a fit of fine weather unless the ministry desire me to stay till the end of the session which may be a month longer but i believe they will not for i suppose the peace will be made and they will have no further service for me i must make my canal fine this summer as fine as i can i am afraid i shall see great neglects among my quicksets i hope the cherrytrees on the river walk are fine things now but no more of this  26 i forgot to finish this letter this morning and am come home so late i must give it to the bellman but i would have it go tonight lest you should think there is anything in the story of my being arrested in an action of twenty thousand pounds by lord marlborough which i hear is in dyers letter18 and consequently i suppose gone to ireland farewell dearest md etc etc     letter 40  london jan 26 171112  i have no gilt paper left of this size so you must be content with plain our society dined together today for it was put off as i told you upon lord marlboroughs business on thursday the duke of ormond dined with us today the first time we were thirteen at table and lord lansdowne came in after dinner so that we wanted but three the secretary proposed the duke of beaufort who desires to be one of our society but i stopped it because the duke of ormond doubts a little about it and he was gone before it was proposed i left them at seven and sat this evening with poor mrs wesley who has been mightily ill today with a fainting fit she has often convulsions too she takes a mixture with asafoetida which i have now in my nose and everything smells of it i never smelt it before tis abominable we have eight packets they say due from ireland  27 i could not see prince eugene at court today the crowd was so great the whigs contrive to have a crowd always about him and employ the rabble to give the word when he sets out from any place when the duchess of hamilton came from the queen after church she whispered me that she was going to pay me a visit i went to lady oglethorpes the place appointed for ladies always visit me in third places and she kept me till near four she talks too much is a plaguy detractor and i believe i shall not much like her i was engaged to dine with lord masham they stayed as long as they could yet had almost dined and were going in anger to pull down the brass peg for my hat but lady masham saved it at eight i went again to lord mashams lord treasurer is generally there at night we sat up till almost two lord treasurer has engaged me to contrive some way to keep the archbishop of york1 from being seduced by lord nottingham i will do what i can in it tomorrow tis very late so i must go sleep  28 poor mrs manley the author is very ill of a dropsy and sore leg the printer tells me he is afraid she cannot live long i am heartily sorry for her she has very generous principles for one of her sort and a great deal of good sense and invention she is about forty very homely and very fat mrs van made me dine with her today i was this morning with the duke of ormond and the prolocutor about what lord treasurer spoke to me yesterday i know not what will be the issue there is but a slender majority in the house of lords and we want more we are sadly mortified at the news of the french taking the town in brazil from the portuguese the sixth edition of three thousand of the conduct of the allies is sold and the printer talks of a seventh eleven thousand of them have been sold which is a most prodigious run the little twopenny letter of advice to the october club does not sell i know not the reason for it is finely written i assure you and like a true author i grow fond of it because it does not sell you know that it is usual to writers to condemn the judgment of the world if i had hinted it to be mine everybody would have bought it but it is a great secret  29 i borrowed one or two idle books of contes des fees2 and have been reading them these two days although i have much business upon my hands i loitered till one at home then went to mr lewis at his office and the vicechamberlain told me that lady rialton3 had yesterday resigned her employment of lady of the bedchamber and that lady jane hyde4 lord rochesters daughter a mighty pretty girl is to succeed he said too that lady sunderland would resign in a day or two i dined with lewis and then went to see mrs wesley who is better today but you must know that mr lewis gave me two letters one from the bishop of cloyne with an enclosed from lord inchiquin5 to lord treasurer which he desires i would deliver and recommend i am told that lord was much in with lord wharton and i remember he was to have been one of the lords justices by his recommendation yet the bishop recommends him as a great friend to the church etc ill do what i think proper tother letter was from little saucy md n26 o lord never saw the like under a cover too and by way of journal we shall never have done sirrahs how durst you write so soon sirrahs i wont answer it yet  30 i was this morning with the secretary who was sick and out of humour he would needs drink champagne some days ago on purpose to spite me because i advised him against it and now he pays for it stella used to do such tricks formerly he put me in mind of her lady sunderland has resigned her place too it is lady catherine hyde6 that succeeds lady rialton and not lady jane lady catherine is the late earl of rochesters daughter i dined with the secretary then visited his lady and sat this evening with lady masham the secretary came to us but lord treasurer did not he dined with the master of the rolls7 and stayed late with him our society does not meet till tomorrow sennight because we think the parliament will be very busy tomorrow upon the state of the war and the secretary who is to treat as president must be in the house i fancy my talking of persons and things here must be very tedious to you because you know nothing of them and i talk as if you did you know kevins street and werburgh street and what do you call the street where mrs walls lives and ingoldsby8 and higgins9 and lord santry10 but what care you for lady catherine hyde why do you say nothing of your health sirrah i hope it is well  31 trimnel bishop of norwich11 who was with this lord sunderland at moor park in their travels preached yesterday before the house of lords and today the question was put to thank him and print his sermon but passed against him for it was a terrible whig sermon the bill to repeal the act for naturalising protestant foreigners passed the house of lords today by a majority of twenty though the scotch lords went out and would vote neither way in discontent about the duke of hamiltons patent if you know anything of it a poem is come out today inscribed to me by way of a flirt12 for it is a whiggish poem and good for nothing they plagued me with it in the court of requests i dined with lord treasurer at five alone only with one dutchman prior is now a commissioner of the customs i told you so before i suppose when i came home tonight i found a letter from dr sacheverell thanking me for recommending his brother to lord treasurer and mr secretary for a place lord treasurer sent to him about it so good a solicitor was i although i once hardly thought i should be a solicitor for sacheverell  feb 1 has not your dean of st patrick received my letter you say nothing of it although i writ above a month ago my printer has got the gout and i was forced to go to him today and there i dined it was a most delicious day why dont you observe whether the same days be fine with you tonight at six dr atterbury and prior and i and dr freind met at dr robert freinds13 house at westminster who is master of the school there we sat till one and were good enough company i here take leave to tell politic dingley that the passage in the conduct of the allies is so far from being blamable that the secretary designs to insist upon it in the house of commons when the treaty of barrier14 is debated there as it now shortly will for they have ordered it to be laid before them the pamphlet of advice to the october club begins now to sell but i believe its fame will hardly reach ireland tis finely written i assure you i long to answer your letter but wont yet you know tis late etc  2 this ends christmas15 and what care i i have neither seen nor felt nor heard any christmas this year i passed a lazy dull day i was this morning with lord treasurer to get some papers from him which he will remember as much as a cat although it be his own business it threatened rain but did not much and prior and i walked an hour in the park which quite put me out of my measures i dined with a friend hard by and in the evening sat with lord masham till twelve lord treasurer did not come this is an idle diningday usually with him we want to hear from holland how our peace goes on for we are afraid of those scoundrels the dutch lest they should play us tricks lord mar16 a scotch earl was with us at lord mashams i was arguing with him about the stubbornness and folly of his countrymen they are so angry about the affair of the duke of hamilton whom the queen has made a duke of england and the house of lords will not admit him he swears he would vote for us but dare not because all scotland would detest him if he did he should never be chosen again nor be able to live there  3 i was at court today to look for a dinner but did not like any that were offered me and i dined with lord mountjoy the queen has the gout in her knee and was not at chapel i hear we have a dutch mail but i know not what news although i was with the secretary this morning he showed me a letter from the hanover envoy mr bothmar complaining that the barrier treaty is laid before the house of commons and desiring that no infringement may be made in the guarantee of the succession but the secretary has written him a peppering answer i fancy you understand all this and are able statesgirls since you have read the conduct of the allies we are all preparing against the birthday i think it is wednesday next if the queens gout increases it will spoil sport prince eugene has two fine suits made against it and the queen is to give him a sword worth four thousand pounds the diamonds set transparent  4 i was this morning soliciting at the house of commons door for mr vesey a son of the archbishop of tuam17 who has petitioned for a bill to relieve him in some difficulty about his estate i secured him above fifty members i dined with lady masham we have no packet from holland as i was told yesterday and this wind will hinder many people from appearing at the birthday who expected clothes from holland i appointed to meet a gentleman at the secretarys tonight and they both failed the house of commons have this day made many severe votes about our being abused by our allies those who spoke drew all their arguments from my book and their votes confirm all i writ the court had a majority of a hundred and fifty all agree that it was my book that spirited them to these resolutions i long to see them in print my head has not been as well as i could wish it for some days past but i have not had any giddy fit and i hope it will go over  5 the secretary turned me out of his room this morning and showed me fifty guineas rolled up which he was going to give some french spy i dined with four irishmen at a tavern today i thought i had resolved against it before but i broke it i played at cards this evening at lady mashams but i only played for her while she was waiting and i won her a pool and supped there lord treasurer was with us but went away before twelve the ladies and lords have all their clothes ready against tomorrow i saw several mighty fine and i hope there will be a great appearance in spite of that spiteful french fashion of the whiggish ladies not to come which they have all resolved to a woman and i hope it will more spirit the queen against them for ever  6 i went to dine at lord mashams at three and met all the company just coming out of court a mighty crowd they stayed long for their coaches i had an opportunity of seeing several lords and ladies of my acquaintance in their fineries lady ashburnham18 looked the best in my eyes they say the court was never fuller nor finer lord treasurer his lady and two daughters and mrs hill dined with lord and lady masham the five ladies were monstrous fine the queen gave prince eugene the diamond sword today but nobody was by when she gave it except my lord chamberlain there was an entertainment of opera songs at night and the queen was at all the entertainment and is very well after it i saw lady wharton19 as ugly as the devil coming out in the crowd all in an undress she has been with the marlborough daughters20 and lady bridgewater21 in st jamess looking out of the window all undressed to see the sight i do not hear that one whig lady was there except those of the bedchamber nothing has made so great a noise as one kelsons chariot that cost nine hundred and thirty pounds the finest was ever seen the rabble huzzaed him as much as they did prince eugene this is birthday chat  7 our society met today the duke of ormond was not with us we have lessened our dinners which were grown so extravagant that lord treasurer and everybody else cried shame i left them at seven visited for an hour and then came home like a good boy the queen is much better after yesterdays exercise her friends wish she would use a little more i opposed lord jerseys22 election into our society and he is refused i likewise opposed the duke of beaufort but i believe he will be chosen in spite of me i dont much care i shall not be with them above two months for i resolve to set out for ireland the beginning of april next before i treat them again and see my willows  8 i dined today in the city this morning a scoundrel dog one of the queens music a german whom i had never seen got access to me in my chamber by patricks folly and gravely desired me to get an employment in the customs for a friend of his who would be very grateful and likewise to forward a project of his own for raising ten thousand pounds a year upon operas i used him civiller than he deserved but it vexed me to the pluck23 he was told i had a mighty interest with lord treasurer and one word of mine etc well i got home early on purpose to answer mds letter n26 for this goes tomorrowwell i never saw such a letter in all my life so saucy so journalish so sanguine so pretending so everything i satisfied all your fears in my last all is gone well as you say yet you are an impudent slut to be so positive you will swagger so upon your sagacity that we shall never have done pray dont mislay your reply i would certainly print it if i had it here how long is it i suppose half a sheet was the answer written in ireland yes yes you shall have a letter when you come from ballygall i need not tell you again whos out and whos in we can never get out the duchess of somersetso they say presto writ the conduct etc do they like it i dont care whether they do or no but the resolutions printed tother day in the votes are almost quotations from it and would never have passed if that book had not been written i will not meddle with the spectator let him fairsex it to the worlds end my disorder is over but blood was not from the pleswell madam dingley the frost why we had a great frost but i forget how long ago it lasted above a week or ten days i believe about six weeks ago but it did not break so soon with us i think as december 29 yet i think it was about that time on second thoughts md can have no letter from presto says you and yet four days before you own you had my thirtyseventh unreasonable sluts the bishop of gloucester is not dead24 and i am as likely to succeed the duke of marlborough as him if he were theres enough for that now it is not unlikely that the duke of shrewsbury will be your governor at least i believe the duke of ormond will not returnwell stella again why really three editions of the conduct etc is very much for ireland it is a sign you have some honest among you well i will do mr manley25 all the service i can but he will ruin himself what business had he to engage at all about the city cant he wish his cause well and be quiet when he finds that stirring will do it no good and himself a great deal of hurt i cannot imagine who should open my letter it must be done at your sideif i hear of any thoughts of turning out mr manley i will endeavour to prevent it i have already had all the gentlemen of ireland here upon my back often for defending him so now i have answered your saucy letter my humble service to goody stoyte and catherine i will come soon for my dinner  9 morning my cold goes off at last but i think i have got a small new one i have no news since last they say we hear by the way of calais that peace is very near concluding i hope it may be true ill go and seal up my letter and give it myself tonight into the postoffice and so i bid my dearest md farewell till tonight i heartily wish myself with them as hope saved my willows and quicksets and trees will be finely improved i hope this year it has been fine hard frosty weather yesterday and today farewell etc etc etc     letter 411  london feb 9 171112  when my letter is gone and i have none of yours to answer my conscience is so clear and my shoulder so light and i go on with such courage to prate upon nothing to deerichar md oo would wonder i dined with sir matthew dudley who is newly turned out of commission of the customs he affects a good heart and talks in the extremity of whiggery which was always his principle though he was gentle a little while he kept in employment we can yet get no packets from holland i have not been with any of the ministry these two or three days i keep out of their way on purpose for a certain reason for some time though i must dine with the secretary tomorrow the choosing of the company being left to me i have engaged lord anglesea2 and lord carteret3 and have promised to get three more but i have a mind that none else should be admitted however if i like anybody at court tomorrow i may perhaps invite them i have got another cold but not very bad nite  md  10 i saw prince eugene at court today very plain hes plaguy yellow and tolerably ugly besides the court was very full and people had their birthday clothes i dined with the secretary today i was to invite five but i only invited two lord anglesea and lord carteret pshaw i told you this but yesterday we have no packets from holland yet here are a parcel of drunken whiggish lords like your lord santry4 who come into chocolatehouses and rail aloud at the tories and have challenges sent them and the next morning come and beg pardon general ross5 was like to swinge the marquis of winchester6 for this trick tother day and we have nothing else now to talk of till the parliament has had another bout with the state of the war as they intended in a few days they have ordered the barrier treaty to be laid before them and it was talked some time ago as if there was a design to impeach lord townshend who made it i have no more politics now nite dee md  11 i dined with lord anglesea today who had seven irishmen to be my companions of which two only were coxcombs one i did not know and tother was young blith7 who is a puppy of figure here with a fine chariot he asked me one day at court when i had been just talking with some lords who stood near me doctor when shall we see you in the county of meath i whispered him to take care what he said for the people would think he was some barbarian he never would speak to me since till we met today i went to lady mashams tonight and sat with lord treasurer and the secretary there till past two oclock and when i came home found some letters from ireland which i read but can say nothing of them till tomorrow tis so very late but i8 must always be9 late or early nite deelest sollahs10  12 one letter was from the bishop of clogher last night and tother from walls about mrs souths11 salary and his own pension of 18 pounds for his tithe of the park i will do nothing in either the first i cannot serve in and the other is a trifle only you may tell him i had his letter and will speak to ned southwell about what he desires me you say nothing of your deans receiving my letter i find clements12 whom i recommended to lord anglesea last year at wallss desire or rather the bishop of cloghers is mightily in lord angleseas favour you may tell the bishop and walls so i said to lord anglesea that i was glad i had the good luck to recommend him etc i dined in the city with my printer to consult with him about some papers lord treasurer gave me last night as he always does too late however i will do something with them my third cold is a little better i never had anything like it before three colds successively i hope i shall have the fourth13 those messengers come from holland today and they brought over the six packets that were due i know not the particulars yet for when i was with the secretary at noon they were just opening but one thing i find that the dutch are playing us tricks and tampering with the french they are dogs i shall know more tomollow md14  13 i dined today privately with my friend lewis at his lodgings to consult about some observations on the barrier treaty our news from holland is not good the french raise difficulties and make such offers to the allies as cannot be accepted and the dutch are uneasy that we are likely to get anything for ourselves and the whigs are glad at all this i came home early and have been very busy three or four hours i had a letter from dr pratt15 today by a private hand recommending the bearer to me for something that i shall not trouble myself about wesley16 writ to recommend the same fellow to me his expression is that hearing i am acquainted with my lord treasurer he desires i would do so and so a matter of nothing what puppies are mankind i hope i shall be wiser when i have once done with courts i think you hant troubled me much with your recommendations i would do you all the saavis17 i could  pray have you got your aplon18 maram ppt i paid for it but yesterday that puts me in mind of it i writ an inventory of what things i sent by leigh in one of my letters did you compare it with what you got i hear nothing of your cards now do you never play yes at ballygall go to bed nite deelest md19  14 our society dined today at mr secretarys house i went there at four but hearing the house of commons would sit late upon the barrier treaty i went for an hour to kensington to see lord mashams children my young nephew20 his son of six months old has got a swelling in his neck i fear it is the evil we did not go to dinner till eight at night and i left them at ten the commons have been very severe on the barrier treaty as you will find by their votes a whig member took out the conduct of the allies and read that passage about the succession with great resentment but none seconded him the church party carried every vote by a great majority the ab21 dublin is so railed at by all who come from ireland that i can defend him no longer lord anglesea assured me that the story of applying piso out of tacitus22 to lord treasurers being wounded is true i believe the duke of beaufort will be admitted to our society next meeting today i published the fable of midas23 a poem printed in a loose halfsheet of paper i know not how it will sell but it passed wonderfully at our society tonight and mr secretary read it before me the other night to lord treasurer at lord mashams where they equally approved of it tell me how it passes with you i think this paper is larger than ordinary for here is six days journal and no nearer the bottom i fear these journals are very dull nite my deelest lives  15 mr lewis and i dined by invitation with a scotch acquaintance after i had been very busy in my chamber till two afternoon my third cold is now very troublesome on my breast especially in the morning this is a great revolution in my health colds never used to return so soon with me or last so long tis very surprising this news today of the dauphin and dauphiness both dying within six days they say the old king is almost heartbroke he has had prodigious mortifications in his family the dauphin has left two little sons of four and two years old the eldest is sick there is a foolish story got about the town that lord strafford one of our plenipotentiaries is in the interests of france and it has been a good while said that lord privy seal24 and he do not agree very well they are both long practised in business but neither of them of much parts strafford has some life and spirit but is infinitely proud and wholly illiterate nite md  16 i dined today in the city with my printer to finish something i am doing about the barrier treaty25 but it is not quite done i went this evening to lord mashams where lord treasurer sat with us till past twelve the lords have voted an address to the queen to tell her they are not satisfied with the king of frances offers the whigs brought it in of a sudden and the court could not prevent it and therefore did not oppose it the house of lords is too strong in whigs notwithstanding the new creations for they are very diligent and the tories as lazy the side that is down has always most industry the whigs intended to have made a vote that would reflect on lord treasurer but their project was not ripe i hit my face such a rap by calling the coach to stop tonight that it is plaguy sore the bone beneath the eye nite dee logues  17 the court was mighty full today and has been these many sundays but the queen was not at chapel she has got a little fit of the gout in her foot the good of going to court is that one sees all ones acquaintance whom otherwise i should hardly meet twice a year prince eugene dines with the secretary today with about seven or eight general officers or foreign ministers

sometimes that if i were a dozen years younger i would cultivate his favour and trust my fortune with his but what care oo for all this i am sorry when i came first acquainted with this ministry that i did not send you their names and characters and then you would have relished what2 i would have writ especially if i had let you into the particulars of affairs but enough of this nite deelest

to the bath in a few weeks our peace goes on but slowly the dutch are playing tricks and we do not push it strongly as we ought the fault of our court is delay of which the queen has a great deal and lord treasurer is not without his share but pay richar md ret us know a little of your life and tonvelsasens3 do you play at ombre or visit the dean and goody walls and stoytes and manleys as usual i must have a letter from oo to fill the other side of this sheet let me know what you do is my aunt alive yet  oh pray now i think of it be so kind to step to my aunt and take notice of my greatgrandfathers picture you know he has a ring on his finger with a seal of an anchor and dolphin about it but i think there is besides at the bottom of the picture the same coat of arms quartered with another which i suppose was my greatgrandmothers if this be so it is a stronger argument than the seal and pray see whether you think that coat of arms was drawn at the same time with the picture or whether it be of a later hand and ask my aunt what she knows about it but perhaps there is no such coat of arms on the picture and i only dreamed it my reason is because i would ask some herald here whether i should choose that coat or one in guillims large folio of heraldry4 where my uncle godwin is named with another coat of arms of three stags this is sad stuff to rite so nite md  25 i

have but so many places passed the house of commons and will pass the house of lords in spite of the ministry which you know is a great lessening of the queens power four of the new lords voted

treasurer was there but i thought i thought he looked melancholy just as he did at the beginning of the session and he was not so merry as usual in short the majority in the house of lords is a very weak one and he has much ado to keep it up and he is not able to make those removes he would and oblige his friends and i doubt too19 he does not take care enough about it or rather cannot do all

court of requests to get some lords to be at a committee tomorrow about a friends bill and then the duke of beaufort gave me a poem finely bound in folio printed at stamford and writ by a country

ought to have gone saturday last the pain increased with mighty violence in my left shoulder and collarbone and that side my neck on thursday morning appeared great red spots in all those places where my pain was and the violence of the pain was confined to my neck behind a little on the left side which was so violent that i had not a minutes ease nor hardly a minutes sleep in three days and nights the spots increased every day and bred little pimples which are now grown white and full of corruption though small the red still continues too and most prodigious hot and inflamed the disease is the shingles i eat nothing but watergruel am very weak but out of all violent pain the doctors say it would have ended in some violent disease if it had not come out thus i shall now recover fast i have

shoulder which grew worse and spread for six days then broke all out by my collar and left side of my neck in monstrous red spots inflamed and these grew to small pimples for four days i had no rest nor nights for a pain in my neck then i grew a little better afterward where my pains were a cruel itching seized me beyond whatever i could imagine and kept me awake several nights i rubbed it vehemently but did not scratch it then it grew into three or four great sores like blisters and run at last i advised the doctor to use it like a blister so i did with melilot2 plasters which still run and am now in pain enough but am daily mending i kept my chamber a fortnight then went out a day or two but then confined myself again two days ago i went to a neighbour to dine but yesterday again kept at home today i will venture abroad a little and hope to be well in a week or ten days i never suffered so much in my life i have taken my breeches in above two inches so i am leaner which

in my shoulder and collar i keep flannel on it and rub it with brandy and take a nasty diet drink i still itch terribly and have some few pimples i am weak and sweat and then the flannel makes me mad with itching but i think my pain lessens a journal while i was sick would have been a noble thing made up of pain and physic visits and messages the two last were almost as troublesome as the two first one good circumstance is that i am grown much leaner i believe i told you that i have taken in my breeches two inches i had your n29 last night in answer to your good opinion of my disease the doctors said they never saw anything so odd of the kind they were not properly shingles but herpes miliaris and twenty other hard names i can never be sick like other people but always something out of the common way and as for your notion of its coming without pain it neither came nor stayed nor went without pain and the most pain i ever bore in my life medemeris2 is retired in the country with the beast her husband long ago i thank the bishop of clogher for his proxy i will write to him soon here is dillys wife in town but i have not seen her yet no sinkerton3 tis not a sign of health but a sign that if it had not come out some terrible fit of sickness would have followed i was at our society last thursday to receive a new member the chancellor of the exchequer4 but i drink nothing above wine and water we shall have a peace i hope soon or at least entirely broke but i believe the first my letter to lord treasurer about the english tongue5 is now printing and i suffer my name to be put at the end of it which i never did before in my life the appendix to the third part of john bull6 was published yesterday it is equal to the rest i hope you read john bull it was a scotch gentleman7 a friend of mine that writ it but they put it upon me the parliament will hardly be up till june we were like to be undone some days ago with a tack but we carried it bravely and the whigs came in to help us poor lady masham i am afraid will lose her only son about a twelvemonth old with the kings evil i never would let mrs fenton see me during my illness though she often came but she has been once here since i recovered bernage has been twice to see me of late his regiment will be broke and he only upon halfpay so perhaps he thinks he will want me again i am told here the bishop of clogher and family are coming over but he says nothing of it himself i have been returning the visits of those that sent howdees8 in my sickness particularly the duchess of hamilton who came and sat with me two hours i make bargains with all people that i dine with to let me scrub my back against a chair and the duchess of ormond9 was forced to bear it the other day many of my friends are gone to kensington where the queen has been removed for some time this is a long letter for a kick10 body i will begin the next in the journal way though my journals will be sorry ones my left hand is very

that i intend my next shall be in the old way and yet i shall perhaps break my resolution when i feel pain i believe i have lost credit with you in relation to my coming over but i protest it is impossible for one who has anything to do with this ministry to be certain when he fixes any time there is a business which till it take some turn or other i cannot leave this place in prudence or honour and i never wished so much as now that i had stayed in ireland but the die is cast and is now a spinning and till it settles i cannot tell whether it be an ace or a sise2 i am confident by what you know yourselves that you will justify me in all this the moment i am used ill i will leave them but know not how to do it while things are in suspense the session will soon be over i believe in a fortnight and the peace we hope will be made in a short time and there will be no further occasion for me nor have i anything to trust to but court gratitude so that i expect to see my willows3 a month after the parliament is up but i will take md in my way and not go to laracor like an unmannerly spraenekich ferrow4 have you seen my letter to lord treasurer there are two answers come out to it already5 though it is no politics but a harmless proposal about the improvement of the english tongue i believe if i writ an essay upon a straw some fool would answer it about ten days hence i expect a letter from md n30you are now writing it near the end as i guessi have not received dds money but i will give you a note for it on parvisol and bed oo paadon6 i have not done it before i am just now thinking to go lodge at kensington for the air lady masham has teased me to do it but business has hindered me but now lord treasurer has removed thither fifteen of our society dined together under a canopy in an arbour at parsons green7 last thursday i never saw anything so fine and romantic we got a great victory last wednesday in the house of lords by a majority i think of twentyeight and the whigs had desired their friends to bespeak places to see lord treasurer carried to the tower8 i met your higgins9 here yesterday he roars at the insolence of the whigs in ireland talks much of his own sufferings and expenses in asserting the cause of the church and i find he would fain plead merit enough to desire that his fortune should be mended i believe he designs to make as much noise as he can in order to preferment pray let the provost when he sees you give you ten english shillings and i will give as much here to the man who delivered me rymers books10 he knows the meaning tell him i will not trust him but that you can order it to be paid me here and i will trust you till i see you have i told you that the rogue patrick has left me these two months to my great satisfaction i have got another who seems to be much better if he continues it i am printing a threepenny pamphlet11 and shall print another in a fortnight and then i have done unless some new occasion starts is my curate warburton married to mrs melthrop in my parish so i hear or is it a lie has raymond got to his new house do you see joe now and then what luck have you at ombre how stands it with the dean12 my service to mrs stoyte and catherine if she be come from wales i have not yet seen dilly ashes wife i called once but she was not at home i think she is under the doctors hand13 i believe the news of the duke of ormond producing letters in the council of war with orders not to fight will surprise you in ireland lord treasurer said in the house of lords that in a few days the treaty of peace should be laid before them and our court thought it wrong to hazard a battle and sacrifice many lives in such a juncture if the peace holds all will do well otherwise i know not how we shall weather it and it was reckoned as a wrong step in politics for lord treasurer to open himself so much the secretary would not go so far to satisfy the whigs in the house of commons but there all went swimmingly ill say no more to oo tonite sellohs because i must send away the letter not by the bell14 but early and besides i have not much more to say at zis plesent liting15 does md never read at all now pee16 but oo walk plodigiousry i suppose oo make nothing of walking to to to ay to donnybrook i walk too as much as i can because sweating is good but ill walk more if i go to kensington i suppose i shall have

fortnight partly for the air and exercise partly to be near the court where dinners are to be found i generally get a lift in a coach to town and in the evening i walk back on saturday i dined with the duchess of ormond at her lodge near sheen and thought to get a boat back as usual i walked by the bank to cue kew but no boat then to mortlake but no boat and it was nine oclock at last a little sculler called full of nasty people i made him set me down at hammersmith so walked two miles to this place and got here by eleven last night i had another such difficulty i was in the city till past ten at night it rained hard but no coach to be had it gave over a little and i walked all the way here and got home by twelve i love these shabby difficulties when they are over but i hate them because they arise from not having a thousand pound a year i had your n30 about three days ago which i will now answer and first i did not relapse but found2 i came out before i ought and so and so as i have told you in some of my last the first coming abroad made people think i was quite recovered and i had no more messages afterwards well but john bull is not writ by the person you imagine as hope3 it is too good for another to own had it been grub street i would have let people think as they please and i think thats right is not it now so flap ee hand and make wry mouth ooself sauci doxi

now i am against dr smith i drink little water with my wine yet i believe he is right yet dr cockburn told me a little wine would not hurt me but it is so hot and dry and water is so dangerous the worst thing here is my evenings at lord mashams where lord treasurer comes and we sit till after twelve but it is convenient i should be among them for a while as much as possible i need not tell oo why but i hope that will be at an end in a month or two one way or other and i am resolved it shall but i cant go to tunbridge or anywhere else out of the way in this juncture so ppt designs for templeoag what a name is that whereabouts is that place i hope not very far from dublin higgins is here roaring that all is wrong in ireland and would have me get him an audience of lord treasurer to tell him so but i will have nothing to do in it no not i faith we have had no thunder till last night and till then we were dead for want of rain but there fell a great deal no field looked green i reckon the queen will go to windsor in three or four weeks and if the secretary takes a house there i shall be sometimes with him but how affectedly ppt talks of my being here all the summer which i do not intend nor to stay one minute longer in england than becomes the circumstances i am in i wish you would go soon into the country and take a good deal of it and where better than trim joe will

waters i hope dd had her bill and has her money remember to write a due time before me money is wanted and be good galls dood dallars i mean and no crying dallars i heard somebody coming upstairs and forgot i was in the country and i was afraid of a visitor that is one advantage of being here that i am not teased with solicitors molt the chemist is my acquaintance my service to dr smith i sent the question to him about sir walter raleighs cordial and the answer he returned is in these words it is directly after mr boyles receipt that commission is performed if he wants any of it molt shall use him fairly i suppose smith is one of your physicians so now your letter is fully and impartially answered not as rascals answer me i believe if i writ an essay upon a straw i should have a shoal of answerers but no matter for that you see i can answer without making any reflections as becomes men of learning well but now for the peace why we expect it daily but the french have the staff in their own hands and we trust to their honesty i wish it were otherwise things are now in the way of being soon in the extremes of well or ill i hope and believe the first lord wharton is gone out of town in a rage and curses himself and friends for ruining themselves in defending lord marlborough and godolphin and taking nottingham into their favour he swears he will meddle no more during this reign a pretty speech at sixtysix and the queen is near twenty years younger and now in very good health for you must know her health is fixed by a certain reason that she has done with braces i must use the

lele me     letter 491  kensington july 1 1712  i never was in a worse station for writing letters than this especially for writing to md since i left off my journals for i go to town early and when i come home at night i generally go to lord masham where lord treasurer comes and we stay till past twelve but i am now resolved to write journals again though my shoulder is not yet well for i have still a few itching pimples and a little pain now and then it is now high cherrytime with us take notice is it so soon with you and we have early apricots and gooseberries are ripe on sunday archdeacon parnell came here to see me it seems he has been ill for grief of his wifes death2 and has been two months at the bath he has a mind to go to dunkirk with jack hill3 and i persuade him to it and have spoke to hill to receive him but i doubt he wont have spirit to go i have made ford4 gazetteer and got two hundred pounds a year settled on the employment by the secretary of state beside the perquisites it is the prettiest employment in england of its bigness yet the puppy does not seem satisfied with it i think people keep some follies to themselves till they have occasion to produce them he thinks it not genteel enough and makes twenty difficulties tis impossible to make any man easy his salary is paid him every week if he pleases without taxes or abatements he has little to do for it he has a pretty office with coals candles papers etc can frank what letters he will and his perquisites if he takes care may be worth one hundred pounds more i hear the bishop of clogher is landing or landed in england and i hope to see him in a few days i was to see mrs bradley5 on sunday night her youngest son is married to somebody worth nothing and her daughter was forced to leave lady giffard because she was striking up an intrigue with a footman who played well upon the flute this is the mothers account of it yesterday the old bishop of worcester6 who pretends to be a prophet went to the queen by appointment to prove to her majesty out of daniel and the revelations that four years hence there would be a war of religion that the king of france would be a protestant and fight on their side that the popedom would be destroyed etc and declared that he would be content to give up his bishopric if it were not true lord treasurer who told it me was by and some others and i am told lord treasurer confounded him sadly in his own learning which made the old fool very quarrelsome he is near ninety years old old bradley is fat and lusty and has lost his palsy have you seen tolands invitation to dismal7 how do you like it but it is an imitation of horace and perhaps you dont understand horace here has been a great sweep of employments and we expect still more removals the court seems resolved to make thorough work mr hill intended to set out tomorrow for dunkirk of which he is appointed governor but he tells me today that he cannot go till thursday or friday i wish it were over mr secretary tells me he is in no fear at all that france will play tricks with us if we have dunkirk once all is safe we rail now all against the dutch who indeed have acted like knaves fools and madmen mr secretary is soon to be made a viscount he desired i would draw the preamble of his patent but i excused myself from a work that might lose me a great deal of reputation and get me very little we would fain have the court make him an earl but it would not be and therefore he will not take the title of bullenbrook8 which is lately extinct in the elder branch of his family i have advised him to be called lord pomfret but he thinks that title is already in some other family9 and besides he objects that it is in yorkshire where he has no estate but there is nothing in that and i love pomfret dont you love pomfret why tis in all our histories they are full of pomfret castle but whats all this to you you dont care for this is goody stoyte come to london i have not heard of her yet the dean of st patricks never had the manners to answer my letter i was tother day to see sterne10 and his wife she is not half so handsome as when i saw her with you at dublin they design to pass the summer at a house near lord somerss about a dozen miles off you never told me how my letter to lord treasurer passes in ireland i suppose you are drinking at this time templesomethings11 waters steele was arrested the other day for making a lottery directly against an act of parliament he is now under prosecution but they think it will be dropped out of pity12 i believe he will very soon lose his employment for he has been mighty impertinent of late in his spectators and i will never offer a word in his behalf raymond writes me word that the bishop of meath13 was going to summon me in order to suspension for absence if the provost had not prevented him i am prettily rewarded for getting them their firstfruits with a p we have had very little hot weather during the whole month of june and for a week past we have had a great deal of rain though not every day i am just now told that the governor of dunkirk has not orders yet to deliver up the town to jack hill and his forces but expects them daily this must put off hills journey a while and i dont like these stoppings in such an affair go get oo gone and drink oo waters if this rain has not spoiled them sauci doxi i have no more to say to oo at plesent but rove pdfr and md and me and podefr will rove pdfr and md and me i wish you had taken any account when i sent money to mrs brent i believe i hant done it a great while

the queen goes on tuesday to windsor and i shall follow in three or four days after i can do nothing here going early to london and coming late from it and supping at lady mashams i dined today with the duke of argyle at cue kew and would not go to the court tonight because of writing to md the bishop of clogher has been here this fortnight i see him as often as i can poor master ashe has a sad redness in his face it is st anthonys fire his face all swelled and will break in his cheek but no danger since dunkirk has been in our hands grub street has been very fruitful pdfr has writ five or six grub street papers this last week have you seen tolands invitation to dismal or hue and cry after dismal or ballad on dunkirk or argument that dunkirk is not in our hands poh you have seen nothing i am dead here with the hot weather yet i walk every night home and believe it does me good but my shoulder is not yet right itchings and scratchings and small achings did i tell you i had made ford gazetteer with two hundred pounds a year salary beside perquisites i had a letter lately from parvisol who says my canal looks very finely i long to see it but no apples all blasted again he tells me there will be a triennial visitation in august i must send raymond another proxy so now i will answer oo rettle n332 dated june 17 ppt writes as well as ever for all her waters i wish i had never come here as often and as heartily as ppt what had i to do here i have heard of the bishops making me uneasy but i did not think it was because i never writ to him a little would make me write to him but i dont know what to say i find i am obliged to the provost for keeping the bishop3 from being impertinent yes maram dd but oo would not be content with letters flom pdfr of six lines or twelve either fais i hope ppt will have done with the waters soon and find benefit by them i believe if they were as far off as wexford they would do as much good for i take the journey to contribute as much as anything i can assure you the bishop of cloghers being here does not in the least affect my staying or going i never talked to higgins but once in my life in the street and i believe he and i shall hardly meet but by chance what care i whether my letter to lord treasurer be commended there or no why does not somebody among you answer it as three or four have done here i am now sitting with nothing but my nightgown for heat ppt shall have a great bible i have put it down in my memlandums4 just now and dd shall be repaid her tother book but patience all in good time you are so hasty a dog

fifteen times evly molning in milk porridge leles fol oo nowand leles fol oo rettle and evly kind of sing7and now i must say something else you hear secretary st john is made viscount bullinbrook8 i can hardly persuade him to take that title because the eldest branch of his family had it in an earldom and it was last year extinct if he did not take it i advised him to be lord pomfret which i think is a noble title you hear of it often in the chronicles pomfret castle but we believed it was among the titles of some other lord jack hill sent his sister a pattern of a headdress from dunkirk it was like our fashion twenty years ago only not quite so high and looked very ugly i have made trapp9 chaplain to lord bullinbroke and he is mighty happy and thankful for it mr addison returned me

river and the holly and the cherrytrees on the riverwalk  19 i could not send this letter last post being called away before i could fold or finish it i dined yesterday with lord treasurer sat with

sleepy at nine i must shave head and face and meet lord bullinbrook at eleven and dine again with lord treasurer today there will be another grub10 a letter from the pretender to a whig lord grub street has but ten days to live then an act of parliament takes place that ruins it by taxing every halfsheet at a halfpenny we have news just come but not the particulars that the earl of albemarle11 at the head of eight thousand dutch is beaten lost the greatest part of his men and himself a prisoner this perhaps may cool their courage and make them think of a peace the duke of ormond has got

least the reason of my resentment at it is because you talk as glibly of a thing as if it were done which for aught i know is farther from being done than ever since i hear not a word of it though the town is full of it and the court always giving me joy and vexation you might be sure i would have let you know as soon as it was done but i believe you fancied i would affect not to tell it you but let you learn it from newspapers and reports i remember only there was something in your letter about mes money and that shall be taken care of on the other side i left windsor on monday last upon lord bolingbrokes being gone to france and somebodys being here that i ought often to consult with in an affair i am upon but that person talks of returning to windsor again and i believe i shall follow him i am now in a hedgelodging very busy as i am every day till noon so that this letter is like to be short and you are not to blame me these two months for i protest if i study ever so hard i cannot in that time compass what i am upon we have a fever both here and at windsor which hardly anybody misses but it lasts not above three or four days and kills nobody2 the queen has forty servants down of it at once i dined yesterday with treasurer but could do no business though he sent for me i thought on purpose but he desires i will dine with him again today windsor is a most delightful place and at this time abounds in dinners my lodgings there look upon eton and the thames i wish i was owner of them they belong to a prebend god knows what was in your letter and if it be not answered whose fault is it sauci dallarsdo you know that grub street is dead and gone last week no more ghosts or murders now for love or money i plied it pretty close the last fortnight and published at least seven penny papers of my own besides some of other peoples but now every single halfsheet pays a halfpenny to the queen3 the observator is fallen the medleys are jumbled together with the flying post the examiner is deadly sick the spectator keeps up and doubles its price i know not how long it will hold have you seen the red stamp the papers are marked with methinks it is worth a halfpenny the stamping it lord bolingbroke and prior set out for france last saturday my lords business is to hasten the peace before the dutch are too much mauled and hinder france from carrying the jest of beating them too far have you seen the fourth part of john bull4 it is equal to the rest and extremely good the bishop of cloghers son has been ill of st anthonys fire but is now quite well i was afraid his face would be spoiled but it is not dilly is just as he used to be and puns as plentifully and as bad the two brothers see one another but i think not the two sisters raymond writ to me that he intended to invite you to trim are you have you will you be there wont oo see pool laratol5 parvisol says i shall have no fruit blasts have taken away all pray observe the cherrytrees on the riverwalk but oo are too lazy to take such a journey if you have not your letters in due time for two months hence impute it to my being tosticated between this and windsor and pray send me again the state of mes money for i will not look into your letter for it poor lord winchelsea6 is dead to my great grief he was a worthy honest gentleman and particular friend of mine and what is yet worse my old acquaintance mrs finch7 is now countess of winchelsea the title being fallen to her husband but without much estate i have been poring my eyes all this morning and it is now past two afternoon so i shall take a little walk in the park do you play at ombre still or is that off by mr stoytes absence and mrs manleys grief somebody was telling me of a strange sister that mrs manley has got in

i never was so long without writing to md as now since i left them nor ever will again while i am able to write i have expected from one week to another that something would be done in my own affairs but nothing at all is nor i dont know when anything will or whether ever at all so slow are people at doing favours i have been much out of order of late with the old giddiness in my head i took a vomit for it two days ago and will take another about a day or two hence i have eat mighty little fruit yet i impute my disorder to that little and shall henceforth wholly forbear it i am engaged in a long work and have done all i can of it and wait for some papers from the ministry for materials for the rest and they delay me as if it were a favour i asked of them so that i have been idle here this good while and it happened in a right time when i was too much out of order to study one is kept constantly out of humour by a thousand unaccountable things in public proceedings and when i reason with some friends we cannot conceive how affairs can last as they are god only knows but it is a very melancholy subject for those who have any near concern in it i am again endeavouring as i was last year to keep people2 from breaking to pieces upon a hundred misunderstandings one cannot withhold them from drawing different ways while the enemy is watching to destroy both see how my style is altered by living and thinking and talking among these people instead of my canal and riverwalk and willows i lose all my money here among the ladies3 so that i never play when i can help it being sure to lose i have lost five pounds the five weeks i have been here i hope ppt is luckier at picquet with the dean and mrs walls the dean never answered my letter though i have clearly forgot whether i sent a bill for me in any of my last letters i think i did pray let me know and always give me timely notice i wait here but to see what they will do for me and whenever preferments are given from me as hope saved i will come over  18 i have taken a vomit today and hope i shall be better i have been very giddy since i writ what is before yet not as i used to be more frequent but not so violent yesterday we were alarmed with the queens being ill she had an aguish and feverish fit and you never saw such countenances as we all had such dismal melancholy her physicians from town were sent for but towards night she grew better today she missed her fit and was up we are not now in any fear it will be at worst but an ague and we hope even that will not return lord treasurer would not come here from london because it would make a noise if he came before his usual time which is saturday and he goes away on mondays the whigs have lost a great support in the earl of godolphin4 it is a good jest to hear the ministers talk of him now with humanity and pity because he is dead and can do them no more hurt lady orkney5 the late kings mistress who lives at a fine place five miles from hence called cliffden6 and i are grown mighty acquaintance she is the wisest woman i ever saw and lord treasurer made great use of her advice in the late change of affairs i heard lord marlborough is growing ill of his diabetes which if it be true may soon carry him off and then the ministry will be something more at ease md has been a long time without writing to pdfr though they have not the same cause it is seven weeks since your last came to my hands which was n32 that you may not be mistaken i hope ppt has not wanted her health you were then drinking waters the doctor tells me i must go into a course of steel though i have not the spleen for that they can never give me though i have as much provocation to it as any man alive bernages7 regiment is broke but he is upon halfpay i have not seen him this long time but i suppose he is overrun with melancholy my lord shrewsbury is certainly designed to be governor of ireland and i believe the duchess will please the people there mightily the irish whig leaders promise great things to themselves from his government but care shall be taken if possible to prevent them mrs fenton8 has writ to me that she has been forced to leave lady giffard and come to town for a rheumatism that lady does not love to be troubled with sick people mrs fenton writes to me as one dying and desires i would think of her son i have not answered her letter she is retired9 to mrs poveys is my aunt alive yet and do you ever see her i suppose she has forgot the loss of her son is raymonds new house quite finished and does he squander as he used to do has he yet spent all his wifes fortune i hear there are five or six people putting strongly in for my livings god help them but if ever the court should give me anything i would recommend raymond to the duke of ormond not for any particular friendship to him but because it would be proper for the minister of trim to have laracor you may keep the goldstudded snuffbox now for my brother hill governor of dunkirk has sent me the finest that ever you saw10 it is allowed at court that none in england comes near it though it did not cost above twenty pounds and the duchess of hamilton has made me pockets for it like a womans with a belt and buckle for you know i wear no waistcoat in summer and there are several divisions and one on purpose for my box oh howe have had most delightful weather this whole week but illness and vomiting have hindered me from sharing in a great part of it lady masham made the queen send to kensington for some of her preserved ginger for me which i take in the morning and hope it will do me good mrs brent11 sent me a letter by a young fellow a printer desiring i would recommend him here which you may tell her i have done but i cannot promise what will come of it for it is necessary they should be made free here12 before they can be employed i remember i put the boy prentice to brent i hope parvisol has set my tithes well this year he has writ nothing to me about it pray talk to him of it when you see him and let him give me an account how things are i suppose the corn is now off the ground i hope he has sold that great ugly horse why dont you sell to him he keeps me at charges for horses that i never ride yours is lame and will never be good for anything the queen will stay here about a month longer i suppose but lady masham will go in ten days to lie in at kensington poor creature she fell down in the court here tother day she would needs walk across it upon some displeasure with her chairmen and was likely to be spoiled so near her time but we hope all is over for a black eye and a sore side though i shall not be at ease till she is brought to bed i find i can fill up a letter some way or other without a journal if i had not a spirit naturally cheerful i should be very much discontented at a thousand things pray god preserve mds health and pdfrs and that i may live far from the envy and discontent that attends those who are

for i used to be ill for three or four days together ready to totter as i walked i take eight pills a day and have taken i believe a hundred and fifty already the queen lord treasurer lady masham and i were all ill together but are now all better only lady masham expects every day to lie in at kensington there was never such a lump of lies spread about the town together as now i doubt not but you will have them in dublin before this comes to you and all without the least grounds of truth i have been mightily put backward in something i am writing by my illness but hope to fetch it up so as to be ready when the parliament meets lord treasurer has had an ugly fit of the rheumatism but is now near quite well i was playing at oneandthirty with him and his family tother night he gave us all twelvepence apiece to begin with it put me in mind of sir william temple2 i asked both him and lady masham seriously whether the queen were at all inclined to a dropsy and they positively assured me she was not so did her physician arbuthnot who always attends her yet these devils have spread that she has holes in her legs and runs at her navel and i know not what arbuthnot has sent me from windsor a pretty discourse upon lying and i have ordered the printer to come for it it is a proposal for publishing a curious piece called the art of political lying in two volumes etc and then there is an abstract of the first volume just like those pamphlets which they call the works of the learned3 pray get it when it comes out the queen has a little of the gout in one of her hands i believe she will stay a month still at windsor lord treasurer showed me the kindest letter from her in the world by which i picked out one secret that there will be soon made some knights of the garter you know another is fallen by lord godolphins death he will be buried in a day or two at westminster abbey i saw tom leigh4 in town once the bishop of clogher has taken his lodging for the winter they are all well i hear there are in town abundance of people from ireland half a dozen bishops at least the poor old bishop of london5 at past fourscore fell down backward going upstairs and i think broke or cracked his skull yet is now recovering the town is as empty as at midsummer and if i had not occasion for physic i would be at windsor still did i tell you of lord riverss will he has left legacies to about twenty paltry old whores by name and not a farthing to any friend dependent or relation he has left from his only child lady barrymore6 her mothers estate and given the whole to his heirmale a popish priest a second cousin who is now earl rivers and whom he used in his life like a footman after him it goes to his chief wench and bastard lord treasurer and lord chamberlain are executors of this hopeful will i loved the man and detest his memory we hear nothing of peace yet i believe verily the dutch are so wilful because they are told the queen cannot live i had poor mds letter n37 at windsor but i could not answer it then poor pdfr was vely kick8 then and besides it was a very inconvenient place to send letters from oo thought to come home the same day and stayed a month that was a sign the place was agreeable9 i should love such a sort of jaunt is that lad swanton10 a little more fixed than he used to be i think you like the girl very well she has left off her grave airs i

believe i scaped the new fever12 for the same reason that ppt did because i am not well but why should dd scape it pray she is melthigal oo know and ought to have the fever but i hope it is now too late and she wont have it at all some physicians here talk very melancholy and think it foreruns the plague which is actually at hamburg i hoped ppt would have done with her illness but i think we both have that faculty never to part with a disorder for ever we are very constant i have had my giddiness twentythree years by fits will mrs raymond never have done lyingin he intends to leave beggars enough for i daresay he has squandered away the best part of his fortune already and is not out of debt i had a letter from him lately  oct 11 lord treasurer sent for me yesterday and the day before to sit with him because he is not yet quite well enough to go abroad and i could not finish my letter how the deuce come i to be so exact in me money just seventeen shillings and eightpence more than due i believe you cheat me if hawkshaw does not pay the interest i will have the principal pray speak to parvisol and have his advice what i should do about it service to mrs stoyte and catherine and mrs walls ppt makes a petition with many apologies john danvers you know is lady giffards friend the rest i never heard of i tell you what as things are at present i cannot possibly speak to lord treasurer for anybody i need tell you no more something or nothing will be done in my own affairs if the former i will be a solicitor for your sister13 if the latter i have done with courts for ever opportunities will often fall in my way if i am used well and i will then make it my business it is my delight to do good offices for people who want and deserve and a tenfold delight

so tell my friends the parliament will not meet till after christmas and by that time the work i am doing will be over and then nothing shall keep me i am very much discontented at parvisol about neglecting to sell my horses etc  lady masham is not yet brought to bed but we expect it daily i dined with her today lord bolingbroke returned about two months ago and prior about a week and goes back prior i mean in a few days who told you of my snuffbox and pocket did i i had a letter today from dr coghill2 desiring me to get raphoe for dean sterne and the deanery for myself i shall indeed i have such obligations to sterne but however if i am asked who will make a good bishop i shall name him before anybody then comes another letter desiring i would recommend a provost3 supposing that pratt who has been here about a week will certainly be promoted but i believe he will not i presented pratt to lord treasurer and truly young molyneux4 would have had me present him too but i directly answered him i would not unless he had business with him he is the son of one mr molyneux of ireland his father wrote a book5 i suppose you know it here is the duke of marlborough going out of england lord knows why which causes many speculations some say he is conscious of guilt and dare not stand it others think he has a mind to fling an odium on the government as who should say that one who has done such great services to his country cannot live quietly in it by reason of the malice of his enemies i have helped to patch up these people6 together once more god knows how long it may last i was today at a trial between lord lansdowne and lord carteret two friends of mine it was in the queens bench for about six thousand a year or nine i think i sat under lord chiefjustice parker and his pen falling down i reached it up he made me a low bow and i was going to whisper him that i had done good for evil for he would have taken mine from me7 i told it lord treasurer and bolingbroke parker would not have known me if several lords on the bench and in the court bowing had not turned everybodys eyes and set them a whispering i owe the dog a spite and will pay him in two months at furthest if i can so much for that but you must have chat and i must say every sorry thing that comes into my head they say the queen will stay a month longer at windsor these devils of grub street rogues that write the flying post and medley in one paper8 will not be quiet they are always mauling lord treasurer lord bolingbroke and me we have the dog under prosecution but bolingbroke is not active enough but i hope to swinge him he is a scotch rogue one ridpath9 they get out upon bail and write on we take them again and get fresh bail so it goes round they say some learned dutchman has wrote a book proving by civil law that we do them wrong by this peace but i shall show by plain reason that we have suffered the wrong and not they i toil like a horse and have hundreds of letters still to read and squeeze a line out of each or at least the seeds of a line strafford goes back to holland in a day or two and i hope our peace is very near i have about thirty pages more to write that is to be extracted which will be sixty in print it is the most troublesome part of all and i cannot keep myself private though i stole into a room up two pair of stairs when i came from windsor but my present man has not yet learned his lesson of denying me discreetly  30 the duchess of ormond found me out today and made me dine with her lady masham is still expecting she has had a cruel cold i could not finish my letter last post for the soul of me lord bolingbroke has had my papers these six weeks and done nothing to them is tisdall yet in the world i propose writing controversies to get a name with posterity the duke of ormond will not be over these three or four days i desire to make him join with me in settling all right among our people i have ordered the duchess to let me have an hour with the duke at his first coming to give him a true state of persons and things i believe the duke of shrewsbury will hardly be declared your governor yet at least i think so now but resolutions alter very often the duke of hamilton gave me a pound of snuff today admirable good i wish dd had it and ppt too if she likes it it cost me a quarter of an hour of his politics which i was forced to hear lady orkney10 is making me a writingtable of her own contrivance and a bed nightgown she is perfectly kind like a mother i think the devil was in it the other day that i should talk to her of an ugly squinting cousin of hers and the poor lady herself you know squints like a dragon the other day we had a long discourse with her about love and she told us a saying of her sister fitzhardinge11 which i thought excellent that in men desire begets love and in women love begets desire we have abundance of our old criers12 still hereabouts i hear every morning your women with the old satin and taffeta etc the fellow with old coats suits or cloaks our weather is abominable of late we have not two tolerable days in twenty i have lost money again at ombre with lord orkney and others yet after all this year i have lost but threeandtwenty shillings so that considering card money i am no loser  our society hath not yet renewed their meetings i hope we shall continue to do some good this winter and lord treasurer promises the academy for reforming our language shall soon go forward i must now go hunt those dry letter for materials you will see something very notable i hope so much for that god almighty bless you     letter 551  london nov 15 1712  before this comes to your hands you will have heard of the most terrible accident that hath almost ever happened this morning at eight my man brought me word that the duke of hamilton had fought with lord mohun2 and killed him and was brought home wounded3 i immediately sent him to the dukes house in st jamess square but the porter could hardly answer for tears and a great rabble was about the house in short they fought at seven this morning the dog mohun was killed on the spot and while4 the duke was over him mohun shortening his sword stabbed him in at the shoulder to the heart the duke was helped toward the cakehouse by the ring in hyde park where they fought and died on the grass before he could reach the house and was brought home in his coach by eight while the poor duchess5 was asleep maccartney6 and one hamilton7 were the seconds who fought likewise and are both fled i am told that a footman of lord mohuns stabbed the duke of hamilton and some say maccartney did so too mohun gave the affront and yet sent the challenge i am infinitely concerned for the poor duke who was a frank honest goodnatured man i loved him very well and i think he loved me better he had8 the greatest mind in the world to have me go with him to france but durst not tell it me and those he did said i could not be spared which was true they have removed the poor duchess to a lodging in the neighbourhood where i have been with her two hours and am just come away i never saw so melancholy a scene for indeed all reasons for real grief belong to her nor is it possible for anybody to be a greater loser in all regards she has moved my very soul the lodging was inconvenient and they would have removed her to another but i would not suffer it because it had no room backward and she must have been tortured with the noise of the grub street screamers mentioning her husbands murder to her ears  i believe you have heard the story of my escape in opening the bandbox sent to lord treasurer9 the prints have told a thousand lies of it but at last we gave them a true account of it at length printed in the evening10 only i would not suffer them to name me having been so often named before and teased to death with questions i wonder how i came to have so much presence of mind which is usually not my talent but so it pleased god and i saved myself and him for there was a bullet apiece a gentleman told me that if i had been killed the whigs would have called it a judgment because the barrels were of inkhorns with which i had done them so much mischief there was a pure grub street of it full of lies and inconsistencies11 i do not like these things at all and i wish myself more and more among my willows12 there is a devilish spirit among people and the ministry must exert themselves or sink nite dee sollahs ill go seep13  16 i thought to have finished this yesterday but was too much disturbed i sent a letter early this morning to lady masham to beg her to write some comforting words to the poor duchess i dined today with lady masham at kensington where she is expecting these two months to lie in she has promised me to get the queen to write to the duchess kindly on this occasion and tomorrow i will beg lord treasurer to visit and comfort her i have been with her two hours again and find her worse her violences not so frequent but her melancholy more formal and settled she has abundance of wit and spirit about thirtythree years old handsome and airy and seldom spared anybody that gave her the least provocation by which she had many enemies and few friends lady orkney her sisterinlaw is come to town on this occasion and has been to see her and behaved herself with great humanity they have been always very ill together and the poor duchess could not have patience when people told her i went often to lady orkneys but i am resolved to make them friends for the duchess is now no more the object of envy and must learn humility from the severest master affliction i design to make the ministry put out a proclamation if it can be found proper against that villain maccartney what shall we do with these murderers i cannot end this letter tonight and there is no occasion for i cannot send it till tuesday and the crowners inquest on the dukes body is to be tomorrow and i shall know more but what

of hamilton again after i had been with lady orkney and charged her to be kind to her sister in her affliction the duchess told me lady orkney had been with her and that she did not treat her as gently as she ought they hate one another but i will try to patch it up i have been drawing up a paragraph for the postboy to be out tomorrow and as malicious as possible and very proper for abel

from the queen thank god i have stayed till past one with him so nite deelest md16  18 the committee of council is to sit this afternoon upon the affair of the duke of hamiltons murder and i hope a proclamation will be out against maccartney i was just now tis now noon with the duchess to let her know lord treasurer will see her she is mightily out of order the jury have not yet brought in their verdict upon the crowners inquest we suspect maccartney stabbed the duke while he was fighting the queen and lord treasurer are in great concern at this event i dine today again with lord treasurer but must send this to the postoffice before because else i shall not have time he usually keeping me so late ben tooke bid me write to dd to send her certificate for it is high time it should be sent

die i think lady bettys portion is not above 8000 pounds i remember either tisdall writ to me in somebodys letter or you did it for him that i should mention him on occasion to lord anglesea with whom he said he had some little acquaintance lord anglesea was with me tonight at lord treasurers and then i asked him about tisdall and described him he said he never saw him but that he had sent him his book4 see what it is to be a puppy pray tell mr walls that lord anglesea thanked me for recommending clements5 to him that he says he is 20000 pounds the better for knowing clements but pray dont let

eckershall i put it off several times but was forced at last to promise i would come tonight and it never was in my head till i was locked up and i have called and called but my man is gone to bed so i will write an excuse tomorrow i detest that tom leigh and am as formal to him as i can when i happen to meet him in the park the rogue frets me if he knew it he asked me why i did not wait on the bishop of dromore15 i answered i had not the honour to be acquainted with him and would not presume etc he takes me seriously and says the bishop is no proud man etc he tells me of a judge in ireland that has done ill things i ask why he is not out says he i think the bishops and you and i and the rest of the clergy should meet and consult about it i beg his pardon and say i cannot be serviceable that way he answers yes everybody may help somethingdont you see how curiously he contrives to vex me for the dog knows that with half a word i could do more than all of them together but he only does it from the pride and envy of his own heart and not out of a humorous design of teasing he is one of those that would rather a service should not be done than done by a private man and of his own country you take all this dont you nite dee sollahs ill go seep a dozey  24 i dined today with the chancellor of the exchequer in order to look over some of my papers but nothing was done i have been

for being absent three days mighty kind with a p less of civility and more of his interest we hear maccartney is gone over to ireland was it not comical for a gentleman to be set upon by highwaymen and to tell them he was maccartney upon which they brought him to a justice of peace in hopes of the reward19 and the rogues were sent to gaol was it not great presence of mind but maybe you heard this already for there was a grub street of it lord bolingbroke told me i must walk away today when dinner was done because lord treasurer and he and another were to enter upon business but i said it was as fit i should know their business as anybody for i was to justify it20 so the rest went and i stayed and it was so important i was like to sleep over it i left them at nine and it is now twelve

of selkirk whom i had never seen before he is another brother of the duke of hamilton and is going to france by a power from his mother the old duchess26 to negotiate their pretensions to the duchy of chatelherault he teased me for two hours in spite of my teeth and held my hand when i offered to stir would have had me engage the ministry to favour him against lord abercorn and to convince them that lord abercorn had no pretensions and desired i would also convince lord abercorn himself so and concluded he was sorry i was a greater friend to abercorn than hamilton i had no patience and used him with some plainness am not i purely handled between a couple of puppies ay says ppt you must be meddling in other folks affairs i appeal to the bishop of clogher whether abercorn did not complain that i would not let him see me last year and that he swore he would take no denial from my servant when he came again the ministers gave me leave to tell the hamilton family it was their opinion that they ought to agree with abercorn lord anglesea was then by and told abercorn upon which he gravely tells me i was commissioned by the ministers and ought to perform my commission etcbut ill have done with them i have warned lord treasurer and lord bolingbroke to beware of selkirks teasing x on him yet abercorn vexes me more the whelp owes to me all the kind receptions he has had from the ministry

171213  i ended my last with the melancholy news of poor lady ashburnhams death the bishop of clogher and dr pratt made me dine with them today at lord mountjoys pursuant to an engagement which i had forgot lady mountjoy told me that maccartney was got safe out of our clutches for she had spoke with one who had a letter from him from holland others say the same thing tis hard such a dog should escapeas i left lord mountjoys i saw the duke daumont the french ambassador going from lord bolingbrokes where he dined to have a private audience of the queen i followed and went up to court where there was a great crowd i was talking with the duke of argyle by the fireside in the bedchamber when the ambassador came out from the queen argyle presented me to him and lord bolingbroke and we talked together a while he is a fine gentleman something like the duke of ormond and just such an expensive man after church today i showed the bishop of clogher at court who was who nite my two dee logues and2  5 our frost is broke but it is bloody cold lord treasurer is recovered and went out this evening to the queen i dined with lady oxford and then sat with lord treasurer while he went out he gave me a letter from an unknown hand relating to dr brown3 bishop of cork recommending him to a better bishopric as a person who opposed lord wharton and was made a bishop on that account celebrating him for a great politician etc in short all directly contrary to his character which i made bold to explain what dogs there are in the world i was to see the poor duke and duchess of ormond this morning the duke was in his public room with mr southwell4 and two more gentlemen when southwell and i were alone with him he talked something of lord ashburnham that he was afraid the whigs would get him again he bore up as well as he could but something falling accidentally in discourse the tears were just falling out of his eyes and i looked off to give him an opportunity which he took of wiping them with his handkerchief i never saw anything so moving nor such a mixture of greatness of mind and tenderness and discretion nite md  6 lord bolingbroke and parnell and i dined by invitation with my friend darteneuf5 whom you have heard me talk of lord bolingbroke likes parnell mightily and it is pleasant to see that one who hardly passed for anything in ireland makes his way here with a little friendly forwarding it is scurvy rainy weather and i have hardly been abroad today nor know anything that passeslord treasurer is quite recovered and i hope will be careful to keep himself well the duchess of marlborough is leaving england to go to her duke and makes presents of rings to several friends they say worth two hundred pounds apiece i am sure she ought to give me one though the duke pretended to think me his greatest enemy and got people to tell me so and very mildly to let me know how gladly he would have me softened toward him i bid a lady of his acquaintance and mine let him know that i had hindered many a bitter thing against him not for his own sake but because i thought it looked base and i desired everything should be left him except power nite md  7 i dined with lord and lady masham today and this evening played at ombre with mrs vanhom merely for amusement the ministers have got my papers and will neither read them nor give them to me and i can hardly do anything very warm slabby weather but i made a shift to get a walk yet i lost half of it by shaking off lord rochester6 who is a good civil simple man the bishop of ossory will not be bishop of hereford7 to the great grief of himself and his wife and hat is md doing now i wonder playing at cards with the dean and mrs walls i think it is not certain yet that maccartney is escaped i am plagued with bad authors verse and prose who send me their books and poems the vilest trash i ever saw but i have given their names to my man never to let them see me i have got new ink and tis very white and i dont see that it turns black at all ill go to seep tis past twelvenite md  8 oo must understand that i am in my geers and have got a chocolatepot a present from mrs ashe of clogher and some chocolate from my brother ormond and i treat folks sometimes i dined with lord treasurer at five oclock today and was by while he and lord bolingbroke were at business for it is fit i should know all that passes now because etc the duke of ormond employed me to speak to lord treasurer today about an affair and i did so and the duke had spoke himself two hours before which vexed me and i will chide the duke about it ill tell you a good thing there is not one of the ministry but what will employ me as gravely to speak for them to lord treasurer as if i were their brother or his and i do it as gravely though i know they do it only because they will not make themselves uneasy or had rather i should be denied than they i believe our peace will not be finished these two months for i think we must have a return from spain by a messenger who will not go till sunday next lord treasurer has invited me to dine with him again tomorrow your commissioner keatley8 is to be there nite dee richar md9  9 dr pratt drank chocolate with me this morning and then we walked i was yesterday with him to see lady betty butler grieving for her sister ashburnham the jade was in bed in form and she did so cant she made me sick i meet tom leigh every day in the park to preserve his health he is as ruddy as a rose and tells me his bishop of dromore10 recovers very much that bishop has been very near dying this days examiner talks of the play of what is it like11 and you will think it to be mine and be bit for i have no hand in these papers at all i dined with lord treasurer and shall again tomorrow which is his day when all the ministers dine with him he calls it whippingday it is always on saturday and we do indeed usually rally him about his faults on that day i was of the original club when only poor lord rivers lord keeper and lord bolingbroke came but now ormond anglesea lord steward12 dartmouth and other rabble intrude and i scold at it but now they pretend as good a title as i and indeed many saturdays i am not there the company being too many i dont love it nite md  10 at seven this evening as we sat after dinner at lord treasurers a servant said lord peterborow was at the door lord treasurer and lord bolingbroke went out to meet him and brought him in he was just returned from abroad where he has been above a year soon as he saw me he left the duke of ormond and other lords and ran and kissed me before he spoke to them but chid me terribly for not writing to him which i never did this last time he was abroad not knowing where he was and he changed places so often it was impossible a letter should overtake him he left england with a bruise by his coach overturning that made him spit blood and was so ill we expected every post to hear of his death but he outrode it or outdrank it or something and is come home lustier than ever he is at least sixty and has more spirits than any young fellow i know in england he has got the old oxford regiment of horse and i believe will have a garter i love the hangdog dearly nite dee md  11 the court was crammed today to see13 the french ambassador but he did not come did i never tell you that i go to court on sundays as to a coffeehouse to see acquaintance whom i should otherwise not see twice a year the provost14 and i dined with ned southwell by appointment in order to settle your kingdom if my scheme can be followed but i doubt our ministry will be too tedious you must certainly have a new parliament but they would have that a secret yet our parliament here will be prorogued for three weeks those puppies the dutch will not yet come in though they pretend to submit to the queen in everything but they would fain try first how our session begins in hopes to embroil us in the house of lords and if my advice had been taken the session should have begun and we would have trusted the parliament to approve the steps already made toward the peace and had an address perhaps from them to conclude without the dutch if they would not agreeothers are of my mind but it is not reckoned so safe it seems yet i doubt whether the peace will be ready so soon as three weeks but that is a secret nite md  12 pratt and i walked into the city to one batemans15 a famous bookseller for old books there i laid out four pounds like a fool and we dined at a hedge alehouse for two shillings and twopence like emperors let me see i bought plutarch two volumes for thirty shillings etc well ill tell you no more oo dont understand greek16 we have no news and i have nothing more to say today and i cant finish my work these ministers will not find time to do what i would have them so nite nown dee dallars  13 i was to have dined today with lord keeper but would not because that brute sir john walter17 was to be one of the company you may remember he railed at me last summer was twelvemonth at windsor and has never begged my pardon though he promised to do it and lord mansel who was one of the company would certainly have set us together by the ears out of pure roguish mischief so i dined with lord treasurer where there was none but lord bolingbroke i stayed till eight and then went to lady orkneys who has been sick and sat with her till twelve from whence you may consider it is late sollahs the parliament was prorogued today as i told you for three weeks our weather is very bad and slobbery and i shall spoil my new hat i have bought a new hat or empty my pockets does hawkshaw pay the interest he owes lord abercorn plagues me to death i have now not above six people to provide for and about as many to do good offices to and thrice as many that i will do nothing for nor can i if i would nite dee md  14 today i took the circle of morning visits i went to the duchess of ormond and there was she and lady betty and lord ashburnham together this was the first time the mother and daughter saw each other since lady ashburnhams death they were both in tears and i chid them for being together and made lady betty go to her own chamber then sat a while with the duchess and went after lady betty and all was well there is something of farce in all these mournings let them be ever so serious people will pretend to grieve more than they really do and that takes off from their true grief i then went to the duchess of hamilton who never grieved but raged and stormed and railed18 she is pretty quiet now but has a diabolical temper lord keeper and his son and their two ladies and i dined today with mr caesar19 treasurer of the navy at his house in the city where he keeps his office we happened to talk of brutus and i said something in his praise when it struck me immediately that i had made a blunder in doing so and therefore i recollected myself and said mr caesar i beg your pardon so we laughed etc nite my own deelest richar logues md  15 i forgot to tell you that last night i had a present sent me i found it when i came home in my chamber of the finest wild fowl i ever saw with the vilest letter and from the vilest poet in the world who sent it me as a bribe to get him an employment i knew not where the scoundrel lived so i could not send them back and therefore i gave them away as freely as i got them and have ordered my man never to let up the poet when he comes the rogue should have kept the wings at least for his muse one of his fowls was a large capon pheasant as fat as a pullet i ate share of it today with a friend we have now a drawingroom every wednesday thursday and saturday at one oclock the queen does not come out but all her ministers foreigners and persons of quality are at it i was there today and as lord treasurer came towards me i avoided him and he hunted me thrice about the room i affect never to take notice of him at church or court he knows it for i have told him so and tonight at lord mashams he gave an account of it to the company but my reasons are that people seeing me speak to him causes a great deal of teasing i tell you what comes into my head that i never knew whether md were whigs or tories and i value our conversation the more that it never turned on that subject i have a fancy that ppt is a tory and a violent one i dont know why but methinks she looks like one and dd a sort of a trimmer am i right i gave the examiner a hint about this prorogation and to praise the queen for her tenderness to the dutch in giving them still more time to submit20 it fitted the occasions at present nite md  16 i was busy today at the secretarys office and stayed till past three the duke of ormond and i were to dine at lord orkneys the duke was at the committee so i thought all was safe when i went there they had almost dined for the duke had sent to excuse himself which i never knew i came home at seven and began a little whim which just came into my head and will make a threepenny pamphlet21 it shall be finished and out in a week and if it succeeds you shall know what it is otherwise not i cannot send this tomorrow and will put it off till next saturday because i have much business so my journals shall be short and ppt must have patience so nite dee sollahs  17 this rogue parnell has not yet corrected his poem and i would fain have it out i dined today with lord treasurer and his saturday company nine of us in all they went away at seven and lord treasurer and i sat talking an hour after after dinner he was talking to the lords about the speech the queen must make when the parliament meets he asked me how i would make it i was going to be serious because it was seriously put but i turned it to a jest and because they had been speaking of the duchess of marlborough going to flanders after the duke i said the speech should begin thus my lords and gentlemen in order to my own quiet and that of my subjects i have thought fit to send the duchess of marlborough abroad after the duke this took well and turned off the discourse i must tell you i do not at all like the present situation of affairs and remember i tell you so things must be on another foot or we are all undone i hate this driving always to an inch nite md  18 we had a mighty full court today dilly was with me at the french church and edified mightily the duke of ormond and i dined at lord orkneys but i left them at seven and came home to my whim i have made a great progress my large treatise22 stands stock still some think it too dangerous to publish and would have me print only what relates to the peace i cannot tell what i shall dothe bishop of dromore is dying they thought yesterday he could not live two hours yet he is still alive but is utterly past all hopes go to cards sollahs and nite  19 i was this morning to see the duke and duchess of ormond the duke daumont came in while i was with the duke of ormond and we complimented each other like dragons a poor fellow called at the door where i lodge with a parcel of oranges for a present for me i bid my man know what his name was and whence he came he sent word his name was bun and that i knew him very well i bid my man tell him i was busy and he could not speak to me and not to let him leave his oranges i know no more of it but i am sure i never heard the name and i shall take no such presents from strangers perhaps he might be only some beggar who wanted a little money perhaps it might be something worse let them keep their poison for their rats i dont love it23 that blot is a blunder nite dee md  20 a committee of our society dined today with the chancellor of the exchequer our society does not meet now as usual for which i am blamed but till lord treasurer will agree to give us money and employments to bestow i am averse to it and he gives us nothing but promises the bishop of dromore is still alive and that is all we expect every day he will die and then tom leigh must go back which is one good thing to the town i believe pratt will drive at one of these bishoprics our english bishopric24 is not yet disposed of i believe the peace will not be ready by the session nite md  21 i was today with my printer to give him a little pamphlet i have written but not politics it will be out by monday if it succeeds i will tell you of it otherwise not we had a prodigious thaw today as bad as rain yet i walked like a good boy all the way the bishop of dromore still draws breath but cannot live two days longer my large book lies flat some people think a great part of it ought not to be now printed i believe i told you so before this letter shall not go till saturday which makes up the three weeks exactly and i allow md six weeks which are now almost out so oo must know i expect a rettle vely soon and that md is vely werr25 and so nite dee md  22 this is one of our court days and i was there i told you there is a drawingroom wednesday thursday and saturday the hamiltons and abercorns have done teasing me the latter i hear is actually going to france lord treasurer quarrelled with me at court for being four days without dining with him so i dined there today and he has at last fallen in with my project as he calls it of coining halfpence and farthings with devices like medals in honour of the queen every year changing the device i wish it may be done nite md  23 the duke of ormond and i appointed to dine with ned southwell today to talk of settling your affairs of parliament in ireland but there was a mixture of company and the duke of ormond was in haste and nothing was done if your parliament meets this summer it must be a new one but i find some are of opinion there should be none at all these two years i will trouble myself no more about it my design was to serve the duke of ormond dr pratt and i sat this evening with the bishop of clogher and played at ombre for threepences that i suppose is but low with you i found at coming home a letter from md n37 i shall not answer it zis bout but will the next i am sorry for poo poo ppt pray walk hen oo can i have got a terrible new cold before my old one was quite gone and dont know how pay  26 i shall have dds money soon from the exchequer the bishop of dromore is dead now at last nite dee md  24 i was at court today and it was comical to see lord abercorn bowing to me but not speaking and lord selkirk the same27 i dined with lord treasurer and his saturday club and sat with him two hours after the rest were gone and spoke freer to him of affairs than i am afraid others do who might do more good all his friends repine and shrug their shoulders but will not deal with him so freely as they ought it is an odd business the parliament just going to sit and no employments given they say they will give them in a few days there is a new bishop made of hereford28 so ossory29 is disappointed i hinted so to his friends two months ago to make him leave off deluding himself and being indiscreet as he was i have just time to send this without giving to the bellman nite deelest richar md dee md md md

hundred tiles fallen down and one swinger fell about forty yards before me that would have killed a horse so after church and court i walked through the park and took a chair to lord treasurers next door to his house a tin chimneytop had fallen down with a hundred bricks it is grown calm this evening i wonder had you such a wind today i hate it as much as any hog does lord treasurer has engaged me to dine again with him tomorrow he has those tricks sometimes of inviting me from day to day which i am forced to break through my little pamphlet2 is out tis not politics if it takes i say again you shall hear of it nite dee logues  26 this morning i felt a little touch of giddiness which has disordered and weakened me with its ugly remains all this day pity pdfr after dinner at lord treasurers the french ambassador duke daumont sent lord treasurer word that his house was burnt down to the ground it took fire in the upper rooms while he was at dinner with monteleon the spanish ambassador and other persons and soon after lord bolingbroke came to us with the same story we are full of speculations upon it but i believe it was the carelessness of his french rascally servants tis odd that this very day lord somers wharton sunderland halifax and the whole club of whig lords dined at pontacks3 in the city as i received private notice they have some damned design i tell you another odd thing i was observing it to lord treasurer that he was stabbed on the day king william died and the day i saved his life by opening the bandbox4 was king williams birthday my friend mr lewis has had a lie spread on him by the mistake of a man who went to another of his name to give him thanks for passing his privy seal to come from france5 that other lewis spread about that the man brought him thanks from lord perth and lord melfort two lords with the pretender for his great services etc the lords will examine that tother lewis tomorrow in council and i believe you will hear of it in the prints for i will make abel roper give a relation of it pray tell me if it be necessary to write a little plainer for i looked over a bit of my last letter and could hardly read it ill mend my hand if oo please but you are more used to it nor i as mr raymond says nite md  27 i dined today with lord treasurer this makes four days together and he has invited me again tomorrow but i absolutely refused him i was this evening at a christening with him of lord dupplins6 daughter he went away at ten but they kept me and some others till past twelve so you may be sure tis late as they say we have now stronger suspicions that the duke daumonts house was set on fire by malice i was today to see lord keeper who has quite lost his voice with a cold there dr radcliffe told me that it was the ambassadors confectioner set the house on fire by boiling sugar and going down and letting it boil over yet others still think differently so i know not what to judge nite my own deelest md rove pdfr  28 i was today at court where the spanish ambassador talked to me as if he did not suspect any design in burning daumonts house but abbe gaultier secretary for france here said quite otherwise and that daumont had a letter the very same day to let him know his house should be burnt and they tell several other circumstances too tedious to write one is that a fellow mending the tiles just when the fire broke out saw a pot with wildfire7 in the room i dined with lord orkney neither lord abercorn nor selkirk will now speak with me i have disobliged both sides nite dear md  29 our society met today fourteen of us and at a tavern we now resolve to meet but once a fortnight and have a committee every other week of six or seven to consult about doing some good i proposed another message to lord treasurer by three principal members to give a hundred guineas to a certain person and they are to urge it as well as they can we also raised sixty guineas upon our own society but i made them do it by sessors8 and i was one of them and we fitted our tax to the several estates the duke of ormond pays ten guineas and i the third part of a guinea at that rate they may tax as often as they please well but i must answer oor rettle ung oomens not yet tis rate now and i cant tind it nite deelest md  30 i have drank spa waters this two or three days but they do not pass and make me very giddy i ant well faith ill take them no more i sauntered after church with the provost today to see a library to be sold and dined at five with lord orkney we still think there was malice in burning daumonts house i hear little harrison9 is come over it was he i sent to utrecht he is now queens secretary to the embassy and has brought with him the barrier treaty as it is now corrected by us and yielded to by the dutch which was the greatest difficulty to retard the peace i hope he will bring over the peace a month hence for we will send him back as soon as possible i long to see the little brat my own creature his pay is in all a thousand pounds a year and they have never paid him a groat though i have teased their hearts out he must be three or four hundred pounds in debt at least the brat let me go to bed sollahsnite dee richar md  31 harrison was with me this morning we talked three hours and then i carried him to court when we went down to the door of my lodging i found a coach waited for him i chid him for it but he whispered me it was impossible to do otherwise and in the coach he told me he had not one farthing in his pocket to pay it and therefore took the coach for the whole day and intended to borrow money somewhere or other so there was the queens minister entrusted in affairs of the greatest importance without a shilling in his pocket to pay a coach i paid him while he was with me seven guineas in part of a dozen of shirts he bought me in holland i presented him to the duke of ormond and several lords at court and i contrived it so that lord treasurer came to me and asked i had parnell by me whether that was dr parnell and came up and spoke to him with great kindness and invited him to his house i value myself upon making the ministry desire to be acquainted with parnell and not parnell with the ministry his poem is almost fully corrected and shall soon be out heres enough for today only to tell you that i was in the city with my printer to alter an examiner about my friend lewiss story10 which will be told with remarks nite md  feb 1 i could do nothing till today about the examiner but the printer came this morning and i dictated to him what was fit to be said and then mr lewis came and corrected it as he would have it so i was neither at church nor court the duke of ormond and i dined at lord orkneys i left them at seven and sat with sir andrew fountaine who has a very bad sore leg for which he designs to go to france fais heres a week gone and one side of this letter not finished oh but i write now but once in three weeks iss fais this shall go sooner the parliament is to sit on the third but will adjourn for three or four days for the queen is laid up with the gout and both speakers out of order though one of them the lord keeper is almost well i spoke to the duke of ormond a good deal about ireland we do not altogether agree nor am i judge enough of irish affairs but i will speak to lord treasurer tomorrow that we three may settle them some way or other nite sollahs both rove pdfr  2 i had a letter some days ago from moll gery11 her name is now wigmore and her husband has turned parson she desires nothing but that i would get lord keeper to give him a living but i will send her no answer though she desires it much she still makes mantuas at farnham it rained all this day and dilly came to me and was coaching it into the city so i went with him for a shaking because it would not cost me a farthing there i met my friend stratford12 the merchant who is going abroad to gather up his debts and be clear in the world he begged that i would dine with some merchant friends of ours there because it was the last time i should see him so i did and thought to have seen lord treasurer in the evening but he happened to go out at five so i visited some friends and came home and now i have the greatest part of your letter to answer and yet i will not do it tonight say what oo please the parliament meets tomorrow but will be prorogued for a fortnight which disappointment will i believe vex abundance of them though they are not whigs for they are forced to be in town at expense for nothing but we want an answer from spain before we are sure of everything being right for the peace and god knows whether we can have that answer this month it is a most ticklish juncture of affairs we are always driving to an inch i am weary of it nite md  3 the parliament met and was prorogued as i said and i found some cloudy faces and heard some grumbling we have got over all our difficulties with france i think they have now settled all the articles of commerce between us and them wherein they were very much disposed to play the rogue if we had not held them to it and this business we wait from spain is to prevent some other rogueries of the french who are finding an evasion to trade to the spanish west indies but i hope we shall prevent it i dined with lord treasurer and he was in good humour enough i gave him that part of my book in manuscript to read where his character was and drawn pretty freely he was reading and correcting it with his pencil when the bishop of st davids13 now removing to hereford came in and interrupted us i left him at eight and sat till twelve with the provost and bishop of clogher at the provosts nite md  4 i was today at court but kept out of lord treasurers way because i was engaged to the duke of ormond where i dined and i think ate and drank too much i sat this evening with lady masham and then with lord masham and lord treasurer at lord mashams it was last year you may remember my constant evening place i saw lady jersey14 with lady masham who has been laying out for my acquaintance and has forced a promise for me to drink chocolate with her in a day or two which i know not whether i shall perform i have just mended my pen you see for i do not much like her character but she is very malicious and therefore i think i must keep fair with her i cannot send this letter till saturday next i find so i will answer oors now i see no different days of the month yet it is dated january 3 so it was long a coming i did not write to dr coghill that i would have nothing in ireland but that i was soliciting nothing anywhere and that is true i have named dr sterne to lord treasurer lord bolingbroke and the duke of ormond for a bishopric and i did it heartily i know not what will come of it but i tell you as a great secret that i have made the duke of ormond promise me to recommend nobody till he tells me and this for some

dined with lord treasurer and his saturday company but there were but seven at table lord peterborrow is ill and spits blood with a bruise he got before he left england but i believe an italian lady

me the parliament was prorogued till thursday sennight they have had some expresses by which they count that the peace may be signed by that time at least that france holland and we will sign some articles by which we shall engage to sign the peace when it is ready but spain has no minister there for monteleon who is to be their ambassador at utrecht is not yet gone from hence and till he is there the spaniards can sign no peace and of one thing take notice that a general peace can hardly be finished these two months so as to be proclaimed here for after signing it must be ratified that is confirmed by the several princes at their courts which to spain will cost a month for we must have notice that it is ratified in all courts before we can proclaim it so be not in too much haste

begged that the ministers may have a meeting on purpose to settle that matter and let us be the attackers and i believe it will come to something for the whigs intend to attack the ministers and if instead of that the ministers attack the whigs it will be better and farther i believe we shall attack them on those very points they intend to attack us the parliament will be again prorogued for a fortnight because of passion week i forgot to tell you that mr griffin has given ppts brother2 a new employment about ten pounds a year better than his former but more remote and consequently cheaper

parliamentman told me he had heard that i had wrote to my friends in ireland to keep firm to the whig interest for that lord treasurer would certainly declare for it after the peace annesley said twenty people had told him this you must know this is what they endeavour to report of lord treasurer that he designs to declare for the whigs and a scotch fellow has wrote the same to scotland and his meeting with those lords gives occasion to such reports let me henceforth call lord treasurer eltee because possibly my letters may be opened pray remember eltee you know the reason lt and eltee

got a dinner there and then went to the latin play at westminster school acted by the boys and lord treasurer eltee i mean again honoured them with his presence lady mashams eldest son about two years old is ill and i am afraid will not live she is full of grief and i pity and am angry with her four shillings today in coachhire fais it wont do our peace will certainly be ready by thursday fortnight but our plenipotentiaries were to blame that it was not done already they thought their powers were not full enough to sign the peace unless every prince was ready which cannot yet be for spain has no minister yet at utrecht but now ours have new orders nite md  25 weather worse than ever terrible rain all day but i was resolved i would spend no more money i went to an auction of pictures with dr pratt and there met the duke of beaufort who promised to come with me to court but did not so a coach i got and went to court and did some little business there but was forced to go home for oo must understand i take a little physic overnight which works me next day lady orkney is my physician it is hiera picra9 two spoonfuls devilish stuff i thought to have dined with eltee but would not merely to save a shilling but i dined privately with a friend and played at ombre and won six shillings here are several people of quality lately dead of the smallpox i have not yet seen miss ashe but hear she is well the bishop of clogher has bought abundance of pictures and dr pratt has got him very good pennyworths10 i can get no walks the weather is so bad is it so with oo sollahs 11  26 though it

the parliament was prorogued till this day fortnight we had terrible rain and hail today our society met this day but i left them before seven and went to sir andrew fountaine and played at ombre with him and sir thomas clarges till ten and then went to sir thomas hanmer his wife the duchess of grafton left us after a little while and i stayed with him about an hour upon some affairs etc lord bolingbroke left us at the society before i went for there is an express from utrecht but i know not yet what it contains only i know the ministers expect the peace will be signed in a week which is a week before the session nite md  27 parnells poem is mightily esteemed but poetry sells ill i am plagued with that 12 poor harrisons mother you would laugh to see how cautious i am of paying her the 100 pounds i received for her son from the treasury i have asked every creature i know whether i may do it safely yet durst not venture till my lord keeper assured me there was no danger i have not paid her but will in a day or two though i have a great mind to stay till ppt sends me her opinion because ppt is a great lawyer i dined today with a mixture of people at a scotchmans who made the invitation to mr lewis and me and has some design upon us which we know very well i went afterwards to see a famous moving picture13 and i never saw anything so pretty you see a sea ten miles wide a town on tother end and ships sailing in the sea and discharging their cannon you see a great sky with moon and stars etc im a fool nite dee md  28 i had a mighty levee today i deny myself to everybody except about half a dozen and they were all here and mr addison was one and i had chocolate twice which i dont like our rainy weather continues coachhire goes deep i dined with eltee and his saturday company as usual and could not get away till nine lord peterborow was making long harangues and eltee kept me in spite then i went to see the bishop of ossory who had engaged me in the morning he is going to ireland the bishop of killaloe14 and tom leigh was with us the latter had wholly changed his style by seeing how the bishops behaved themselves and he seemed to think me one of more importance than i really am i put the ill conduct of the bishops about the firstfruits with relation to eltee and me strongly upon killaloe and showed how it had hindered me from getting a better thing for them called the crown rents which the queen had promised he had nothing to say but was humble and desired my interest in that and some other things this letter is half done in a week i believe oo will have it next nite md  29 i have been employed in endeavouring to save one of your junior fellows15 who came over here for a dispensation from taking orders and in soliciting it has run out his time and now his fellowship is void if the college pleases unless the queen suspends the execution and gives him time to take orders i spoke to all the ministers yesterday about it but they say the queen is angry and thought it was a trick to deceive her and she is positive and so the man must be ruined for i cannot help him i never saw him in my life but the case was so hard i could not forbear interposing your government recommended him to the duke of ormond and he thought they would grant it and by the time it was refused the fellowship by rigour is forfeited i dined with dr arbuthnot one of my brothers at his lodgings in chelsea and was there at chapel and the altar put me in mind of tisdalls outlandish would16 at your hospital for the soldiers i was not at court today and i hear the queen was not at church perhaps the gout has seized her again terrible rain all day have oo such weather nite md  30 morning i was naming some time ago to a certain person another certain person that was very deserving and poor and sickly and tother that first certain person gave me a hundred pounds to give the other which i have not yet done the person who is to have it never saw the giver nor expects one farthing nor has the least knowledge or imagination of it so i believe it will be a very agreeable surprise for i think it is a handsome present enough at night i dined in the city at pontacks17 with lord dupplin and some others we were treated by one colonel cleland18 who has a mind to be governor of barbados and is laying these long traps for me and others to engage our interests for him he is a true scotchman i paid the hundred pounds this evening and it was an agreeable surprise to the receiver we reckon the peace is now signed and that we shall have it in three days i believe it is pretty sure nite md  31 i thought today on ppt when she told me she supposed i was acquainted with the steward when i was giving myself airs of being at some lords house sir andrew fountaine invited the bishop of clogher and me and some others to dine where he did and he carried us to the duke of kents19 who was gone out of town but the steward treated us nobly and showed us the fine pictures etc i have not yet seen miss ashe i wait till she has been abroad and taken the air this evening lady masham dr arbuthnot and i were contriving a lie for tomorrow that mr noble20 who was hanged last saturday was recovered by his friends and then seized again by the sheriff and is now in a messengers hands at the black swan in holborn we are all to send to our friends to know whether they have heard anything of it and so we hope it will spread however we shall do our endeavours nothing shall be wanting on our parts and leave the rest to fortune nite md  april 1 we had no success in our story though i sent my man to several houses to inquire among the footmen without letting him into the secret but i doubt my colleagues did not contribute as they ought parnell and i dined with darteneuf21 today you have heard of darteneuf i have told you of darteneuf after dinner we all went to lord bolingbrokes who had desired me to dine with him but i would not because i heard it was to look over a dull poem of one parson trapp22 upon the peace the swedish envoy told me today at court that he was in great apprehensions about his master23 and indeed we are afraid that prince has24 died among those turkish dogs i prevailed on lord bolingbroke to invite mr addison to dine with him on good friday i suppose we shall be mighty mannerly addison is to have a play of his acted on friday in easter week tis a tragedy called cato i saw it unfinished some years ago25 did i tell you that steele has begun a new daily paper called the guardian26 they say good for nothing i have not seen it nite dee md  2 i was this morning with lord bolingbroke and he tells me a spanish courier is just come with the news that the king of spain has agreed to everything that the queen desires and the duke dossuna has left paris in order to his journey to utrecht i was prevailed on to come home with trapp and read his poem and correct it but it was good for nothing while i was thus employed sir thomas hanmer came up to my chamber and balked me of a journey he and i intended this week to lord orkneys at cliffden27 but he is not well and his physician will not let him undertake such a journey i intended to dine with lord treasurer but going to see colonel disney who lives with general withers28 i liked the generals little dinner so well that i stayed and took share of it and did not go to lord treasurer till six where i found dr sacheverell who told us that the bookseller had given him 100 pounds for his sermon29 preached last sunday and intended to print 30000 i believe he will be confoundedly bit and will hardly sell above half i have fires still though april has begun against my old maxim but the weather is wet and cold i never saw such a long run of ill weather in my life nite dee logues md  3 i was at the queens chapel today but she was not there mr st john lord bolingbrokes brother came this day at noon with an express from utrecht that the peace is signed by all the ministers there but those of the emperor who will likewise sign in a few days so that now the great work is in effect done and i believe it will appear a most excellent peace for europe particularly for england addison and i and some others dined with lord bolingbroke and sat with him till twelve we were very civil but yet when we grew warm we talked in a friendly manner of party addison raised his objections and lord bolingbroke answered them with great complaisance addison began lord somerss health which went about but i bid him not name lord whartons for i would not pledge it and i told lord bolingbroke frankly that addison loved lord wharton as little as i did so we laughed etc well but you are glad of the peace you ppt the trimmer are not you as for dd i dont doubt her why now if i did not think ppt had been a violent tory and dd the greater whig of the two tis late nite md  4 this passion week people are so demure especially this last day that i told dilly who called here that i would dine with him and so i did faith and had a small shoulder of mutton of my own bespeaking it rained all day i came home at seven and have never stirred out but have been reading sacheverells long dull sermon which he sent me it is the first sermon since his suspension is expired but not a word in it upon the occasion except two or three remote hints the bishop of clogher has been sadly bit by tom ashe who sent him a pun which the bishop had made and designed to send to him but delayed it and lord pembroke and i made sir andrew fountaine write it to tom i believe i told you of it in my last it succeeded right and the bishop was wondering to lord pembroke how he and his brother could hit on the same thing ill go to bed soon for i must be at church by eight tomorrow easter day nite dee md  5 warburton30 wrote to me two letters about a living of one foulkes who is lately dead in the county of meath my answer is that before i received the first letter general gorges31 had recommended a friend of his to the duke of ormond which was the first time i heard of its vacancy and it was the provost told me of it i believe verily that foulkes was not dead when gorges recommended the other for warburtons last letter said that foulkes was dead the day before the datethis has prevented me from serving warburton as i would have done if i had received early notice enough pray say or write this to warburton to justify me to him i was at church at eight this morning and dressed and shaved after i came back but was too late at court and lord abingdon32 was like to have snapped me for dinner and i believe will fall out with me for refusing him but i hate dining with them and i dined with a private friend and took two or three good walks for it was a very fine day the first we have had a great while remember was easter day a fine day with you i have sat with lady worsley till now nite dee md  6 i was this morning at ten at the rehearsal of mr addisons play called cato which is to be acted on friday there were not above half a score of us to see it we stood on the stage and it was foolish enough to see the actors prompted every moment and the poet directing them and the drab that acts catos daughter33 out in the midst of a passionate part and then calling out whats next the bishop of clogher was there too but he stood privately in a gallery i went to dine with lord treasurer but he was gone to wimbledon his daughter caermarthens34 country seat seven miles off so i went back and dined privately with mr addison whom

possibbere i will put this in the postoffice so i say no more i write by this post to the dean but it is not above two lines and one enclosed to you but that enclosed to you is not above three lines

tell you what it is lest this letter should miscarry or be opened but i never saw his fellow for delays the parliament will now certainly sit and everybodys expectations are ready to burst at a council tonight the lord chiefjustice parker a whig spoke against the peace so did lord chomley2 another whig who is treasurer of the household my lord keeper3 was this night made lord chancellor we hope there will soon be some removes nite dee sollahs late rove pdfr4  8 lord chomley the right name is cholmondeley is this day removed from his employment for his last nights speech and sir richard

between two great men i dined with lord treasurer and did the business i had for him to his satisfaction i wont tell md what it was 7 for zat the parliament sits tomorrow for certain here is a letter printed in maccartneys name vindicating himself from the murder of the duke of hamilton i must give some hints to have it answered tis full of lies and will give an opportunity of exposing that party to morrow will be a very important day all the world will be at westminster lord treasurer is as easy as a lamb they are mustering up the proxies of the absent lords but they are not in any fear of wanting a majority which death and accidents have increased this year nite md  9 i was this morning with lord treasurer to present to him a young son8 of the late earl of jersey at the desire of the widow there i saw the mace and great coach ready for lord treasurer who was going to parliament our society met today but i expected the houses would sit longer than i cared to fast so i dined with a friend and never inquired how matters went till eight this evening when i went to lord orkneys where i found sir thomas hanmer the queen delivered her speech very well but a little weaker in her voice the crowd was vast the order for the address9 was moved and opposed by lord nottingham halifax and cowper lord treasurer spoke with great spirit and resolution lord peterborow flirted10 against the duke of marlborough who is in germany you know but it was in answer to one of halifaxs impertinences the order for an address passed by a majority of thirtythree and the houses rose before six this is the account i heard at lord orkneys the bishop of chester11 a high tory was against the court the duchess of marlborough sent for him some months ago to justify herself to him in relation to the queen and showed him letters and told him stories which the weak man believed and was perverted nite md  10 i dined with a cousin in the city and poor pat rolt was there i have got her rogue of a husband leave to come to england from portmahon the whigs are much down but i reckon they have some scheme in agitation this parliamenttime hinders our court meetings on wednesdays thursdays and saturdays i had a great deal of business tonight which gave me a temptation to be idle and i lost a dozen shillings at ombre with dr pratt and another i have been to see tother day the bishop of clogher and lady but did not see miss it rains every day and yet we are all over dust lady mashams eldest boy is very ill i doubt he will not live and she stays at kensington to nurse him which vexes us all she is so excessively fond it makes me mad she should never leave the queen but leave everything to stick to what is so much the interest of the public as well as her own this i tell her but talk to the winds nite md  11 i dined at lord treasurers with his saturday company we had ten at table all lords but myself and the chancellor of the exchequer argyle went off at six and was in very indifferent humour as usual duke of ormond and lord bolingbroke were absent i stayed till near ten lord treasurer showed us a small picture enamelled work and set in gold worth about twenty pounds a picture i mean of the queen which she gave to the duchess of marlborough set in diamonds when the duchess was leaving england she took off all the diamonds and gave the picture to one mrs higgins an old intriguing woman whom everybody knows bidding her make the best of it she could lord treasurer sent to mrs higgins for this picture and gave her a hundred pounds for it was ever such an ungrateful beast as that duchess or did you ever hear such a story i suppose the whigs will not believe it pray try them takes off the diamonds and gives away the picture to an insignificant woman as a thing of no consequence and gives it to her to sell like a piece of oldfashioned plate is she not a detestable slut nite deelest md  12 i went to court today on purpose to present mr berkeley12 one of your fellows of dublin college to lord berkeley of stratton that mr berkeley is a very ingenious man and great philosopher and i have mentioned him to all the ministers and given them some of his writings and i will favour him as much as i can this i think i am bound to in honour and conscience to use all my little credit toward helping forward men of worth in the world the queen was at chapel today and looks well i dined at lord orkneys with the duke of ormond lord arran and sir thomas hanmer mr st john secretary at utrecht expects every moment to return there with the ratification of the peace did i tell you in my last of addisons play called cato and that i was at the rehearsal of it nite md  13 this morning my friend mr lewis came to me and showed me an order for a warrant for the three vacant deaneries but none of them to me this was what i always foresaw and received the notice of it better i believe than he expected i bid mr lewis tell lord treasurer that i took nothing ill of him but his not giving me timely notice as he promised to do if he found the queen would do nothing for me at noon lord treasurer hearing i was in mr lewiss office came to me and said many things too long to repeat i told him i had nothing to do but go to ireland immediately for i could not with any reputation stay longer here unless i had something honourable immediately given to me we dined together at the duke of ormonds he there told me he had stopped the warrants for the deans that what was done for me might be at the same time and he hoped to compass it tonight but i believe him not i told the duke of ormond my intentions he is content sterne should be a bishop and i have st patricks but i believe nothing will come of it for stay i will not and so i believe for all oo 13 oo may see me in dublin before april ends i am less out of humour than you would imagine and if it were not that impertinent people will condole with me as they used to give me joy i would value it less but i will avoid company and muster up my baggage and send them next monday by the carrier to chester and come and see my willows against the expectation of all the worldhat care i nite deelest logues md  14 i dined in the city today and ordered a lodging to be got ready for me against i came to pack up my things for i will leave this end of the town as soon as ever the warrants for the deaneries are out which are yet stopped lord treasurer told mr lewis that it should be determined tonight and so he will for14 a hundred nights so he said yesterday but i value it not my daily journals shall be but short till i get into the city and then i will send away this and follow it myself and design to walk it all the way to chester my man and i by ten miles a day it will do my health a great deal of good i shall do it in fourteen days nite dee md  15 lord bolingbroke made me dine with him today he15 was as good company as ever and told me the queen would determine something for me tonight the dispute is windsor or st patricks i told him i would not stay for their disputes and he thought i was in the right lord masham told me that lady masham is angry i have not been to see her since this business and desires i will come tomorrow nite deelest md  16 i was this noon at lady mashams who was just come from kensington where her eldest son is sick she said much to me of what she had talked to the queen and lord treasurer the poor lady fell a shedding tears openly she could not bear to think of my having st patricks etc i was never more moved than to see so much friendship i would not stay with her but went and dined with dr arbuthnot with mr berkeley one of your fellows whom i have recommended to the doctor and to lord berkeley of stratton mr lewis tells me that the duke of ormond has been today with the queen and she was content that dr sterne should be bishop of dromore and i dean of st patricks but then out came lord treasurer and said he would not be satisfied but that i must be prebendary of windsor thus he perplexes things i expect neither but i confess as much as i love england i am so angry at this treatment that if i had my choice i would rather have st patricks lady masham says she will speak to purpose to the queen tomorrow nite dee md  17 i went to dine at lady mashams today and she was taken ill of a sore throat and aguish she spoke to the queen last night but had not much time the queen says she will determine tomorrow with lord treasurer the warrants for the deaneries are still stopped for fear i should be gone do you think anything will be done i dont care whether it is or no in the meantime i prepare for my journey and see no great people nor will see lord treasurer any more if i go lord treasurer told mr lewis it should be done tonight so he said five nights ago nite md  18 this morning mr lewis sent me word that lord treasurer told him the queen would determine at noon at three lord treasurer sent to me to come to his lodgings at st jamess and told me the queen was at last resolved that dr sterne should be bishop of dromore and i dean of st patricks and that sternes warrant should be drawn immediately you know the deanery is in the duke of ormonds gift but this is concerted between the queen lord treasurer and the duke of ormond to make room for me i do not know whether it will yet be done some unlucky accident may yet come neither can i feel joy at passing my days in ireland and i confess i thought the ministry would not let me go but perhaps they cant help it nite md  19 i forgot to tell you that lord treasurer forced me to dine with him yesterday as usual with his saturday company which i did after frequent refusals today i dined with a private friend and was not at court after dinner mr lewis sent me a note that the queen stayed till she knew whether the duke of ormond approved of sterne for bishop i went this evening and found the duke of ormond at the cockpit and told him and desired he would go to the queen and approve of sterne he made objections desired i would name any other deanery for he did not like sterne that sterne never went to see him that he was influenced by the archbishop of dublin etc so all now is broken again i sent out for lord treasurer and told him this he says all will do well but i value not what he says this suspense vexes me worse than anything else nite md  20 i went today by appointment to the cockpit to talk with the duke of ormond he repeated the same proposals of any other deanery etc i desired he would put me out of the case and do as he pleased then with great kindness he said he would consent but would do it for no man alive but me etc and he will speak to the queen today or tomorrow so perhaps something will come of it i cant tell nite dee dee logues md  21 the duke of ormond has told the queen he is satisfied that sterne should be bishop and she consents i shall be dean and i suppose the warrants will be drawn in a day or two i dined at an alehouse with parnell and berkeley for i am not in humour to go among the ministers though lord dartmouth invited me to dine with him today and lord treasurer was to be there i said i would if i were out of suspense nite deelest md  22 the queen says warrants shall be drawn but she will dispose of all in england and ireland at once to be teased no more this will delay it some time and while it is delayed i am not sure of the queen my enemies being busy i hate this suspense nite deelest md16  23 i dined yesterday with general hamilton17 i forgot to tell oo i write short journals now i have eggs on the spit this night the queen has signed all the warrants among which sterne is bishop of dromore and the duke of ormond is to send over an order for making me dean of st patricks i have no doubt of him at all i think tis now passed and i suppose md is malicious enough to be glad and rather have it than wells18 but you see what a condition i am in i thought i was to pay but six hundred pounds for the house but the bishop of clogher says eight hundred pounds firstfruits one hundred and fifty pounds and so with patent a thousand pounds in all so that i shall not be the better for the deanery these three years i hope in some time they will be persuaded here to give me some money to pay off these debts i must finish the book i am writing19 before i can go over and they expect i shall pass next winter here and then i will dun them to give me a sum of money however i hope to pass four or five months with md and whatever comes on it mds allowance must be increased and shall be too fais 20 i received oor rettle no 39 tonight just ten weeks since i had your last i shall write next post to bishop sterne never man had so many enemies of ireland21 as he i carried it with the strongest hand possible if he does not use me well and gently in what dealings i shall have with him he will be the most ungrateful of mankind the archbishop of york22 my mortal enemy has sent by a third hand that he would be glad to see me shall i see him or not i hope to be over in a month and that md with their raillery will be mistaken that i shall make it three years i will answer oo rettle soon but no more journals i shall be very busy short letters from hence forward i shall not part with laracor that is all i have to live on except the deanery be worth more than four hundred pounds a year is it if it be the overplus shall be divided between md and fw beside usual allowance of md 23 pray write to me a goodhumoured letter immediately let it be ever so short this affair was carried with great difficulty which vexes me but they say here tis much to my reputation that i have made a bishop in spite of all the world to get the best deanery in ireland nite dee sollahs  24 i forgot to tell you i had sternes letter yesterday in answer to mine oo performed oor commission well dood dallars both24 i made mistakes the three last days and am forced to alter the number25 i dined in the city today with my printer and came home early and am going to be busy with my work i will send this tomorrow and i suppose the warrants will go then i wrote to dr coghill to take care of passing my patent and

is said to have met swift rushing out of archbishop kings study with a countenance of distraction immediately after the wedding king who was in tears said you have just met the most unhappy man on earth but on the subject of his wretchedness you must never ask a question will it be believed that scottwho rejects delanys inference from this alleged incidenthad no better authority for it than a friend of his delanys relict  9 this incident for which there is probably some foundation of factwe cannot say how muchhas been greatly expanded by mrs woods in her novel esther vanhomrigh unfortunately most of her readers cannot of course judge exactly how far her story is a work of imagination  10 in october swift explained that he had been in the country partly to see a lady of my old acquaintance who was extremely ill unpublished letters of dean swift p 198  11 there is a story that shortly before her death swift begged stella to allow herself to be publicly announced as his wife but that she replied that it was then too late the versions given by delany and theophilus swift differ considerably while sheridan alters the whole thing by representing swift as brutally refusing to comply with stellas last wishes  12 there has also been the absurd suggestion that the impediment was swifts knowledge that both he and stella were the illegitimate children of sir william templea theory which is absolutely disproved by known facts  13 it is curious to note the intimate knowledge of some of swifts peculiarities which was possessed by the hostile writer of a pamphlet called a hue and cry after dr st published in 1714 that piece consists for the most part of extracts from a supposed diary by swift and contains such passages as these friday go to the club am treated

criticises the failings of dr anthony raymond who was says scott a particular friend his unreliability in money matters the improvidence of his large family his peculiarities in grammar his pride in
