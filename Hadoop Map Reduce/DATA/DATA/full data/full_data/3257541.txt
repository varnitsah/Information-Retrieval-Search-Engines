3257541	a plea for captain john brown  by henry david thoreau   read to the citizens of concord mass sunday evening october 30 1859    i trust that you will pardon me for being here i do not wish to force my thoughts upon you but i feel forced myself little as i know of captain brown i would fain do my part to correct the tone and the statements of the newspapers and of my countrymen generally respecting his character and actions it costs us nothing to be just we can at least express our sympathy with and admiration of him and his companions and that is what i now propose to do  first as to his history i will endeavor to omit as much as possible what you have already read i need not describe his person to you for probably most of you have seen and will not soon forget him i am told that his grandfather john brown was an officer in the revolution that he himself was born in connecticut about the beginning of this century but early went with his father to ohio i heard him say that his father was a contractor who furnished beef to the army there in the war of 1812 that he accompanied him to the camp and assisted him in that employment seeing a good deal of military lifemore perhaps than if he had been a soldier for he was often present at the councils of the officers especially he learned by experience how armies are supplied and maintained in the fielda work which he observed requires at least as much experience and skill as to lead them in battle he said that few persons had any conception of the cost even the pecuniary cost of firing a single bullet in war he saw enough at any rate to disgust him with a military life indeed to excite in his a great abhorrence of it so much so that though he was tempted by the offer of some petty office in the army when he was about eighteen he not only declined that but he also refused to train when warned and was fined for it he then resolved that he would never have anything to do with any war unless it were a war for liberty  when the troubles in kansas began he sent several of his sons thither to strengthen the party of the free state men fitting them out with such weapons as he had telling them that if the troubles should increase and there should be need of his he would follow to assist them with his hand and counsel this as you all know he soon after did and it was through his agency far more than any others that kansas was made free  for a part of his life he was a surveyor and at one time he was engaged in woolgrowing and he went to europe as an agent about that business there as everywhere he had his eyes about him and made many original observations he said for instance that he saw why the soil of england was so rich and that of germany i think it was so poor and he thought of writing to some of the crowned heads about it it was because in england the peasantry live on the soil which they cultivate but in germany they are gathered into villages at night it is a pity that he did not make a book of his observations  i should say that he was an oldfashioned man in respect for the constitution and his faith in the permanence of this union slavery he deemed to be wholly opposed to these and he was its determined foe  he was by descent and birth a new england farmer a man of great commonsense deliberate and practical as that class is and tenfold more so he was like the best of those who stood at concord bridge once on lexington common and on bunker hill only he was firmer and higher principled than any that i have chanced to hear of as there it was no abolition lecturer that converted him ethan allen and stark with whom he may in some respects be compared were rangers in a lower and less important field they could bravely face their countrys foes but he had the courage to face his country herself when she was in the wrong a western writer says to account for his escape from so many perils that he was concealed under a rural exterior as if in that prairie land a hero should by good rights wear a citizens dress only  he did not go to the college called harvard good old alma mater as she is he was not fed on the pap that is there furnished as he phrased it i know no more of grammar than one of your calves but he went to the great university of the west where he sedulously pursued the study of liberty for which he had early betrayed a fondness and having taken many degrees he finally commenced the public practice of humanity in kansas as you all know such were his humanities and not any study of grammar he would have left a greek accent slanting the wrong way and righted up a falling man  he was one of that class of whom we hear a great deal but for the most part see nothing at allthe puritans it would be in vain to kill him he died lately in the time of cromwell but he reappeared here why should he not some of the puritan stock are said to have come over and settled in new england they were a class that did something else than celebrate their forefathers day and eat parched corn in remembrance of that time they were neither democrats nor republicans but men of simple habits straightforward prayerful not thinking much of rulers who did not fear god not making many compromises nor seeking after available candidates  in his camp as one has recently written and as i have myself heard him state he permitted no profanity no man of loose morals was suffered to remain there unless indeed as a prisoner of war i would rather said he have the smallpox yellowfever and cholera all together in my camp than a man without principle it is a mistake sir that our people make when they think that bullies are the best fighters or that they are the fit men to oppose these southerners give me men of good principlesgodfearing menmen who respect themselves and with a dozen of them i will oppose any hundred such men as these buford ruffians he said that if one offered himself to be a soldier under him who was forward to tell what he could or would do if he could only get sight of the enemy he had but little confidence in him  he was never able to find more than a score or so of recruits whom he would accept and only about a dozen among them his sons in whom he had perfect faith when he was here some years ago he showed to a few a little manuscript bookhis orderly book i think he called itcontaining the names of his company in kansas and the rules by which they bound themselves and he stated that several of them had already sealed the contract with their blood when some one remarked that with the addition of a chaplain it would have been a perfect cromwellian troop he observed that he would have been glad to add a chaplain to the list if he could have found one who could fill that office worthily it is easy enough to find one for the united states army i believe that he had prayers in his camp morning and evening nevertheless  he was a man of spartan habits and at sixty was scrupulous about his diet at your table excusing himself by saying that he must eat sparingly and fare hard as became a soldier or one who was fitting himself for difficult enterprises a life of exposure  a man of rare commonsense and directness of speech as of action a transcendentalist above all a man of ideas and principlesthat was what distinguished him not yielding to a whim or transient impulse but carrying out the purpose of a life i noticed that he did not overstate anything but spoke within bounds i remember particularly how in his speech here he referred to what his family had suffered in kansas without ever giving the least vent to his pentup fire it was a volcano with an ordinary chimneyflue also referring to the deeds of certain border ruffians he said rapidly paring away his speech like an experienced soldier keeping a reserve of force and meaning they had a perfect right to be hung he was not in the least a rhetorician was not talking to buncombe or his constituents anywhere had no need to invent anything but to tell the simple truth and communicate his own resolution therefore he appeared incomparably strong and eloquence in congress and elsewhere seemed to me at a discount it was like the speeches of cromwell compared with those of an ordinary king  as for his tact and prudence i will merely say that at a time when scarcely a man from the free states was able to reach kansas by any direct route at least without having his arms taken from him he carrying what imperfect guns and other weapons he could collect openly and slowly drove an oxcart through missouri apparently in the capacity of a surveyor with his surveying compass exposed in it and so passed unsuspected and had ample opportunity to learn the designs of the enemy for some time after his arrival he still followed the same profession when for instance he saw a knot of the ruffians on the prairie discussing of course the single topic which then occupied their minds he would perhaps take his compass and one of his sons and proceed to run an imaginary line right through the very spot on which that conclave had assembled and when he came up to them he would naturally pause and have some talk with them learning their news and at last all their plans perfectly and having thus completed his real survey he would resume his imaginary one and run on his line till he was out of sight  when i expressed surprise that he could live in kansas at all with a price set upon his head and so large a number including the authorities exasperated against him he accounted for it by saying it is perfectly well understood that i will not be taken much of the time for some years he has had to skulk in swamps suffering from poverty and from sickness which was the consequence of exposure befriended only by indians and a few whites but though it might be known that he was lurking in a particular swamp his foes commonly did not care to go in after him he could even come out into a town where there were more border ruffians than free state men and transact some business without delaying long and yet not be molested for said he no little handful of men were willing to undertake it and a large body could not be got together in season  as for his recent failure we do not know the facts about it it was evidently far from being a wild and desperate attempt his enemy mr vallandigham is compelled to say that it was among the best planned executed conspiracies that ever failed  not to mention his other successes was it a failure or did it show a want of good management to deliver from bondage a dozen human beings and walk off with them by broad daylight for weeks if not months at a leisurely pace through one state after another for half the length of the north conspicuous to all parties with a price set upon his head going into a courtroom on his way and telling what he had done thus convincing missouri that it was not profitable to try to hold slaves in his neighborhoodand this not because the government menials were lenient but because they were afraid of him  yet he did not attribute his success foolishly to his star or to any magic he said truly that the reason why such greatly superior numbers quailed before him was as one of his prisoners confessed because they lacked a causea kind of armor which he and his party never lacked when the time came few men were found willing to lay down their lives in defence of what they knew to be wrong they did not like that this should be their last act in this world  but to make haste to his last act and its effects  the newspapers seem to ignore or perhaps are really ignorant of the fact that there are at least as many as two or three individuals to a town throughout the north who think much as the present speaker does about him and his enterprise i do not hesitate to say that they are an important and growing party we aspire to be something more than stupid and timid chattels pretending to read history and our bibles but desecrating every house and every day we breathe in perhaps anxious politicians may prove that only seventeen white men and five negroes were concerned in the late enterprise but their very anxiety to prove this might suggest to themselves that all is not told why do they still dodge the truth they are so anxious because of a dim consciousness of the fact which they do not distinctly face that at least a million of the free inhabitants of the united states would have rejoiced if it had succeeded they at most only criticise the tactics though we wear no crape the thought of that mans position and probable fate is spoiling many a mans day here at the north for other thinking if any one who has seen him here can pursue successfully any other train of thought i do not know what he is made of if there is any such who gets his usual allowance of sleep i will warrant him to fatten easily under any circumstances which do not touch his body or purse i put a piece of paper and a pencil under my pillow and when i could not sleep i wrote in the dark  on the whole my respect for my fellowmen except as one may outweigh a million is not being increased these days i have noticed the coldblooded way in which newspaper writers and men generally speak of this event as if an ordinary malefactor though one of unusual pluckas the governor of virginia is reported to have said using the language of the cockpit the gamest man he ever sawhad been caught and were about to be hung he was not dreaming of his foes when the governor thought he looked so brave it turns what sweetness i have to gall to hear or hear of the remarks of some of my neighbors when we heard at first that he was dead one of my townsmen observed that he died as the fool dieth which pardon me for an instant suggested a likeness in him dying to my neighbor living others cravenhearted said disparagingly that he threw his life away because he resisted the government which way have they thrown their lives praysuch as would praise a man for attacking singly an ordinary band of thieves or murderers i hear another ask yankeelike what will he gain by it as if he expected to fill his pockets by this enterprise such a one has no idea of gain but in this worldly sense if it does not lead to a surprise party if he does not get a new pair of boots or a vote of thanks it must be a failure but he wont gain anything by it well no i dont suppose he could get fourandsixpence a day for being hung take the year round but then he stands a chance to save a considerable part of his souland such a soulwhen you do not no doubt you can get more in your market for a quart of milk than for a quart of blood but that is not the market that heroes carry their blood to  such do not know that like the seed is the fruit and that in the moral world when good seed is planted good fruit is inevitable and does not depend on our watering and cultivating that when you plant or bury a hero in his field a crop of heroes is sure to spring up this is a seed of such force and vitality that it does not ask our leave to germinate  the momentary charge at balaclava in obedience to a blundering command proving what a perfect machine the soldier is has properly enough been celebrated by a poet laureate but the steady and for the most part successful charge of this man for some years against the legions of slavery in obedience to an infinitely higher command is as much more memorable than that as an intelligent and conscientious man is superior to a machine do you think that that will go unsung  served him righta dangerous manhe is undoubtedly insane so they proceed to live their sane and wise and altogether admirable lives reading their plutarch a little but chiefly pausing at that feat of putnam who was let down into a wolfs den and in this wise they nourish themselves for brave and patriotic deeds some time or other the tract society could afford to print that story of putnam you might open the district schools with the reading of it for there is nothing about slavery or the church in it unless it occurs to the reader that some pastors are wolves in sheeps clothing the american board of commissioners for foreign missions even might dare to protest against that wolf i have heard of boards and of american boards but it chances that i never heard of this particular lumber till lately and yet i hear of northern men and women and children by families buying a life membership in such societies as these a lifemembership in the grave you can get buried cheaper than that  our foes are in our midst and all about us there is hardly a house but is divided against itself for our foe is the all but universal woodenness of both head and heart the want of vitality in man which is the effect of our vice and hence are begotten fear superstition bigotry persecution and slavery of all kinds we are mere figureheads upon a hulk with livers in the place of hearts the curse is the worship of idols which at length changes the worshipper into a stone image himself and the newenglander is just as much an idolater as the hindoo this man was an exception for he did not set up even a political graven image between him and his god  a church that can never have done with excommunicating christ while it exists away with your broad and flat churches and your narrow and tall churches take a step forward and invent a new style of outhouses invent a salt that will save you and defend our nostrils  the modern christian is a man who has consented to say all the prayers in the liturgy provided you will let him go straight to bed and sleep quietly afterward all his prayers begin with now i lay me down to sleep and he is forever looking forward to the time when he shall go to his long rest he has consented to perform certain oldestablished charities too after a fashion but he does not wish to hear of any newfangled ones he doesnt wish to have any supplementary articles added to the contract to fit it to the present time he shows the whites of his eyes on the sabbath and the blacks all the rest of the week the evil is not merely a stagnation of blood but a stagnation of spirit many no doubt are well disposed but sluggish by constitution and by habit and they cannot conceive of a man who is actuated by higher motives than they are accordingly they pronounce this man insane for they know that they could never act as he does as long as they are themselves  we dream of foreign countries of other times and races of men placing them at a distance in history or space but let some significant event like the present occur in our midst and we discover often this distance and this strangeness between us and our nearest neighbors they are our austrias and chinas and south sea islands our crowded society becomes well spaced all at once clean and handsome to the eyea city of magnificent distances we discover why it was that we never got beyond compliments and surfaces with them before we become aware of as many versts between us and them as there are between a wandering tartar and a chinese town the thoughtful man becomes a hermit in the thoroughfares of the marketplace impassable seas suddenly find their level between us or dumb steppes stretch themselves out there it is the difference of constitution of intelligence and faith and not streams and mountains that make the true and impassable boundaries between individuals and between states none but the likeminded can come plenipotentiary to our court  i read all the newspapers i could get within a week after this event and i do not remember in them a single expression of sympathy for these men i have since seen one noble statement in a boston paper not editorial some voluminous sheets decided not to print the full report of browns words to the exclusion of other matter it was as if a publisher should reject the manuscript of the new testament and print wilsons last speech the same journal which contained this pregnant news was chiefly filled in parallel columns with the reports of the political conventions that were being held but the descent to them was too steep they should have been spared this contrastbeen printed in an extra at least to turn from the voices and deeds of earnest men to the cackling of political conventions officeseekers and speechmakers who do not so much as lay an honest egg but wear their breasts bare upon an egg of chalk their great game is the game of straws or rather that universal aboriginal game of the platter at which the indians cried hub bub exclude the reports of religious and political conventions and publish the words of a living man  but i object not so much to what they have omitted as to what they have inserted even the liberator called it a misguided wild and apparently insaneeffort as for the herd of newspapers and magazines i do not chance to know an editor in the country who will deliberately print anything which he knows will ultimately and permanently reduce the number of his subscribers they do not believe that it would be expedient how then can they print truth if we do not say pleasant things they argue nobody will attend to us and so they do like some travelling auctioneers who sing an obscene song in order to draw a crowd around them republican editors obliged to get their sentences ready for the morning edition and accustomed to look at everything by the twilight of politics express no admiration nor true sorrow even but call these men deluded fanaticsmistaken meninsane or crazed it suggests what a sane set of editors we are blessed with not mistaken men who know very well on which side their bread is buttered at least  a man does a brave and humane deed and at once on all sides we hear people and parties declaring i didnt do it nor countenance him to do it in any conceivable way it cant be fairly inferred from my past career i for one am not interested to hear you define your position i dont know that i ever was or ever shall be i think it is mere egotism or impertinent at this time ye neednt take so much pains to wash your skirts of him no intelligent man will ever be convinced that he was any creature of yours he went and came as he himself informs us under the auspices of john brown and nobody else the republican party does not perceive how many his failure will make to vote more correctly than they would have them they have counted the votes of pennsylvania  co but they have not correctly counted captain browns vote he has taken the wind out of their sailsthe little wind they hadand they may as well lie to and repair  what though he did not belong to your clique though you may not approve of his method or his principles recognize his magnanimity would you not like to claim kindredship with him in that though in no other thing he is like or likely to you do you think that you would lose your reputation so what you lost at the spile you would gain at the bung  if they do not mean all this then they do not speak the truth and say what they mean they are simply at their old tricks still  it was always conceded to him says one who calls him crazy that he was a conscientious man very modest in his demeanor apparently inoffensive until the subject of slavery was introduced when he would exhibit a feeling of indignation unparalleled  the slaveship is on her way crowded with its dying victims new cargoes are being added in midocean a small crew of slaveholders countenanced by a large body of passengers is smothering four millions under the hatches and yet the politician asserts that the only proper way by which deliverance is to be obtained is by the quiet diffusion of the sentiments of humanity without any outbreak as if the sentiments of humanity were ever found unaccompanied by its deeds and you could disperse them all finished to order the pure article as easily as water with a wateringpot and so lay the dust what is that that i hear cast overboard the bodies of the dead that have found deliverance that is the way we are diffusing humanity and its sentiments with it  prominent and influential editors accustomed to deal with politicians men of an infinitely lower grade say in their ignorance that he acted on the principle of revenge they do not know the man they must enlarge themselves to conceive of him i have no doubt that the time will come when they will begin to see him as he was they have got to conceive of a man of faith and of religious principle and not a politician or an indian of a man who did not wait till he was personally interfered with or thwarted in some harmless business before he gave his life to the cause of the oppressed  if walker may be considered the representative of the south i wish i could say that brown was the representative of the north he was a superior man he did not value his bodily life in comparison with ideal things he did not recognize unjust human laws but resisted them as he was bid for once we are lifted out of the trivialness and dust of politics into the region of truth and manhood no man in america has ever stood up so persistently and effectively for the dignity of human nature knowing himself for a man and the equal of any and all governments in that sense he was the most american of us all he needed no babbling lawyer making false issues to defend him he was more than a match for all the judges that american voters or officeholders of whatever grade can create he could not have been tried by a jury of his peers because his peers did not exist when a man stands up serenely against the condemnation and vengeance of mankind rising above them literally by a whole bodyeven though he were of late the vilest murderer who has settled that matter with himselfthe spectacle is a sublime onedidnt ye know it ye liberators ye tribunes ye republicansand we become criminal in comparison do yourselves the honor to recognize him he needs none of your respect  as for the democratic journals they are not human enough to affect me at all i do not feel indignation at anything they may say  i am aware that i anticipate a littlethat he was still at the last accounts alive in the hands of his foes but that being the case i have all along found myself thinking and speaking of him as physically dead  i do not believe in erecting statues to those who still live in our hearts whose bones have not yet crumbled in the earth around us but i would rather see the statue of captain brown in the massachusetts statehouse yard than that of any other man whom i know i rejoice that i live in this age that i am his contemporary  what a contrast when we turn to that political party which is so anxiously shuffling him and his plot out of its way and looking around for some available slave holder perhaps to be its candidate at least for one who will execute the fugitive slave law and all those other unjust laws which he took up arms to annul  insane a father and six sons and one soninlaw and several more men besidesas many at least as twelve disciplesall struck with insanity at once while the same tyrant holds with a firmer gripe than ever his four millions of slaves and a thousand sane editors his abettors are saving their country and their bacon just as insane were his efforts in kansas ask the tyrant who is his most dangerous foe the sane man or the insane do the thousands who know him best who have rejoiced at his deeds in kansas and have afforded him material aid there think him insane such a use of this word is a mere trope with most who persist in using it and i have no doubt that many of the rest have already in silence retracted their words  read his admirable answers to mason and others how they are dwarfed and defeated by the contrast on the one side halfbrutish halftimid questioning on the other truth clear as lightning crashing into their obscene temples they are made to stand with pilate and gesler and the inquisition how ineffectual their speech and action and what a void their silence they are but helpless tools in this great work it was no human power that gathered them about this preacher  what have massachusetts and the north sent a few sane representatives to congress for of late yearsto declare with effect what kind of sentiments all their speeches put together and boiled downand probably they themselves will confess itdo not match for manly directness and force and for simple truth the few casual remarks of crazy john brown on the floor of the harpers ferry enginehousethat man whom you are about to hang to send to the other world though not to represent you there no he was not our representative in any sense he was too fair a specimen of a man to represent the like of us who then were his constituents if you read his words understandingly you will find out in his case there is no idle eloquence no made nor maiden speech no compliments to the oppressor truth is his inspirer and earnestness the polisher of his sentences he could afford to lose his sharps rifles while he retained his faculty of speecha sharps rifle of infinitely surer and longer range  and the new york herald reports the conversation verbatim it does not know of what undying words it is made the vehicle  i have no respect for the penetration of any man who can read the report of that conversation and still call the principal in it insane it has the ring of a saner sanity than an ordinary discipline and habits of life than an ordinary organization secure take any sentence of itany questions that i can honorably answer i will not otherwise so far as i am myself concerned i have told everything truthfully i value my word sir the few who talk about his vindictive spirit while they really admire his heroism have no test by which to detect a noble man no amalgam to combine with his pure gold they mix their own dross with it  it is a relief to turn from these slanders to the testimony of his more truthful but frightened jailers and hangmen governor wise speaks far more justly and appreciatingly of him than any northern editor or politician or public personage that i chance to have heard from i know that you can afford to hear him again on this subject he says they are themselves mistaken who take him to be madman he is cool collected and indomitable and it is but just to him to say that he was humane to his prisoners and he inspired me with great trust in his integrity as a man of truth he is a fanatic vain and garrulous i leave that part to mr wise but firm truthful and intelligent his men too who survive are like him colonel washington says that he was the coolest and firmest man he ever saw in defying danger and death with one son dead by his side and another shot through he felt the pulse of his dying son with one hand and held his rifle with the other and commanded his men with the utmost composure encouraging them to be firm and to sell their lives as dear as they could of the three white prisoners brown stephens and coppic it was hard to say which was most firm  almost the first northern men whom the slaveholder has learned to respect  the testimony of mr vallandigham though less valuable is of the same purport that it is vain to underrate either the man or his conspiracy he is the farthest possible removed from the ordinary ruffian fanatic or madman  all is quiet at harpers ferry say the journals what is the character of that calm which follows when the law and the slaveholder prevail i regard this event as a touchstone designed to bring out with glaring distinctness the character of this government we needed to be thus assisted to see it by the light of history it needed to see itself when a government puts forth its strength on the side of injustice as ours to maintain slavery and kill the liberators of the slave it reveals itself a merely brute force or worse a demoniacal force it is the head of the pluguglies it is more manifest than ever that tyranny rules i see this government to be effectually allied with france and austria in oppressing mankind there sits a tyrant holding fettered four millions of slaves here comes their heroic liberator this most hypocritical and diabolical government looks up from its seat on the gasping four millions and inquires with an assumption of innocence what do you assault me for am i not an honest man cease agitation on this subject or i will make a slave of you too or else hang you  we talk about a representative government but what a monster of a government is that where the noblest faculties of the mind and the whole heart are not represented a semihuman tiger or ox stalking over the earth with its heart taken out and the top of its brain shot away heroes have fought well on their stumps when their legs were shot off but i never heard of any good done by such a government as that  the only government that i recognizeand it matters not how few are at the head of it or how small its armyis that power that establishes justice in the land never that which establishes injustice what shall we think of a government to which all the truly brave and just men in the land are enemies standing between it and those whom it oppresses a government that pretends to be christian and crucifies a million christs every day  treason where does such treason take its rise i cannot help thinking of you as you deserve ye governments can you dry up the fountains of thought high treason when it is resistance to tyranny here below has its origin in and is first committed by the power that makes and forever recreates man when you have caught and hung all these human rebels you have accomplished nothing but your own guilt for you have not struck at the fountainhead you presume to contend with a foe against whom west point cadets and rifled cannon point not can all the art of the cannonfounder tempt matter to turn against its maker is the form in which the founder thinks he casts it more essential than the constitution of it and of himself  the united states have a coffle of four millions of slaves they are determined to keep them in this condition and massachusetts is one of the confederated overseers to prevent their escape such are not all the inhabitants of massachusetts but such are they who rule and are obeyed here it was massachusetts as well as virginia that put down this insurrection at harpers ferry she sent the marines there and she will have to pay the penalty of her sin  suppose that there is a society in this state that out of its own purse and magnanimity saves all the fugitive slaves that run to us and protects our colored fellowcitizens and leaves the other work to the government socalled is not that government fast losing its occupation and becoming contemptible to mankind if private men are obliged to perform the offices of government to protect the weak and dispense justice then the government becomes only a hired man or clerk to perform menial or indifferent services of course that is but the shadow of a government whose existence necessitates a vigilant committee what should we think of the oriental cadi even behind whom worked in secret a vigilant committee but such is the character of our northern states generally each has its vigilant committee and to a certain extent these crazy governments recognize and accept this relation they say virtually well be glad to work for you on these terms only dont make a noise about it and thus the government its salary being insured withdraws into the back shop taking the constitution with it and bestows most of its labor on repairing that when i hear it at work sometimes as i go by it reminds me at best of those farmers who in winter contrive to turn a penny by following the coopering business and what kind of spirit is their barrel made to hold they speculate in stocks and bore holes in mountains but they are not competent to lay out even a decent highway the only free road the underground railroad is owned and managed by the vigilant committee they have tunnelled under the whole breadth of the land such a government is losing its power and respectability as surely as water runs out of a leaky vessel and is held by one that can contain it  i hear many condemn these men because they were so few when were the good and the brave ever in a majority would you have had him wait till that time cametill you and i came over to him the very fact that he had no rabble or troop of hirelings about him would alone distinguish him from ordinary heroes his company was small indeed because few could be found worthy to pass muster each one who there laid down his life for the poor and oppressed was a picked man culled out of many thousands if not millions apparently a man of principle of rare courage and devoted humanity ready to sacrifice his life at any moment for the benefit of his fellowman it may be doubted if there were as many more their equals in these respects in all the countryi speak of his followers onlyfor their leader no doubt scoured the land far and wide seeking to swell his troop these alone were ready to step between the oppressor and the oppressed surely they were the very best men you could select to be hung that was the greatest compliment which this country could pay them they were ripe for her gallows she has tried a long time she has hung a good many but never found the right one before  when i think of him and his six sons and his soninlaw not to enumerate the others enlisted for this fight proceeding coolly reverently humanely to work for months if not years sleeping and waking upon it summering and wintering the thought without expecting any reward but a good conscience while almost all america stood ranked on the other sidei say again that it affects me as a sublime spectacle if he had any journal advocating his cause any organ as the phrase is monotonously and wearisomely playing the same old tune and then passing round the hat it would have been fatal to his efficiency if he had acted in any way so as to be let alone by the government he might have been suspected it was the fact that the tyrant must give place to him or he to the tyrant that distinguished him from all the reformers of the day that i know  it was his peculiar doctrine that a man has a perfect right to interfere by force with the slaveholder in order to rescue the slave i agree with him they who are continually shocked by slavery have some right to be shocked by the violent death of the slaveholder but no others such will be more shocked by his life than by his death i shall not be forward to think him mistaken in his method who quickest succeeds to liberate the slave i speak for the slave when i say that i prefer the philanthropy of captain brown to that philanthropy which neither shoots me nor liberates me at any rate i do not think it is quite sane for one to spend his whole life in talking or writing about this matter unless he is continuously inspired and i have not done so a man may have other affairs to attend to i do not wish to kill nor to be killed but i can foresee circumstances in which both these things would be by me unavoidable we preserve the socalled peace of our community by deeds of petty violence every day look at the policemans billy and handcuffs look at the jail look at the gallows look at the chaplain of the regiment we are hoping only to live safely on the outskirts of this provisional army so we defend ourselves and our henroosts and maintain slavery i know that the mass of my countrymen think that the only righteous use that can be made of sharps rifles and revolvers is to fight duels with them when we are insulted by other nations or to hunt indians or shoot fugitive slaves with them or the like i think that for once the sharps rifles and the revolvers were employed in a righteous cause the tools were in the hands of one who could use them  the same indignation that is said to have cleared the temple once will clear it again the question is not about the weapon but the spirit in which you use it no man has appeared in america as yet who loved his fellowman so well and treated him so tenderly he lived for him he took up his life and he laid it down for him what sort of violence is that which is encouraged not by soldiers but by peaceable citizens not so much by laymen as by ministers of the gospel not so much by the fighting sects as by the quakers and not so much by quaker men as by quaker women  this event advertises me that there is such a fact as deaththe possibility of a mans dying it seems as if no man had ever died in america before for in order to die you must first have lived i dont believe in the hearses and palls and funerals that they have had there was no death in the case because there had been no life they merely rotted or sloughed off pretty much as they had rotted or sloughed along no temples veil was rent only a hole dug somewhere let the dead bury their dead the best of them fairly ran down like a clock franklinwashingtonthey were let off without dying they were merely missing one day i hear a good many pretend that they are going to die or that they have died for aught that i know nonsense ill defy them to do it they havent got life enough in them theyll deliquesce like fungi and keep a hundred eulogists mopping the spot where they left off only half a dozen or so have died since the world began do you think that you are going to die sir no theres no hope of you you havent got your lesson yet youve got to stay after school we make a needless ado about capital punishmenttaking lives when there is no life to take memento mori we dont understand that sublime sentence which some worthy got sculptured on his gravestone once weve interpreted it in a grovelling and snivelling sense weve wholly forgotten how to die  but be sure you do die nevertheless do your work and finish it if you know how to begin you will know when to end  these men in teaching us how to die have at the same time taught us how to live if this mans acts and words do not create a revival it will be the severest possible satire on the acts and words that do it is the best news that america has ever heard it has already quickened the feeble pulse of the north and infused more and more generous blood into her veins and heart than any number of years of what is called commercial and political prosperity could how many a man who was lately contemplating suicide has now something to live for  one writer says that browns peculiar monomania made him to be dreaded by the missourians as a supernatural being sure enough a hero in the midst of us cowards is always so dreaded he is just that thing he shows himself superior to nature he has a spark of divinity in him                  unless above himself he can     erect himself how poor a thing is man  newspaper editors argue also that it is a proof of his insanity that he thought he was appointed to do this work which he didthat he did not suspect himself for a moment they talk as if it were impossible that a man could be divinely appointed in these days to do any work whatever as if vows and religion were out of date as connected with any mans daily work as if the agent to abolish slavery could only be somebody appointed by the president or by some political party they talk as if a mans death were a failure and his continued life be it of whatever character were a success  when i reflect to what a cause this man devoted himself and how religiously and then reflect to what cause his judges and all who condemn him so angrily and fluently devote themselves i see that they are as far apart as the heavens and earth are asunder  the amount of it is our leading men are a harmless kind of folk and they know well enough that they were not divinely appointed but elected by the votes of their party  who is it whose safety requires that captain brown be hung is it indispensable to any northern man is there no resource but to cast this man also to the minotaur if you do not wish it say so distinctly while these things are being done beauty stands veiled and music is a screeching lie think of himof his rare qualitiessuch a man as it takes ages to make and ages to understand no mock hero nor the representative of any party a man such as the sun may not rise upon again in this benighted land to whose making went the costliest material the finest adamant sent to be the redeemer of those in captivity and the only use to which you can put him is to hang him at the end of a rope you who pretend to care for christ crucified consider what you are about to do to him who offered himself to be the savior of four millions of men  any man knows when he is justified and all the wits in the world cannot enlighten him on that point the murderer always knows that he is justly punished but when a government takes the life of a man without the consent of his conscience it is an audacious government and is taking a step towards its own dissolution is it not possible that an individual may be right and a government wrong are laws to be enforced simply because they were made or declared by any number of men to be good if they are not good is there any necessity for a mans being a tool to perform a deed of which his better nature disapproves is it the intention of lawmakers that good men shall be hung ever are judges to interpret the law according to the letter and not the spirit what right have you to enter into a compact with yourself that you will do thus or so against the light within you is it for you to make up your mindto form any resolution whateverand not accept the convictions that are forced upon you and which ever pass your understanding i do not believe in lawyers in that mode of attacking or defending a man because you descend to meet the judge on his own ground and in cases of the highest importance it is of no consequence whether a man breaks a human law or not let lawyers decide trivial cases business men may arrange that among themselves if they were the interpreters of the everlasting laws which rightfully bind man that would be another thing a counterfeiting lawfactory standing half in a slave land and half in free what kind of laws for free men can you expect from that  i am here to plead his cause with you i plead not for his life but for his characterhis immortal life and so it becomes your cause wholly and is not his in the least some eighteen hundred years ago christ was crucified this morning perchance captain brown was hung these are the two ends of a chain which is not without its links he is not old brown any longer he is an angel of light  i see now that it was necessary that the bravest and humanest man in all the country should be hung perhaps he saw it himself i almost fear that i may yet hear of his deliverance doubting if a prolonged life if any life can do as much good as his death  misguided garrulous insane vindictive so ye write in your easychairs and thus he wounded responds from the floor of the armory clear as a cloudless sky true as the voice of nature is no man sent me here it was my own prompting and that of my maker i acknowledge no master in human form  and in what a sweet and noble strain he proceeds addressing his captors who stand over him i think my friends you are guilty of a great wrong against god and humanity and it would be perfectly right for any one to interfere with you so far as to free those you willfully and wickedly hold in bondage  and referring to his movement it is in my opinion the greatest service a man can render to god  i pity the poor in bondage that have none to help them that is why i am here not to gratify any personal animosity revenge or vindictive spirit it is my sympathy with the oppressed and the wronged that are as good as you and as precious in the sight of god  you dont know your testament when you see it  i want you to understand that i respect the rights of the poorest and weakest of colored people oppressed by the slave power just as much as i do those of the most wealthy and powerful  i wish to say furthermore that you had better all you people at the south prepare yourselves for a settlement of that question that must come up for settlement sooner than you are prepared for it the sooner you are prepared the better you may dispose of me very easily i am nearly disposed of now but this question is still to be settledthis negro question i mean the end of that is not yet  i foresee the time when the painter will paint that scene no longer going to rome for a subject the poet will sing it the historian record it and with the landing of the pilgrims and the declaration of independence it will be the ornament of some future national gallery when at least the present form of slavery shall be no more here we shall then be at liberty to weep for captain brown then and not till then we will take our revenge
