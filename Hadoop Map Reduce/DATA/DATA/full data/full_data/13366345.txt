13366345	a wonderbook for girls and boys                       by nathaniel hawthorne                           the gorgons head     contents    tanglewood porchintroductory to the gorgons head   the gorgons head   tanglewood porchafter the story    the author has long been of opinion that many of the classical myths were capable of being rendered into very capital reading for children  in the little volume here offered to the public he has worked up half a dozen of them with this end in view  a great freedom of treatment was necessary to his plan but it will be observed by every one who attempts to render these legends malleable in his intellectual furnace that they are marvellously independent of all temporary modes and circumstances they remain essentially the same after changes that would affect the identity of almost anything else  he does not therefore plead guilty to a sacrilege in having sometimes shaped anew as his fancy dictated the forms that have been hallowed by an antiquity of two or three thousand years  no epoch of time can claim a copyright in these immortal fables  they seem never to have been made and certainly so long as man exists they can never perish but by their indestructibility itself they are legitimate subjects for every age to clothe with its own garniture of manners and sentiment and to imbue with its own morality  in the present version they may have lost much of their classical aspect or at all events the author has not been careful to preserve it and have perhaps assumed a gothic or romantic guise  in performing this pleasant taskfor it has been really a task fit for hot weather and one of the most agreeable of a literary kind which he ever undertookthe author has not always thought it necessary to write downward in order to meet the comprehension of children  he has generally suffered the theme to soar whenever such was its tendency and when he himself was buoyant enough to follow without an effort children possess an unestimated sensibility to whatever is deep or high in imagination or feeling so long as it is simple likewise  it is only the artificial and the complex that bewilder them  lenox july 15 1851     the gorgons head  tanglewood porch  introductory to the gorgons head  beneath the porch of the countryseat called tanglewood one fine autumnal morning was assembled a merry party of little folks with a tall youth in the midst of them  they had planned a nutting expedition and were impatiently waiting for the mists to roll up the hillslopes and for the sun to pour the warmth of the indian summer over the fields and pastures and into the nooks of the manycolored woods  there was a prospect of as fine a day as ever gladdened the aspect of this beautiful and comfortable world  as yet however the morning mist filled up the whole length and breadth of the valley above which on a gently sloping eminence the mansion stood  this body of white vapor extended to within less than a hundred yards of the house  it completely hid everything beyond that distance except a few ruddy or yellow treetops which here and there emerged and were glorified by the early sunshine as was likewise the broad surface of the mist  four or five miles off to the southward rose the summit of monument mountain and seemed to be floating on a cloud  some fifteen miles farther away in the same direction appeared the loftier dome of taconic looking blue and indistinct and hardly so substantial as the vapory sea that almost rolled over it  the nearer hills which bordered the valley were half submerged and were specked with little cloudwreaths all the way to their tops  on the whole there was so much cloud and so little solid earth that it had the effect of a vision  the children abovementioned being as full of life as they could hold kept overflowing from the porch of tanglewood and scampering along the gravelwalk or rushing across the dewy herbage of the lawn  i can hardly tell how many of these small people there were not less than nine or ten however nor more than a dozen of all sorts sizes and ages whether girls or boys  they were brothers sisters and cousins together with a few of their young acquaintances who had been invited by mr and mrs pringle to spend some of this delightful weather with their own children at tanglewood  i am afraid to tell you their names or even to give them any names which other children have ever been called by because to my certain knowledge authors sometimes get themselves into great trouble by accidentally giving the names of real persons to the characters in their books  for this reason i mean to call them primrose periwinkle sweet fern dandelion blue eye clover huckleberry cowslip squashblossom milkweed plantain and buttercup although to be sure such titles might better suit a group of fairies than a company of earthly children  it is not to be supposed that these little folks were to be permitted by their careful fathers and mothers uncles aunts or grandparents to stray abroad into the woods and fields without the guardianship of some particularly grave and elderly person  o no indeed  in the first sentence of my book you will recollect that i spoke of a tall youth standing in the midst of the children  his nameand i shall let you know his real name because he considers it a great honor to have told the stories that are here to be printedhis name was eustace bright he was a student at williams college and had reached i think at this period the venerable age of eighteenyears so that he felt quite like a grandfather towards periwinkle dandelion huckleberry squashblossom milkweed and the rest who were only half or a third as venerable as he  a trouble in his eyesight such as many students think it necessary to have nowadays in order to prove their diligence at their books had kept him from college a week or two after the beginning of the term  but for my part i have seldom met with a pair of eyes that looked as if they could see farther or better than those of eustace bright  this learned student was slender and rather pale as all yankee students are but yet of a healthy aspect and as light and active as if he had wings to his shoes  by the by being much addicted to wading through streamlets and across meadows he had put on cowhide boots for the expedition  he wore a linen blouse a cloth cap and a pair of green spectacles which he had assumed probably less for the preservation of his eyes than for the dignity that they imparted to his countenance  in either case however he might as well have let then alone for huckleberry a mischievous little elf crept behind eustace as he sat on the steps of the porch snatched the spectacles from his nose and clapped them on her own and as the student forgot to take them back they fell off into the grass and lay there till the next spring  now eustace bright you must know had won great fame among the children as a narrator of wonderful stories and though he sometimes pretended to be annoyed when they teased him for more and more and always for more yet i really doubt whether he liked anything quite so well as to tell them  you might have seen his eyes twinkle therefore when clover sweet fern cowslip buttercup and most of their playmates besought him to relate one of his stories while they were waiting for the mist to clear up  yes cousin eustace said primrose who was a bright girl of twelve with laughing eyes and a nose that turned up a little the morning is certainly the best time for the stories with which you so often tire out our patience  we shall be in less danger of hurting your feelings by falling asleep at the most interesting pointsas little cowslip and i did last night  naughty primrose cried cowslip a child of six years old i did not fall asleep and i only shut my eyes so as to see a picture of what cousin eustace was telling about  his stories are good to hear at night because we can dream about them asleep and good in the morning too because then we can dream about them awake  so i hope he will tell us one this very minute  thank you my little cowslip said eustace certainly you shall have the best story i can think of if it were only for defending me so well from that naughty primrose  but children i have already told you so many fairy tales that i doubt whether there is a single one which you have not heard at least twice over  i am afraid you will fall asleep in reality if i repeat any of them again  no no no cried blue eye periwinkle plantain and half a dozen others  we like a story all the better for having heard it two or three tunes before  and it is a truth as regards children that a story seems often to deepen its mark in their interest not merely by two or three but by numberless repetitions  but eustace bright in the exuberance of his resources scorned to avail himself of an advantage which an older storyteller would have been glad to grasp at  it would be a great pity said he if a man of my learning to say nothing of original fancy could not find a new story every day year in and year out for children such as you  i will tell you one of the nursery tales that were made for the amusement of our great old grandmother the earth when she was a child in frock and pinafore there are a hundred such and it is a wonder to me that they have not long ago been put into picturebooks for little girls and boys  but instead of that old graybearded grandsires pore over them in musty volumes of greek and puzzle themselves with trying to find out when and how and for what they were made  well well well well cousin eustace cried all the children at once talk no more about your stories but begin  sit down then every soul of you said eustace bright and be all as still as so many mice  at the slightest interruption whether from great naughty primrose little dandelion or any other i shall bite the story short off between my teeth and swallow the untold part  but in the first place do any of you know what a gorgon is  i do said primrose  then hold your tongue rejoined eustace who had rather she would have known nothing about the matter  hold all your tongues and i shall tell you a sweet pretty story of a gorgons head  and so he did as you may begin to read on the next page  working up his sophomorical erudition with a good deal of tact and incurring great obligations to professor anthon he nevertheless disregarded all classical authorities whenever the vagrant audacity of his imagination impelled him to do so    the gorgons head  perseus was the son of danae who was the daughter of a king  and when perseus was a very little boy some wicked people put his mother and himself into a chest and set them afloat upon the sea  the wind blew freshly and drove the chest away from the shore and the uneasy billows tossed it up and down while danae clasped her child closely to her bosom and dreaded that some big wave would dash its foamy crest over them both  the chest sailed on however and neither sank nor was upset until when night was coming it floated so near an island that it got entangled in a fishermans nets and was drawn out high and dry upon the sand  the island was called seriphus and it was reigned over by king polydectes who happened to be the fishermans brother  this fisherman i am glad to tell you was an exceedingly humane and upright man  he showed great kindness to danae and her little boy and continued to befriend them until perseus had grown to be a handsome youth very strong and active and skilful in the use of arms  long before this time king polydectes had seen the two strangersthe mother and her childwho had come to his dominions in a floating chest  as he was not good and kind like his brother the fisherman but extremely wicked he resolved to send perseus on a dangerous enterprise in which he would probably be killed and then to do some great mischief to danae herself  so this badhearted king spent a long while in considering what was the most dangerous thing that a young man could possibly undertake to perform  at last having hit upon an enterprise that promised to turn out as fatally as he desired he sent for the youthful perseus  the young man came to the palace and found the king sitting upon his throne  perseus said king polydectes smiling craftily upon him you are grown up a fine young man  you and your good mother have received a great deal of kindness from myself as well as from my worthy brother the fisherman and i suppose you would not be sorry to repay some of it  please your majesty answered perseus i would willingly risk my life to do so  well then continued the king still with a curving smile on his lips i have a little adventure to propose to you and as you are a brave and enterprising youth you will doubtless look upon it as a great piece of good luck to have so rare an opportunity of distinguishing yourself  you must know my good perseus i think of getting married to the beautiful princess hippodamia and it is customary on these occasions to make the bride a present of some farfetched and elegant curiosity  i have been a little perplexed i must honestly confess where to obtain anything likely to please a princess of her exquisite taste  but this morning i flatter myself i have thought of precisely the article  and can i assist your majesty in obtaining it cried perseus eagerly  you can if you are as brave a youth as i believe you to be replied king polydectes with the utmost graciousness of manner  the bridal gift which i have set my heart on presenting to the beautiful hippodamia is the head of the gorgon medusa with the snaky locks and i depend on you my dear perseus to bring it to me  so as i am anxious to settle affairs with the princess the sooner you go in quest of the gorgon the better i shall be pleased  i will set out tomorrow morning answered perseus  pray do so my gallant youth rejoined the king  and perseus in cutting off the gorgons head be careful to make a clean stroke so as not to injure its appearance  you must bring it home in the very best condition in order to suit the exquisite taste of the beautiful princess hippodamia  perseus left the palace but was scarcely out of hearing before polydectes burst into a laugh being greatly amused wicked king that he was to find how readily the young man fell into the snare  the news quickly spread abroad that perseus had undertaken to cut off the head of medusa with the snaky locks  everybody was rejoiced for most of the inhabitants of the island were as wicked as the king himself and would have liked nothing better than to see some enormous mischief happen to danae and her son  the only good man in this unfortunate island of seriphus appears to have been the fisherman  as perseus walked along therefore the people pointed after him and made mouths and winked to one another and ridiculed him as loudly as they dared  ho ho cried they medusas snakes will sting him soundly  now there were three gorgons alive at that period and they were the most strange and terrible monsters that had ever been since the world was made or that have been seen in after days or that are likely to be seen in all time to come  i hardly know what sort of creature or hobgoblin to call them  they were three sisters and seem to have borne some distant resemblance to women but were really a very frightful and mischievous species of dragon  it is indeed difficult to imagine what hideous beings these three sisters were  why instead of locks of hair if you can believe me they had each of them a hundred enormous snakes growing on their heads all alive twisting wriggling curling and thrusting out their venomous tongues with forked stings at the end the teeth of the gorgons were terribly long tusks their hands were made of brass and their bodies were all over scales which if not iron were something as hard and impenetrable  they had wings too and exceedingly splendid ones i can assure you for every feather in them was pure bright glittering burnished gold and they looked very dazzlingly no doubt when the gorgons were flying about in the sunshine  but when people happened to catch a glimpse of their glittering brightness aloft in the air they seldom stopped to gaze but ran and hid themselves as speedily as they could  you will think perhaps that they were afraid of being stung by the serpents that served the gorgons instead of hairor of having their heads bitten off by their ugly tusksor of being torn all to pieces by their brazen claws  well to be sure these were some of the dangers but by no means the greatest nor the most difficult to avoid  for the worst thing about these abominable gorgons was that if once a poor mortal fixed his eyes full upon one of their faces he was certain that very instant to be changed from warm flesh and blood into cold and lifeless stone  thus as you will easily perceive it was a very dangerous adventure that the wicked king polydectes had contrived for this innocent young man  perseus himself when he had thought over the matter could not help seeing that he had very little chance of coming safely through it and that he was far more likely to become a stone image than to bring back the head of medusa with the snaky locks  for not to speak of other difficulties there was one which it would have puzzled an older man than perseus to get over  not only must he fight with and slay this goldenwinged ironscaled longtusked brazenclawed snakyhaired monster but he must do it with his eyes shut or at least without so much as a glance at the enemy with whom he was contending  else while his arm was lifted to strike he would stiffen into stone and stand with that uplifted arm for centuries until time and the wind and weather should crumble him quite away  this would be a very sad thing to befall a young mail who wanted to perform a great many brave deeds and to enjoy a great deal of happiness in this bright and beautiful world  so disconsolate did these thoughts make him that perseus could not bear to tell his another what he had undertaken to do  he therefore took his shield girded on his sword and crossed over from the island to the mainland where he sat down in a solitary place and hardly refrained from shedding tears  but while he was in this sorrowful mood he heard a voice close beside him  perseus said the voice why are you sad  he lifted his head from his hands in which he had hidden it and behold all alone as perseus had supposed himself to be there was a stranger in the solitary place  it was a brisk intelligent and remarkably shrewdlooking young man with a cloak over his shoulders an odd sort of cap on his head a strangely twisted staff in his hand and a short and very crooked sword hanging by his side  he was exceedingly light and active in his figure like a person much accustomed to gymnastic exercises and well able to leap or run  above all the stranger had such a cheerful knowing and helpful aspect though it was certainly a little mischievous into the bargain that perseus could not help feeling his spirits grow livelier as he gazed at him  besides being really a courageous youth he felt greatly ashamed that anybody should have found him with tears in his eyes like a timid little schoolboy when after all there might be no occasion for despair  so perseus wiped his eyes and answered the stranger pretty briskly putting on as brave a look as he could  i am not so very sad said he only thoughtful about an adventure that i have undertaken  oho answered the stranger  well tell me all about it and possibly i may be of service to you  i have helped a good many young men through adventures that looked difficult enough beforehand  perhaps you may have heard of me  i have more names than one but the name of quicksilver suits me as well as any other  tell me what your trouble is and we will talk the matter over and see what can be done  the strangers words and manner put perseus into quite a different mood from his former one  he resolved to tell quicksilver all his difficulties since he could not easily be worse off than he already was and very possibly his new friend might give him some advice that would turn out well in the end  so he let the stranger know in few words precisely what the case washow that king polydeetes wanted the head of medusa with the snaky locks as a bridal gift for the beautiful princess hippodamia and how that he had undertaken to get it for him but was afraid of being turned into stone  and that would be a great pity said quicksilver with his mischievous smile  you would make a very handsome marble statue it is true and it would be a considerable number of centuries before you crumbled away but on the whole one would rather be a young man for a few years than a stone image for a great many  o far rather exclaimed perseus with the tears again standing in his eyes  and besides what would my dear mother do if her beloved son were turned into a stone  well well let us hope that the affair will not turn out so very badly replied quicksilver in an encouraging tone  i am the very person to help you if anybody can  my sister and myself will do our utmost to bring you safe through the adventure ugly as it now looks  your sister repeated perseus  yes my sister said the stranger  she is very wise i promise you and as for myself i generally have all my wits about me such as they are  if you show yourself bold and cautious and follow our advice you need not fear being a stone image yet awhile  but first of all you must polish your shield till you can see your face in it as distinctly as in a mirror  this seemed to perseus rather an odd beginning of the adventure for he thought it of far more consequence that the shield should be strong enough to defend him from the gorgons brazen claws than that it should be bright enough to show him the reflection of his face  however concluding that quicksilver knew better than himself he immediately set to work and scrubbed the shield with so much diligence and goodwill that it very quickly shone like the moon at harvesttime  quicksilver looked at it with a smile and nodded his approbation  then taking off his own short and crooked sword he girded it about perseus instead of the one which he had before worn  no sword but mine will answer your purpose observed he the blade has a most excellent temper and will cut through iron and brass as easily as through the slenderest twig  and now we will set out  the next thing is to find the three gray women who will tell us where to find the nymphs  the three gray women cried perseus to whom this seemed only a new difficulty in the path of his adventure pray who may the three gray women be i never heard of them before  they are three very strange old ladies said quicksilver laughing they have but one eye among them and only one tooth  moreover you must find them out by starlight or in the dusk of the evening for they never show themselves by the light either of the sun or moon  but said perseus why should i waste my time with these three gray women  would it not be better to set out at once in search of the terrible gorgons  no no answered his friend  there are other things to be done before you can find your way to the gorgons  there is nothing for it but to hunt up these old ladies and when we meet with them you may be sure that the gorgons are not a great way off  come let us be stirring  perseus by this time felt so much confidence in his companions sagacity that he made no more objections and professed himself ready to begin the adventure immediately  they accordingly set out and walked at a pretty brisk pace so brisk indeed that perseus found it rather difficult to keep up with his nimble friend quicksilver  to say the truth he had a singular idea that quicksilver was furnished with a pair of winged shoes which of course helped him along marvellously and then too when perseus looked sideways at him out of the corner of his eye he seemed to see wings on the side of his head although if he turned a full gaze there were no such things to be perceived but only an odd kind of cap  but at all events the twisted staff was evidently a great convenience to quicksilver and enabled him to proceed so fast that perseus though a remarkably active young man began to be out of breath  here cried quicksilver at lastfor he knew well enough rogue that he was how hard perseus found it to keep pace with himtake you the staff for you need it a great deal more than i  are there no better walkers than yourself in the island of seriphus  i could walk pretty well said perseus glancing slyly at his companions feet if i had only a pair of winged shoes  we must see about getting you a pair answered quicksilver  but the staff helped perseus along so bravely that he no longer felt the slightest weariness  in fact the stick seemed to be alive in his hand and to lend some of its life to perseus  he and quicksilver now walked onward at their ease talking very sociably together and quicksilver told so many pleasant stories about his former adventures and how well his wits had served him on various occasions that perseus began to think him a very wonderful person  he evidently knew the world and nobody is so charming to a young man as a friend who has that kind of knowledge  perseus listened the more eagerly in the hope of brightening his own wits by what he heard  at last he happened to recollect that quicksilver had spoken of a sister who was to lend her assistance in the adventure which they were now bound upon  where is she he inquired  shall we not meet her soon  all at the proper time said his companion  but this sister of mine you must understand is quite a different sort of character from myself she is very grave and prudent seldom smiles never laughs and makes it a rule not to utter a word unless she has something particularly profound to say  neither will she listen to any but the wisest conversation  dear me ejaculated perseus i shall be afraid to say a syllable  she is a very accomplished person i assure you continued quicksilver and has all the arts and sciences at her fingers ends in short she is so immoderately wise that many people call her wisdom personified  but to tell you the truth she has hardly vivacity enough for my taste and i think you would scarcely find her so pleasant a travelling companion as myself  she has her good points nevertheless and you will find the benefit of them in your encounter with the gorgons  by this time it had grown quite dusk  they were now come to a very wild and desert place overgrown with shaggy bushes and so silent and solitary that nobody seemed ever to have dwelt or journeyed there  all was waste and desolate in the gray twilight which grew every moment more obscure  perseus looked about him rather disconsolately and asked quicksilver whether they had a great deal farther to go  hist  hist whispered his companion  make no noise  this is just the time and place to meet the three gray women  be careful that they do not see you before you see them for though they have but a single eye among the three it is as sharpsighted as half a dozen common eyes  but what must i do asked perseus when we meet them  quicksilver explained to perseus how the three gray women managed with their one eye  they were in the habit it seems of changing it from one to another as if it had been a pair of spectacles orwhich would have suited them betterquizzingglass  when one of the three had kept the eye a certain time she took it out of the socket and passed it to one of her sisters whose turn it might happen to be and who immediately clapped it into her own head and enjoyed a peep at the visible world  thus it will easily be understood that only one of the three gray women could see while the other two were in utter darkness and moreover at the instant when the eye was passing from hand to hand neither of the poor old ladies was able to see a wink  i have heard of a great many strange things in my day and have witnessed not a few but none it seems to me that can compare with the oddity of these three gray women all peeping through a single eye  so thought perseus likewise and was so astonished that he almost fancied his companion was joking with him and that there were no such old women in the world  you will soon find whether i tell the truth or no observed quicksilver  hark hush hist hist  there they come now  perseus looked earnestly through the dusk of the evening and there sure enough at no great distance off he descried the three gray women the light being so faint he could not well make out what sort of figures they were only he discovered that they had long gray hair and as they came nearer he saw that two of them had but the empty socket of an eye in the middle of their foreheads  but in the middle of the third sisters forehead there was a very large bright and piercing eye which sparkled like a great diamond in a ring and so penetrating did it seem to be that perseus could not help thinking it must possess the gift of seeing in the darkest midnight just as perfectly as at noonday  the sight of three persons eyes was melted and collected into that single one  thus the three old dames got along about as comfortably upon the whole as if they could all see at once  she who chanced to have the eye in her forehead led the other two by the hands peeping sharply about her all the while insomuch that perseus dreaded lest she should see right through the thick clump of bushes behind which he and quicksilver had hidden themselves  my stars it was positively terrible to be within reach of so very sharp an eye  but before they reached the clump of bushes one of the three gray women spoke  sister  sister scarecrow cried she you have had the eye long enough  it is my turn now  let me keep it a moment longer sister nightmare answered scarecrow i thought i had a glimpse of something behind that thick bush  well and what of that retorted nightmare peevishly  cant i see into a thick bush as easily as yourself  the eye is mine as well as yours and i know the use of it as well as you or may be a little better  i insist upon taking a peep immediately  but here the third sister whose name was shakejoint began to complain and said that it was her turn to have the eye and that scarecrow and nightmare wanted to keep it all to themselves  to end the dispute old dame scarecrow took the eye out of her forehead and held it forth in her hand  take it one of you cried she and quit this foolish quarrelling for my part i shall be glad of a little thick darkness  take it quickly however or i must clap it into my own head again  accordingly both nightmare and shakejoint stretched out their hands groping eagerly to snatch the eye out of the hand of scarecrow  but being both alike blind they could not easily find where scarecrows hand was and scarecrow being now just as much in the dark as shakejoint and nightmare could not at once meet either of their hands in order to put the eye into it  thus as you will see with half an eye my wise little auditors these good old dames had fallen into a strange perplexity  for though the eye shone and glistened like a star as scarecrow held it out yet the gray women caught not the least glimpse of its light and were all three in utter darkness from too impatient a desire to see  quicksilver was so much tickled at beholding shakejoint and nightmare both groping for the eye and each finding fault with scarecrow and one another that he could scarcely help laughing aloud  now is your time he whispered to perseus  quick quick  before they can clap the eye into either of their heads rush out upon the old ladies and snatch it from scarecrows hand  in an instant while the three gray women were still scolding each other perseus leaped front behind the clump of bushes and made himself master of the prize  the marvellous eye as he held it in his hand shone very brightly and seemed to look up into his face with a knowing air and an expression as if it would have winked had it been provided with a pair of eyelids for that purpose  but the gray women knew nothing of what had happened and each supposing that one of her sisters was in possession of the eye they began their quarrel anew  at last as perseus did not wish to put these respectable dames to greater inconvenience than was really necessary he thought it right to explain the matter my good ladies said he pray do not be angry with one another  if anybody is in fault it is myself for i have the honor to hold your very brilliant and excellent eye in my own hand  you you have our eye  and who are you screamed the three gray women all in a breath for they were terribly frightened of course at hearing a strange voice and discovering that their eyesight had got into the hands of they could not guess whom  o what shall we do sisters what shall we do  we are all in the dark  give us our eye give us our one precious solitary eye  you have two of your own give us our eye  tell them whispered quicksilver to perseus that they shall have back the eye as soon as they direct you where to find the nymphs who have the flying slippers the magic wallet and the helmet of darkness  my dear good admirable old ladies said perseus addressing the gray women there is no occasion for putting yourselves into such a fright i am by no means a bad young man  you shall have back your eye safe and sound and as bright as ever the moment you tell me where to find the nymphs  the nymphs  goodness me sisters what nymphs does he mean screamed scarecrow  there are a great many nymphs people say some that go a hunting in the woods and some that live inside of trees and some that have a comfortable home in fountains of water  we know nothing at all about them  we are three unfortunate old souls that go wandering about in the dusk and never had but one eye amongst us and that one you have stolen away  o give it back good strangerwhoever you are give it back  all this while the three gray women were groping with their outstretched hands and trying their utmost to get hold of perseus  but he took good care to keep out of their reach  my respectable dames said hefor his mother had taught him always to use the greatest civilityi hold your eye fast in my hand and shall keep it safely for you until you please to tell me where to find these nymphs  the nymphs i mean who keep the enchanted wallet the flying slippers and the what is itthe helmet of invisibility  mercy on us sisters what is the young man talking about exclaimed scarecrow nightmare and shakejoint one to another with great appearance of astonishment  a pair of flying slippers quoth he  his heels would quickly fly higher than his head if he were silly enough to put them on  and a helmet of invisibility  how could a helmet make him invisible unless it were big enough for him to hide under it  and an enchanted wallet  what sort of a contrivance may that be i wonder no no good stranger we can tell you nothing of these marvellous things  you have two eyes of your own and we have but a single one amongst us three  you can find out such wonders better than three blind old creatures like us  perseus hearing them talk in this way began really to think that the gray women knew nothing of the matter and as it grieved him to have put them to so much trouble he was just on the point of restoring their eye and asking pardon for his rudeness in snatching it away  but quicksilver caught his hand  dont let them make a fool of you said he  these three gray women are the only persons in the world that can tell you where to find the nymphs and unless you get that information you will never succeed in cutting off the head of medusa with the snaky locks  keep fast hold of the eye and all will go well  as it turned out quicksilver was in the right  there are but few things that people prize so much as they do their eyesight and the gray women valued their single eye as highly as if it had been half a dozen which was the number they ought to have had  finding that there was no other way of recovering it they at last told perseus what he wanted to know  no sooner had they done so than he immediately and with the utmost respect clapped the eye into the vacant socket in one of their foreheads thanked them for their kindness and bade them farewell before the young man was out of hearing however they had got into a new dispute because he happened to have given the eye to scarecrow who had already taken her turn of it when their trouble with perseus commenced   it is greatly to be feared that the three gray women were very much in the habit of disturbing their mutual harmony by bickerings of this sort which was the more pity as they could not conveniently do without one another and were evidently intended to be inseparable companions  as a general rule i would advise all people whether sisters or brothers old or young who chance to have but one eye amongst them to cultivate forbearance and not all insist upon peeping through it at once  quicksilver and perseus in the mean time were making the best of their way in quest of the nymphs  the old dames had given them such particular directions that they were not long in finding them out they proved to be very different persons from nightmare shakejoint and scarecrow for instead of being old they were young and beautiful and instead of one eye amongst the sisterhood each nymph had two exceedingly bright eyes of her own with which she looked very kindly at perseus  they seemed to be acquainted with quicksilver and when he told them the adventure which perseus had undertaken they made no difficulty about giving him the valuable articles that were in their custody  in the first place they brought out what appeared to be a small purse made of deerskin and curiously embroidered and bade him be sure and keep it safe  this was the magic wallet  the nymphs next produced a pair of shoes or slippers or sandals with a nice little pair of wings at the heel of each  put them on perseus said quicksilver  you will find yourself as lightheeled as you can desire for the remainder of our journey  so perseus proceeded to put one of the slippers on while he laid the other on the ground by his side  unexpectedly however this other slipper spread its wings fluttered up off the ground and would probably have flown away if quicksilver had not made a leap and luckily caught it in the air  be more careful said he as he gave it back to perseus  it would frighten the birds up aloft if they should see a flying slipper amongst them  when perseus had got on both of these wonderful slippers he was altogether too buoyant to tread on earth  making a step or two lo and behold  upward he popt into the air high above the heads of quicksilver and the nymphs and found it very difficult to clamber down again  winged slippers and all such highflying contrivances are seldom quite easy to manage until one grows a little accustomed to them  quicksilver laughed at his companions involuntary activity and told him that he must not be in so desperate a hurry but must wait for the invisible helmet  the goodnatured nymphs had the helmet with its dark tuft of waving plumes all in readiness to put upon his head  and now there happened about as wonderful an incident as anything that i have yet told you the instant before the helmet was put on there stood perseus a beautiful young man with golden ringlets and rosy cheeks the crooked sword by his side and the brightly polished shield upon his arma figure that seemed all made up of courage sprightliness and glorious light  but when the helmet had descended over his white brow there was no longer any perseus to be seen  nothing but empty air  even the helmet that covered him with its invisibility had vanished  where are you perseus asked quicksilver  why here to be sure answered perseus very quietly although his voice seemed to come out of the transparent atmosphere  just where i was a moment ago  dont you see me  no indeed answered his friend  you are hidden under the helmet but if i cannot see you neither can the gorgons  follow me therefore and we will try your dexterity in using the winged slippers  with these words quicksilvers cap spread its wings as if his head were about to fly away from his shoulders but his whole figure rose lightly into the air and perseus followed  by the time they had ascended a few hundred feet the young man began to feel what a delightful thing it was to leave the dull earth so far beneath him and to be able to flit about like a bird  it was now deep night  perseus looked upward and saw the round bright silvery moon and thought that he should desire nothing better than to soar up thither and spend his life there  then he looked downward again and saw the earth with its seas and lakes and the silver courses of its rivers and its snowy mountainpeaks and the breadth of its fields and the dark cluster of its woods and its cities of white marble and with the moonshine sleeping over the whole scene it was as beautiful as the moon or any star could be  and among other objects he saw the island of seriplius where his dear mother was sometimes he and quicksilver approached a cloud that at a distance looked as if it were made of fleecy silver although when they plunged into it they found themselves chilled and moistened with gray mist  so swift was their flight however that in an instant they emerged from the cloud into the moonlight again  once a highsoaring eagle flew right against the invisible perseus  the bravest sights were the meteors that gleamed suddenly out as if a bonfire had been kindled in the sky and made the moonshine pale for as much as a hundred miles around them  as the two companions flew onward perseus fancied that he could hear the rustle of a garment close by his side and it was on the side opposite to the one where he beheld quicksilver yet only quicksilver was visible  whose garment is this inquired perseus that keeps rustling close beside me in the breeze  o it is my sisters  answered quicksilver  she is coming along with us as i told you she would  we could do nothing without the help of my sister  you have no idea how wise she is  she has such eyes too  why she can see you at this moment just as distinctly as if you were not invisible and ill venture to say she will be the first to discover the gorgons  by this time in their swift voyage through the air they had come within sight of the great ocean and were soon flying over it  far beneath them the waves tossed themselves tumultuously in midsea or rolled a white surfline upon the long beaches or foamed against the rocky cliffs with a roar that was thunderous in the lower world although it became a gentle murmur like the voice of a baby half asleep before it reached the ears of perseus  just then a voice spoke in the air close by him  it seemed to be a womans voice and was melodious though not exactly what might be called sweet but grave and mild  perseus said the voice there are the gorgons  where  exclaimed perseus  i cannot see them  on the shore of that island beneath you replied the voice  a pebble dropped from your hand would strike in the midst of them  i told you she would be the first to discover them said quicksilver to perseus  and there they are  straight downward two or three thousand feet below him perseus perceived a small island with the sea breaking into white foam all around its rocky shore except on one side where there was a beach of snowy sand  he descended towards it and looking earnestly at a cluster or heap of brightness at the foot of a precipice of black rocks behold there were the terrible gorgons  they lay fast asleep soothed by the thunder of the sea for it required a tumult that would have deafened everybody else to lull such fierce creatures into slumber the moonlight glistened on their steely scales and on their golden wings which drooped idly over the sand  their brazen claws horrible to look at were thrust out and clutched the wavebeaten fragments of rock while the sleeping gorgons dreamed of tearing some poor mortal all to pieces  the snakes that served them instead of hair seemed likewise to be asleep although now and then one would writhe and lift its head and thrust out its forked tongue emitting a drowsy hiss and then let itself subside among its sister snakes  the gorgons were more like an awful gigantic kind of insectimmense goldenwinged beetles or dragonflies or things of that sortat once ugly and beautifulthan like anything else only that they were a thousand and a million times as big  and with all this there was something partly human about them too  luckily for perseus their faces were completely hidden from him by the posture in which they lay for had he but looked one instant at them he would have fallen heavily out of the air an image of senseless stone  now whispered quicksilver as he hovered by the side of perseusnow is your time to do the deed  be quick for if one of the gorgons should awake you are too late  which shall i strike at asked perseus drawing his sword and descending a little lower  they all three look alike  all three have snaky locks  which of the three is medusa  it must be understood that medusa was the only one of these dragonmonsters whose head perseus could possibly cut off  as for the other two let him have the sharpest sword that ever was forged and he might have hacked away by the hour together without doing there the least harm  be cautious said the calm voice which had before spoken to him  one of the gorgons is stirring in her sleep and is just about to turn over that is medusa  do not look at her  the sight would turn you to stone look at the reflection of her face and figure in the bright mirror of your shield  perseus now understood quicksilvers motive for so earnestly exhorting him to polish his shield  in its surface he could safely look at the reflection of the gorgons face  and there it wasthat terrible countenancemirrored in the brightness of the shield with the moonlight falling over it and displaying all its horror  the snakes whose venomous natures could not altogether sleep kept twisting themselves over the forehead  it was the fiercest and most horrible face that ever was seen or imagined and yet with a strange fearful and savage kind of beauty in it  the eyes were closed and the gorgon was still in a deep slumber but there was an unquiet expression disturbing her features as if the monster was troubled with an ugly dream  she gnashed her white tusks and dug into the sand with her brazen claws  the snakes too seemed to feel medusas dream and to be made more restless by it  they twined themselves into tumultuous knots writhed fiercely and uplifted a hundred hissing heads without opening their eyes  now now whispered quicksilver who was growing impatient  make a dash at the monster  but be calm said the grave melodious voice at the young mans side look in your shield as you fly downward and take care that you do not miss your first stroke  perseus flew cautiously downward still keeping his eyes on medusas face as reflected in his shield  the nearer he came the more terrible did the snaky visage and metallic body of the monster grow  at last when he found himself hovering over her within arms length perseus uplifted his sword while at the same instant each separate snake upon the gorgons head stretched threateningly upward and medusa unclosed her eyes  but she awoke too late  the sword was sharp the stroke fell like a lightningflash and the head of the wicked medusa tumbled from her body  admirably done  cried quicksilver  make haste and clap the head into your magic wallet  to the astonishment of perseus the small embroidered wallet which he had hung about his neck and which had hitherto been no bigger than a purse grew all at once large enough to contain medusas head  as quick as thought he snatched it up with the snakes still writhing upon it and thrust it in  your task is done said the calm voice  now fly for the other gorgons will do their utmost to take vengeance for medusas death  it was indeed necessary to take flight for perseus had not done the deed so quietly but that the clash of his sword and the hissing of the snakes and the thump of medusas head as it tumbled upon the seabeaten sand awoke the other two monsters  there they sat for an instant sleepily rubbing their eyes with their brazen fingers while all the snakes on their heads reared themselves on end with surprise and with venomous malice against they knew not what  but when the gorgons saw the scaly carcass of medusa headless and her golden wings all ruffled and half spread out on the sand it was really awful to hear what yells and screeches they set up  and then the snakes  they sent forth a hundredfold hiss with one consent and medusas snakes answered them out of the magic wallet  no sooner were the gorgons broad awake than they hurtled upward into the air brandishing their brass talons gnashing their horrible tusks and flapping their huge wings so wildly that some of the golden feathers were shaken out and floated down upon the shore  and there perhaps those very feathers he scattered till this day  up rose the gorgons as i tell you staring horribly about in hopes of turning somebody to stone  had perseus looked them in the face or had he fallen into their clutches his poor mother would never have kissed her boy again  but he took good care to turn his eyes another way and as he wore the helmet of invisibility the gorgons knew not in what direction to follow him nor did he fail to make the best use of the winged slippers by soaring upward a perpendicular mile or so  at that height when the screams of those abominable creatures sounded faintly beneath him he made a straight course for the island of seriphus in order to carry medusas head to king polydectes  i have no time to tell you of several marvellous things that befell perseus on his way homeward such as his killing a hideous seamonster just as it was on the point of devouring a beautiful maiden nor how he changed an enormous giant into a mountain of stone merely by showing him the head of the gorgon  if you doubt this latter story you may make a voyage to africa some day or other and see the very mountain which is still known by the ancient giants name  finally our brave perseus arrived at the island where he expected to see his dear mother  but during his absence the wicked king had treated danae so very ill that she was compelled to make her escape and had taken refuge in a temple where some good old priests were extremely kind to her  these praiseworthy priests and the kindhearted fisherman who had first shown hospitality to danae and little perseus when he found them afloat in the chest seem to have been the only persons on the island who cared about doing right  all the rest of the people as well as king polydectes himself were remarkably illbehaved and deserved no better destiny than that which was now to happen  not finding his mother at home perseus went straight to the palace and was immediately ushered into the presence of the king  polydectes was by no means rejoiced to see him for he had felt almost certain in his own evil mind that the gorgons would have torn the poor young man to pieces and have eaten him up out of the way  however seeing him safely returned he put the best face he could upon the matter and asked perseus how he had succeeded  have you performed your promise inquired he  have you brought me the head of medusa with the snaky locks  if not young man it will cost you dear for i must have a bridal present for the beautiful princess hippodamia and there is nothing else that she would admire so much  yes please your majesty answered perseus in a quiet way as if it were no very wonderful deed for such a young man as he to perform  i have brought you the gorgons head snaky locks and all  indeed  pray let me see it quoth king polydectes  it must be a very curious spectacle if all that travellers tell about it be true  your majesty is in the right replied perseus  it is really an object that will be pretty certain to fix the regards of all who look at it  and if your majesty think fit i would suggest that a holiday be proclaimed and that all your majestys subjects be summoned to behold this wonderful curiosity  few of them i imagine have seen a gorgons head before and perhaps never may again  the king well knew that his subjects were an idle set of reprobates and very fond of sightseeing as idle persons usually are  so he took the young mans advice and sent out heralds and messengers in all directions to blow the trumpet at the streetcorners and in the marketplaces and wherever two roads met and summon everybody to court  thither accordingly came a great multitude of goodfornothing vagabonds all of whom out of pure love of mischief would have been glad if perseus had met with some illhap in his encounter with the gorgons  if there were any better people in the island as i really hope there may have been although the story tells nothing about any such they stayed quietly at home minding their own business and taking care of their little children  most of the inhabitants at all events ran as fast as they could to the palace and shoved and pushed and elbowed one another in their eagerness to get near a balcony on which perseus showed himself holding the embroidered wallet in his hand  on a platform within full view of the balcony sat the mighty king polydectes amid his evil counsellors and with his flattering courtiers in a semicircle round about him  monarch counsellors courtiers and subjects all gazed eagerly towards perseus  show us the head  show us the head shouted the people and there was a fierceness in their cry as if they would tear perseus to pieces unless he should satisfy them with what he had to show  show us the head of medusa with the snaky locks  a feeling of sorrow and pity came over the youthful perseus  o king polydectes cried he and ye many people i am very loath to show you the gorgons head  ah the villain and coward yelled the people more fiercely than before  he is making game of us  he has no gorgons head  show us the head if you have it or we will take your own head for a football  the evil counsellors whispered bad advice in the kings ear the courtiers murmured with one consent that perseus had shown disrespect to their royal lord and master and the great king polydectes himself waved his hand and ordered him with the stern deep voice of authority on his peril to produce the bead  show me the gorgons head or i will cut off your own  and perseus sighed  this instant repeated polydectes or you die  behold it then cried perseus in a voice like the blast of a trumpet  and suddenly holding up the head not an eyelid had time to wink before the wicked king polydectes his evil counsellors and all his fierce subjects were no longer anything but the mere images of a monarch and his people  they were all fixed forever in the look and attitude of that moment  at the first glimpse of the terrible head of medusa they whitened into marble  and perseus thrust the head back into his wallet and went to tell his dear mother that she need no longer be afraid of the wicked king polydectes    tanglewood porch  after the story  is not that a very fine story asked eustace  o yes yes cried cowslip clapping her hands  and those funny old women with only one eye amongst them  i never heard of anything so strange  as to their one tooth which they shifted about observed primrose there was nothing so very wonderful in that  i suppose it was a false tooth  but think of your turning mercury into quicksilver and talking about his sister  you are too ridiculous  and was she not his sister asked eustace bright  if i had thought of it sooner i would have described her as a maiden lady who kept a pet owl  well at any rate said primrose your story seems to have driven away the mist  and indeed while the tale was going forward the vapors had been quite exhaled from the landscape  a scene was now disclosed which the spectators might almost fancy as having been created since they had last looked in the direction where it lay  about half a mile distant in the lap of the valley now appeared a beautiful lake which reflected a perfect image of its own wooded banks and of the summits of the more distant hills  it gleamed in glassy tranquillity without the trace of a winged breeze on any part of its bosom  beyond its farther shore was monument mountain in a recumbent position stretching almost across the valley  eustace bright compared it to a huge headless sphinx wrapped in a persian shawl and indeed so rich and diversified was the autumnal foliage of its woods that the simile of the shawl was by no means too highcolored for the reality  in the lower ground between tanglewood and the lake the clumps of trees and borders of woodland were chiefly goldenleaved or dusky brown as having suffered more from frost than the foliage on the hillsides  over all this scene there was a genial sunshine intermingled with a slight haze which made it unspeakably soft and tender  o what a day of indian summer was it going to be  the children snatched their baskets and set forth with hop skip and jump and all sorts of frisks and gambols while cousin eustace proved his fitness to preside over the party by outdoing all their antics and performing several new capers which none of them could ever hope to imitate  behind went a good old dog whose name was ben  he was one of the most respectable and kindhearted of quadrupeds and probably felt it to be his duty not to trust the children away from their parents without some better guardian than this featherbrained eustace bright
