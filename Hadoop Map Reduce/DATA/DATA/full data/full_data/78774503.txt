you must tell me what i did  sits down at table l  lady windermere  well you kept paying me elaborate compliments the whole evening  lord darlington  smiling  ah nowadays we are all of us so hard up that the only pleasant things to pay are compliments  theyre the only things we can pay  lady windermere  shaking her head  no i am talking very seriously  you mustnt laugh i am quite serious  i dont like compliments and i dont see why a man should think he is pleasing a woman enormously when he says to her a whole heap of things that he doesnt mean  lord darlington  ah but i did mean them  takes tea which she offers him  lady windermere  gravely  i hope not  i should be sorry to have to quarrel with you lord darlington  i like you very much you know that  but i shouldnt like you at all if i thought you were what most other men are  believe me you are better than most other men and i sometimes think you pretend to be worse  lord darlington  we all have our little vanities lady windermere  lady windermere  why do you make that your special one  still seated at table l  lord darlington  still seated lc  oh nowadays so many conceited people go about society pretending to be good that i think it shows rather a sweet and modest disposition to pretend to be bad  besides there is this to be said  if you pretend to be good the world takes you very seriously  if you pretend to be bad it doesnt  such is the astounding stupidity of optimism  lady windermere  dont you want the world to take you seriously then lord darlington  lord darlington  no not the world  who are the people the world takes seriously  all the dull people one can think of from the bishops down to the bores  i should like you to take me very seriously lady windermere you more than any one else in life  lady windermere  whywhy me  lord darlington  after a slight hesitation  because i think we might be great friends  let us be great friends  you may want a friend some day  lady windermere  why do you say that  lord darlington  ohwe all want friends at times  lady windermere  i think were very good friends already lord darlington  we can always remain so as long as you dont   lord darlington  dont what  lady windermere  dont spoil it by saying extravagant silly things to me  you think i am a puritan i suppose  well i have something of the puritan in me  i was brought up like that  i am glad of it  my mother died when i was a mere child  i lived always with lady julia my fathers elder sister you know  she was stern to me but she taught me what the world is forgetting the difference that there is between what is right and what is wrong  she allowed of no compromise  i allow of none  lord darlington  my dear lady windermere  lady windermere  leaning back on the sofa  you look on me as being behind the agewell i am  i should be sorry to be on the same level as an age like this  lord darlington  you think the age very bad  lady windermere  yes  nowadays people seem to look on life as a speculation  it is not a speculation  it is a sacrament  its ideal is love  its purification is sacrifice  lord darlington  smiling  oh anything is better than being sacrificed  lady windermere  leaning forward  dont say that  lord darlington  i do say it  i feel iti know it  enter parker c  parker  the men want to know if they are to put the carpets on the terrace for tonight my lady  lady

darlington  still seated  do you think thenof course i am only putting an imaginary instancedo you think that in the case of a young married couple say about two years married if the husband suddenly becomes the intimate friend of a woman ofwell more than doubtful characteris always calling upon her lunching with her and probably paying her billsdo you think that the wife should not console herself  lady windermere  frowning  console herself  lord darlington  yes i think she shouldi think she has the right  lady windermere  because the husband is vileshould the wife be vile also  lord darlington  vileness is a terrible word lady windermere  lady windermere  it is a terrible thing lord darlington  lord darlington  do you know i am afraid that good people do a great deal of harm in this world  certainly the greatest harm they do is that they make badness of such extraordinary importance  it is absurd to divide people into good and bad  people are either charming or tedious  i take the side of the charming and you lady windermere cant help belonging to them  lady windermere  now lord darlington  rising and crossing r front of him  dont stir i am merely going to finish my flowers goes to table rc  lord darlington  rising and moving chair  and i must say i think you are very hard on modern life lady windermere  of course there is much against it i admit  most women for instance nowadays are rather mercenary  lady windermere  dont talk about such people  lord darlington  well then setting aside mercenary people who of course are dreadful do you think seriously that women who have committed what the world calls a fault should never be forgiven  lady windermere  standing at table  i think they should never be forgiven  lord darlington  and men  do you think that there should be the same laws for men as there are for women  lady windermere  certainly  lord darlington  i think life too complex a thing to be settled by these hard and fast rules  lady windermere  if we had these hard and fast rules we should find life much more simple  lord darlington  you allow of no exceptions  lady windermere  none  lord darlington  ah what a fascinating puritan you are lady windermere  lady windermere  the adjective was unnecessary lord darlington  lord darlington  i couldnt help it  i can resist everything except temptation  lady windermere  you have the modern affectation of weakness  lord darlington  looking at her  its only an affectation lady windermere  enter parker c  parker  the duchess of berwick and lady agatha carlisle  enter the duchess of berwick

darlington  i wont let you know my daughter you are far too wicked  lord darlington  dont say that duchess  as a wicked man i am a complete failure  why there are lots of people who say i have never really done anything wrong in the whole course of my life of course they only say it behind my back  duchess of berwick  isnt he dreadful  agatha this is lord darlington  mind you dont believe a word

honour of my birthday  a small and early  lord darlington  standing lc  very small very early and very select duchess  duchess of berwick  on sofa l  of course its going to be select  but we know that dear margaret about your house  it is really one of the few houses in london where i can take agatha and where i feel perfectly secure about dear berwick  i dont know what society is coming to  the most dreadful people seem to go everywhere  they certainly come to my partiesthe men get quite furious if one doesnt ask them  really some one should make a stand against it  lady windermere  i will duchess  i will have no one in my house about whom there is any scandal  lord darlington  rc  oh dont say that lady windermere  i should never be admitted  sitting  duchess of berwick  oh men dont matter  with women it is different  were good  some of us are at least  but we are positively getting elbowed into the corner  our husbands would really forget our existence if we didnt nag at them from time to time just to remind them that we have a perfect legal right to do so  lord darlington  its a curious thing duchess about the game of marriagea game by the way that is going out of fashionthe wives hold all the honours and invariably lose the odd trick  duchess of berwick   the odd trick  is that the husband lord darlington  lord darlington  it would be rather a good name for the modern husband  duchess of berwick  dear lord darlington how thoroughly depraved you are  lady windermere  lord darlington is trivial  lord darlington  ah dont say that lady windermere  lady windermere  why do you talk so trivially about life then  lord darlington  because i think that life is far too important a thing ever to talk seriously about it  moves up c  duchess of berwick  what does he mean  do as a concession to my poor wits lord darlington just explain to me what you really mean  lord darlington  coming down back of table  i think i had better not duchess  nowadays to be intelligible is to be found out  goodbye  shakes hands with duchess  and nowgoes up stage lady windermere goodbye  i may come tonight maynt i do let me come  lady windermere  standing up stage with lord darlington  yes certainly  but you are not to say foolish insincere things to people  lord darlington  smiling  ah you are beginning to reform me it is a dangerous thing to reform any one lady windermere  bows and exit c  duchess of berwick  who has risen goes c  what a charming wicked creature  i like him so much  im quite delighted hes gone  how sweet youre looking  where do you get your

look over the photograph album that i see there  lady agatha  yes mamma  goes to table up l  duchess of berwick  dear girl  she is so fond of photographs of switzerland  such a pure taste i think  but i really am so sorry for you margaret  lady windermere  smiling  why duchess  duchess of berwick  oh on account of that horrid woman  she dresses so well too which makes it much worse sets such a dreadful example  augustusyou know my disreputable brothersuch a trial to us allwell augustus is completely infatuated about her  it is quite scandalous for she is absolutely inadmissible into society  many a woman has a past but i am told that she has at least a dozen and that they all fit  lady windermere  whom are you talking about duchess  duchess of berwick  about mrs erlynne  lady windermere  mrs erlynne  i never heard of her duchess and what has she to do with me  duchess of berwick  my poor child  agatha darling  lady agatha  yes mamma  duchess of berwick  will you go out on the terrace and look at the sunset  lady agatha  yes mamma  exit through window l  duchess of berwick  sweet girl  so devoted to sunsets  shows such refinement of feeling does it not  after all there is nothing like nature is there  lady windermere  but what is it duchess  why do you talk to me about this person  duchess of berwick  dont you really know  i assure you were all so distressed about it  only last night at dear lady jansens every one was saying how extraordinary it was that of all men in london windermere should behave in such a way  lady windermere  my husbandwhat has he got to do with any woman of that kind  duchess of berwick  ah what indeed dear  that is the point  he goes to see her continually and stops for hours at a time and while he is there she is not at home to any one  not that many ladies call on her dear but she has a great many disreputable men friendsmy own brother particularly as i told youand that is what makes it so dreadful about windermere  we looked upon him as being such a model husband but i am afraid there is no doubt about it  my dear niecesyou know the saville girls dont yousuch nice domestic creaturesplain dreadfully plain but so good well theyre always at the window doing fancy work and making ugly things for the poor which i think so useful of them in these dreadful socialistic days and this terrible woman has taken a house in curzon street right opposite themsuch a respectable street too  i dont know what were coming to  and they tell me that windermere goes there four and five times a weekthey see him  they cant help itand although they never talk scandal theywell of coursethey remark on it to every one  and the worst of it all is that i have been told that this woman has got a great deal of money out of somebody for it seems that she came to london six months ago without anything at all to speak of and now she has this charming house in mayfair drives her ponies in the park every afternoon and allwell allsince she has known poor dear windermere  lady windermere  oh i cant believe it  duchess of berwick  but its quite true my dear  the whole of london knows it  that is why i felt it was better to come and talk to you and advise you to take windermere away at once to homburg or to aix where hell have something to amuse him and where you can watch him all day long  i assure you my dear that on several occasions after i was first married i had to pretend to be very ill and was obliged to drink the most unpleasant mineral waters merely to get berwick out of town  he was so extremely susceptible  though i am bound to say he never gave away any large sums of money to anybody  he is far too highprincipled for that  lady windermere  interrupting  duchess duchess its impossible  rising and crossing stage to c  we are only married two years  our child is but six months old  sits in chair r of l table  duchess of berwick  ah the dear pretty baby  how is the little darling  is it a boy or a girl  i hope a girlah no i remember its a boy  im so sorry  boys are so wicked  my boy is excessively immoral  you wouldnt believe at what hours he comes home  and hes only left oxford a few monthsi really dont know what they teach them there  lady windermere  are all men bad  duchess of berwick  oh all of them my dear all of them without any exception  and they never grow any better  men become old but they never become good  lady windermere  windermere and i married for love  duchess of berwick  yes we begin like that  it was only berwicks brutal and incessant threats of suicide that made me accept him at all and before the year was out he was running after all kinds of petticoats every colour every shape every material  in fact before the honeymoon was over i caught him winking at my maid a most pretty respectable girl  i dismissed her at once without a characterno i remember i passed her on to my sister poor dear sir george is so shortsighted i thought it wouldnt matter  but it did thoughit was most unfortunate rises  and now my dear child i must go as we are dining out and mind you dont take this little aberration of windermeres too much to heart  just take him abroad and hell come back to you all right  lady windermere  come back to me  c  duchess of berwick   lc  yes dear these wicked women get our husbands away from us but they always come back slightly damaged of course  and dont make scenes men hate them  lady windermere  it is very kind of you duchess to come and tell me all this  but i cant believe that my husband is untrue to me  duchess of berwick  pretty child  i was like that once  now i know that all men are monsters  lady windermere rings bell  the only thing to do is to feed the wretches well  a good cook does wonders and that i know you have  my dear margaret you are not going to cry  lady windermere  you neednt be afraid duchess i never cry  duchess of berwick  thats quite right dear  crying is the refuge of plain women but the ruin of pretty ones  agatha darling  lady agatha  entering l  yes mamma  stands back of table lc  duchess of berwick  come and bid goodbye to lady windermere and thank her for your charming visit  coming down again  and by the way i must thank you for sending a card to mr hopperhes that rich young australian people are taking such notice of just at present  his father made a great fortune by selling some kind of food in circular tinsmost palatable i believei fancy it is the thing the servants always refuse to eat  but the son is quite interesting  i think hes attracted by dear agathas clever talk of course we should be very sorry to lose her but i think that a mother who doesnt part with a daughter every season has no real affection  were coming tonight dear  parker opens c doors and remember my advice take the poor fellow out of town at once it is the only thing to do  goodbye once more come agatha  exeunt duchess and lady agatha c  lady windermere  how horrible  i understand now what lord

one who pitied me was kind enough to tell me what every one in london knows already your daily visits to curzon street your mad infatuation the monstrous sums of money you squander on this infamous woman crossing l  lord windermere  margaret dont talk like that of mrs erlynne you dont know how unjust it is  lady windermere  turning to him  you are very jealous of mrs erlynnes honour  i wish you

that is all  oh dont imagine i mind about the money  as far as i am concerned you may squander everything we have  but what i do mind is that you who have loved me you who have taught me to love you

more than a girl then  she had been a wife for even less time than you have  lady windermere  i am not interested in herandyou should not mention this woman and me in the same breath  it is an error

anything at all  hallo tuppy  hear youre going to be married again thought you were tired of that game  lord augustus  youre excessively trivial my dear boy excessively trivial  cecil graham  by the way tuppy which is it  have you been twice married and once divorced or twice divorced and once married  i say youve been twice divorced and once married  it seems so much more probable  lord augustus  i have a very bad memory  i really dont remember which  moves away r  lady plymdale  lord windermere ive something most particular to ask you  lord windermere  i am afraidif you will excuse mei must join my wife  lady plymdale  oh you mustnt dream of such a thing  its most dangerous nowadays for a husband to pay any attention to his wife in public  it always makes people think that he beats her

 how do you do again lord windermere  how charming your sweet wife looks  quite a picture  lord windermere  in a low voice  it was terribly rash of you to come  mrs erlynne  smiling  the wisest thing i ever did in my life and by the way you must pay me a good deal of attention this evening  i am afraid of the women  you must introduce me to some of them  the men i can always manage  how do you do

embarrassment oh certainly if you wish it  aunt caroline allow me to introduce mrs erlynne  mrs erlynne  so pleased to meet you lady jedburgh  sits beside her on the sofa  your nephew and i are great friends  i am so much interested in his political career  i think hes sure to be a wonderful success  he thinks like a tory and talks like a radical and thats so important nowadays  hes such a brilliant talker too  but we all know from whom he inherits that  lord allandale was saying to me only yesterday in the park that mr graham talks almost as well as his aunt  lady jedburgh  r  most kind of you to say these charming things to me  mrs  erlynne smiles and continues conversation  dumby  to cecil graham  did you introduce mrs erlynne to lady jedburgh  cecil graham  had to my dear

on thursday  with great pleasure  rises and speaks to lord windermere laughing  what a bore it is to have to be civil to these old dowagers  but they always insist on it  lady plymdale  to mr dumby  who is that welldressed woman talking to windermere  dumby  havent got the slightest idea  looks like an edition de luxe of a wicked french novel meant specially for the english market  mrs erlynne  so that is poor dumby with lady plymdale  i hear she is frightfully jealous of him  he doesnt seem anxious to speak to me tonight  i suppose he is afraid of her  those straw coloured women have dreadful tempers  do you know i think ill dance with you first windermere  lord windermere bits his lip and frowns  it will make lord augustus so jealous  lord augustus  lord augustus comes down  lord windermere insists on my dancing with him first and as its his own house i cant well refuse  you know i would much sooner dance with you  lord augustus  with a low bow  i wish i could think so mrs erlynne  mrs erlynne  you know it far too well  i can fancy a person dancing through life with you and finding it charming  lord augustus  placing his hand on his white waistcoat  oh thank you thank you  you are the most adorable of all ladies  mrs erlynne  what a nice speech  so simple and so sincere  just the sort of speech i like  well you shall hold my bouquet  goes towards ballroom on lord windermeres arm  ah mr dumby how are you  i am so sorry i have been out the last three times you have called  come and lunch on friday  dumby  with perfect nonchalance  delighted  lady plymdale glares with indignation at mr dumby  lord augustus follows mrs erlynne and lord windermere into the ballroom holding bouquet  lady plymdale  to mr dumby  what an absolute brute you are  i never can believe a word you say  why did you tell me you didnt know her  what do you mean by calling on her three times running you are not to go to lunch there of course you understand that  dumby  my dear laura i wouldnt dream of going  lady plymdale  you havent told me her name yet  who is she  dumby  coughs slightly and smooths his hair  shes a mrs erlynne  lady plymdale  that woman  dumby  yes that is what every one calls her  lady plymdale  how very interesting  how intensely interesting i really must have a good stare at her  goes to door of ballroom and looks in  i have heard the most shocking things about her they say she is ruining poor windermere  and lady windermere who goes in for being so proper invites her  how extremely amusing it takes a thoroughly good woman to do a thoroughly stupid thing you are to lunch there on friday  dumby  why  lady plymdale  because i want you to take my husband with you  he has been so attentive lately that he has become a perfect nuisance  now this woman is just the thing for him  hell dance attendance upon her as long as she lets him and wont bother me i assure you women of that kind are most useful  they form the basis of other peoples marriages  dumby  what a mystery you are  lady plymdale  looking at him  i wish you were  dumby  i amto myself  i am the only person in the world i should like to know thoroughly but i dont see any chance of it just at present  they pass into the ballroom and lady windermere and lord darlington enter from the terrace  lady windermere  yes  her coming here is monstrous unbearable i know now what you meant today at teatime  why didnt you tell me right out  you should have  lord darlington  i couldnt  a man cant tell these things about another man  but if i had known he was going to make you ask her here tonight i think i would have told you  that insult at any rate you would have been spared  lady windermere  i did not ask her  he insisted on her coming against my entreatiesagainst my commands  oh the house is tainted for me  i feel that every woman here sneers at me as she dances by with my husband  what have i done to deserve this  i gave him all my life  he took itused itspoiled it  i am degraded in my own eyes and i lack couragei am a coward  sits down on sofa  lord darlington  if i know you at all i know that you cant live with a man who treats you like this  what sort of life would you have with him  you would feel that he was lying to you every moment of the day  you would feel that the look in his eyes was false his voice false his touch false his passion false  he would come to you when he was weary of others you would have to comfort him  he would come to you when he was devoted to others you would have to charm him  you would have to be to him the mask of his real life the cloak to hide his secret  lady windermere  you are rightyou are terribly right  but where am i to turn  you said you would be my friend lord darlington tell me what am i to do  be my friend now  lord darlington  between men and women there is no friendship possible  there is passion enmity worship love but no friendship  i love you   lady windermere  no no  rises  lord darlington  yes i love you  you are more to me than anything in the whole world  what does your husband give you nothing  whatever is in him he gives to this wretched woman whom he has thrust into your society into your home to shame you before every one  i offer you my life   lady windermere  lord darlington  lord darlington  my lifemy whole life  take it and do with it what you will    i love youlove you as i have never loved any living thing  from the moment i met you i loved you loved you blindly adoringly madly  you did not know it thenyou know it now  leave this house tonight  i wont tell you that the world matters nothing or the worlds voice or the voice of society they matter a great deal  they matter far too much  but there are moments when one has to choose between living ones own life fully entirely completelyor dragging out some false shallow degrading existence that the world in its hypocrisy demands  you have that moment now  choose  oh my love choose  lady windermere  moving slowly away from him and looking at him with startled eyes  i have not the courage  lord darlington  following her  yes you have the courage there may be six months of pain of disgrace even but when you no longer bear his name when you bear mine all will be well margaret my love my wife that shall be some dayyes my wife you know it  what are you now  this woman has the place that belongs by right to you  oh gogo out of this house with head erect with a smile upon your lips with courage in your eyes  all london will know why you did it and who will blame you  no one if they do what matter  wrong  what is wrong  its wrong for a man to abandon his wife for a shameless woman  it is wrong for a wife to remain with a man who so dishonours her  you said once you would make no compromise with things  make none now  be brave be yourself  lady windermere  i am afraid of being myself  let me think  let me wait  my husband may return to me  sits down on sofa  lord darlington  and you would take him back  you are not what i thought you were  you are just the same as every other woman  you would stand anything rather than face the censure of a world whose praise you would despise  in a week you will be driving with this woman in the park  she will be your constant guestyour dearest friend  you would endure anything rather than break with one blow this monstrous tie  you are right  you have no courage none  lady windermere  ah give me time to think  i cannot answer you now  passes her hand nervously over her brow  lord darlington  it must be now or not at all  lady windermere  rising from the sofa  then

pounds a year left to me by a third cousinor a second husbandor some distant relative of that kind  it would be an additional attraction wouldnt it  you have a delightful opportunity now of paying me a compliment windermere but you are not very clever at paying compliments  i am afraid margaret doesnt encourage you in that excellent habit  its a great mistake on her part  when men give up saying what is charming they give up thinking what is charming  but seriously what do you say to 2000 pounds  2500 pounds i think  in modern life margin is everything  windermere dont you think the world an intensely amusing place  i do  exit on terrace with lord windermere  music strikes up in ball room  lady windermere  to stay in this house any longer is impossible tonight a man who loves me offered

offence towards you  and ii tell you that had it ever occurred to me that such a monstrous suspicion would have entered your mind i would have died rather than have crossed your life or hisoh died gladly died  moves away to sofa r  lady windermere  you talk as if you had a heart  women like you have no hearts  heart is not in you  you are bought and sold sits lc  mrs erlynne  starts with a gesture of pain  then restrains herself and comes over to where lady windermere is sitting  as she speaks she stretches out her hands towards her but does not dare to touch her  believe what you choose about me  i am not worth a moments sorrow  but dont spoil your beautiful young life on my account  you dont know what may be in store for you unless you leave this house at once  you dont know what it is to fall into the pit to be despised mocked abandoned sneered atto be an outcast to find the door shut against one to have to creep in by hideous byways afraid every moment lest the mask should be stripped from ones face and all the while to hear the laughter the horrible laughter of the world a thing more tragic than all the tears the world has ever shed  you dont know what it is  one pays for ones sin and then one pays again and all ones life one pays  you must never know thatas for me if suffering be an expiation then at this moment i have expiated all my faults whatever they have been for tonight you have made a heart in one who had it not made it and broken itbut let that pass  i may have wrecked my own life but i will not let you wreck yours  you why you are a mere girl you would be lost  you havent got the kind of brains that enables a woman to get back  you have neither the wit nor the courage  you couldnt stand dishonour  no  go back lady windermere to the husband who loves you whom you love you have a child lady windermere  go back to that child who even now in pain or in joy may be calling to you  lady windermere rises  god gave you that child  he will require from you that you make his life fine that you watch over him  what answer will you make to god if his life is ruined through you  back to your house lady windermereyour husband loves you  he has never swerved for a moment from the love he bears you  but even if he had a thousand loves you must stay with your child  if he was harsh to you you must stay with your child  if he illtreated you you must stay with your child  if he abandoned you your place is with your child  lady windermere bursts into tears and buries her face in her hands  rushing to her  lady windermere  lady windermere  holding out her hands to her helplessly as a child might do  take me home  take me home  mrs erlynne  is about to embrace her  then restrains herself there is a look of wonderful joy in her face  come  where is your cloak  getting it from sofa  here  put it on  come at once  they go to the door  lady windermere  stop  dont you hear voices  mrs erlynne  no no  there was no one  lady windermere  yes there is  listen  oh that is my husbands voice  he is coming in  save me  oh its some plot  you have sent for him  voices outside  mrs erlynne  silence  im here to save you if i can  but i fear it is too late  there points to the curtain across the window  the first chance you have slip out if you ever get a chance  lady windermere  but you  mrs erlynne  oh never mind me  ill face them  lady windermere hides herself behind the curtain  lord augustus  outside  nonsense dear windermere you must not leave me  mrs erlynne  lord augustus  then it is i who am lost hesitates for a moment then looks round and sees door r and exits through it   enter lord darlington mr dumby lord windermere lord augustus lorton and mr cecil graham  dumby  what a nuisance their turning us out of the club at this hour  its only two oclock  sinks into a chair  the lively part of the evening is only just beginning  yawns and closes his eyes  lord windermere  it is very good of you lord darlington allowing augustus to force our company on you but im afraid i cant stay long  lord darlington  really  i am so sorry  youll take a cigar wont you  lord windermere  thanks  sits down  lord augustus  to lord windermere  my dear boy you must not dream of going  i have a great deal to talk to you about of demmed importance too  sits down with him at l table  cecil graham  oh  we all know what that is  tuppy cant talk about anything but mrs erlynne  lord windermere  well that is no business of yours is it cecil  cecil graham  none  that is why it interests me  my own business always bores me to death  i prefer other peoples  lord darlington  have something to drink you fellows  cecil youll have a whisky and soda  cecil graham  thanks  goes to table with lord darlington  mrs erlynne looked very handsome tonight didnt she  lord darlington  i am not one of her admirers  cecil graham  i usent to be but i am now  why she actually made me introduce her to poor dear aunt caroline  i believe she is going to lunch there  lord darlington  in purple  no  cecil graham  she is really  lord darlington  excuse me you fellows  im going away to morrow  and i have to write a few letters  goes to writing table and sits down  dumby  clever woman mrs erlynne  cecil graham  hallo dumby  i thought you were asleep  dumby  i am i usually am  lord augustus  a very clever woman  knows perfectly well what a demmed fool i amknows it as well as i do myself  cecil graham comes towards him laughing  ah you may laugh my boy but it is a great thing to come across a woman who thoroughly understands one  dumby  it is an awfully dangerous thing  they always end by marrying one  cecil graham  but i thought tuppy you were never going to see her again  yes you told me so yesterday evening at the club  you said youd heard   whispering to him  lord augustus  oh shes explained that  cecil graham  and the wiesbaden affair  lord augustus  shes explained that too  dumby  and her income tuppy  has she explained that  lord augustus  in a very serious voice  shes going to explain that tomorrow  cecil graham goes back to c table  dumby  awfully commercial women nowadays  our grandmothers threw their caps over the mills of course but by jove their granddaughters only throw their caps over mills that can raise the wind for them  lord augustus  you want to make her out a wicked woman  she is not  cecil graham  oh  wicked women bother one  good women bore one that is the only difference between them  lord augustus  puffing a cigar  mrs erlynne has a future before her  dumby  mrs erlynne has a past before her  lord augustus  i prefer women with a past  theyre always so demmed amusing to talk to  cecil graham  well youll have lots of topics of conversation with her tuppy  rising and going to him  lord augustus  youre getting annoying dearboy youre getting demmed annoying  cecil graham  puts his hands on his shoulders  now tuppy youve lost your figure and youve lost your character  dont lose your temper you have only got one  lord augustus  my dear boy if i wasnt the most goodnatured man in london   cecil graham  wed treat you with more respect wouldnt we tuppy  strolls away  dumby  the youth of the present day are quite monstrous  they have absolutely no respect for dyed hair  lord augustus looks round angrily  cecil graham  mrs erlynne has a very great respect for dear tuppy  dumby  then mrs erlynne sets an admirable example to the rest of her sex  it is perfectly brutal the way most women nowadays behave to men who are not their husbands  lord windermere  dumby you are ridiculous and cecil you let your tongue run away with you  you must leave mrs erlynne alone you dont really know anything about her and youre always talking scandal against her  cecil graham  coming towards him lc  my dear arthur i never talk scandal  i only talk gossip  lord windermere  what is the difference between scandal and gossip  cecil graham  oh gossip is charming  history is merely gossip but scandal is gossip made tedious by morality  now i never moralise  a man who moralises is usually a hypocrite and a woman who moralises is invariably plain  there is nothing in the whole world so unbecoming to a woman as a nonconformist conscience  and most women know it im glad to say  lord augustus  just my sentiments dear boy just my sentiments  cecil graham  sorry to hear it tuppy whenever people agree with me i always feel i must be wrong  lord augustus  my dear boy when i was your age   cecil graham  but you never were tuppy and you never will be goes up c  i say darlington let us have some cards  youll play arthur wont you  lord windermere  no thanks cecil  dumby  with a sigh  good heavens how marriage ruins a man its as demoralising as cigarettes and far more expensive  cecil graham  youll play of course tuppy  lord augustus  pouring himself out a brandy and soda at table cant dear boy  promised mrs erlynne never to play or drink again  cecil graham  now my dear tuppy dont be led astray into the paths of virtue  reformed you would be perfectly tedious  that is the worst of women  they always want one to be good  and if we are good when they meet us they dont love us at all  they like to find us quite irretrievably bad and to leave us quite unattractively good  lord darlington  rising from r table where he has been writing letters  they always do find us bad  dumby  i dont think we are bad  i think we are all good except tuppy  lord darlington  no we are all in the gutter but some of us are looking at the stars  sits down at c table  dumby  we are all in the gutter but some of us are looking at the stars  upon my word you are very romantic tonight darlington  cecil graham  too romantic  you must be in love  who is the girl  lord darlington  the woman i love is not free or thinks she isnt  glances instinctively at lord windermere while he speaks  cecil graham  a married woman then  well theres nothing in the world like the devotion of a married woman  its a thing no married man knows anything about  lord darlington  oh she doesnt love me  she is a good woman she is the only good woman i have ever met in my life  cecil graham  the only good woman you have ever met in your life  lord darlington  yes  cecil graham  lighting a cigarette  well you are a lucky fellow  why i have met hundreds of good women  i never seem to meet any but good women  the world is perfectly packed with good women  to know them is a middleclass education  lord darlington  this woman has purity and innocence  she has everything we men have lost  cecil graham  my dear fellow what on earth should we men do going about with purity and innocence  a carefully thoughtout buttonhole is much more effective  dumby  she doesnt really love you then  lord darlington  no she does not  dumby  i congratulate you my dear fellow  in this world there are only two tragedies  one is not getting what one wants and the other is getting it  the last is much the worst the last is a real tragedy  but i am interested to hear she does not love you how long could you love a woman who didnt love you cecil  cecil graham  a woman who didnt love me  oh all my life  dumby  so could i  but its so difficult to meet one  lord darlington  how can you be so conceited dumby  dumby  i didnt say it as a matter of conceit  i said it as a matter of regret  i have been wildly madly adored  i am sorry i have  it has been an immense nuisance  i should like to be allowed a little time to myself now and then  lord augustus  looking round  time to educate yourself i suppose  dumby  no time to forget all i have learned  that is much more important dear tuppy  lord augustus moves uneasily in his chair  lord darlington  what cynics you fellows are  cecil graham  what is a cynic  sitting on the back of the sofa  lord darlington  a man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing  cecil graham  and a sentimentalist my dear darlington is a man who sees an absurd value in everything and doesnt know the market price of any single thing  lord darlington  you always amuse me cecil  you talk as if you were a man of experience  cecil graham  i am  moves up to front off fireplace  lord darlington  you are far too young  cecil graham  that is a great error  experience is a question of instinct about life  i have got it  tuppy hasnt  experience is the name tuppy gives to his mistakes  that is all  lord augustus looks round indignantly  dumby  experience is the name every one gives to their mistakes  cecil graham  standing with his back to the fireplace  one shouldnt commit any  sees lady windermeres fan on sofa  dumby  life would be very dull without them  cecil graham  of course you are quite faithful to this woman you are in love with darlington to this good woman  lord darlington  cecil if on really loves a woman all other women in the world become absolutely meaningless to one  love changes onei am changed  cecil graham  dear me  how very interesting  tuppy i want to talk to you  lord augustus takes no notice  dumby  its no use talking to tuppy  you might just as well talk to a brick wall  cecil graham  but i like talking to a brick wallits the only thing in the world that never contradicts me  tuppy  lord augustus  well what is it  what is it  rising and going over to cecil graham  cecil graham  come over here  i want you particularly  aside darlington has been moralising and talking about the purity of love and that sort of thing and he has got some woman in his rooms all the time  lord augustus  no really really  cecil graham  in a low voice  yes here is her fan  points to the fan  lord augustus  chuckling  by jove  by jove  lord windermere  up by door  i am really off now lord darlington  i am sorry you are leaving england so soon  pray call on us when you come back  my wife and i will be charmed to see you  lord darlington  up sage with lord windermere  i am afraid i shall be away for many years  goodnight  cecil graham  arthur  lord windermere  what  cecil graham  i want to speak to you for a moment  no do come  lord windermere  putting on his coat  i cantim off  cecil graham  it is something very particular  it will interest you enormously  lord windermere  smiling  it is some of your nonsense cecil  cecil graham  it isnt  it isnt really  lord augustus  going to him  my dear fellow you mustnt go yet  i have a lot to talk to you about  and cecil has something to show you  lord windermere  walking over  well what is it  cecil graham  darlington has got a woman here in his rooms  here is her fan  amusing isnt it  a pause  lord windermere  good god  seizes the fandumby rises  cecil graham  what is the matter  lord windermere  lord darlington  lord darlington  turning round  yes  lord windermere  what is my wifes fan doing here in your rooms hands off cecil  dont touch me  lord darlington  your wifes fan  lord windermere  yes here it is  lord darlington  walking towards him  i dont know  lord windermere  you must know  i demand an explanation  dont hold me you fool  to cecil graham  lord darlington  aside  she is here after all  lord windermere  speak sir  why is my wifes fan here  answer me  by god  ill search your rooms and if my wifes here ill moves  lord darlington  you shall not search my rooms  you have no right to do so  i forbid you  lord windermere  you scoundrel  ill not leave your room till i have searched every corner of it  what moves behind that curtain rushes towards the curtain c  mrs erlynne  enters behind r  lord windermere  lord windermere  mrs erlynne  every one starts and turns round  lady windermere slips out from behind the curtain and glides from the room l  mrs erlynne  i am afraid i took your wifes fan in mistake for my own when i was leaving your house tonight  i am so sorry takes fan from him  lord windermere looks at her in contempt lord darlington in mingled astonishment and anger  lord augustus turns away  the other men smile at each other  act drop    fourth act    scenesame as in act i  lady windermere  lying on sofa  how can i tell him  i cant tell him  it would kill me  i wonder what happened after i escaped from that horrible room  perhaps she told them the true reason of her being there and the real meaning of thatfatal fan of mine  oh if he knowshow can i look him in the face again he would never forgive me  touches bell  how securely one thinks one livesout of reach of temptation sin folly  and then suddenlyoh  life is terrible  it rules us we do not rule it  enter rosalie r  rosalie  did your ladyship ring for me  lady windermere  yes  have you found out at what time lord windermere came in last night  rosalie  his lordship did not come in till five oclock  lady windermere  five oclock  he knocked at my door this morning didnt he  rosalie  yes my ladyat halfpast nine  i told him your ladyship was not awake yet  lady windermere  did he say anything  rosalie  something about your ladyships fan  i didnt quite catch what his lordship said  has the fan been lost my lady  i cant find it and parker says it was not left in any of the rooms he has looked in all of them and on the terrace as well  lady windermere  it doesnt matter  tell parker not to trouble that will do  exit rosalie  lady windermere  rising  she is sure to tell him  i can fancy a person doing a wonderful act of selfsacrifice doing it spontaneously recklessly noblyand afterwards finding out that it costs too much  why should she hesitate between her ruin and mine    how strange  i would have publicly disgraced her in my own house  she accepts public disgrace in the house of another to save me    there is a bitter irony in things a bitter irony in the way we talk of good and bad women    oh what a lesson and what a pity that in life we only get our lessons when they are of no use to us  for even if she doesnt tell i must  oh the shame of it the shame of it  to tell it is to live through it all again  actions are the first tragedy in life words are the second  words are perhaps the worst  words are merciless   oh starts as lord windermere enters  lord windermere  kisses her  margarethow pale you look  lady windermere  i slept very badly  lord windermere  sitting on sofa with her  i am so sorry  i came in dreadfully late and didnt like to wake you  you are crying dear  lady windermere  yes i am crying for i have something to tell you arthur  lord windermere  my dear child you are not well  youve been doing too much  let us go away to the country  youll be all right at selby  the season is almost over  there is no use staying on  poor darling  well go away today if you like rises  we can easily catch the 340  ill send a wire to fannen  crosses and sits down at table to write a telegram  lady windermere  yes let us go away today  no i cant go to day arthur  there is some one i must see before i leave town some one who has been kind to me  lord windermere  rising and leaning over sofa  kind to you  lady windermere  far more than that  rises and goes to him  i will tell you arthur but only love me love me as you used to love me  lord windermere  used to  you are not thinking of that wretched woman who came here last night  coming round and sitting r of her  you dont still imagineno you couldnt  lady windermere  i dont  i know now i was wrong and foolish  lord windermere  it was very good of you to receive her last nightbut you are never to see her again  lady windermere  why do you say that  a pause  lord windermere  holding her hand  margaret i thought mrs erlynne was a woman more sinned against than sinning as the phrase goes  i thought she wanted to be good to get back into a place that she had lost by a moments folly to lead again a decent life i believed what she told mei was mistaken in her  she is badas bad as a woman can be  lady windermere  arthur arthur dont talk so bitterly about any woman  i dont think now that people can be divided into the good and the bad as though they were two separate races or creations what are called good women may have terrible things in them mad moods of recklessness assertion jealousy sin  bad women as they are termed may have in them sorrow repentance pity sacrifice  and i dont think mrs erlynne a bad womani know shes not  lord windermere  my dear child the womans impossible  no matter what harm she tries to do us you must never see her again  she is inadmissible anywhere  lady windermere  but i want to see her  i want her to come here  lord windermere  never  lady windermere  she came here once as your guest  she must come now as mine  that is but fair  lord windermere  she should never have come here  lady windermere  rising  it is too late arthur to say that now  moves away  lord windermere  rising  margaret if you knew where mrs erlynne went last night after she left this house you would not sit in the same room with her  it was absolutely shameless the whole thing  lady windermere  arthur i cant bear it any longer  i must tell you  last night   enter parker with a tray on which lie lady windermeres fan and a card  parker  mrs erlynne has called to return your ladyships fan which she took away by mistake last night  mrs erlynne has written a message on the card  lady windermere  oh ask mrs erlynne to be kind enough to come up  reads card  say i shall be very glad to see her  exit parker  she wants to see me arthur  lord windermere  takes card and looks at it  margaret i beg you not to  let me see her first at any rate  shes a very dangerous woman  she is the most dangerous woman i know  you dont realise what youre doing  lady windermere  it is right that i should see her  lord windermere  my child you may be on the brink of a great sorrow  dont go to meet it  it is absolutely necessary that i should see her before you do  lady windermere  why should it be necessary  enter parker  parker  mrs erlynne  enter mrs erlynne  exit parker  mrs erlynne  how do you do lady windermere  to lord windermere  how do you do  do you know lady windermere i am so sorry about your fan  i cant imagine how i made such a silly mistake  most stupid of me  and as i was driving in your direction i thought i would take the opportunity of returning your property in person with many apologies for my carelessness and of bidding you goodbye  lady windermere  goodbye  moves towards sofa with mrs erlynne and sits down beside her  are you going away then mrs erlynne  mrs erlynne  yes i am going to live abroad again  the english climate doesnt suit me  myheart is affected here and that i dont like  i prefer living in the south  london is too full of fogs andand serious people lord windermere  whether the fogs produce the serious people or whether the serious people produce the fogs i dont know but the whole thing rather gets on my nerves and so im leaving this afternoon by the club train  lady windermere  this afternoon  but i wanted so much to come and see you  mrs erlynne  how kind of you  but i am afraid i have to go  lady windermere  shall i never see you again mrs erlynne  mrs erlynne  i am afraid not  our lives lie too far apart  but there is a little thing i would like you to do for me  i want a photograph of you lady windermerewould you give me one  you dont know how gratified i should be  lady windermere  oh with pleasure  there is one on that table ill show it to you goes across to the table  lord windermere  coming up to mrs erlynne and speaking in a low voice  it is monstrous your intruding yourself here after your conduct last night  mrs erlynne  with an amused smile  my dear windermere manners before morals  lady windermere  returning  im afraid it is very flatteringi am not so pretty as that  showing photograph  mrs erlynne  you are much prettier  but havent you got one of yourself with your little boy  lady windermere  i have  would you prefer one of those  mrs erlynne  yes  lady windermere  ill go and get it for you if youll excuse me for a moment  i have one upstairs  mrs erlynne  so sorry lady windermere to give you so much trouble  lady windermere  moves to door r  no trouble at all mrs erlynne  mrs erlynne  thanks so much  exit lady windermere r  you seem rather out of temper this morning windermere  why should you be  margaret and i get on charmingly together  lord windermere  i cant bear to see you with her  besides you have not told me the truth mrs erlynne  mrs erlynne  i have not told her the truth you mean  lord windermere  standing c  i sometimes wish you had  i should have been spared then the misery the anxiety the annoyance of the last six months  but rather than my wife should knowthat the mother whom she was taught to consider as dead the mother whom she has mourned as dead is livinga divorced woman going about under an assumed name a bad woman preying upon life as i know you now to berather than that i was ready to supply you with money to pay bill after bill extravagance after extravagance to risk what occurred yesterday the first quarrel i have ever had with my wife  you dont understand what that means to me  how could you but i tell you that the only bitter words that ever came from those sweet lips of hers were on your account and i hate to see you next her  you sully the innocence that is in her moves lc  and then i used to think that with all your faults you were frank and honest  you are not  mrs erlynne  why do you say that  lord windermere  you made me get you an invitation to my wifes ball  mrs erlynne  for my daughters ballyes  lord windermere  you came and within an hour of your leaving the house you are found in a mans roomsyou are disgraced before every one  goes up stage c  mrs erlynne  yes  lord windermere  turning round on her  therefore i have a right to look upon you as what you area worthless vicious woman  i have the right to tell you never to enter this house never to attempt to come near my wife   mrs erlynne  coldly  my daughter you mean  lord windermere  you have no right to claim her as your daughter you left her abandoned her when she was but a child in the cradle abandoned her for your lover who abandoned you in turn  mrs erlynne  rising  do you count that to his credit lord windermereor to mine  lord windermere  to his now that i know you  mrs erlynne  take careyou had better be careful  lord windermere  oh i am not going to mince words for you  i know you thoroughly  mrs erlynne  looks steadily at him  i question that  lord windermere  i do know you  for twenty years of your life you lived without your child without a thought of your child  one day you read in the papers that she had married a rich man  you saw your hideous chance  you knew that to spare her the ignominy of learning that a woman like you was her mother i would endure anything  you began your blackmailing  mrs erlynne  shrugging her shoulders  dont use ugly words windermere  they are vulgar  i saw my chance it is true and took it  lord windermere  yes you took itand spoiled it all last night by being found out  mrs erlynne  with a strange smile  you are quite right i spoiled it all last night  lord windermere  and as for your blunder in taking my wifes fan from here and then leaving it about in darlingtons rooms it is unpardonable  i cant bear the sight of it now  i shall never let my wife use it again  the thing is soiled for me  you should have kept it and not brought it back  mrs erlynne  i think i shall keep it  goes up  its extremely pretty  takes up fan  i shall ask margaret to give it to me  lord windermere  i hope my wife will give it you  mrs erlynne  oh im sure she will have no objection  lord windermere  i wish that at the same time she would give you a miniature she kisses every night before she praysits the miniature of a young innocentlooking girl with beautiful dark hair  mrs erlynne  ah yes i remember  how long ago that seems goes to sofa and sits down  it was done before i was married dark hair and an innocent expression were the fashion then windermere  a pause  lord windermere  what do you mean by coming here this morning what is your object  crossing lc and sitting  mrs erlynne  with a note of irony in her voice  to bid good bye to my dear daughter of course  lord windermere bites his under lip in anger  mrs erlynne looks at him and her voice and manner become serious  in her accents at she talks there is a note of deep tragedy  for a moment she reveals herself  oh dont imagine i am going to have a pathetic scene with her weep on her neck and tell her who i am and all that kind of thing  i have no ambition to play the part of a mother  only once in my life like i known a mothers feelings  that was last night  they were terriblethey made me sufferthey made me suffer too much  for twenty years as you say i have lived childlessi want to live childless still  hiding her feelings with a trivial laugh besides my dear windermere how on earth could i pose as a mother with a grownup daughter  margaret is twentyone and i have never admitted that i am more than twentynine or thirty at the most twentynine when there are pink shades thirty when there are not so you see what difficulties it would involve  no as far as i am concerned let your wife cherish the memory of this dead stainless mother  why should i interfere with her illusions  i find it hard enough to keep my own  i lost one illusion last night  i thought i had no heart  i find i have and a heart doesnt suit me windermere  somehow it doesnt go with modern dress  it makes one look old  takes up handmirror from table and looks into it and it spoils ones career at critical moments  lord windermere  you fill me with horrorwith absolute horror  mrs erlynne  rising  i suppose windermere you would like me to retire into a convent or become a hospital nurse or something of that kind as people do in silly modern novels  that is stupid of you arthur in real life we dont do such thingsnot as long as we have any good looks left at any rate  nowhat consoles one nowadays is not repentance but pleasure  repentance is quite out of date  and besides if a woman really repents she has to go to a bad dressmaker otherwise no one believes in her  and nothing in the world would induce me to do that  no i am going to pass entirely out of your two lives  my coming into them has been a mistakei discovered that last night  lord windermere  a fatal mistake  mrs erlynne  smiling  almost fatal  lord windermere  i am sorry now i did not tell my wife the whole thing at once  mrs erlynne  i regret my bad actions  you regret your good ones that is the difference between us  lord windermere  i dont trust you  i will tell my wife  its better for her to know and from me  it will cause her infinite painit will humiliate her terribly but its right that she should know  mrs erlynne  you propose to tell her  lord windermere  i am going to tell her  mrs erlynne  going up to him  if you do i will make my name so infamous that it will mar every moment of her life  it will ruin her and make her wretched  if you dare to tell her there is no depth of degradation i will not sink to no pit of shame i will not enter  you shall not tell heri forbid you  lord windermere  why  mrs erlynne  after a pause  if i said to you that i cared for her perhaps loved her evenyou would sneer at me wouldnt you  lord windermere  i should feel it was not true  a mothers love means devotion unselfishness sacrifice  what could you know of such things  mrs erlynne  you are right  what could i know of such things dont let us talk any more about itas for telling my daughter who i am that i do not allow  it is my secret it is not yours  if i make up my mind to tell her and i think i will i shall tell her before i leave the
