this volume is composed appeared originally in the columns of fun when the wisdom of the fables and the truth of the tales tended to wholesomely diminish the levity of that jocund sheet their publication in a new form would seem to be a fitting occasion to say something as to their merit  homers iliad it will be remembered was but imperfectly appreciated by homers contemporaries miltons paradise lost was so lightly regarded when first written that the author received but twentyfive pounds for it ben jonson was for some time blind to the beauties of shakespeare and shakespeare himself had but small esteem for his own work  appearing each week in fun these fables and tales very soon attracted the notice of the editor who was frank enough to say afterward that when he accepted the manuscript he did not quite perceive the quality of it the printers too into whose hands it came have since admitted that for some days they felt very little interest in it and could not even make out what it was all about when to these evidences i add the confession that at first i did not myself observe anything extraordinary in my work i think i need say no more the discerning public will note the parallel and my modesty be spared the necessity of making an ass of itself  dg     fables of zambri the parsee  illustration  i   a certain persian nobleman obtained from a cow gipsy a small oyster holding him up by the beard he addressed him thus  you must try to forgive me for what i am about to do and you might as well set about it at once for you havent much time i should never think of swallowing you if it were not so easy but opportunity is the strongest of all temptations besides i am an orphan and very hungry  very well replied the oyster it affords me genuine pleasure to comfort the parentless and the starving i have already done my best for our friend here of whom you purchased me but although she has an amiable and accommodating stomach we couldnt agree for this trifling incompatibilitywould you believe itshe was about to stew me saviour benefactor proceed  i think said the nobleman rising and laying down the oyster i ought to know something more definite about your antecedents before succouring you if you couldnt agree with your mistress you are probably no better than you should be  people who begin doing something from a selfish motive frequently drop it when they learn that it is a real benevolence     ii   a rat seeing a cat approaching and finding no avenue of escape went boldly up to her and said  madam i have just swallowed a dose of powerful bane and in accordance with instructions upon the label have come out of my hole to die will you kindly direct me to a spot where my corpse will prove peculiarly offensive  since you are so ill replied the cat i will myself transport you to a spot which i think will suit  so saying she struck her teeth through the nape of his neck and trotted away with him this was more than he had bargained for and he squeaked shrilly with the pain  ah said the cat a rat who knows he has but a few minutes to live never makes a fuss about a little agony i dont think my fine fellow you have taken poison enough to hurt either you or me  so she made a meal of him  if this fable does not teach that a rat gets no profit by lying i should be pleased to know what it does teach     iii   a frog who had been sitting up all night in neighbourly converse with an echo of elegant leisure went out in the grey of the morning to obtain a cheap breakfast seeing a tadpole approach  halt he croaked and show cause why i should not eat you  the tadpole stopped and displayed a fine tail  enough said the frog i mistook you for one of us and if there is anything i like it is frog but no frog has a tail as a matter of course  while he was speaking however the tail ripened and dropped off and its owner stood revealed in his edible character  aha ejaculated the frog so that is your little game if instead of adopting a disguise you had trusted to my mercy i should have spared you but i am down upon all manner of deceit  and he had him down in a moment  learn from this that he would have eaten him anyhow     iv   an old man carrying for no obvious reason a sheaf of sticks met another donkey whose cargo consisted merely of a bundle of stones  suppose we swop said the donkey  very good sir assented the old man lay your load upon my shoulders and take off my parcel putting it upon your own back  the donkey complied so far as concerned his own encumbrance but neglected to remove that of the other  how clever said the merry old gentleman i knew you would do that if you had done any differently there would have been no point to the fable  and laying down both burdens by the roadside he trudged away as merry as anything     v   an elephant meeting a mouse reproached him for not taking a proper interest in growth  it is all very well retorted the mouse for people who havent the capacity for anything better let them grow if they like but i prefer toasted cheese  the stupid elephant not being able to make very much sense of this remark essayed after the manner of persons worsted at repartee to set his foot upon his clever conqueror in point of fact he did set his foot upon him and there wasnt any more mouse  the lesson imparted by this fable is open palpable mice and elephants look at things each after the manner of his kind and when an elephant decides to occupy the standpoint of a mouse it is unhealthy for the latter     vi   a wolf was slaking his thirst at a stream when a lamb left the side of his shepherd came down the creek to the wolf passed round him with considerable ostentation and began drinking below  i beg you to observe said the lamb that water does not commonly run uphill and my sipping here cannot possibly defile the current where you are even supposing my nose were no cleaner than yours which it is so you have not the flimsiest pretext for slaying me  i am not aware sir replied the wolf that i require a pretext for loving chops it never occurred to me that one was necessary  and he dined upon that lambkin with much apparent satisfaction  this fable ought to convince any one that of two stories very similar one needs not necessarily be a plagiarism     vii  illustration  an old gentleman sat down one day upon an acorn and finding it a very comfortable seat went soundly to sleep the warmth of his body caused the acorn to germinate and it grew so rapidly that when the sleeper awoke he found himself sitting in the fork of an oak sixty feet from the ground  ah said he i am fond of having an extended view of any landscape which happens to please my fancy but this one does not seem to possess that merit i think i will go home  it is easier to say go home than to go  well well he resumed if i cannot compel circumstances to my will i can at least adapt my will to circumstances i decide to remain lifeas a certain eminent philosopher in england wilt say whenever there shall be an england to say it inis the definite combination of heterogeneous changes both simultaneous and successive in correspondence with external coexistences and sequences i have fortunately a few years of this before me yet and i suppose i can permit my surroundings to alter me into anything i choose  and he did but what a choice  i should say that the lesson hereby imparted is one of contentment combined with science     viii   a caterpillar had crawled painfully to the top of a hoppole and not finding anything there to interest him began to think of descending  now soliloquized he if i only had a pair of wings i should be able to manage it very nicely  so saying he turned himself about to go down but the heat of his previous exertion and that of the sun had by this time matured him into a butterfly  just my luck he growled i never wish for anything without getting it i did not expect this when i came out this morning and have nothing prepared but i suppose i shall have to stand it  so he spread his pinions and made for the first open flower he saw but a spider happened to be spending the summer in that vegetable and it was not long before mr butterfly was wishing himself back atop of that pole a simple caterpillar  he had at last the pleasure of being denied a desire  hæc fabula docet that it is not a good plan to call at houses without first ascertaining who is at home there     ix   it is related of a certain tartar priest that being about to sacrifice a pig he observed tears in the victims eyes  now id like to know what is the matter with you he asked  sir replied the pig if your penetration were equal to that of the knife you hold you would know without inquiring but i dont mind telling you i weep because i know i shall be badly roasted  ah returned the priest meditatively having first killed the pig we are all pretty much alike it is the bad roasting that frightens us mere death has no terrors  from this narrative learn that even priests sometimes get hold of only half a truth     x   a dog being very much annoyed by bees ran quite accidentally into an empty barrel lying on the ground and looking out at the bunghole addressed his tormenters thus  had you been temperate stinging me only one at a time you might have got a good deal of fun out of me as it is you have driven me into a secure retreat for i can snap you up as fast as you come in through the bunghole learn from this the folly of intemperate zeal  when he had concluded he awaited a reply there wasnt any reply for the bees had never gone near the bunghole they went in the same way as he did and made it very warm for him  the lesson of this fable is that one cannot stick to his pure reason while quarrelling with bees     xi   a fox and a duck having quarrelled about the ownership of a frog agreed to refer the dispute to a lion after hearing a great deal of argument the lion opened his mouth to speak  i am very well aware interrupted the duck what your decision is it is that by our own showing the frog belongs to neither of us and you will eat him yourself but please remember that lions do not like frogs  to me exclaimed the fox it is perfectly clear that you will give the frog to the duck the duck to me and take me yourself allow me to state certain objections to  i was about to remark said the lion that while you were disputing the cause of contention had hopped away perhaps you can procure another frog  to point out the moral of this fable would be to offer a gratuitous insult to the acuteness of the reader     xii   an ass meeting a pair of horses late one evening said to them  it is time all honest horses were in bed why are you driving out at this time of day  ah returned they if it is so very late why are you out riding  i never in my life retorted the ass angrily knew a horse to return a direct answer to a civil question  this tale shows that this ass did not know everything  the implication that horses do not answer questions seems to have irritated the worthy fabulisttranslator     xiii   a stone being cast by the plough against a lump of earth hastened to open the conversation as follows  virtue which is the opposite of vice is best fostered by the absence of temptation  the lump of earth being taken somewhat by surprise was not prepared with an apophthegm and said nothing  since that time it has been customary to call a stupid person a clod     xiv   a river seeing a zephyr carrying off an anchor asked him what are you going to do with it  i give it up replied the zephyr after mature reflection  blow me if i would continued the river you might just as well not have taken it at all  between you and me returned the zephyr i only picked it up because it is customary for zephyrs to do such things but if you dont mind i will carry it up to your head and drop it in your mouth  this fable teaches such a multitude of good things that it would be invidious to mention any     xv   a peasant sitting on a pile of stones saw an ostrich approaching and when it had got within range he began pelting it it is hardly probable that the bird liked this but it never moved until a large number of boulders had been discharged then it fell to and ate them  it was very good of you sir then said the fowl pray tell me to what virtue i am indebted for this excellent meal  to piety replied the peasant who believing that anything able to devour stones must be a god was stricken with fear i beg you wont think these were merely cold victuals from my table i had just gathered them fresh and was intending to have them dressed for my dinner but i am always hospitable to the deities and now i suppose i shall have to go without  on the contrary my pious youth returned the ostrich you shall go within  and the man followed the stones  the falsehoods of the wicked never amount to much     xvi   two thieves went into a farmers granary and stole a sack of kitchen vegetables and one of them slinging it across his shoulders they began to run away in a moment all the domestic animals and barnyard fowls about the place were at their heels in high clamour which threatened to bring the farmer down upon them with his dogs  you have no idea how the weight of this sack assists me in escaping by increasing my momentum said the one who carried the plunder suppose you take it  ah returned the other who had been zealously pointing out the way to safety and keeping foremost therein it is interesting to find how a common danger makes people confiding you have a thousand times said i could not be trusted with valuable booty it is an humiliating confession but i am myself convinced that if i should assume that sack and the impetus it confers you could not depend upon your dividend  illustration  a common danger was the reply seems to stimulate conviction as well as confidence  very likely assented the other drily i am quite too busy to enter into these subtleties you will find the subject very ably treated in the zendavesta  but the bastinado taught them more in a minute than they would have gleaned from that excellent work in a fortnight  if they could only have had the privilege of reading this fable it would have taught them more than either     xvii   while a man was trying with all his might to cross a fence a bull ran to his assistance and taking him upon his horns tossed him over seeing the man walking away without making any remark the bull said  you are quite welcome i am sure i did no more than my duty  i take a different view of it very naturally replied the man and you may keep your polite acknowledgments of my gratitude until you receive it i did not require your services  you dont mean to say answered the bull that you did not wish to cross that fence  i mean to say was the rejoinder that i wished to cross it by my method solely to avoid crossing it by yours  fabula docet that while the end is everything the means is something     xviii   an hippopotamus meeting an open alligator said to him  my forked friend you may as well collapse you are not sufficiently comprehensive to embrace me i am myself no tyro at smiling when in the humour  i really had no expectation of taking you in replied the other i have a habit of extending my hospitality impartially to all and about seven feet wide  you remind me said the hippopotamus of a certain zebra who was not vicious at all he merely kicked the breath out of everything that passed behind him but did not induce things to pass behind him  it is quite immaterial what i remind you of was the reply  the lesson conveyed by this fable is a very beautiful one     xix   a man was plucking a living goose when his victim addressed him thus  suppose you were a goose do you think you would relish this sort of thing  well suppose i were answered the man do you think you would like to pluck me  indeed i would was the emphatic natural but injudicious reply  just so concluded her tormentor thats the way i feel about the matter     xx   a traveller perishing of thirst in a desert debated with his camel whether they should continue their journey or turn back to an oasis they had passed some days before the traveller favoured the latter plan  i am decidedly opposed to any such waste of time said the animal i dont care for oases myself  i should not care for them either retorted the man with some temper if like you i carried a number of assorted watertanks inside but as you will not submit to go back and i shall not consent to go forward we can only remain where we are  but objected the camel that will be certain death to you  not quite was the quiet answer it involves only the loss of my camel  so saying he assassinated the beast and appropriated his liquid store  a compromise is not always a settlement satisfactory to both parties     xxi   a sheep making a long journey found the heat of his fleece very uncomfortable and seeing a flock of other sheep in a fold evidently awaiting for some one leaped over and joined them in the hope of being shorn perceiving the shepherd approaching and the other sheep huddling into a remote corner of the fold he shouldered his way forward and going up to the shepherd said  did you ever see such a lot of fools its lucky i came along to set them an example of docility seeing me operated upon they ll be glad to offer themselves  perhaps so replied the shepherd laying hold of the animals horns but i never kill more than one sheep at a time mutton wont keep in hot weather  the chops tasted excellently well with tomato sauce  the moral of this fable isnt what you think it is it is this the chops of another mans mutton are always nice eating     xxii   two travellers between teheran and bagdad met halfway up the vertical face of a rock on a path only a cubit in width as both were in a hurry and etiquette would allow neither to set his foot upon the other even if dignity had permitted prostration they maintained for some time a stationary condition after some reflection each decided to jump round the other but as etiquette did not warrant conversation with a stranger neither made known his intention the consequence was they met with considerable emphasis about four feet from the edge of the path and went through a flight of soaring eagles a mile out of their waya  footnote a this is infamous the learned parsee appears wholly to ignore the distinction between a fable and a simple lietranslator     xxiii   a stone which had lain for centuries in a hidden place complained to allah that remaining so long in one position was productive of cramps  if thou wouldst be pleased it said to let me take a little exercise now and then my health would be the better for it  so it was granted permission to make a short excursion and at once began rolling out into the open desert it had not proceeded far before an ostrich who was pensively eating a keg of nails left his repast dashed at the stone and gobbled it up  this narration teaches the folly of contentment if the ostrich had been content with his nails he would never have eaten the stone     xxiv   a man carrying a sack of corn up a high ladder propped against a wall had nearly reached the top when a powerful hog passing that way leant against the bottom to scratch its hide  i wish said the man speaking down the ladder you would make that operation as brief as possible and when i come down i will reward you by rearing a fresh ladder especially for you  this one is quite good enough for a hog was the reply but i am curious to know if you will keep your promise so ill just amuse myself until you come down  and taking the bottom rung in his mouth he moved off away from the wall a moment later he had all the loose corn he could garner but he never got that other ladder  moralan ace and four kings is as good a hand as one can hold in drawpoker     xxv   a young cock and a hen were speaking of the size of eggs said the cock  i once laid an egg  oh you did interrupted the hen with a derisive cackle pray how did you manage it  the cock felt injured in his selfesteem and turning his back upon the hen addressed himself to a brood of young chickens  i once laid an egg  the chickens chirped incredulously and passed on the insulted bird reddened in the wattles with indignation and strutting up to the patriarch of the entire barnyard repeated his assertion the patriarch nodded gravely as if the feat were an everyday affair and the other continued  i once laid an egg alongside a watermelon and compared the two the vegetable was considerably the larger  this fable is intended to show the absurdity of hearing all a man has to say     xxvi   illustration  seeing himself getting beyond his depth a bathing naturalist called lustily for succour  anything i can do for you inquired the engaging octopus  happy to serve you i am sure said the accommodating leech  command me added the earnest crab  gentlemen of the briny deep exclaimed the gasping savant i am compelled to decline your friendly offices but i tender you my scientific gratitude and as a return favour i beg with this my last breath that you will accept the freedom of my aquarium and make it your home  this tale proves that scientific gratitude is quite as bad as the natural sort     xxvii   two whales seizing a pike attempted in turn to swallow him but without success they finally determined to try him jointly each taking hold of an end and both shutting their eyes for a grand effort when a shark darted silently between them biting away the whole body of their prey opening their eyes they gazed upon one another with much satisfaction  i had no idea he would go down so easily said the one  nor i returned the other but how very tasteless a pike is  the insipidity we observe in most of our acquaintances is largely due to our imperfect knowledge of them     xxviii   a wolf went into the cottage of a peasant while the family was absent in the fields and falling foul of some beef was quietly enjoying it when he was observed by a domestic rat who went directly to her master informing him of what she had seen  i would myself have dispatched the robber she added but feared you might wish to take him alive  so the man secured a powerful club and went to the door of the house while the rat looked in at the window after taking a survey of the situation the man said  i dont think i care to take this fellow alive judging from his present performance i should say his keeping would entail no mean expense you may go in and slay him if you like i have quite changed my mind  if you really intended taking him prisoner replied the rat the object of that bludgeon is to me a matter of mere conjecture however it is easy enough to see you have changed your mind and it may be barely worth mentioning that i have changed mine  the interest you both take in me said the wolf without looking up touches me deeply as you have considerately abstained from bothering me with the question of how i am to be disposed of i will not embarrass your counsels by obtruding a preference whatever may be your decision you may count on my acquiescence my countenance alone ought to convince you of the meek docility of my character i never lose my temper and i never swear but by the stomach of the prophet if either one of you domestic animals is in sight when i have finished the conquest of these ribs the question of my fate may be postponed for future debate without detriment to any important interest  this fable teaches that while you are considering the abatement of a nuisance it is important to know which nuisance is the more likely to be abated     xxix   a snake tried to shed his skin by pulling it off over his head but being unable to do so was advised by a woodman to slip out of it in the usual way  but said the serpent this is the way you do it  true exclaimed the woodman holding out the hem of his tunic but you will observe that my skin is brief and open if you desire one like that i think i can assist you  so saying he chopped off about a cubit of the snakes tail     xxx   an oyster who had got a large pebble between the valves of his shell and was unable to get it out was lamenting his sad fate whenthe tide being outa monkey ran to him and began making an examination  you appear said the monkey to have got something else in here too i think id better remove that first  with this he inserted his paw and scooped out the animals essential part  now said he eating the portion he had removed i think you will be able to manage the pebble yourself  to apprehend the lesson of this fable one must have some experience of the law     xxxi   an old fox and her two cubs were pursued by dogs when one of the cubs got a thorn in his foot and could go no farther setting the other to watch for the pursuers the mother proceeded with much tender solicitude to extract the thorn just as she had done so the sentinel gave the alarm  how near are they asked the mother  close by in the next field was the answer  the deuce they are was the hasty rejoinder however i presume they will be content with a single fox  and shoving the thorn earnestly back into the wounded foot this excellent parent took to her heels  this fable proves that humanity does not happen to enjoy a monopoly of paternal affection     xxxii   a man crossing the great river of egypt heard a voice which seemed to come from beneath his boat requesting him to stop thinking it must proceed from some riverdeity he laid down his paddle and said  whoever you are that ask me to stop i beg you will let me go on i have been asked by a friend to dine with him and i am late  should your friend pass this way said the voice i will show him the cause of your detention meantime you must come to dinner with me  willingly replied the man devoutly very well pleased with so extraordinary an honour pray show me the way  in here said the crocodile elevating his distending jaws above the water and beckoning with his tonguethis way please  this fable shows that being asked to dinner is not always the same thing as being asked to dine     xxxiii   an old monkey designing to teach his sons the advantage of unity brought them a number of sticks and desired them to see how easily they might be broken one at a time so each young monkey took a stick and broke it  now said the father i will teach you a lesson  and he began to gather the sticks into a bundle but the young monkeys thinking he was about to beat them set upon him all together and disabled him  there said the aged sufferer behold the advantage of unity if you had assailed me one at a time i would have killed every mothers son of you  moral lessons are like the merchants goods they are conveyed in various ways     xxxiv   a wild horse meeting a domestic one taunted him with his condition of servitude the tamed animal claimed that he was as free as the wind  if that is so said the other pray tell me the office of that bit in your mouth  that was the answer is iron one of the best tonics in the materia medica  but what said the other is the meaning of the rein attached to it  keeps it from falling out of my mouth when i am too indolent to hold it was the reply  how about the saddle  fool was the angry retort its purpose is to spare me fatigue when i am tired i get on and ride     xxxv   some doves went to a hawk and asked him to protect them from a kite  that i will was the cheerful reply and when i am admitted into the dovecote i shall kill more of you in a day than the kite did in a century but of course you know this you expect to be treated in the regular way  so he entered the dovecote and began preparations for a general slaughter but the doves all set upon him and made exceedingly short work of him with his last breath he asked them why being so formidable they had not killed the kite they replied that they had never seen any kite     illustration   xxxvi   a defeated warrior snatched up his aged father and slinging him across his shoulders plunged into the wilderness followed by the weary remnant of his beaten army the old gentleman liked it  see said he triumphantly to the flying legion did you ever hear of so dutiful and accommodating a son and hes as easy under the saddle as an old family horse  i rather think replied the broken and disordered battalion with a grin that mr Æneas once did something of this kind but his father had thoughtfully taken an armful of lares and penates and the accommodating nature of his son was therefore more conspicuous if i might venture to suggest that you take up my shield and scimitar  thank you said the aged party i could not think of disarming the military but if you would just hand me up one of the heaviest of those dead branches i think the merits of my son would be rendered sufficiently apparent  the routed column passed him up the one shown in the immediate foreground of our sketch and it was quite enough for both steed and rider  fabula ostendit that history repeats itself with variations     xxxvii   a pig who had engaged a crayfish to pilot him along the beach in search of mussels was surprised to see his guide start off backwards  your excessive politeness quite overcomes me said the porker but dont you think it rather ill bestowed upon a pig pray dont hesitate to turn your back upon me  sir replied the crayfish permit me to continue as i am we now stand to each other in the proper relation of employé to employer the former is excessively obsequious and the latter is in the eyes of the former a hog     xxxviii   the king of tortoises desiring to pay a visit of ceremony to a neighbouring monarch feared that in his absence his idle subjects might get up a revolution and that whoever might be left at the head of the state would usurp the throne so calling his subjects about him he addressed them thus  i am about to leave our beloved country for a long period and desire to leave the sceptre in the hands of him who is most truly a tortoise i decree that you shall set out from yonder distant tree and pass round it whoever shall get back last shall be appointed regent  so the population set out for the goal and the king for his destination before the race was decided his majesty had made the journey and returned but he found the throne occupied by a subject who at once secured by violence what he had won by guile  certain usurpers are too conscientious to retain kingly power unless the rightful monarch be dead and these are the most dangerous sort     xxxix   a spaniel at the point of death requested a mastiff friend to eat him  it would soothe my last moments said he to know that when i am no longer of any importance to myself i may still be useful to you  much obliged i am sure replied his friend i think you mean well but you should know that my appetite is not so depraved as to relish dog  perhaps it is for a similar reason we abstain from cannibalism     xl   a cloud was passing across the face of the sun when the latter expostulated with him  why said the sun when you have so much space to float in should you be casting your cold shadow upon me  after a moments reflection the cloud made answer thus  i certainly had no intention of giving offence by my presence and as for my shadow dont you think you have made a trifling mistakenot a gigantic or absurd mistake but merely one that would disgrace an idiot  at this the great luminary was furious and fell so hotly upon him that in a few minutes there was nothing of him left  it is very foolish to bandy words with a cloud if you happen to be the sun     xli   a rabbit travelling leisurely along the highway was seen at some distance by a duck who had just come out of the water  well i declare said she if i could not walk without limping in that ridiculous way id stay at home why hes a spectacle  did you ever see such an ungainly beast as that duck said the rabbit to himself if i waddled like that i should go out only at night  moral by a kangaroopeople who are ungraceful of gait are always intolerant of mind     xlii   a fox who dwelt in the upper chamber of an abandoned watchtower where he practised all manner of magic had by means of his art subjected all other animals to his will one day he assembled a great multitude of them below his window and commanded that each should appear in his presence and all who could not teach him some important truth should be thrown off the walls and dashed to pieces upon hearing this they were all stricken with grief and began to lament their hard fate most piteously  how said they shall we who are unskilled in magic unread in philosophy and untaught in the secrets of the starswho have neither wit eloquence nor songhow shall we essay to teach wisdom to the wise  nevertheless they were compelled to make the attempt after many had failed and been dispatched another fox arrived on the ground and learning the condition of affairs scampered slyly up the steps and whispered something in the ear of the cat who was about entering the tower so the latter stuck her head in at the door and shrieked  pullets with a southern exposure ripen earliest and have yellow legs  at this the magician was so delighted that he dissolved the spell and let them all go free     xliii   one evening a jackass passing between a village and a hill looked over the latter and saw the faint light of the rising moon  hoho master redface said he so you are climbing up the other side to point out my long ears to the villagers are you ill just meet you at the top and set my heels into your insolent old lantern  so he scrambled painfully up to the crest and stood outlined against the broad disc of the unconscious luminary more conspicuously a jackass than ever before     xliv   a bear wishing to rob a beehive laid himself down in front of it and overturned it with his paw  now said he i will lie perfectly still and let the bees sting me until they are exhausted and powerless their honey may then be obtained without opposition  and it was so obtained but by a fresh bear the other being dead  this narrative exhibits one aspect of the fabian policy     xlv   a cat seeing a mouse with a piece of cheese said  i would not eat that if i were you for i think it is poisoned however if you will allow me to examine it i will tell you certainly whether it is or not  while the mouse was thinking what it was best to do the cat had fully made up her mind and was kind enough to examine both the cheese and the mouse in a manner highly satisfactory to herself but the mouse has never returned to give his opinion     xlvi   an improvident man who had quarrelled with his wife concerning household expenses took her and the children out on the lawn intending to make an example of her putting himself in an attitude of aggression and turning to his offspring he said  you will observe my darlings that domestic offences are always punished with a loss of blood make a note of this and be wise  he had no sooner spoken than a starving mosquito settled upon his nose and began to assist in enforcing the lesson  my officious friend said the man when i require illustrations from the fowls of the air you may command my patronage the deep interest you take in my affairs is at present a trifle annoying  illustration  i do not find it so the mosquito would have replied had he been at leisure and am convinced that our respective points of view are so widely dissimilar as not to afford the faintest hope of reconciling our opinions upon collateral points let us be thankful that upon the main question of bloodletting we perfectly agree  when the bird had concluded the mans convictions were quite unaltered but he was too weak to resume the discussion and although blood is thicker than water the children were constrained to confess that the stranger had the best of it  this fable teaches     xlvii   i hate snakes who bestow their caresses with interested partiality or fastidious discrimination boasted a boa constrictor my affection is unbounded it embraces all animated nature i am the universal shepherd i gather all manner of living things into my folds entertainment here for man and beast  i should be glad of one of your caresses said a porcupine meekly it has been some time since i got a loving embrace  so saying he nestled snugly and confidingly against the largehearted serpentwho fled  a comprehensive philanthropy may be devoid of prejudices but it has its preferences all the same     xlviii   during a distressing famine in china a starving man met a fat pig who seeing no chance of escape walked confidently up to the superior animal and said  awful famine isnt it  quite dreadful replied the man eyeing him with an evident purpose almost impossible to obtain meat  plenty of meat such as it is but no corn do you know i have been compelled to eat so many of your people i dont believe there is an ounce of pork in my composition  and i so many that i have lost all taste for pork  terrible thing this cannibalism  depends upon which character you try it in it is terrible to be eaten  you are very brutal  you are very fat  you look as if you would take my life  you look as if you would sustain mine  let us pull sticks said the now desperate animal to see which of us shall die  good assented the man ill pull this one  so saying he drew a hedgestake from the ground and stained it with the brain of that unhappy porker  moralan empty stomach has no ears     xlix   a snake a mile long having drawn himself over a rocs egg complained that in its present form he could get no benefit from it and modestly desired the roc to aid him in some way  certainly assented the bird i think we can arrange it  saying which she snatched up one of the smaller persian provinces and poising herself a few leagues above the suffering reptile let it drop upon him to smash the egg  this fable exhibits the folly of asking for aid without specifying the kind and amount of aid you require     l   an ox meeting a man on the highway asked him for a pinch of snuff whereupon the man fled back along the road in extreme terror  dont be alarmed said a horse whom he met the ox wont bite you  the man gave one stare and dashed across the meadows  well said a sheep i wouldnt be afraid of a horse he wont kick  the man shot like a comet into the forest  look where youre going there or ill thrash the life out of you screamed a bird into whose nest he had blundered  frantic with fear the man leapt into the sea  by jove how you frightened me said a small shark  the man was dejected and felt a sense of injury he seated himself moodily on the bottom braced up his chin with his knees and thought for an hour then he beckoned to the fish who had made the last remark  see here i say said he i wish you would just tell me what in thunder this all means  ever read any fables asked the shark  noyeswell the catechism the marriage service and  oh bother said the fish playfully smiling clean back to the pectoral fins get out of this and bolt your Æsop  the man did get out and bolted  this fable teaches that its worthy author was drunk as a loontranslator     li   a lion pursued by some villagers was asked by a fox why he did not escape on horseback  there is a fine strong steed just beyond this rock said the fox all you have to do is to get on his back and stay there  so the lion went up to the charger and asked him to give him a lift  certainly said the horse with great pleasure  and setting one of his heels into the animals stomach he lifted him about seven feet from the ground  confound you roared the beast as he fell back  so did you quietly remarked the steed     lii   a mahout who had dismounted from his elephant and was quietly standing on his head in the middle of the highway was asked by the animal why he did not revert and move on  you are making a spectacle of yourself said the beast  if i choose to stand upside down replied the man i am very well aware that i incur the displeasure of those who adhere with slavish tenacity to the prejudices and traditions of society but it seems to me that rebuke would come with a more consistent grace from one who does not wear a tail upon his nose  this fable teaches that four straight lines may enclose a circle but there will be corners to let     liii   a dog meeting a strange cat took her by the top of the back and shook her for a considerable period with some earnestness then depositing her in a ditch he remarked with gravity  there my feline friend i think that will teach you a wholesome lesson and as punishment is intended to be reformatory you ought to be grateful to me for deigning to administer it  i dont think of questioning your right to worry me said the cat getting her breath but i should like to know where you got your licence to preach at me also if not inconsistent with the dignity of the court i should wish to be informed of the nature of my offence in order that i may the more clearly apprehend the character of the lesson imparted by its punishment  since you are so curious replied the dog i worry you because you are too feeble to worry me  in other words rejoined the cat getting herself together as well as she could you bite me for that to which you owe your existence  the reply of the dog was lost in the illimitable field of ether whither he was just then projected by the kick of a passing horse the moral of this fable cannot be given until he shall get down and close the conversation with the regular apophthegm     liv   people who wear tight hats will do well to lay this fable well to heart and ponder upon the deep significance of its moral  in passing over a river upon a high bridge a cow discovered a broad loose plank in the flooring sustained in place by a beam beneath the centre  now said she i will stand at this end of the trap and when yonder sheep steps upon the opposite extreme there will be an upward tendency in wool  so when the meditative mutton advanced unwarily upon the treacherous device the cow sprang bodily upon the other end and there was a fall in beef     lv   two snakes were debating about the proper method of attacking prey  the best way said one is to slide cautiously up endwise and seize it thusillustrating his method by laying hold of the others tail  not at all was the reply a better plan is to approach by a circular sidesweep thusturning upon his opponent and taking in his tail  although there was no disagreement as to the manner of disposing of what was once seized each began to practise his system upon the other and continued until both were swallowed  the work begun by contention is frequently completed by habit     illustration   lvi   a man staggering wearily through the streets of persepolis under a heavy burden said to himself  i wish i knew what this thing is i have on my back then i could make some sort of conjecture as to what i design doing with it  suppose said the burden i were a man in a sack what disposition would you make of me  the regular thing replied the man would be to take you over to constantinople and pitch you into the bosphorus but i should probably content myself with laying you down and jumping on you as being more agreeable to my feelings and quite as efficacious  but suppose continued the burden i were a shoulder of beefwhich i quite as much resemblebelonging to some poor family  in that case replied the man promptly i should carry you to my larder my good fellow  but if i were a sack of gold do you think you would find me very onerous said the burden  a great deal would depend was the answer upon whom you happened to belong to but i may say generally that gold upon the shoulders is wonderfully light considering the weight of it  behold said the burden the folly of mankind they cannot perceive that the quality of the burdens of life is a matter of no importance the question of pounds and ounces is the only consideration of any real weight     lvii   a ghost meeting a genie one wintry night said to him  extremely harassing weather friend wish i had some teeth to chatter  you do not need them said the other you can always chatter those of other people by merely showing yourself for my part i should be content with some light employment would erect a cheap palace transport a lightweight princess threaten a small crippleor jobs of that kind what are the prospects of the fool crop  for the next few thousand years very good there is a sort of thing called literature coming in shortly and it will make our fortune but it will be very bad for history curse this phantom apparel the more i gather it about me the colder i get  when literature has made our fortune sneered the genie i presume you will purchase material clothing  and you retorted the ghost will be able to advertise for permanent employment at a fixed salary  this fable shows the difference between the super natural and the natural super the one appears in the narrative the other does not     lviii   permit me to help you on in the world sir said a boy to a travelling tortoise placing a glowing coal upon the animals back  thank you replied the unconscious beast i alone am responsible for the time of my arrival and i alone will determine the degree of celerity required the gait i am going will enable me to keep all my present appointments  a genial warmth began about this time to pervade his upper crust and a moment after he was dashing away at a pace comparatively tremendous  how about those engagements sneered the grinning urchin  ive recollected another one was the hasty reply     lix   having fastened his gaze upon a sparrow a rattlesnake sprung open his spanning jaws and invited her to enter  i should be most happy said the bird not daring to betray her helpless condition but anxious by any subterfuge to get the serpent to remove his fascinating regard but i am lost in contemplation of yonder green sunset from which i am unable to look away for more than a minute i shall turn to it presently  do by all means said the serpent with a touch of irony in his voice there is nothing so improving as a good square green sunset  did you happen to observe that man standing behind you with a club continued the sparrow handsome fellow fifteen cubits high with seven heads and very singularly attired quite a spectacle in his way  i dont seem to care much for men said the snake every way inferior to serpentsexcept in malice  but he is accompanied by a really interesting child persisted the bird desperately  the rattlesnake reflected deeply he soliloquized as follows  there is a mere chancesay about one chance to ten thousand millionthat this songster is speaking the truth one chance in ten thousand million of seeing a really interesting child is worth the sacrifice demanded ill make it  so saying he removed his glittering eyes from the bird who immediately took wing and looked behind him it is needless to say there was no really interesting child therenor anywhere else  moralmendacity so called from the inventors is a very poor sort of dacity but it will serve your purpose if you draw it sufficiently strong     lx   a man who was very much annoyed by the incursions of a lean ass belonging to his neighbour resolved to compass the destruction of the invader  now said he if this animal shall choose to starve himself to death in the midst of plenty the law will not hold me guilty of his blood i have read of a trick which i think will fix him  so he took two bales of his best hay and placed them in a distant field about forty cubits apart by means of a little salt he then enticed the ass in and coaxed him between the bundles  there fiend said he with a diabolic grin as he walked away delighted with the success of his stratagem now hesitate which bundle of hay to attack first until you starvemonster  some weeks afterwards he returned with a wagon to convey back the bundles of hay there wasnt any hay but the wagon was useful for returning to his owner that unfortunate asswho was too fat to walk  this ought to show any one the folly of relying upon the teaching of obscure and inferior authorsa  footnote a it is to be wished our author had not laid himself open to the imputation of having perverted if not actually invented some of his facts for the unworthy purpose of bringing a deserving rival into disfavourtranslator     lxi   one day the king of the wrens held his court for the trial of a bear who was at large upon his own recognizance being summoned to appear the animal came with great humility into the royal presence  what have you to say sir demanded the king in defence of your inexcusable conduct in pillaging the nests of our loyal subjects wherever you can find them  may it please your majesty replied the prisoner with a reverential gesture repeated at intervals and each time at a less distance from the royal person i will not wound your majestys sensibilities by pleading a love of eggs i will humbly confess my course of crime warn your majesty of its probable continuance and beg your majestys gracious permission to inquirewhat is your majesty going to do about it  the king and his ministers were very much struck with this respectful speech with the ingenuity of the final inquiry and with the bears paw it was the paw however which made the most lasting impression  always give ear to the flattery of your powerful inferiors it will cheer you in your decline     lxii   a philosopher looking up from the pages of the zendavesta upon which he had been centring his soul beheld a pig violently assailing a cauldron of cold slops  heaven bless us said the sage for unalloyed delight give me a good honest article of sensuality so soon as my essay upon the correlation of mindforces shall have brought me fame and fortune i hope to abjure the higher faculties devoting the remainder of my life to the cultivation of the propensities  allah be praised soliloquized the pig there is nothing so godlike as intellect and nothing so ecstatic as intellectual pursuits i must hasten to perform this gross material function that i may retire to my wallow and resign my soul to philosophical meditation  this tale has one moral if you are a philosopher and another if you are a pig     lxiii   awful darkisnt it said an owl one night looking in upon the roosting hens in a poultryhouse dont see how i am to find my way back to my hollow tree  there is no necessity replied the cock you can roost there alongside the door and go home in the morning  thanks said the owl chuckling at the fools simplicity and having plenty of time to indulge his facetious humour he gravely installed himself upon the perch indicated and shutting his eyes counterfeited a profound slumber he was aroused soon after by a sharp constriction of the throat  i omitted to tell you said the cock that the seat you happen by the merest chance to occupy is a contested one and has been fruitful of hens to this vexatious weasel i dont know how often i have been partially widowed by the sneaking villain  for obvious reasons there was no audible

ungainly gambols in the spring sunshine suddenly assumed a severe gravity of gait and a sedate solemnity of expression that would have been creditable to a brahmin  fine morning said the horse who fired by her example was curvetting lithely and tossing his head  that rather uninteresting fact replied the cow attending strictly to her business as a ruminant does not impress me as justifying your execution of all manner of unseemly contortions as a preliminary to accosting an entire stranger  well nno stammered the horse ii suppose not fact is iino offence i hope  and the unhappy charger

dont know of course you have heard that i am a great friend to the dear little mice  illustration  yes was the answer i have heard that you love us indifferently well and my mission here was to bless you while you slept but as you will wish to go and get your breakfast i wont bore you fine morningisnt it au revoir  this fable teaches that it is usually safe to avoid one who pretends to be a friend without having any reason to be it wasnt safe in this instance however for the cat went after that departing rodent and got away with him     lxvii   a man pursued by a lion was about stepping into a place of safety when he bethought him of the power of the human eye and turning about he fixed upon his pursuer a steady look of stern reproof the raging beast immediately moderated his rate per hour

conventionalities  a light dawned upon the intellect of that pismire he shook the reefs out of his legs he scratched the reverse of his ear he grappled that cereal and trotted away like a giant

was so overcome by the warmth of his own body that he fell asleep and did not wake until nightfall in the darkness he was unable to find his head or his tail and so could not disentangle and slide

persia had a favourite hawk one day his majesty was hunting and had become separated from his attendants feeling thirsty he sought a stream of water trickling from a rock took a cup and pouring some liquor into it from his pocketflask filled it up with water and raised it to his lips the hawk who had been all this time hovering about swooped down screaming no you dont and upset the cup with his wing  i know what is the matter said the king there is a dead serpent in the fountain above and this faithful bird has saved my life by not permitting me to drink the juice i must reward him in the regular way  so he called a page who had thoughtfully presented himself and gave directions to have the remorse apartments of the palace put in order and for the court tailor to prepare an evening suit of sackclothandashes then summoning the hawk he seized and dashed him to the ground killing him very dead rejoining his retinue he dispatched an officer to remove the body of the serpent from the fountain lest somebody else should get poisoned there wasnt any serpentthe water was remarkable for its wholesome purity  then the king cheated of his remorse was sorry he had slain the bird he said it was a needless waste of power to kill a bird who merely deserved killing it never occurred to the king that the hawks touching solicitude was with reference to the contents of the royal flask

his keeper thus  i say friend if you dont procure me a shorter cage i shall have to give up zoology it is about the most wearing pursuit i ever engaged in i favour the advancement of science but the mechanical part of it is a trifle severe and ought to be done by contract  you are quite right my hearty said the keeper it is severe and there have been several excellent plans proposed to lighten the drudgery pending the adoption of some of them you would find a partial relief in lying down and keeping quiet  it wont doit wont do replied the bear with a mournful shake of the head its not the orthodox thing inaction may do for professors collectors and others connected with the ornamental part of the noble science but for us we must keep moving or zoology would soon revert to the crude guesses and mistaken theories of the azoic period and yet continued the beast after the keeper had gone there is something novel and ingenious in what the underling suggests i must remember that and

adhering to his hull so defiled the water that it gave back no image of him after that whenever he left port he was careful to be well clayed along the waterline  the lesson of this is that if all

take to the water it was agreed among them that the bear should be lowered alongside the mouse who was to act as pilot should embark upon him at once to beat off the drowning sailors and the monkey

enables me  perhaps mused the ungrateful pachyderm if we could not reach the higher branches we should develop a taste for the lower ones  in any case was the rejoinder we can never be sufficiently thankful that we are unlike the lowly hippopotamus who can reach neither the one nor the other  ah yes the elephant assented there does not seem to have been enough of natures kindness to go round

anothers hunting grounds of everything edible there remains no grievance to quarrel about you are a good fellow let us embrace  they did so with the utmost heartiness which being observed by a contiguous monkey that animal got up a tree where he delivered himself of the wisdom following  there is nothing so touching as these expressions of mutual regard between animals who are vulgarly

endeavoured for some time to reconcile the two theories but the worms ate my acorns and then would not come out since then i have left science to work out its own problems while i work out the holes i hope the final decision may be in some way advantageous to me for at my nest i have a number of prepared holes which i can hammer into some suitable tree at a moments notice perhaps i could insert a

a yawning hippopotamus  what is too bad inquired the quadruped what is the matter with you  oh i never complain was the reply i was only thinking of the niggard economy of nature in building a great big beast like you and not giving him any mouth  hm hm it was still worse mused the beast to construct a great wit like you and give him no seasonable occasion for the display of his cleverness  a

so fatigued that he began to leap less and think more suddenly an obvious method of surmounting the difficulty presented itself to the salmonic intelligence  strange he soliloquized as well as he could in the watervery strange i did not think of it before ill go above the fall and leap downwards  so he went out on the bank walked round to the upper side of the fall and found he could leap over

cannot tell you answered the critic shaking his head despondingly i do not at all understand it i can only say that i have been accustomed to censure all discourse that differs from my own  exactly said the ass you have sought to make an art of impertinence by mistaking preferences for principles in taste you have invented a word incapable of definition to denote an idea impossible of expression and by employing in connection therewith the words good and bad you indicate a merely subjective process in terms of an objective quality such presumption transcends the limit of the merely impudent

  divers tales     the grateful bear   i hope all my little readers have heard the story of mr androcles and the lion so i will relate it as nearly as i can remember it with the caution that androcles must not be confounded with the lion if i had a picture representing androcles with a silk hat and the lion with a knot in his tail the two might readily be distinguished but the artist says he wont make any such picture and we must try to get on without  one day androcles was gathering truffles in a forest when he found a lions den and walking into it he lay down and slept it was a custom in his time to sleep in lions dens when practicable the lion was absent inspecting a zoological garden and did not return until late but he did return he was surprised to find a stranger in his menagerie without a ticket but supposing him to be some contributor to a comic paper did not eat him he was very well satisfied not to be eaten by him presently androcles awoke wishing he had some seltzer water or something seltzer water is good after a nights debauch and somethingit is difficult to say whatis good to begin the new debauch with seeing the lion eyeing him he began hastily to pencil his last will and testament upon the rocky floor of the den what was his surprise to see the lion advance amicably and extend his right forefoot androcles however was equal to the occasion he met the friendly overture with a cordial grasp of the hand whereat the lion howledfor he had a carpettack in his foot perceiving that he had made a little mistake androcles made such reparation as was in his power by pulling out the tack and putting it in his own foot  after this the beast could not do too much for him he went out every morningcarefully locking the door behind himand returned every evening bringing in a nice fat baby from an adjacent village and laying it gratefully at his benefactors feet for the first few days something seemed to have gone wrong with the benefactors appetite but presently he took very kindly to the new diet and as he could not get away he lodged there rentfree all the days of his lifewhich terminated very abruptly one evening when the lion had not met with his usual success in hunting  all this has very little to do with my story i throw it in as a classical allusion to meet the demands of a literary fashion which has its origin in the generous eagerness of writers to give the public more than it pays for but the story of androcles was a favourite with the bear whose adventures i am about to relate  one day this crafty brute carefully inserted a thorn between two of his toes and limped awkwardly to the farmhouse of dame pinworthy a widow who with two beautiful whelps infested the forest where he resided he knocked at the open door sent in his card and was duly admitted to the presence of the lady who inquired his purpose by way of defining his position he held up his foot and snuffled very dolorously the lady adjusted her spectacles took the paw in her lap she too had heard the tale of androcles and after a close scrutiny discovered the thorn which as delicately as possible she extracted the patient making wry faces and howling dismally the while  illustration  when it was all over and she had assured him there was no charge his gratitude was a passion to observe he desired to embrace her at once but this although a widow of seven years standing she would by no means permit she said she was not personally averse to hugging but what would her dear departedboohoosay of it this was very absurd for mr boohoo had seven feet of solid earth above him and it couldnt make much difference what he said even supposing he had enough tongue left to say anything which he had not however the polite beast respected her scruples so the only way in which he could testify his gratitude was by remaining to dinner they had the housedog for dinner that day though from some false notion of hospitable etiquette the woman and children did not take any  on the next day punctually at the same hour the bear came again with another thorn and stayed to dinner as before it was not much of a dinner this timeonly the cat and a roll of staircarpet with one or two pieces of sheet music but true gratitude does not despise even the humblest means of expression the succeeding day he came as before but after being relieved of his torment he found nothing prepared for him but when he took to thoughtfully licking one of the little girls hands that answered not with a caress the mother thought better of it and drove in a small heifer  he now came every day he was so old a friend that the formality of extracting the thorn was no longer observed it would have contributed nothing to the good understanding that existed between him and the widow he thought that three or four instances of good samaritanism afforded ample matter for perpetual gratitude his constant visits were bad for the live stock of the farm for some kind of beast had to be in readiness each day to furnish forth the usual feast and this prevented multiplication most of the textile fabrics too had disappeared for the appetite of this animal was at the same time cosmopolitan and exacting it would accept almost anything in the way of entremets but something it would have a hearthrug a hallmat a cushion mattress blanket shawl or other article of wearing apparelanything in short that was easy of ingestion was graciously approved the widow tried him once with a box of coals as dessert to some barnyard fowls but this he seemed to regard as a doubtful comestible seductive to the palate but obstinate in the stomach a look at one of the children always brought him something else no matter what he was then engaged on  it was suggested to mrs pinworthy that she should poison the bear but after trying about a hundredweight of strychnia arsenic and prussic acid without any effect other than what might be expected from mild tonics she thought it would not be right to go into toxicology so the poor widow pinworthy went on patiently enduring the consumption of her cattle sheep and hogs the evaporation of her poultry and the taking off of her bed linen until there were left only the clothing of herself and children some curtains a sickly lamb and a pet pigeon when the bear came for these she ventured to expostulate in this she was perfectly successful the animal permitted her to expostulate as long as she liked then he ate the lamb and pigeon took in a dishcloth or two and went away just as contentedly as if she had not uttered a word  nothing edible now stood between her little daughters and the grave her mental agony was painful to her mind she could scarcely have suffered more without an increase of unhappiness she was roused to desperation and next day when she saw the bear leaping across the fields toward the house she staggered from her seat and shut the door it was singular what a difference it made she always remembered it after that and wished she had thought of it before                                          the setting sachem     twas an injin chieftain in

decomposition in a modest wayside cottage in thuringia she was an excellent sample of the thuringian widow a species not yet extinct but trying very hard to become so the same may be said of the whole genus madame yonsmit was quite young very comely cultivated gracious and pleasing her home was a nest of domestic virtues but she had a daughter who reflected but little credit upon the nest feodora was indeed a bad egga very wicked and ungrateful egg you could see she was by her face the girl had the most vicious countenanceit was repulsive it was a face in which boldness struggled for the supremacy with cunning and both were thrashed into subjection by avarice it was this latter virtue in feodora which kept her mother from having a taxable income  feodoras business was to beg on the highway it wrung the heart of the honest amiable gentlewoman to have her daughter do this but the hag having been reared in luxury considered labour degradingwhich it isand there was not much to steal in that part of thuringia feodoras mendicity would have provided an ample fund for their support but unhappily that ingrate would hardly ever fetch home more than two or three shillings at a time goodness knows what she did with the rest  vainly the good woman pointed out the sin of coveteousness vainly she would stand at the cottage door awaiting the childs return and begin arguing the point with her the moment she came in sight the receipts diminished daily until the average was less than tenpencea sum upon which no born gentlewoman would deign to exist so it became a matter of some importance to know where feodora kept her banking account madame yonsmit thought at first she would follow her and see but although the good lady was as vigorous and sprightly as ever carrying a crutch more for ornament than use she abandoned this plan because it did not seem suitable to the dignity of a decayed gentlewoman she employed a detective  the foregoing particulars i have from madame yonsmit herself for those immediately subjoining i am indebted to the detective a skilful officer named bowstr  illustration  no sooner had the scraggy old hag communicated her suspicions than the officer knew exactly what to do he first distributed handbills all over the country stating that a certain person suspected of concealing money had better look sharp he then went to the home secretary and by not seeking to understate the real difficulties of the case induced that functionary to offer a reward of a thousand pounds for the arrest of the malefactor next he proceeded to a distant town and took into custody a clergyman who resembled feodora in respect of wearing shoes after these formal preliminaries he took up the case with some zeal he was not at all actuated by a desire to obtain the reward but by pure love of justice the thought of securing the girls private hoard for himself never for a moment entered his head  he began to make frequent calls at the widows cottage when feodora was at home when by apparently careless conversation he would endeavour to draw her out but he was commonly frustrated by her old beast of a mother who when the girls answers did not suit would beat her unmercifully so he took to meeting feodora on the highway and giving her coppers carefully marked for months he kept this up with wonderful selfsacrificethe girl being a mere uninteresting angel he met her daily in the roads and forest his patience never wearied his vigilance never flagged her most careless glances were conscientiously noted her lightest words treasured up in his memory meanwhile the clergyman having been unjustly acquitted he arrested everybody he could get his hands on matters went on in this way until it was time for the grand coup  the succeedingparticulars i have from the lips of feodora herself  when that horrid bowstr first came to the house feodora thought he was rather impudent but said little about it to her mothernot desiring to have her back broken she merely avoided him as much as she dared he was so frightfully ugly but she managed to endure him until he took to waylaying her on the highway hanging about her all day interfering with the customers and walking home with her at night then her dislike deepened into disgust and but for apprehensions not wholly unconnected with a certain crutch she would have sent him about his business in short order more than a thousand million times she told him to be off and leave her alone but men are such foolsparticularly this one  what made bowstr exceptionally disagreeable was his shameless habit of making fun of feodoras mother whom he declared crazy as a loon but the maiden bore everything as well as she could until one day the nasty thing put his arm about her waist and kissed her before her very face then she feltwell it is not clear how she felt but of one thing she was quite sure after having such a shame put upon her by this insolent brute she would never go back under her dear mothers roofnever she was too proud for that at any rate so she ran away with mr bowstr and married him  the conclusion of this history i learned for myself  upon hearing of her daughters desertion madame yonsmit went clean daft she vowed she could bear betrayal could endure decay could stand being a widow would not repine at being left alone in her old age whenever she should become old and could patiently submit to the sharper than a serpents thanks of having a toothless child generally but to be a motherinlaw no no that was a plane of degradation to which she positively would not descend so she employed me to cut her throat it was the toughest throat i ever cut in all my life                                          the legend of immortal truth     a bear

banking too he was addicted to such frequent runs upon the institution with a hatchet that it kept his parents honourably poor to purchase banks for him so they were reluctantly compelled to discourage the depositing element in his panicky nature  johnny was not above work either to him the dignity of labour was not a juiceless platitude as it is to me but a living nourishing truth as satisfying and wholesome as that two sides of a triangle are equal to one side of bacon he would hold horses for gentlemen who desired to step into a bar to inquire for letters he would pursue the fleeting pig at the behest of a drover he would carry water to the lions of a travelling menagerie or do anything for gain he was sharpwitted too before conveying a drop of comfort to the parching king of beasts he would stipulate for sixpence instead of the usual free ticketor tasting order so to speak he cared not a button for the show  the first hard work johnny did of a morning was to look over the house for fugitive pins needles hairpins matches and other unconsidered trifles and if he sometimes found these where nobody had lost them he made such reparation as was in his power by losing them again where nobody but he could find them in the course of time when he had garnered a good many he would realize and bank the proceeds  nor was he weakly superstitious this johnny you could not fool him with the santa claus hoax on christmas eve he would lie awake all night as sceptical as a priest and along toward morning getting quietly out of bed would examine the pendent stockings of the other children to satisfy himself the predicted presents were not there and in the morning it always turned out that they were not then when the other children cried because they did not get anything and the parents affected surprise as if they really believed in the venerable fiction johnny was too manly to utter a whimper he would simply slip out of the back door and engage in traffic with affluent orphans disposing of woolly horses tin whistles marbles tops dolls and sugar archangels at a ruinous discount for cash he continued these provident courses for nine long years always banking his accretions with scrupulous care everybody predicted he would one day be a merchant prince or a railway king and some added he would sell his crown to the junkdealers  his unthrifty brother meanwhile kept growing worse and worse he was so careless of wealthso so wastefully extravagant of lucrethat johnny felt it his duty at times to clandestinely assume control of the fraternal finances lest the habit of squandering should wreck the fraternal moral sense it was plain that charles had entered upon the broad road which leads from the cradle to the workhouseand that he rather liked the travelling so profuse was his prodigality that there were grave suspicions as to his method of acquiring what he so openly disbursed there was but one opinion as to the melancholy termination of his careera termination which he seemed to regard as eminently desirable but one day when the good pastor put it at him in so many words charles gave token of some apprehension  do you really think so sir said he thoughtfully aint you playin it on me  i assure you charles said the good man catching a ray of hope from the boys dawning seriousness you will certainly end your days in a workhouse unless you speedily abandon your course of extravagance there is nothing like habitnothing  charles may have thought that considering his frequent and lavish contributions to the missionary fund the parson was rather hard upon him but he did not say so he went away in mournful silence and began pelting a blind beggar with coppers  one day when johnny had been more than usually provident and charles proportionately prodigal their father having exhausted moral suasion to no apparent purpose determined to have recourse to a lower order of argument he would try to win charles to economy by an appeal to his grosser nature so he convened the entire family and  johnny said he do you think you have much money in your bank you ought to have saved a considerable sum in nine years  johnny took the alarm in a minute perhaps there was some barefooted little girl to be endowed with sundayschool books  no he answered reflectively i dont think there can be much theres been a good deal of cold weather this winter and you know how metal shrinks nooo im sure there cant be only a little  well johnny you go up and bring down your bank well see perhaps charles may be right after all and its not worth while to save money i dont want a son of mine to get into a bad habit unless it pays  so johnny travelled reluctantly up to his garret and went to the corner where his big tin bankbox had sat on a chest undisturbed for years he had long ago fortified himself against temptation by vowing never to even shake it for he remembered that formerly when charles used to shake his and rattle the coins inside he always ended by smashing in the roof johnny approached his bank and taking hold of the cornice on either side braced himself gave a strong lift upwards and keeled over upon his back with the edifice atop of him like one of the figures in a picture of the great lisbon earthquake there was but a single coin in it and that by an ingenious device was suspended in the centre so that every piece popped in at the chimney would clink upon it in passing through charlies little hole into charlies little stocking hanging innocently beneath  of course restitution was out of the question and even johnny felt that any merely temporal punishment would be weakly inadequate to the demands of justice but that night in the dead silence of his chamber johnny registered a great and solemn swear that so soon as he could worry together a little capital he would fling his feeble remaining energies into the spendthrift business and he did so                                          four jacks and a knave   in the backwoods of pennsylvania stood a little mill the miller appertaining unto this mill was a pennsylvania dutchmana species of animal in which for some centuries sauerkraut has been usurping the place of sense in hans donnerspiel the usurpation was not complete he still knew enough to go in when it rained but he did not know enough to stay there after the storm had blown over hans was known to a large circle of friends and admirers as about the worst miller in those parts but as he was the only one people who quarrelled with an exclusively meat diet continued to patronize him he was honest as all stupid people are but he was careless so absentminded was he that sometimes when grinding somebodys wheat he would thoughtlessly turn into the hopper a bag of rye a lot of old beerbottles or a basket of fish this made the flour so peculiar that the people about there never knew what it was to be well a day in all their lives there were so many local diseases in that vicinity that a doctor from twenty miles away could not have killed a patient in a week  hans meant well but he had a hobbya hobby that he did not ride that does not express it it rode him it spurred him so hard that the poor wretch could not pause a minute to see what he was putting into his mill this hobby was the purchase of jackasses he expended all his income in this diversion and his mill was fairly sinking under its weight of mortgages he had more jackasses than he had hairs on his head and as a rule they were thinner he was no mere amateur collector either but a sharp discriminating connoisseur he would buy a fat globular donkey if he could not do better but a lank shabby one was the apple of his eye he rolled such a one as it were like a sweet morsel under his tongue  hanss nearest neighbour was a worthless young scamp named jo garvey who lived mainly by hunting and fishing jo was a sharpwitted rascal without a single scruple between himself and fortune with a tithe of hanss industry he might have been almost anything but his dense laziness always rose up like a stone wall about him shutting him in like a toad in a rock the exact opposite of hans in almost every respect he was notably similar in one he had a hobby jos hobby was the selling of jackasses  one day while hanss upper and nether millstones were making it lively for a mingled grist of corn potatoes and young chickens he heard joseph calling outside stepping to the door he saw him holding three halters to which were appended three donkeys  i say hans said he here are three fine animals for your stud i have brought em up from the egg and i know em to be firstclass but they re not so big as i expected and you may have em for a sack of oats each  hans was delighted he had not the least doubt in the world that joe had stolen them but it was a fixed principle with him never to let a donkey go away and say he was a hard man to deal with he at once brought out and delivered the oats jo gravely examined the quality and placing a sack across each animal calmly led them away  illustration  when he had gone it occurred to hans that he had less oats and no more asses than he had before  tuyfel he exclaimed scratching his pow i puy dot yackasses und i dont vos god im so mooch as i didnt haf im beforeaint it  very much to his comfort it was therefore to see jo come by next day leading the same animals  hi he shrieked you prings me to my yackasses you gif me to my broberdy back  oh very well hans if you want to crawfish out of a fair bargain all right ill give you back your donkeys and you give me back my oats  yaw yaw assented the mollified miller you his von honest shentlemans as i vos efer vent anyvhere but i dont god ony more oats und you moost dake vheat eh  and fetching out three sacks of wheat he handed them over jo was proceeding to lay these upon the backs of the animals but this was too thin for even hans  ach you tiefveller you leabs dis yackasses in me und go right avay off odther i bust your het mid a gloob dont it  so joseph was reluctantly constrained to hang the donkeys to a fence while he did this hans was making a desperate attempt to think presently he brightened up  yo how you coom by dot vheat all de dime  why old mudhead you gave it to me for the jacks  und how you coom by dot oats pooty soon avhile ago  why i gave that to you for them said joseph pressed very hard for a reply  vell den you goes vetch me back to dot oats so gwicker as a lamb gedwinkle his dailhay  all right hans lend me the donkeys to carry off my wheat and i ll bring back your oats on em  joseph was beginning to despair but no objection being made he loaded up the grain and made off with his docile caravan in a halfhour he returned with the donkeys but of course without anything else  i zay yo where is dis oats i hear zo mooch dalk aboud still  oh curse you and your oats growled jo with simulated anger you make such a fuss about a bargain i have decided not to trade take your old donkeys and call it square  den vhere mine vheat is  now look here hans that wheat is yours is it  yaw yaw  and the donkeys are yours eh  yaw yaw  and the wheats been yours all the time has it  yaw yaw  well so have the donkeys i took em out of your pasture in the first place now what have you got to complain of  the dutchman reflected all over his head with his forefingernail  gomblain i no gomblain ven it is all right i zee now i vos made a mistaken coom dake a drinks  jo left the animals standing and went inside where they pledged one another in brimming mugs of beer then taking hans by the hand  i am sorry said he we cant trade perhaps some other day you will be more reasonable good bye  and joseph departed leading away the donkeys  hans stood for some moments gazing after him with a complacent smile making his fat face ridiculous then turning to his millstones he shook his head with an air of intense selfsatisfaction  py donner dot yo garfey bees a geen shmard yockey but he gonnot spiel me svoppin yackasses                                          dr deadwood i presume   my name is shandy and this is the record of my sentimental journey mr ames jordan gannett proprietors son of the york with which paper i am connected by marriage sent me a postcard in a sealed envelope asking me to call at a wellknown restaurant in regent street i was then at a wellknown restaurant in houndsditch i put on my worst and only hat and went i found mr gannett at dinner eating pease with his knife in the manner of his countrymen he opened the conversation characteristically thus  wheres dr deadwood  after several ineffectual guesses i had a happy thought i asked him  am i my brothers barkeeper  mr gannett pondered deeply with his forefinger alongside his nose finally he replied  i give it up  he continued to eat for some moments in profound silence as that of a man very much in earnest suddenly he resumed  here is a blank cheque signed i will send you all my fathers personal property tomorrow take this and find dr deadwood find him actually if you can but find him away  i did as requested that is i took the cheque having supplied myself with such luxuries as were absolutely necessary i retired to my lodgings upon my table in the centre of the room were spread some clean white sheets of foolscap and sat a bottle of black ink it was a good omen the virgin paper was typical of the unexplored interior of africa the sable ink represented the night of barbarism or the hue of barbarians indifferently  now began the most arduous undertaking mentioned in the york i mean in history lighting my pipe and fixing my eye upon the ink and paper i put my hands behind my back and took my departure from the hearthrug toward the interior language fails me i throw myself upon the readers imagination before i had taken two steps my vision alighted upon the circular of a quack physician which i had brought home the day before around a bottle of hairwash i now saw the words twentyone fevers this prostrated me for i know not how long recovering i took a step forward when my eyes fastened themselves upon my penwiper worked into the similitude of a tiger this compelled me to retreat to the hearthrug for reinforcements the redandwhite dog displayed upon that article turned a deaf ear to my entreaties nothing would move him  a torrent of rain now began falling outside and i knew the roads were impassable but chafing with impatience i resolved upon another advance cautiously proceeding viâ the sofa my attention fell upon a scrap of newspaper and to my unspeakable disappointment i read  the various tribes of the interior are engaged in a bitter warfare  it may have related to america but i could not afford to hazard all upon a guess i made a wide détour by way of the coalscuttle and skirted painfully along the sideboard all this consumed so much time that my pipe expired in gloom and i went back to the hearthrug to get a match off the chimneypiece having done so i stepped over to the table and sat down taking up the pen and spreading the paper between myself and the inkbottle it was late and something must be done writing the familiar word ujijijijijiji i caught a neighbourly cockroach skewered him upon a pin and fastened him in the centre of the word at this supreme moment i felt inclined to fall upon his neck and devour him with kisses but knowing by experience that cockroaches are not good to eat i restrained my feelings lifting my hat i said  dr deadwood i presume  he did not deny it  seeing he was feeling sick i gave him a bit of cheese and cheered him up a trifle after he was well restored  tell me said i is it true that the regents canal falls into lake michigan thence running uphill to omaha as related by ptolemy thence spirally to melbourne where it joins the delta of the ganges and becomes an affluent of the albert nicaragua as herodotus maintains  he did not deny it  the rest is known to the public                                          nutcracking   in the city of algammon resided the prince champou who was madly enamoured of the lady capilla she returned his affectionunopened  in the matter of backhair the lady capilla was blessed even beyond her deserts her natural pigtail was so intolerably long that she employed two pages to look after it when she walked out the one a few yards behind her the other at the extreme end of the line their names were dan and beersheba respectively  illustration  aside from salaries to these dependents and quite apart from the consideration of macassar the possession of all this animal filament was financially unprofitable the hair market was buoyant and hers represented a large amount of idle capital and it was otherwise a source of annoyance and irritation for all the young men of the city were hotly in love with her and skirmishing for a lovelock they seldom troubled dan much but the outlying beersheba had an animated time of it he was subject to constant incursions and was always in a riot  the picture i have drawn to illustrate this history shows nothing of all these squabbles my pen revels in the battles din but my peaceful pencil loves to depict the scenes i know something about  although the lady capilla was unwilling to reciprocate the passion of champou the man she was not averse to quiet interviews with champou the prince in the course of one of these see my picture as she sat listening to his carefullyrehearsed and really artistic avowals with her tail hanging out of the window she suddenly interrupted him  my dear prince said she it is all nonsense you know to ask for my heart but i am not mean you shall have a lock of my hair  do you think replied the prince that i could be so sordid as to accept a single jewel from that glorious crown i love this hair of yours very dearly i admit but only because of its connection with your divine head sever that connection and i should value it no more than i would a tail plucked from its native cow  this comparison seems to me a very fine one but tastes differ and to the lady capilla it seemed quite the reverse rising indignantly she marched away her queue running in through the window and gradually tapering off the interview as it were prince champou saw that he had missed his opportunity and resolved to repair his error straightway he forged an order on beersheba for thirty yards of lovelock to serve this writ he sent his business partner for the prince was wont to beguile his dragging leisure by tonsorial diversions in an obscure quarter of the town at first beersheba was sceptical but when he saw the writing in real ink his scruples vanished and he chopped off the amount of souvenir demanded  now champous partner was the court barber and by the use of a peculiar hair oil which the two of them had concocted they soon managed to balden the pates of all the male aristocracy of the place then to supply the demand so created they devised beautiful wigs from the lady capillas lost tresses which they sold at a marvellous profit and so they were enabled to retire from this narrative with good incomes  it was known that the lady capilla who since the alleged murder of one beersheba had shut herself up like a hermit or a jackknife would reenter society and a great ball was given to do her honour the feauty bank and rashion of algammon had assembled in the guildhall for that purpose while the revelry was at its fiercest the dancing at its loosest the rooms at their hottest and the perspiration at springtide there was a sound of wheels outside begetting an instant hush of expectation within the dancers ceased to spin and all the gentlemen crowded about the door as the lady capilla entered these instinctively fell into two lines and she passed down the space between with her little tail behind her as the end of the latter came into the room the wigs of the two gentlemen nearest the door leaped off to join their parent stem in their haste to recover them the two gentlemen bent eagerly forward knocking their shining pows together with a vehemence that shattered them like eggshells the wigs of the next pair were similarly affected and in seeking to recover them the pair similarly perished then crack spat pashat every step the lady took there were two heads that beat as one in three minutes there was but a single living male in the room he was an odd one who having a lady opposite him had merely pitched himself headlong into her stomach doubling her like a lemonsqueezer  it was merry to see the lady capilla floating through the mazy dance that night with all those wigs fighting for their old places in her pigtail                                          the magicians little joke   about the middle of the fifteenth century there dwelt in the black forest a pretty but unfashionable young maiden named simprella whiskiblote the first of these names was hers in monopoly the other she enjoyed in common with her father simprella was the most beautiful fifteenthcentury girl i ever saw she had coloured eyes a complexion some hair and two lips very nearly alike which partially covered a lot of teeth she was gifted with the complement of legs commonly worn at that period supporting a body to which were loosely attached in the manner of her country as many arms as she had any use for inasmuch as she was not required to hold baby but all these charms were only so many objective points for the operations of the paternal cudgel for this father of hers was a hard unfeeling man who had no bowels of compassion for his bludgeon he would put it to work early and keep it going all day and when it was worn out with hard service instead of rewarding it with steady employment he would cruelly throw it aside and get a fresh one it is scarcely to be wondered at that a girl harried in this way should be driven to the insane expedient of falling in love  near the neat mud cottage in which simprella vegetated was a dense wood extending for miles in various directions according to the point from which it was viewed by a method readily understood it had been so arranged that it was the next easiest thing in the world to get into it and the very easiest thing in the world to stay there  in the centre of this labyrinth was a castle of the early promiscuous order of architecturean order which was until recently much employed in the construction of powderworks but is now entirely exploded in this baronial hall lived an eligible single partya giant so tall he used a stepladder to put on his hat and could not put his hands into his pockets without kneeling he lived entirely alone and gave himself up to the practice of iniquity devising prohibitory liquor laws imposing the income tax and drinking shilling claret but seeing simprella one day he bent himself into the form of a horseshoe magnet to look into her eyes whether it was his magnetic attitude acting upon a young heart steeled by adversity or his chivalric forbearance in not eating her i know not i only know that from that moment she became riotously enamoured of him and the reader may accept either the scientific or the popular explanation according to the bent of his mind  she at once asked the giant in marriage and obtained the consent of his parents by betraying her father into their hands explaining to them however that he was not good to eat but might be drunk on the premises  the marriage proved a very happy one but the household duties of the bride were extremely irksome it fatigued her to dress the beeves for dinner it nearly broke her back to black her lords boots without any scaffolding it took her all day to perform any kindly little office for him but she bore it all uncomplainingly until one morning he asked her to part his back hair then the bent sapling of her spirit flew up and hit him in the face she gathered up some french novels and retired to a lonely tower to breathe out her soul in unavailing regrets  one day she saw below her in the forest a dear gazelle gladding her with its soft black eye she leaned out of the window and said scat the animal did not move then she waved her armsabove describedand said shew this time he did not move as much as he did before simprella decided he must have a bill against her so she closed her shutters drew down the blind and pinned the curtains together a moment later she opened them and peeped out then she went down to examine his collar that she might order one like it  when the gazelle saw simprella approach he arose and beckoning with his tail made off slowly into the wood then simprella perceived this was a supernatural gazellea variety now extinct but which then pervaded the schwarzwald in considerable quantitysent by some good magician who owed the giant a grudge to pilot her out of the forest nothing could exceed her joy at this discovery she whistled a dirge sang a latin hymn and preached a funeral discourse all in one breath such were the artless methods by which the full heart in the fifteenth century was compelled to express its gratitute for benefits the advertising columns of the daily papers were not then open to the benefactors pen  illustration  all would now have been well but for the fact that it was not in following her deliverer simprella observed that his golden collar was inscribed with the mystic wordshands off she tried hard to obey the injunction she did her level best shebut why amplify simprella was a woman  no sooner had her fingers touched the slender chain depending from the magic collar than the poor animals eyes emitted twin tears which coursed silently but firmly down his nose vacating it more in sorrow than in anger then he looked up reproachfully into her face those were his first tearsthis was his last look in two minutes by the watch he was blind as a mole  there is but little more to tell the giant ate himself to death the castle mouldered and crumbled into pigpens empires rose and fell kings ascended their thrones and got down again mountains grew grey and rivers baldheaded suits in chancery were brought and decided and those from the tailor were paid for the ages came like maiden aunts uninvited and lingered till they became a boreand still simprella with the magicians curse upon her conducted her sightless guide through the interminable wilderness  to all others the labyrinth had yielded up its clue the hunter threaded its maze the woodman plunged confidently into its innermost depths the peasant child gathered ferns unscared in its sunless dells but often the child abandoned his botany in terror the woodman bolted for home and the hunters heart went down into his boots at the sight of a fair young spectre leading a blind phantom through the silent glades i saw them there in 1860 while i was gunning i shot them     seafaring   my envious rivals have always sought to cast discredit upon the following tale by affirming that mere unadorned truth does not constitute a work of literary merit be it so i care not what they call it a rose with any other smell would be as sweet  in the autumn of 1868 i wanted to go from sacramento california to san francisco i at once went to the railway office and bought a ticket the clerk telling me that would take me there but when i tried it it wouldnt vainly i laid it on the railway and sat down upon it it would not move and every few minutes an engine would come along and crowd me off the track i never travelled by so badly managed a line  i then resolved to go by way of the river and took passage on a steamboat the engineer of this boat had once been a candidate for the state legislature while i was editing a newspaper stung to madness by the arguments i had advanced against his election which consisted mainly in relating how that his cousin was hanged for horsestealing and how that his sister had an intolerable squint which a free people could never abide he had sworn to be revenged after his defeat i had confessed the charges were false so far as he personally was concerned but this did not seem to appease him he declared he would get even on me and he did he blew up the boat  being thus summarily set ashore i determined that i would be independent of common carriers destitute of common courtesy i purchased a wooden box just large enough to admit one and not transferable i lay down in this doublelocked it on the outside and carrying it to the river launched it upon the watery waste the box i soon discovered had an hereditary tendency to turn over i had parted my hair in the middle before embarking but the precaution was inadequate it secured not immunity only impartiality the box turning over one way as readily as the other i could counteract this evil only by shifting my tobacco from cheek to cheek and in this way i got on tolerably well until my navy sprang a leak near the stern  i now began to wish i had not locked down the cover i could have got out and walked ashore but it was childish to give way to foolish regrets so i lay perfectly quiet and yelled presently i thought of my jackknife by this time the ship was so waterlogged as to be a little more stable this enabled me to get the knife from my pocket without upsetting more than six or eight times and inspired hope taking the whittle between my teeth i turned over upon my stomach and cut a hole through the bottom near the bow turning back again i awaited the result most men would have awaited the result i think if they could not have got out for some time there was no result the ship was too deeply laden astern where my feet were and water will not run up hill unless it is paid to do it but when i called in all my faculties for a good earnest think the weight of my intellect turned the scale it was like a cargo of piglead in the forecastle the water which for nearly an hour i had kept down by drinking it as it rose about my lips began to run out at the hole i had scuttled faster than it could be admitted at the one in the stern and in a few moments the bottom was so dry you might have lighted a match upon it if you had been there and obtained the captains permission  illustration  i was all right now i had got into san pablo bay where it was all plain sailing if i could manage to keep off the horizon i should be somewhere before daylight but a new annoyance was in store for me the steamboats on these waters are constructed of very frail materials and whenever one came into collision with my flotilla she immediately sank this was most exasperating for the piercing shrieks of the hapless crews and passengers prevented my getting any sleep such disagreeable voices as these people had would have tortured an ear of corn i felt as if i would like to step out and beat them softheaded with a club though of course i had not the heart to do so while the padlock held fast  the reader if he is obliging will remember that there was formerly an obstruction in the harbour of san francisco called blossom rock which was some fathoms under water but not fathoms enough to suit shipmasters it was removed by an engineer named von schmidt this person bored a hole in it and sent down some men who gnawed out the whole interior leaving the rock a mere shell into this drawingroom suite were inserted thirty tons of powder ten barrels of nitroglycerine and a womans temper von schmidt then put in something explosive and corked up the opening leaving a long wire hanging out when all these preparations were complete the inhabitants of san francisco came out to see the fun they perched thickly upon telegraph hill from base to summit they swarmed innumerable upon the beach the whole region was black with them all that day they waited and came again the next again they were disappointed and again they returned full of hope for three long weeks they did nothing but squat upon that eminence looking fixedly at the wrong place but when it transpired that von schmidt had hastily left the state directly he had completed his preparations leaving the wire floating in the water in the hope that some electrical eel might swim against it and ignite the explosives the people began to abate their ardour and move out of town they said it might be a good while before a qualified gymnotus would pass that way although the state ichthyologer assured them that he had put some eels eggs into the head waters of the sacramento river not two weeks previously but the country was very beautiful at that time of the year and the people would not wait so when the explosion really occurred there wasnt anybody in the vicinity to witness it it was a stupendous explosion all the same as the unhappy gymnotus discovered to his cost  now i have often thought that if this mighty convulsion had occurred a year or two earlier than it really did it would have been bad for me as i floated idly past unconscious of danger as it was my little bark was carried out into the broad pacific and sank in ten thousand fathoms of the coldest waterit makes my teeth chatter to relate it                                          tony rollos conclusion   to a degree unprecedented in the rollo family of illinois antony was an undutiful son he was so undutiful that he may be said to have been preposterous there were seven other sonsantony was the eldest his younger brothers were a nice wellbehaved bevy of boys as ever you saw they always attended sunday school regularly arriving just before the doxology i think sunday school exercises terminate that way and sitting in a solemn row on a fence outside waiting with pious patience for the girls to come forth then they walked home with them as far as their respective gates they were an obedient seven too they knew well enough the respect due to paternal authority and when their father told them what was what and which side up it ought to lie they never tarried until he had more than picked up a hickory cudgel before tacitly admitting the correctness of the riper judgment had the old gentleman commanded the digging of seven graves and the fabrication of seven board coffins to match these necessaries would have been provided with unquestioning alacrity  but antony i bleed to state was of an impractical pensive turn he despised industry scoffed at sundayschooling set up a private standard of morals and rebelled against natural authority he wouldnt be a dutiful sonnot for money he had no natural affections and loved nothing so well as to sit and think he was tolerably thoughtful all the time but with some farming implement in his hand he came out strong he has been known to take an axe between his knees and sit on a stump in a clearing all day wrapt in a single continuous meditation and when interrupted by the interposition of night or by the superposition of the paternal hickory he would resume the meditation next day precisely where he left off going on and on and on in one profound and inscrutable think it was a common remark in the neighbourhood that if tony rollo didnt let up hed think his ridiculous white head off and on divers occasions when the old mans hickory had fallen upon that fleecy globe with unusual ardour tony really did think it offuntil the continued pain convinced him it was there yet  you would like to know what tony was thinking of all these years that is what they all wanted to know but he didnt seem to tell when the subject was mentioned he would always try to get away and if he could not avoid a direct question he would blush and stammer in so distressing a confusion that the doctor forbade all allusion to the matter lest the young man should have a convulsion it was clear enough however that the subject of tonys meditation was more than average interestin as his father phrased it for sometimes he would give it so grave consideration that observers would double their anxiety about the safety of his head which he seemed in danger of snapping off with solemn nods and at other times he would laugh immoderately smiting his thigh or holding his sides in uncontrollable merriment but it went on without abatement and without any disclosure went on until his poor mothers curiosity had worried her grey hairs in sorrow to the grave went on until his father having worn out all the hickory saplings on the place had made a fair beginning upon the young oaks went on until all the seven brothers having married a sundayschool girl each had erected comfortable loghouses upon outlying corners of the fatherinlegal farms on and ever on until tony was forty years of age this appeared to be a turningpoint in tonys careerat this time a subtle change stole into his life affecting both his inner and his outer self he worked less than formerly and thought a good deal more  years afterwards when the fraternal seven were welltodo freeholders with clouds of progeny making their hearts light and their expenses heavywhen the old homestead was upgrown with rank brambles and the livestock long extinctwhen the aged father had so fallen into the sere and yellow leaf that he couldnt hit hard enough to hurttony the mere shadow of his former self sat one evening in the chimney corner thinking very hard indeed his father and three or four skeleton hounds were the only other persons present the old gentleman quietly shelling a peck of indian corn given by a grateful neighbour whose cow he had once pulled out of the mire and the hounds thinking how cheerfully they would have assisted him had nature kindly made them graminivorous suddenly tony spake  father said he looking straight across the top of the axehandle which he held between his knees as a mental stimulant father ive been thinking of something a good bit lately  jest thirtyfive years tony come next thanksgiving replied the old man promptly in a thin asthmatic falsetto i recollect your mother used to say it dated from the time your aunt hannah was here with the girls  yes father i think it may be a matter of thirtyfive years though it dont seem so long does it but ive been thinking harder for the last week or two and im going to speak out  unbounded amazement looked out at the old mans eyes his tongue utterly unprepared for the unexpected contingency refused its office a corncob imperfectly denuded dropped from his nerveless hand and was critically examined in turn by the gossamer dogs hoping against hope a smoking brand in the fireplace fell suddenly upon a bed of hot coals where lacking the fortitude of guatimozin it emitted a sputtering protest followed by a thin flame like a visible agony in the resulting light tonys haggard face shone competitively with a ruddy blush which spread over his entire scalp to the imminent danger of firing his flaxen hair  yes father he answered making a desperate clutch at calmness but losing his grip im going to make a clean breast of it this time for sure then you can do what you like about it  the paternal organ of speech found sufficient strength to grind out an intimation that the paternal ear was open for business  ive studied it all over father ive looked at it from every side ive been through it with a lantern and ive come to the conclusion that seeing as im the oldest its about time i was beginning to think of getting married                                          no charge for attendance   near the road leading from deutscherkirche to lagerhaus may be seen the ruins of a little cottage it never was a very pretentious pile but it has a history about the middle of the last century it was occupied by one heinrich schneider who was a small farmerso small a farmer his clothes wouldnt fit him without a good deal of takingin but heinrich schneider was young he had a wife howevermost small farmers have when young they were rather poor the farm was just large enough to keep them comfortably hungry  schneider was not literary in his taste his sole reading was an old dogseared copy of the arabian nights done into german and in that he read nothing but the story of aladdin and his wonderful lamp upon his five hundredth perusal of that he conceived a valuable idea he would rub his lamp and corral a genie so he put a thick leather glove on his right hand and went to the cupboard to get out the lamp he had no lamp but this disappointment which would have been instantly fatal to a more despondent man was only an agreeable stimulus to him he took out an old iron candlesnuffer and went to work upon that  now iron is very hard it requires more rubbing than any other metal i once chafed a genie out of an anvil but i was quite weary before i got him all out the slightest irritation of a leaden waterpipe would have fetched the same genie out of it like a rat from his hole but having planted all his poultry sown his potatoes and set out his wheat heinrich had the whole summer before him and he was patient he devoted all his time to compelling the attendance of the supernatural  when the autumn came the good wife reaped the chickens dug out the apples plucked the pigs and other cereals and a wonderfully abundant harvest it was schneiders crops had flourished amazingly that was because he did not worry them all summer with agricultural implements one evening when the produce had been stored heinrich sat at his fireside operating upon his candlesnuffer with the same simple faith as in the early spring suddenly there was a knock at the door and the expected genie put in an appearance his advent begot no little surprise in the good couple  he was a very substantial incarnation indeed of the supernatural about eight feet in length extremely fat thicklimbed illfavoured heavy of movement and generally unpretty he did not at first sight impress his new master any too favourably  however he was given a stool at the fireside and heinrich plied him with a multitude of questions where did he come from whom had he last served how did he like aladdin and did he think they should get on well to all these queries the genie returned evasive answers he was delphic to the verge of unintelligibility he would only nod mysteriously muttering beneath his breath in some unknown tongue probably arabicin which however his master thought he could distinguish the words roast and boiled with significant frequency this genie must have served last in the capacity of cook  illustration  this was a gratifying discovery for the next four months or so there would be nothing to do about the farm the slave could prepare the family meals during the winter and in the spring go regularly to work schneider was too shrewd to risk everything by extravagant demands all at once he remembered the rocs egg of the legend and thought he would proceed with caution so the good couple brought out their cooking utensils and by pantomime inducted the slave into the mystery of their use they showed him the larder the cellars the granary the chickencoops and everything he appeared interested and intelligent apprehended the salient points of the situation with marvellous ease and nodded like he would drop his big head offdid everything but talk  after this the frau prepared the evening meal the genie assisting very satisfactorily except that his notions of quantity were rather too liberal perhaps this was natural in one accustomed to palaces and courts when all was on the table by way of testing his slaves obedience heinrich sat down at the board and carelessly rubbed the candlesnuffer the genie was there in a second not only so but he fell upon the viands with an ardour and sincerity that were alarming in two minutes he had got away with everything on the table the rapidity with which that spirit crowded all manner of edibles into his neck was simply shocking  having finished his repast he stretched himself before the fire and went to sleep heinrich and barbara were depressed in spirit they sat up until nearly morning in silence waiting for the genie to vanish for the night but he did not perceptibly vanish any moreover he had not vanished next morning he had risen with the lark and was preparing breakfast having made his estimates upon a basis of most immoderate consumption to this he soon sat down with the same catholicity of appetite that had distinguished him the previous evening having bolted this preposterous breakfast he arrayed his fat face in a sable scowl beat his master with a stewpan stretched himself before the fire and again addressed himself to sleep over a furtive and clandestine meal in the larder heinrich and barbara confessed themselves thoroughly heartsick of the supernatural  i told you so said he depend upon it patient industry is a thousand per cent better than this invisible agency i will now take the fatal candlesnuffer a mile from here rub it real hard fling it aside and run away  but he didnt during the night ten feet of snow had fallen it lay all winter too  early the next spring there emerged from that cottage by the wayside the unstable framework of a man dragging through seas of melting snow a tottering female of dejected aspect forlorn crippled famishing and discouraged these melancholy relics held on their way until they came to a crossroads all leading to lagerhaus where they saw clinging to an upright post the tatter of an old placard it read as follows     lost strayed or stolen from herr schaackhofers grand    museum the celebrated patagonian giant ugolulah height 8 ft    2 in elegant figure handsome intelligent features    sprightly and vivacious in conversation of engaging address    temperate in diet harmless and tractable in disposition    answers to the nickname of fritz sneddeker any one returning    him to herr schaackhofer will receive seven thalers reward and    no questions asked  it was a tempting offer but they did not go back for the giant but he was afterwards discovered sleeping sweetly upon the hearthstone after a hearty meal of empty barrels and boxes being secured he was found to be too fat for egress by the door so the house was pulled down to let him out and that is how it happens to be in ruins now                                          pernickettys fright   sssssst  dan golby held up his hand to enjoin silence in a breath we were as quiet as mice then it came again borne upon the night wind from away somewhere in the darkness toward the mountains across miles of treeless plaina low dismal sobbing sound like the wail of a strangling child it was nothing but the howl of a wolf and a wolf is about the last thing a man who knows the cowardly beast would be afraid of but there was something so weird and unearthly in this cry between the silencessomething so bansheelike in its suggestion of the gravethat old mountaineers that we were and long familiar with it we felt an instinctive dreada dread which was not fear but only a sense of utter solitude and desolation there is no sound known to mortal ear that has in it so strange a power upon the imagination as the nighthowl of this wretched beast heard across the dreary wastes of the desert he disgraces  involuntarily we drew nearer together and some one of the party stirred the fire till it sent up a tall flame widening the black circle shutting us in on all sides again rose the faint far cry and was answered by one fainter and more far in the opposite quarter then another and yet another struck ina dozen a hundred all at once and in three minutes the whole invisible outer world seemed to consist mainly of wolves jangled out of tune by some convulsion of nature  about this time it was a pleasing study to watch the countenance of old nick this party had joined us at fort benton whither he had come on a steamboat up the missouri this was his maiden venture upon the plains and his habit of querulous faultfinding had on the first day out secured him the sobriquet of old pernicketty which the attrition of time had worn down to old nick he knew no more of wolves and other animals than a naturalist and he was now a trifle frightened he was crouching beside his saddle and kit listening with all his soul his hands suspended before him with divergent fingers his face ashy pale and his jaw hanging unconsidered below  suddenly dan golby who had been watching him with an amused smile assumed a grave aspect listened a moment very intently and remarked  boys if i didnt know those were wolves i should say wed better get out of this  eh exclaimed nick eagerly if you did not know they were wolves why what else and what worse could they be  well theres an innocent replied dan winking slyly at the rest of us why they might be injuns of course dont you know you old bummer that thats the way the red devils run a surprise party dont you know that when you hear a parcel of wolves letting on like that at night its a hundred to one they carry bows and arrows  here one or two old hunters on the opposite side of the fire who had not caught dans precautionary wink laughed goodhumouredly and made derisive comments at this dan seemed much vexed and getting up he strode over to them to argue it out it was surprising how easily they were brought round to his way of thinking  by this time old nick was thoroughly perturbed he fidgeted about examining his rifle and pistols tightened his belt and looked in the direction of his horse his anxiety became so painful that he did not attempt to conceal it upon our part we affected to partially share it one of us finally asked dan if he was quite sure they were wolves then dan listened a long time with his ear to the ground after which he said hesitatingly  well no theres no such thing as absolute certainty i suppose but i think theyre wolves still theres no harm in being ready for anythingalways well to be ready i suppose  nick needed nothing more he pounced upon his saddle and bridle slung them upon his mustang and had everything snug in less time than it takes to tell it the rest of the party were far too comfortable to cooperate with dan to any considerable extent we contented ourselves with making a show of examining our weapons all this time the wolves as is their way when attracted by firelight were closing in clamouring like a legion of fiends if nick had known that a single pistolshot would have sent them scampering away for dear life i presume he would have fired one as it was he had indian on the brain and just stood by his horse quaking till his teeth rattled like dice in a box  no pursued the implacable dan these cant be injuns for if they were we should perhaps hear an owl or two among them the chiefs sometimes hoot owlfashion just to let the rabble know theyre standing up to the work like men and to show where they are  toohoohoohoohooaw  it took us all by surprise nick made one spring and came down astride his sleepy mustang with force enough to have crushed a smaller beast we all rose to our feet except jerry hunker who was lying flat on his stomach with his head buried in his arms and whom we had thought sound asleep one look at him reassured us as to the owl business and we settled back each man pretending to his neighbour that he had got up merely for effect upon nick  that man was now a sight to see he sat in his saddle gesticulating wildly and imploring us to get ready he trembled like a jellyfish he took out his pistols cocked them and thrust them so back into the holsters without knowing what he was about he cocked his rifle holding it with the muzzle directed anywhere but principally our way grasped his bowieknife between his teeth and cut his tongue trying to talk spurred his nag into the fire and backed him out across our blankets and finally sat still utterly unnerved while we roared with the laughter we could no longer suppress  hwissss pft swt cheew bones of cæsar the arrows flitted and clipt amongst us like a flight of bats dan golby threw a doublesummersault alighting on his head dory durkee went smashing into the fire jerry hunker was pinned to the sod where he lay fast asleep such dodging and ducking and clawing about for weapons i never saw and such genuine indian yellingit chills my marrow to write of it  old nick vanished like a dream and long before we could find our tools and get to work we heard the desultory reports of his pistols exploding in his holsters as his pony measured off the darkness between us and safety  for some fifteen minutes we had tolerable warm work of it individually collectively and miscellaneously singlehanded and one against a dozen struggling with painted savages in the firelight and with one another in the dark shooting the living and stabbing the dead stampeding our horses and fighting them battling with anything that would battle and smashing our gunstocks on whatever would not  when all was donewhen we had renovated our fire collected our horses and got our dead into positionwe sat down to talk it over as we sat there cutting up our clothing for bandages digging the poisoned arrowheads out of our limbs readjusting our scalps or swapping them for such vagrant ones as there was nobody to identify we could not help smiling to think how we had frightened old nick dan golby who was sinking rapidly whispered that it was the one sweet memory he had to sustain and cheer him in crossing the dark river into everlasting f it is uncertain how dan would have finished that last word he may have meant felicityhe may have meant fire it is nobodys business                                          juniper   he was a dwarf was juniper about the time of his birth nature was executing a large order for prime giants and had need of all her materials juniper infested the wooded interior of norway and dwelt in a cavea miserable hole in which a blind bat in a condition of sempiternal torpor would have declined to hibernate rentfree juniper was such a feeble little wretch so inoffensive in his way of life so modest in his demeanour that every one was disposed to love him like a cousin there was not enough of him to love like a brother he too was inclined to return the affection he was too weak to love very hard but he made the best stagger at it he could but a singular fatality prevented a perfect communion of soul between him and his neighbours a strange destiny had thrown its shadow upon him which made it cool for him in summer there was a divinity that shaped his ends extremely rough no matter how he hewed them  somewhere in that vicinity lived a monstrous beara great hulking obnoxious beast who had no more soul than tail this rascal had somehow conceived a notion that the appointed function of his existence was the extermination of the dwarf if you met the latter you might rely with cheerful confidence upon seeing the ferocious brute in eager pursuit of him in less than a minute no sooner would juniper fairly accost you looking timidly over his shoulder the while than the raging savage would leap out of some contiguous jungle and make after him like a locomotive engine too late for the train then poor juniper would streak it for the nearest crowd of people diving and dodging amongst their shins with nimble skill shrieking all the time like a panther he was as earnest about it as if he had made a bet upon the result of the race of course everybody was too busy to stop but in his blind terror the dwarf would single out some luckless wightcommonly some welldressed person juniper instinctively sought the protection of the aristocracygetting behind him ducking between his legs surrounding him dancing through himdoing anything to save the paltry flitch of his own bacon presently the bear would lose all patience and nip the other fellow then ashamed of losing his temper he would sneak sullenly away taking along the body when he had gone poor juniper would fall upon his knees tearing his beard pounding his breast and crying mea culpa in deep remorse afterwards he would pay a visit of condolence to the bereaved relations and offer to pay the funeral expenses but of course there never were any funeral expenses everybody as before stated liked the unhappy dwarf but nobody liked the company he kept and people were not at home to him as a rule whenever he came into a village traffic was temporarily suspended and he was made the centre of as broad a solitude as could be hastily improvised  many were the attempts to capture the terrible beast hundreds of the country people would assemble to hunt him with guns and dogs but even the dogs seemed to have an instinctive sense of some occult connection between him and the dwarf and could never be made to understand that it was the former that was wanted directly they were laid on the scent they would forsake it to invest the dwarfs abode and it was with much difficulty the pitying huntsmen could induce them to raise the siege things went on in this unsatisfactory fashion for years the population annually decreasing and juniper making the most miraculous escapes  now there resided in a small village near by a brace of twins little orphan girls named jalap and ginseng their considerate neighbours had told them such pleasing tales about the bear that they decided to leave the country so they got their valuables together in a box and set out they met juniper he approached to inform them it was a fine morning when the great beast of a bear rose like the steam of rich distilled perfume from the earth in front of them and made a mouth at him juniper did not run as might have been expected he stood for a moment peering into the brutes cavernous jaws and then flew he absented himself with such extraordinary nimbleness that after he was a mile distant his image appeared to be standing there yet and looking back he saw it himself baffled of his dwarf the bear thought he would make a shift to get on for the present with an orphan so he picked up jalap by her middle and thoughtfully withdrew  illustration  the thankful but disgusted ginseng continued her emigration but soon missed the jewelbox which in their alarm had been dropped and burst asunder she did not much care for the jewels but it contained some valuable papers among them the examiner a print which once had the misfortune to condemn a book written by the author of this tale and this she doted on returning for her property she peered cautiously around the angle of a rock and saw a spectacle that begot in her mind a languid interest the bear had returned upon a similar mission he was calmly distending his cheeks with the contents of the broken box and perched on a rock near at hand sat juniper waiting for him  it was natural that a suspicion of collusion between the two should dawn upon that infants mind it did dawn it brightened and broadened into the perfect day of conviction it was a revelation to the child at that moment said she afterwards i felt that i could lay my finger on the besttrained bear in christendom but with praiseworthy moderation she controlled herself and didnt do it she just stood still and allowed the beast to proceed having stored all the jewels in his capacious mouth he began taking in the valuable papers first some titledeeds disappeared then some railway bonds presently a roll of rentreceipts all these seemed to be as honey to his tongue he smiled a smile of tranquil happiness finally the newspaper vanished into his face like a wisp of straw drawn into a threshing machine  then the brute expanded his mouth with a ludicrous gape spilling out the jewels a glittering shower then he snapped his jaws like a steel trap afflicted with tetanus and stood on his head awhile next he made a feeble endeavour to complicate the relations between his partsto tie himself into a loveknot failing in this he lay flat upon his side wept retched and finally fashioning his visage into the semblance of sickly grin gave up the ghost i dont know what he died of i suppose it was hereditary in his family  the guilty come always to grief juniper was arrested charged with conspiracy to kill tried convicted sentenced to be hanged and before the sun went down was pardoned in searching his cavern the police discovered countless human bones much torn clothing and a mighty multitude of empty purses but nothing of any valuenot an article of any value it was a mystery what juniper had done with his illgotten valuables the police confessed it was a mystery                                          following the sea   at the time of the great earthquake of 68 i was at arica peru i have not a map by me and am not certain that arica is not in chili but it cant make much difference there was earthquake all along there as nearly as i can remember it occured in augustabout the middle of august 1869 or 70  sam baxter was with me i think we had gone from san francisco to make a railway or something on the morning of the quake sam and i had gone down to the beach to bathe we had shed our boots and begun to moult when there was a slight tremor of the earth as if the elephant who supports it were pushing upwards or lying down and getting up again next the surges which were flattening themselves upon the sand and dragging away such small trifles as they could lay hold of began racing out seaward as if they had received a telegraphic dispatch that somebody was not expected to live this was needless for we did not expect to live  when the sea had receded entirely out of sight we started after it for it will be remembered we had come to bathe and bathing without some kind of water is not refreshing in a hot climate i have heard that bathing in asses milk is invigorating but at that time i had no dealings with other authors i have had no dealings with them since  for the first four or five miles the walking was very difficult although the grade was tolerably steep the ground was soft there were tangled forests of seaweed old rotting ships rusty anchors human skeletons and a multitude of things to impede the pedestrian the floundering sharks bit our legs as we toiled past them and we were constantly slipping down upon the flat fish strewn about like orangepeel on a sidewalk sam too had stuffed his shirtfront with such a weight of spanish doubloons from the wreck of an old galleon that i had to help him across all the worst places it was very dispiriting  presently away on the western horizon i saw the sea coming back it occurred to me then that i did not wish it to come back a tidal wave is nearly always wet and i was now a good way from home with no means of making a fire  the same was true of sam but he did not appear to think of it in that way he stood quite still a moment with his eyes fixed on the advancing line of water then turned to me saying very earnestly  tell you what william i never wanted a ship so bad from the cradle to the grave i would give more for a shipmore than for all the railways and turnpikes you could scare up id give more than a hundred thousand million dollars i wouldid give all im worth and all my erie shares forjustonelittleship  to show how lightly he could part with his wealth he lifted his shirt out of his trousers unbosoming himself of his doubloons which tumbled about his feet a golden storm  by this time the tidal wave was close upon us call that a wave it was one solid green wall of water higher than niagara falls stretching as far as we could see to right and left without a break in its towering front it was by no means clear what we ought to do the moving wall showed no projections by means of which the most daring climber could hope to reach the top there was no ivy there were no windowledges staythere was the lightningconductor no there wasnt any lightningconductor of course not  looking despairingly upward i made a tolerably good beginning at thinking of all the mean actions i had wrought in the flesh when i saw projecting beyond the crest of the wave a ships bowsprit with a man sitting on it reading a newspaper thank fortune we were saved  falling upon our knees with tearful gratitude we got up again and ranran as fast as we could i suspect for now the whole forepart of the ship bulged through the water directly above our heads and might lose its balance any moment if we had only brought along our umbrellas  i shouted to the man on the bowsprit to drop us a line he merely replied that his correspondence was already very onerous and he hadnt any pen and ink  then i told him i wanted to get aboard he said i would find one on the beach about three leagues to the southard where the nancy tucker went ashore  at these replies i was disheartened it was not so much that the man withheld assistance as that he made puns presently however he folded his newspaper put it carefully away in his pocket went and got a line and let it down to us just as we were about to give up the race sam made a lunge at it and got itright into his side for the fiend above had appended a sharkhook to the end of the linewhich was his notion of humour but this was no time for crimination and recrimination i laid hold of sams legs the end of the rope was passed about the capstan and as soon as the men on board had had a little grog we were hauled up i can assure you that it was no fine experience to go up in that way close to the smooth vertical front of water with the whales tumbling out all round and above us and the swordfishes nosing us pointedly with vulgar curiosity  we had no sooner set foot on deck and got sam disengaged from the hook than the purser stepped up with book and pencil  tickets gentlemen  we told him we hadnt any tickets and he ordered us to be set ashore in a boat it was represented to him that this was quite impossible under the circumstances but he replied that he had nothing to do with circumstancesdid not know anything about circumstances nothing would move him till the captain who was a really kindhearted man came on deck and knocked him overboard with a spare topmast we were now stripped of our clothing chafed all over with stiff brushes rolled on our stomachs wrapped in flannels laid before a hot stove in the saloon and strangled with scalding brandy we had not been wet nor had we swallowed any seawater but the surgeon said this was the proper treatment i suspect poor man he did not often get the opportunity to resuscitate anybody in fact he admitted he had not had any such case as ours for years it is uncertain what he might have done to us if the tenderhearted captain had not thrashed him into his cabin with a knotted hawser and told us to go on deck  by this time the ship was passing above the town of arica and the sailors were all ford sitting on the bulwarks snapping peas and small shot at the terrified inhabitants flitting through the streets a hundred feet below these harmless projectiles rattled very merrily upon the upturned bootsoles of the fleeting multitude but not seeing any fun in this we were about to go astern and fish a little when the ship grounded on a hilltop the captain hove out all the anchors he had about him and when the water went swirling back to its legal level taking the town along for company there we were in the midst of a charming agricultural country but at some distance from any seaport  at sunrise next morning we were all on deck sam sauntered aft to the binnacle cast his eye carelessly upon the compass and uttered an ejaculation of astonishment  tell you captain he called out this has been a direr convulsion of nature than you have any idea everythings been screwed right round needle points due south  why you cussed lubber growled the skipper moving up and taking a look it pints drectly to labbard an theres the sun dead ahead  sam turned and confronted him with a steady gaze of ineffable contempt  now who said it wasnt dead aheadtell me that shows how much you know about earthquakes course i didnt mean just this continent nor just this earth i tell you the whole things turned                                          a tale of spanish vengeance   don hemstitch blodoza was an hidalgoone of the highest dalgos of old spain he had a comfortably picturesque castle on the guadalquiver with towers battlements and mortages on it but as it belonged not to his own creditors but to those of his bitterest enemy who inhabited it don hemstitch preferred the forest as a steady residence he had that curse of spanish pride which will not permit one to be a burden upon the man who may happen to have massacred all ones relations and set a price upon the heads of ones family generally he had made a vow never to accept the hospitality of don symposionot if he died for it so he pervaded the romantic dells and the sunless jungle was infected with the sound of his guitar he rose in the morning and laved him in the limpid brooklet and the beams of the noonday sun fell upon him in the pursuit of diet    the thistles downy seed his fare     his drink the morning dew  he throve but indifferently upon this meagre regimen but beyond all other evils a true spaniard of the poorer sort dreads obesity during the darkest night of the season he will get up at an absurd hour and stab his best friend in the back rather than grow fat  it will of course be suspected by the experienced reader that don hemstitch did not have any bed like the horatian lines above quoted    he perched at will on every spray  in translating this tale into the french m victor hugo will please twig the proper meaning of the word spray i shall be very angry if he make it appear that my hero is a gull  one morning while don hemstitch was dozing upon his leafy couchnot his main couch but a branchhe was roused from his tranquil nap by the grunting of swine or if you like subtle distinctions by the sound of human voices peering cautiously through his bedhangings he saw below him at a little distance two of his countrymen in conversation the fine practised phrenzy of their looks their excellently rehearsed air of apprehensive secrecy showed him they were merely conspiring against somebodys life and he dismissed the matter from his mind until the mention of his own name recalled his attention one of the conspirators was urging the other to make one of a jointstock company for the dons assassination but the more conscientious plotter would not consent  the laws of spain said the latter with which we have an acquaintance meanly withheld from the attorneys enjoin that when one man murders another except for debt he must make provision for the widow and orphans i leave it to you if after the summers unprofitable business we are in a position to assume the care and education of a large family we have not a single asset and our liabilities amount to fourteen widows and more than thirty children of strong and increasing appetite  carrrajo hissed the other through his beard we will slaughter the lot of them  at this coldblooded proposition his merciful companion recoiled aghast  diablo he shrieked tempt me no farther what immolate a whole hecatomb of guiltless women and children consider the funeral expense  there is really no moving the lawabiding soul to crime of doubtful profit but don hemstitch was not at ease he could not say how soon it might transpire that he had nor chick nor child should don symposio pass that way and communicate this informationand he was in a position to knowthe moral scruples of the conscientious plotter would vanish like the baseless fabric of a beaten cur moreover it is always unpleasant to be included in a conspiracy in which one is not a conspirator don hemstitch resolved to sell his life at the highest market price  hastily descending his tree he wrapped his cloak about him and stood for some time wishing he had a poniard trying the temper of this upon his thumbnail he found it much more amiable than his own it was a keen toledo bladekeen enough to sever a hare to nerve himself for the deadly work before him he began thinking of a lady whom he had once metthe lovely donna lavaca beloved of el toroblanco having thus wrought up his castilian soul to a high pitch of jealously he felt quite irresistible and advanced towards the two ruffians with his poniard deftly latent in his flowing sleeve his mien was hostile his stride puissant his nose tiptiltednot to put too fine a point upon it petallic don hemstitch was upon the warpath with all his might the forest trembled as he trode the earth bent like thin ice beneath his heel birds beasts serpents and poachers fled affrighted to the right and left of his course he came down upon the unsuspecting assassins like a mild spanish avalanche  illustration  senores he thundered with a frightful scowl and a faint aroma of garlic patter your paternosters as fast as you conveniently may you have but ten minutes to exist has either of you a watch  then might you have seen a guilty dismay overspreading the faces of two sinners like a sudden snow paling twin mountain peaks in the presence of death crime shuddered and sank into his boots conscience stood appalled in the sight of retribution in vain the villains essayed speech each palsied tongue beat out upon the yielding air some weak words of supplication then clave to its proper concave two pairs of brawny knees unsettled their knitted braces and bent limply beneath their loads of incarnate wickedness swaying unsteadily above with clenched hands and streaming eyes these wretched men prayed silently at this supreme moment an american gentleman sitting by with his heels upon a rotted oaken stump tilted back his chair laid down his newspaper and began operating upon a halfeaten applepie one glance at the title of that printone look at that calm angular face clasped in its crescent of crisp crustand don hemstitch blodoza reeled staggered like an exhausted spinningtop he spread his baffled hand upon his eyes and sank heavily to earth  saved saved shrieked the penitent conspirators springing to their feet the far deeps of the forest whispered in consultation and a distant hillside echoed back the words saved sang the rockssaved the glad birds twittered from the leaves above the hare that don hemstitch blodozas poniard would have severed limped awkwardly but confidently about saying saved as well as he knew how  explanation is needless the american gentleman was the special correspondent of the new york herald it is tolerably well known that except beneath his searching eye no considerable event can occurand his whole attention was focused upon that applepie  that is how spanish vengeance was balked of its issue                                          mrs dennisons head   while i was employed in the bank of loan and discount said mr applegarth smiling the smile with which he always prefaced a nice old story there was another clerk there named dennisona quiet reticent fellow the very soul of truth and a great favourite with us all he always wore crape on his hat and once when asked for whom he was in mourning he replied his wife and seemed much affected we all expressed our sympathy as delicately as possible and no more was said upon the subject some weeks after this he seemed to have arrived at that stage of tempered grief at which it becomes a relief to give sorrow wordsto speak of the departed one to sympathizing friends for one day he voluntarily began talking of his bereavement and of the terrible calamity by which his wife had been deprived of her head  this sharpened our curiosity to the keenest edge but of course we controlled it hoping he would volunteer some further information with regard to so singular a misfortune but when day after day went by and he did not allude to the matter we got worked up into a fever of excitement about it one evening after dennison had gone we held a kind of political meeting about it at which all possible and impossible methods of decapitation were suggested as the ones to which mrs d probably owed her extraordinary demise i am sorry to add that we so far forgot the grave character of the event as to lay small wagers that it was done this way or that way that it was accidental or premeditated that she had had a hand in it herself or that it was wrought by circumstances beyond her control all was mere conjecture however but from that time dennison as the custodian of a secret upon which we had staked our cash was an object of more than usual interest it wasnt entirely that either aside from our paltry wagers we felt a consuming curiosity to know the truth for its own sake each set himself to work to elicit the dread secret in some way and the misdirected ingenuity we developed was wonderful all sorts of pious devices were resorted to to entice poor dennison into clearing up the mystery by a thousand indirect methods we sought to entrap him into divulging all history fiction poesyall were laid under contribution and from goliah down through charles i to sam spigger a local celebrity who got his head entangled in mill machinery every one who had ever mourned the loss of a head received his due share of attention during office hours the regularity with which we introduced and the pertinacity with which we stuck to this one topic came near getting us all discharged for one day the cashier came out of his private office and intimated that if we valued our situations the subject of hanging would afford us the means of retaining them he added that he always selected his subordinates with an eye to their conversational abilities but variety of subject was as desirable at times as exhaustive treatment  during all this discussion dennison albeit he had evinced from the first a singular interest in the theme and shirked not his fair share of the conversation never once seemed to understand that it had any reference to himself his frank truthful nature was quite unable to detect the personal significance of the subject it was plain that nothing short of a definite inquiry would elicit the information we were dying to obtain and at a caucus one evening we drew lots to determine who should openly propound it the choice fell upon me  next morning we were at the bank somewhat earlier than usual waiting impatiently for dennison and the time to open the doors they always arrived together when dennison stepped into the room bowing in his engaging manner to each clerk as he passed to his own desk i confronted him shaking him warmly by the hand at that moment all the others fell to writing and figuring with unusual avidity as if thinking of anything under the sun except dennisons wifes head  oh dennison i began as carelessly as i could manage it speaking of decapitation reminds me of something i would like to ask you i have intended asking it several times but it has always slipped my memory of course you will pardon me if it is not a fair question  as if by magic the scratching of pens died away leaving a dead silence which quite disconcerted me but i blundered on  i heard the other daythat is you saidor it was in the newspapers or somewheresomething about your poor wife you understandabout her losing her head would you mind telling me how such a distressing accidentif it was an accidentoccurred  when i had finished dennison walked straight past me as if he didnt see me went round the counter to his stool and perched himself gravely on the top of it facing the other clerks then he began speaking calmly and without apparent emotion  gentlemen i have long desired to speak of this thing but you gave me no encouragement and i naturally supposed you were indifferent i now thank you all for the friendly interest you take in my affairs i will satisfy your curiosity upon this point at once if you will promise never hereafter to allude to the matter and to ask not a single question now  we all promised upon our sacred honour and collected about him with the utmost eagerness he bent his head a moment then raised it quietly saying  my poor wifes head was bitten off  by what we all exclaimed eagerly with suspended breath  he gave us a look full of reproach turned to his desk and went at his work  we went at ours                                          a fowl witch   frau gaubenslosher was strongly suspected of witchcraft i dont think she was a witch but would not like to swear she was not in a court of law unless a good deal depended upon my testimony and i had been properly suborned beforehand a great many persons accused of witchcraft have themselves stoutly disbelieved the charge until when subjected to shooting with a silver bullet or boiling in oil they have found themselves unable to endure the test and it must be confessed appearances were against the frau in the first place she lived quite alone in a forest and had no visiting list this was suspicious secondlyand it was thus mainly that she had acquired her evil reputeall the barnyard fowls in the vicinity seemed to bear her the most uncompromising illwill whenever she passed a flock of hens or ducks or turkeys or geese one of them with dropped wings extended neck and open bill would start in hot pursuit sometimes the whole flock would join in for a few moments with shrill clamour but there would always be one fleeter and more determined than the rest and that one would keep up the chase with unflagging zeal clean out of sight  upon these occasions the dames fright was painful to behold she would not screamher organs of screech seemed to have lost their powernor as a rule would she curse she would just address herself to silent prayerful speed with every symptom of abject terror  the fraus explanation of this unnatural persecution was singularly weak upon a certain night long ago said she a poor bedraggled and attenuated gander had applied at her door for relief he stated in piteous accents that he had eaten nothing for months but tintacks and an occasional beerbottle and he had not roosted under cover for so long a time he did not know what it was like would she give him a place on her fender and fetch out six or eight cold pies to amuse him while she was preparing his supper to this plea she turned a deaf ear and he went away he came again the next night however bringing a written certificate from a clergyman that his case was a deserving one she would not aid him and he departed the night after he presented himself again with a paper signed by the relieving officer of the parish stating that the necessity for help was most urgent  by this time the fraus goodnature was quite exhausted she slew him dressed him put him in a pot and boiled him she kept him boiling for three or four days but she did not eat him because her teeth were just like anybodys teethno weaker perhaps but certainly no stronger nor sharper so she fed him to a threshing machine of her acquaintance which managed to masticate some of the more modern portions but was hopelessly wrecked upon the neck from that time the poor beldame had lived under the ban of a great curse hens took after her as naturally as after the soaring beetle geese pursued her as if she were a fleeting tadpole ducks turkeys and guinea fowl camped upon her trail with tireless pertinacity  now there was a leaven of improbability in this tale and it leavened the whole lump ganders do not roost there is not one in a hundred of them that could sit on a fender long enough to say jack robinson so as the frau lived a thousand years before the birth of common sensesay about a half century agowhen everything uncommon had a smell of the supernatural there was nothing for it but to consider her a witch had she been very feeble and withered the people would have burned her out of hand but they did not like to proceed to extremes without perfectly legal evidence they were cautious for they had made several mistakes recently they had sentenced two or three females to the stake and upon being stripped the limbs and bodies of these had not redeemed the hideous promise of their shrivelled faces and hands justice was ashamed of having toasted comparatively plump and presumably innocent women and the punishment of this one was wisely postponed until the proof should be all in  but in the meantime a graceless youth named hans blisselwartle made the startling discovery that none of the fowls that pursued the frau ever came back to boast of it a brief martial career seemed to have weaned them from the arts of peace and the love of their kindred full of unutterable suspicion hans one day followed in the rear of an exciting race between the timorous dame and an avenging pullet they were too rapid for him but bursting suddenly in at the ladys door some fifteen minutes afterward he found her in the act of placing the plucked and eviscerated nemesis upon her cooking range the frau betrayed considerable confusion and although the accusing blisselwartle could not but recognize in her act a certain poetic justice he could not conceal from himself that there was something grossly selfish and sordid in it he thought it was a good deal like bottling an annoying ghost and selling him for clarified moonlight or like haltering a nightmare and putting her to the cart  when it transpired that the frau ate her feathered persecutors the patience of the villagers refused to honour the new demand upon it she was at once arrested and charged with prostituting a noble superstition to a base selfish end we will pass over the trial suffice it she was convicted but even then they had not the heart to burn a middleaged woman with full rounded outlines as a witch so they broke her upon the wheel as a thief  illustration  the reckless antipathy of the domestic fowls to this inoffensive lady remains to be explained having rejected her theory i am bound in honour to set up one of my own happily an inventory of her effects now before me furnishes a tolerably safe basis amongst the articles of personal property i note one long thin silken fishing line and hook now if i were a barnyard fowlsay a gooseand a lady not a friend of mine were to pass me munching sweetmeats and were to drop a nice fat worm passing on apparently unconscious of her loss i think i should try to get away with that worm and if after swallowing it i felt drawn towards that lady by a strong personal attachment i suppose that i should yield if i could not help it and then if the lady chose to run and i chose to follow making a good deal of noise i suppose it would look as if i were engaged in a very reprehensible pursuit would it not with the light i have that is the way in which the case presents itself to my intelligence though of course i may be wrong                                          the civil service in florida   colonel bulper was of a slumberous turn most people are not they work all day and sleep all nightare always in one or the other condition of unrest and never slumber such persons the colonel used to remark are fit only for sentry duty they are good to watch our property while we take our restand they take the property but this tale is not of them it is of colonel bulper  there was a fellow named halsey a practical joker and one of the most disagreeable of his class he would remain broad awake for a year at a time for no other purpose than to break other people of their natural rest and i must admit that from the wreck of his faculties upon the rock of insomnia he had somehow rescued a marvellous ingenuity and fertility of expedient but this tale is not so much of him as of colonel bulper  at the time of which i write the colonel was the collector of customs at a seaport town in florida united states the climate there is perpetual summer it never rains nor anything and there was no good reason why the colonel should not have enjoyed it to the top of his bent as there was enough for all in point of fact the collectorship had been given him solely that he might repair his wasted vitality by a short season of unbroken repose for during the presidential canvass immediately preceding his appointment he had been kept awake a long time by means of strong tea in order to deliver an able and exhaustive political argument prepared by the candidate who was ultimately successful in spite of it halsey who had favoured the other aspirant was a merchant and had nothing in the world to do but annoy the collector if the latter could have kept away from him the dignity of the office might have been preserved and the object of the incumbents appointment to it attained but sneak away whithersoever he mightinto the heart of the dismal swamp or anywhere in the evergladessome vagrom indian or casual negro was sure to stumble over him before long and go and tell halsey securing a plug of tobacco for reward or if he was not found in this way some company was tolerably certain in the course of time to survey a line of railway athwart his leafy couch and laying his prostrate trunk aside out of the way send word to his persecutor who as soon as the line was as nearly completed as it ever would be would come down on horseback with some diabolical device for waking the slumberer i will confess there is a subtle seeming of unlikelihood about all this but in the land where ponce de leon searched for the fountain of youth there is an air of unreality in everything i can only say i have had the story by me a long time and it seems to me just as true as it was the day i wrote it  sometimes the colonel would seek out a hillside with a southern exposure but no sooner would he compose his members for a bit of slumber than halsey would set about making inquiries for him under pretence that a ship was en route from liverpool and the collectors signature might be required for her anchoring papers having traced himwhich owing to the meddlesome treachery of the venal natives he was always able to dohalsey would set off to texas for a seed of the prickly pear which he would plant exactly beneath the slumberers body this he called a triumph of modern engineering as soon as the young vegetable had pushed its spines above the soil of course the colonel would have to get up and seek another spotand this nearly always waked him  upon one occasion the colonel existed five consecutive days without slumbertravelling all day and sleeping in the weeds at nightto find an almost inaccessible crag on the summit of which he hoped to be undisturbed until the action of the dew should wear away the rock all round his body when he expected and was willing to roll off and wake but even there halsey found him out and put eagles eggs in his southern pockets to hatch when the young birds were well grown they pecked so sharply at the colonels legs that he had to get up and wring their necks the malevolence of people who scorn slumber seems to be practically unlimited  at last the colonel resolved upon revenge and having dreamed out a feasible plan proceeded to put it into execution he had in the warehouse some government powder and causing a keg of this to be conveyed into his private office he knocked out the head he next penned a note to halsey asking him to step down to the office upon important business adding in a postscript as i am liable to be called out for a few moments at any time in case you do not find me in please sit down and amuse yourself with the newspaper until i return he knew halsey was at his countinghouse and would certainly come if only to learn what signification a government official attached to the word business then the colonel procured a brief candle and set it into the powder his plan was to light the candle dispatch a porter with the message and bolt for home having completed his preparations he leaned back in his easy chair and smiled he smiled a long time and even achieved a chuckle for the first time in his life he felt a serene sense of happiness in being particularly wide awake then without moving from his chair he ignited the taper and put out his hand toward the bellcord to summon the porter at this stage of his vengeance the colonel fell into a tranquil and refreshing slumber                                       there is nothing omitted here that is merely the colonels present address                                          a tale of the bosphorus   pollimariar was the daughter of a mussulmanshe was in fact a mussulgirl she lived at stamboul the name of which is an admirable rhyme to what pollimariar was profanely asserted to be by her two sisters djainan and djulya these were very much older than pollimariar and proportionately wicked in wickedness they could discount her giving her the first innings  the relations between pollimariar and her sisters were in all respects similar to those that existed between cinderella and her sisters indeed these big girls seldom read anything but the story of cinderella and that work no doubt had its influence in forming their character they were always apparelling themselves in gaudy dresses from paris and going away to balls leaving their meritorious little sister weeping at home in their everyday finery their father was a commercial traveller absent with his samples in damascus most of the time and the poor girl had no one to protect her from the outrage of exclusion from the parties to which she was not invited she fretted and chafed very much at first but after forbearance ceased to be a virtue it came rather natural to her to exercise a patient endurance but perceiving this was agreeable to her sisters she abandoned it devising a rare scheme of vengeance she sent to the levant herald the following personal advertisement     gvregents canal 1030 pm qkx is

and at the appointed hour he kept the tryst what passed between them the sequel will disclose if i can think it out to suit me  soon afterwards djainan and djulya received cards of invitation to a grand ball at the sultans palace given to celebrate the arrival of a choice lot of circassian beauties in the market the first thing the wicked sisters did was to flourish these invitations triumphantly before the eyes of pollimariar who declared she did not believe a word of it indeed she professed such aggressive incredulity that she had to be severely beaten but she denied the invitations to the last she thought it was best to deny them  the invitations stated that at the proper hour the old original sultana would call personally and conduct the young ladies to the palace and she did so they thought at the time she bore a striking resemblance to a grand vizier with his beard shaven off and this led them into some desultory reflections upon the sin of nepotism and family favour at court but like all moral reflections these came to nothing the old original sultanas attire also was with the exception of a reticule and fan conspicuously epicene but in a country where popular notions of sex are somewhat confused this excited no surprise  as the three marched off in stately array poor little deserted pollimariar stood cowering at one side with her fingers spread loosely upon her eyes weeping likea crocodile the sultana said it was late they would have to make haste she had not fetched a cab however and a recent inundation of dogs very much impeded their progress byandby the dogs became shallower but it was near eleven oclock before they arrived at the sublime portevery old and fruity a janizary standing here split his visage to grin but it was surprising how quickly the sultana had his head off  pretty soon afterwards they came to a low door where the sultana whistled three times and kicked at the panels it soon yielded disclosing two gigantic nubian eunuchs black as the ace of clubs who stared at first but when shown a very cleverlyexecuted signetring of paste knocked their heads against the ground with respectful violence then one of them consulted a thick book and took from a secret drawer two metal badges numbered 7394 and 7395 which he fastened about the necks of the now frightened girls who had just observed that the sultana had vanished the numbers on the badges showed that this would be a very crowded ball  the other black now advanced with a measuring tape and began gravely measuring djainan from head to heel

smith  an editorial article from a journal of may 3rd ad 3873   at the quiet little village of smithcester the ancient london will be celebrated today the twentieth centennial anniversary of this remarkable man the foremost figure of antiquity the recurrence of what no longer than six centuries ago was a popular fête day and which even now is seldom allowed to pass without some recognition by those to whom the word liberty means something more precious than gold is provocative of peculiar emotion it matters little whether or no tradition has correctly fixed the date of smiths birth that he was bornthat being born he wrought nobly at the work his hand found to dothat by the mere force of his intellect he established our present perfect form of government under which civilization has attained its highest and ripest developmentthese are facts beside which a mere question of chronology sinks into insignificance  that this extraordinary man originated the smitharchic system of government is perhaps open to honest doubt very possibly it had a de facto existence in various debased and uncertain shapes as early as the sixteenth century but that he cleared it of its overlying errors and superstitions gave it a definite form and shaped it into an intelligible scheme there is the strongest evidence in the fragments of twentiethcentury literature that have descended to us disfigured though they are with amazingly contradictory statements of his birth parentage and manner of life before he strode upon the political stage as the liberator of mankind it is stated that snakeshearone of his contemporaries a poet whose works had in their day some reputation though it is difficult to say whyalludes to him as the noblest roman of them all our ancestors at the time being called englishmen or romans indifferently in the only fragment of snakeshear extant however we have been unable to find this passage  smiths military power is amply attested in an ancient manuscript of undoubted authenticity which has just been translated from the japanese it is an account of the waterbattle of loo by an eyewitness whose name unfortunately has not reached us in this battle it is stated that smith overthrew the great neapolitan general whom he captured and conveyed in chains to the island of chickenhurst  in his political history of the twentieth century the late mimbleor as he would have been called in the time of which he writes mister mimblehas this luminous sentence with the single exception of coblentz there was no european government the liberator did not upset and which he did not erect into a pure smitharchy and though some of them afterward relapsed temporarily into the crude forms of antiquity and others fell into fanciful systems begotten of the intellectual activity he had stirred up yet so firmly did he establish the principle that in the thirtysecond century the enlightened world was what it has since remained practically smitharchic  it may be noted here as a curious coincidence that the same year which saw the birth of him who established rational government witnessed the death of him who perfected literature in 1873 martin farquhar tuppernext to smith the most notable name in historydied of starvation in the streets of london like that of smith his origin is wrapped in profoundest obscurity no less than seven british cities claimed the honour of his birth meagre indeed is our knowledge of this only bard whose works have descended to us through the changes of twenty centuries entire all that is positively established is that during his life he was editor of the times magazine a word of disputed meaningand as quaint old dumbleshaw says an accomplished greek and latin scholar whatever greek and latin may have been had smith and tupper been contemporaries the iron deeds of the former would doubtless have been immortalized in the golden pages of the latter upon such chances does history depend for her materials  strangely unimpressible indeed must be the mind which looking backward through the vista of twenty centuries upon the singular race from whom we are supposed to be descended can repress a feeling of emotional interest the names of john smith and martin farquhar tupper blazoned upon the page of the dim past and surrounded by the lesser names of snakeshear the first neapolitan oliver cornwell close queen elizabeth or lambeth the dutch bismarch julia cæsar and a host of contemporary notables are singularly suggestive they call to mind the odd old custom of covering the body with clothes the curious error of copernicus and other wide guesses of antique science the lost arts of telegramy steam locomotion and printing with movable types and the exploded theory of gunpowder they set us thinking upon the zealous idolatry which led men to make pious pilgrimages to the then accessible regions about the north pole and into the interior of africa which at that time was but little better than a wilderness they conjure up visions of bloodthirsty emperors tyrannical kings vampire presidents and useless parliamentsstrangely horrible shapes contrasted with the serene and benevolent aspect of our modern smithocracy  let us today rejoice that the old order of things has for ever passed away let us be thankful that our lot has been cast in more wholesome days than those in which john smith chalked out the better destinies of a savage race and tupper sang divine philosophy to inattentive ears and yet let us keep green the memory of whatever there was of goodif anyin the dark presmithian ages when men cherished quaint superstitions and rode on the backs of horseswhen they passed over the seas instead of under themwhen science had not yet dawned to chase away the shadows of imaginationand when the cabalistic letters ad which from habit we still affix to the numerals designating the age of the world had perhaps a known signification                                          sundered hearts   deidrick schwackenheimer was a lusty young goatherd he stood six feet two in his sabots and there was not an ounce of superfluous bone or brain in his composition if he had a fault it was a tendency to sleep more than was strictly necessary the nature of his calling fostered this weakness after being turned into some neighbours pasture his animals would not require looking after until the owner of the soil turned them out again their guardian naturally devoted the interval to slumber nor was there danger of oversleeping the pitchfork of the irate husbandman always roused him at the proper moment  at nightfall deidrick would marshal his flock and drive it homeward to the milkingyard here he was met by the fair young katrina buttersprecht the daughter of his employer who relieved the tense udders of their daily secretion one evening after the milking deidrick who had for years been nourishing a secret passion for katrina was smitten with an idea why should she not be his wife he went and fetched a stool into the yard led her tenderly to it seated her and asked her why the girl thought a moment and then was at some pains to explain she was too young her old father required all her care her little brother would cry she was engaged to max manglewurzzle she amplified considerably but these were the essential points of objection she set them before him seriatim with perfect frankness and without mental reservation when she had done her lover with that instinctive sense of honour characteristic of the true goatherd made no attempt to alter her decision indeed he had nodded a heartbroken assent to each separate proposition and at the conclusion of the last was fast asleep the next morning he jocundly drove his goats afield and appeared the same as usual except that he slept a good deal more and thought of katrina a good deal less  illustration  that evening when he returned with his spraddling milchnannies he found a second stool placed alongside the first it was a happy augury his attentions then were not altogether distasteful he seated himself gravely upon the stool and when katrina had done milking she came and occupied the other he mechanically renewed his proposal then the artless maid proceeded to recapitulate the obstacles to the union she was too young her old father required all her care her little brother would cry she was engaged to max manglewurzzle as each objection was stated and told off on the fraüleins fingers deidrick nodded a resigned acquiescence and at the finish was fast asleep every evening after that deidrick proposed in perfect good faith the girl repeated her objections with equal candour and they were received with somnolent approval lovemaking is very agreeable and by the usuage of long years it becomes a confirmed habit in less than a decade it became impossible for katrina to enjoy her supper without the regular proposal and deidrick could not sleep of a night without the preliminary nap in the goatyard to taper off his wakefulness both would have been wretched had they retired to bed with a shade of misunderstanding between them  and so the seasons went by the earth grayed and greened herself anew the planets sailed their appointed courses the old goats died and their virtues were perpetuated in their offspring max manglewurzzle married the millers daughter katrinas little brother who would have cried at her wedding did not cry any at his own the aged buttersprecht was long gathered to his fathers and katrina was herself well stricken in years and still at fall of night she defined her position to the sleeping lover who had sought her handdefined it in the selfsame terms as upon that eventful eve the gossiping frauen began to whisper it would be a match but it did not look like it as yet slanderous tongues even asserted that it ought to have been a match long ago but i dont see how it could have been without the girls consent the parish clerk began to hanker after his fee but lacking patience he was unreasonable  the whole countryside was now taking a deep interest in the affair the aged did not wish to die without beholding the consummation of the love they had seen bud in their youth and the young did not wish to die at all but no one liked to interfere it was feared that counsel to the woman would be rejected and a thrashing to the man would be misunderstood at last the parson took heart of grace to make or mar the match like a reckless gambler he staked his fee upon the cast of a die he went one day and removed the two stoolsnow worn extremely thinto another corner of the milkingyard  that evening when the distended udders had been duly despoiled the lovers repaired to their trystingplace they opened their eyes a bit to find the stools removed they were tormented with a vague presentiment of evil and stood for some minutes irresolute then assisted to a decision by their weakening knees they seated themselves flat upon the ground deidrick stammered a weak proposal and katrina essayed an incoherent objection but she trembled and became unintelligible and when he attempted to throw in a few nods of generous approval they came in at the wrong places with one accord they arose and sought their stools katrina tried it again she succeeded in saying her father was overyoung to marry and max manglewurzzle would cry if she took care of him deidrick executed a reckless nod that made his neck snap and was broad awake in a minute a second time they arose they conveyed the stools back to their primitive position and began again she remarked that her little brother was too old to require all her care and max would cry to marry her father deidrick addressed himself to sleep but a horrid nightmare galloped roughshod into his repose and set him off with a strangled snort the good understanding between those two hearts was for ever dissipated neither one knew if the other were afoot or on horseback like the sailors thirtieth stroke with the ropesend it was perfectly disgusting their meetings after this were so embarrassing that they soon ceased meeting altogether katrina died soon after a miserable brokenspirited maiden of sixty and deidrick drags out a wretched existence in a remote town upon an income of eight silbergroschen a week  oh friends and brethren if you did but know how slight an act may sunder for ever the bonds of lovehow easily one may wreck the peace of two faithful heartshow almost without an effort the waters of affection may be changed to gall and bitternessi suspect you would make even more more mischief than you do now                                          the early history of bath   bladud was the eldest son of a british king whose name i perfectly remember but do not choose to write temp solomonwho does not appear to have known bladud however bladud was therefore prince of wales he was more than that he was a leperhad it very bad and the court physician sir william gull frequently remarked that the princes death was merely a question of time when a man gets to that stage of leprosy he does not care much for society particularly if no one will have anything to do with him so bladud bade a final adieu to the world and settled in liverpool but not agreeing with the climate he folded his tent into the shape of an arab as longfellow says and silently stole away to the southward bringing up in gloucestershire  here bladud hired himself out to a farmer named smith as a swineherd but fate as he expressed it in the vernacular was ferninst him leprosy is a contagious disease within certain degrees of consanguinity and by riding his pigs afield he communicated it to them so that in a few weeks barring the fact that they were hogs they were no better off than he mr smith was an irritable old gentleman so choleric he made his bondsmen tremblethough he was now abroad upon his own recognizances dreading his wrath bladud quitted his employ without giving the usual weeks notice but so far conforming to custom in other respects as to take his masters pigs along with him  we find him next at a place called swainswickor swineswiga mile or two to the northeast of bath which as yet had no existence its site being occupied by a smooth level reach of white sand or a stormy pool of black water travellers of the time disagree which at swainswick bladud found his level throwing aside all such nonsense as kingly ambition and the amenities of civilized societyutterly ignoring the deceitful pleasures of common sensehe contented his simple soul with composing bouts rimés for lady miller at batheaston villa that one upon a buttered muffin falsely ascribed by walpole to the duchess of northumberland was really constructed by bladud  a brief glance at the local history of the period cannot but prove instructive ralph allen was then residing at sham castle where pope accused him of doing good like a thief in the night and blushing to find it unpopular fielding was painfully evolving tom jones from an inner consciousness that might have been improved by soap and any water but that of bath bishop warburton had just shot the count du barré in a duel with lord chesterfield and beau nash was disputing with dr johnson at the pelican inn walcot upon a question of lexicographical etiquette it is necessary to learn these things in order the better to appreciate the interest of what follows  during all this time bladud never permitted his mind to permanently desert his calling he found family matters a congenial study and he thought of his swine a good deal off and on one day while baiting them amongst the hills he observed a cloud of steam ascending from the valley below having always believed steam a modern invention this ancient was surprised and when his measly charge set up a wild squeal rushing down a steep place into the aspiring vapour his astonishment ripened into dismay as soon as he conveniently could bladud followed and there he heard the sawi mean he saw the herd wallowing and floundering multitudinously in a hot spring and punctuating the silence of nature with grunts of quiet satisfaction as the leprosy left them and clave to the watersto which it cleaves yet it is not probable the pigs went in there for a medicinal purpose how could they know any butcher will tell you that a pig after being assassinated is invariably boiled to loosen the hair by long usage the custom of getting into hot water has become a habit which the living pig inherits from the dead pork see herbert spencer on heredity  now bladud who is said to have studied at athens as most britons of his time did was a rigid disciple of bishop butler and butlers line of argument is this because a rosebush blossoms this year a lamppost will blossom next year by this ingenious logic he proves the immortality of the human soul which is good of him but in so doing he proves also the immortality of the souls of snakes mosquitos and everything else which is less commendable reasoning by analogy bladud was convinced that if these waters would cure a pig they would cure a prince and without waiting to see how they had cured the bacon he waded in  when asked the next day by sir william waller if he intended trying the waters again and if he retained his fondness for that style of bathing he replied not any thank you i am quite cured sir william at once noised abroad the story of the wonderful healing and when it reached the kings ears that potentate sent for bladud to come home at once and succeed to the throne just the same as if he had a skinwhich bladud did some time afterwards he thought to outdo dædalus and icarus by flying from the top of st pauls cathedral he outdid them handsomely he fell a good deal harder than they did and broke his precious neck  previously to his melancholy end he built the city of bath to commemorate his remarkable cure he endowed the corporation with ten millions sterling every penny of the interest of which is annually devoted to the publication of guidebooks to bath to lure the unwary invalid to his doom from motives of mercy the corporation have now set up a contrivance for secretly extracting the mineral properties of the fluid before it is ladled out but formerly a great number of strangers found a watery grave  if king bladud was generous to bath bath has been grateful in return one statue of him adorns the principal street and another graces the swimming pond both speaking likenesses the one represents him as he was before he divided his leprosy with the pigs the other shows him as he appeared after breaking his neck  writing in 1631 dr jordan says the baths are beargardens where both sexes bathe promiscuously while the passersby pelt them with dead dogs cats and pigs and even human creatures are hurled over the rails into the water it is not so bad as that now but lodgings are still held at rates which might be advantageously tempered

petto as everybody called him had a dog upon whom he lavished an amount of affection which had it been disbursed in a proper quarter would have been adequate to the sentimental needs of a dozen brace of lovers the name of this dog was jerusalem but it might more properly have been dantobeersheba he was not a fascinating dog to look at you can buy a handsomer dog in any shop than this one he had neither a graceful exterior nor an engaging address on the contrary his exceptional plainness had passed into a local proverb and such was the inbred coarseness of his demeanour that in the dark you might have thought him a politician  if you will take two very bandylegged curs cut one off just abaft the shoulders and the other immediately forward of the haunches rejecting the forepart of the first and the rear portion of the second you will have the raw material for constructing a dog something like dad pettos you have only to effect a junction between the accepted sections and make the thing eat  had he been favoured with as many pairs of legs as a centipede jerusalem would not have differed materially from either of his race but it was odd to see such a wealth of dog wedded to such a poverty of leg he was so long that the most precocious pupil of the public schools could not have committed him to memory in a week  it was beautiful to see jerusalem rounding the angle of a wall and turning his head about to observe how the remainder of the procession was coming on he was once circumnavigating a small outhouse when catching sight of his own hinderquarters he flew into a terrible rage the sight of another dog always had this effect upon jerusalem and more especially when as in this case he thought he could grasp an unfair advantage so jerusalem took after that retreating foe as hard as ever he could hook it round and round he flew but the faster he went the more his centrifugal force widened his circle until he presently lost sight of his enemy altogether then he slowed down determined to accomplish his end by strategy sneaking closely up to the wall he moved cautiously forward and when he had made the full circuit he came smack up against his own tail making a sudden spring which must have stretched him like a bit of indiarubber he fastened his teeth into his ham hanging on like a country visitor he felt sure he had nailed the other dog but he was equally confident the other dog had nailed him so the problem was simplified to a mere question of enduranceand jerusalem was an animal of pluck the grim conflict was maintained all one daymaintained with deathless perseverance until dad petto discovered the belligerent and uncoupled him then jerusalem looked up at his master with a shake of the head as much as to say its a precious opportune arrival for the other pup but who took him off me  i dont think i can better illustrate the preposterous longitude of this pet than by relating an incident that fell under my own observation i was one day walking along the highway with a friend who was a stranger in the neighbourhood when a rabbit flashed past us going our way but evidently upon urgent business immediately upon his heels followed the first instalment of dad pettos mongrel enveloped in dust his jaws distended the lower one shaving the ground to scoop up the rabbit he was going at a rather lively gait but was some time in passing my friend stood a few moments looking on then rubbed his eyes looked again and finally turned to me just as the brutes tail flitted by saying with a broad stare of astonishment  did you ever see a pack of hounds run so perfectly in line it beats anything and the speed toothey seem fairly blended if a fellow didnt know better he would swear there was but a single dog  i suppose it was this peculiarity of jerusalem that had won old pettos regard he liked as much of anything as he could have for his money and the expense of this creature generally speaking was no greater than that of a brief succinct bull pup but there were times when he was costly all dogs are sometimes off their feedwill eat nothing for a whole day but a few oxtails a pudding or two and such towelling as they can pick up in the scullery when jerusalem got that way which to do him justice was singularly seldom it made things awkward in the near future for in a few days after recovering his passion for food the effect of his former abstemiousness would begin to reach his stomach but of course all he could then devour would work no immediate relief this he would naturally attribute to the quality of his fare and would change his diet a dozen times a day his menu in the twelve working hours comprising an astonishing range of articles from a woodsaw to a kettle of soft soapedibles as widely dissimilar as the zenith and the nadir which also he would eat so catholic an appetite was of course exceptional ordinarily jerusalem was as narrow and illiberal as the best of us give him plenty of raw beef and he would not unsettle his gastric faith by outside speculation or tentative systems  i could relate things of this dog by the hour such for example as his clever device for crossing a railway he never attempted to do this endwise like other animals for the obvious reason that like every one else he was unable to make any sense of the timetables and unless he should by good luck begin the manoeuvre when a train was said to be due it was likely he would be abbreviated for of course no one is idiot enough to cross a railway track when the timetable says it is all clearat least no one as long as jerusalem so he would advance his head to the rails calling in his outlying convolutions and straightening them alongside the track parallel with it and then at a signal previously agreed upona short wild barkthis sagacious dog would make the transit unanimously as it were by this method he commonly avoided a quarrel with the engine  altogether he was a very interesting beast and his master was fond of him no end and with the exception of compelling mr petto to remove to the centre of the state to avoid double taxation upon him he was not wholly unprofitable for he was the best sheepdog in the country he always kept the flock well together by the simple device of surrounding them having done so he would lie down and eat and eat and eat till there wasnt a sheep left except a few old rancid ones and even those he would tear into small spring lambs  dad petto never went anywhere without the superior portion of jerusalem at his side and he always alluded to him as the following dorg but the beast finally became a great nuisance in illinois his body obstructed the roads in all directions and the representative of that district in the national congress was instructed by his constituents to bring in a bill taxing dogs by the linear yard instead of by the head as the law then stood dad petto proceeded at once to washington to lobby against the measure he knew the wife of a clerk in the bureau of statistics armed with this influence he felt confident of success i was myself in washington at the time trying to secure the removal of a postmaster who was personally obnoxious to me inasmuch as i had been strongly recommended for the position by some leading citizens who to their high political characters superadded the more substantial merit of being my relations  dad and i were standing one morning in front of willards hotel when he stooped over and began patting jerusalem on the head all of a sudden the smiling brute sprang open his mouth and bade farewell to a succession of yells which speedily collected ten thousand miserable officeseekers and an equal quantity of brigadiergenerals who all in a breath inquired who had been stabbed and what was the name of the lady  meantime nothing would pacify the pup he howled most dismally punctuating his wails with quick sharp shrieks of mortal agony more than an hourmore than two hourswe strove to discover and allay the canine grievance but to no purpose  presently one of the hotel pages stepped up to mr petto handing him a telegraphic dispatch just received it was dated at his home in cowville illinois and making allowance for the difference in time something more than two hours previously it read as follows  a pot of boiling glue has just been upset upon jerusalems hindquarters shall i try rhubarb or let it get cold and chisel it off  ps he did it himself wagging his tail in the kitchen some democrat has been bribing that dog with cold victualspenelope petto  then we knew what ailed the following dorg  i should like to go on giving the reader a short account of this animals more striking personal peculiarities but the subject seems to grow under my hand the longer i write the longer he becomes and the more there is to tell and after all i shall not get a copper more for pourtraying all this length of dog than i would for depicting an orbicular pig     snaking   very talkative people always seemed to me to be divided into two classesthose who lie for a purpose and those who lie for the love of lying and sam baxter belonged with broad impartiality to both with him falsehood was not more frequently a means than an end for he would not only lie without a purpose but at a sacrifice i heard him once reading a newspaper to a blind aunt and deliberately falsifying the market reports the good old lady took it all in with a trustful faith until he quoted dried apples at fifty cents a yard for unbolted sides then she arose and disinherited him sam seemed to regard the fountain of truth as a stagnant pool and himself an angel whose business it was to stand by and trouble the waters  you know ben dean said sam to me one day im down on that fellow and ill tell you why in the winter of 68 he and i were snaking together in the mountains north of the big sandy  what do you mean by snaking sam  well i like that why gathering snakes to be surerattlesnakes for zoological gardens museums and sideshows to circuses this is how it is done a party of snakers go up to the mountains in the early autumn with provisions for all winter and putting up a snakery at some central point get to work as soon as the torpid season sets in and before there is much snow i presume you know that when the nights begin to get cold the snakes go in under big flat stones snuggle together and lie there frozen stiff until the warm days of spring limber them up for business  we go about raise up the rocks tie the worms into convenient bundles and carry them to the snakery where during the snow season they are assorted labelled according to quality and packed away for transportation sometimes a single showman will have as many as a dozen snakers in the mountains all winter  ben and i were out one day and had gathered a few sheaves of prime ones when we discovered a broad stone that showed good indications but we couldnt raise it the whole upper part of the mountain seemed to be built mostly upon this one stone there was nothing to be done but mole itdig under you know so taking the spade i soon widened the hole the creatures had got in at until it would admit my body crawling in i found a kind of cell in the solid rock stowed nearly full of beautiful serpents some of them as long as a man you would have revelled in those worms they were neatly disposed about the sides of the cave an even dozen in each berth and some odd ones swinging from the ceiling in hammocks like sailors by the time i had counted them roughly as they lay it was dark and snowing like the mischief there was no getting back to headquarters that night and there was room for but one of us inside  inside what sam  see here have you been listening to what im telling you or not there is no use telling you anything perhaps you wont mind waiting till i get done and then you can tell something of your own we drew straws to decide who should sleep inside and it fell to me such luck as that fellow ben always had drawing straws when i held them it was sinful but even inside it was coldish and i was more than an hour getting asleep toward morning though i woke feeling very warm and peaceful the moon was at full just rising in the valley below and shining in at the hole id entered at it made everything light as day  but sam according to my astronomy a full moon never rises towards morning  now who said anything about your astronomy id like to know who is telling thisyou or i always think you know more than i doand always swearing it isnt soand always taking the words out of my mouth andbut whats the use of arguing with you as i was saying the snakes began waking about the same time i did i could hear them turn over on their other sides and sigh presently one raised himself up and yawned he meant well but it was not the regular thing for an ophidian to do at that season byandby they began to poke their heads up all round nodding good morning to one another across the room and pretty soon one saw me lying there and called attention to the fact then they all began to crowd to the front and hang out over the sides of the beds in a fringe to study my habits i cant describe the strange spectacle you would have supposed it was the middle of march and a forward season there were more worms than i had counted and they were larger ones than i had thought and the more they got awake the wider they yawned and the longer they stretched the fat fellows in the hammocks above me were in danger of toppling out and breaking their necks every minute  then it went through my mind like a flash what was the matter finding it cold outside ben had made a roaring fire on the top of the rock and the heat had deceived the worms into the belief that it was late spring as i lay there and thought of a fullgrown man who hadnt any better sense than to do such a thing as that i was mad enough to kill him i lost confidence in mankind if i had not stopped up the entrance before lying down with a big round stone which the heat had swollen so that a hydraulic ram couldnt have butted it loose i should have put on my clothes and gone straight home  but sam you said the entrance was open and the moon shining in  there you go again always contradictingand insinuating that the moon must remain for hours in one positionand saying youve heard it told better by some one elseand wanting to fight ive told this story to your brother over at milk river more than a hundred million times and he never said a word against it  i believe you samuel for he is deaf as a tombstone  tell you what to do for him i know a fellow in smiths valley will cure him in a minute that fellow has cleaned the deafness all out of washington county a dozen times i never knew a case of it that could stand up against him ten seconds take three parts of snakeroot to a gallon of waggongrease andill go and see if i can find the prescription  and sam was off like a rocket                                          mauds papa  that is she in the old black silkthe one with the gimlet curls and the accelerated lapcat doesnt she average about as i set her forth  never told you anything about her well i will  twenty years ago many a young man of otherwise good character would have ameliorated his condition for that girl and would have thought himself overpaid if she had restored a fosy on his sepulchre maud would have been of the same opinionand wouldnt have construed the fosy and she was the most sagacious girl i ever experienced as you shall hear  i was her lover and she was mine we loved ourselves to detraction maud lived a mile from any other houseexcept one brick barn not even a watchdog about the placeexcept her father this pompous old weakling hated me boisterously he said i was dedicated to hard drink and when in that condition was perfectly incompatible i did not like him too  one evening i called on maud and was surprised to meet her at the gate with a shawl drawn over her head and apparently in great combustion she told me hastily the old man was ill of a fever and had nearly derided her by going crazy  this was all a lie something had gone wrong with the old partys eyesamanuensis of the equinox or something he couldnt see well but he was no more crazy than i was sober  i was sitting quietly by him said maud when he sat up in bed and began you never in all your born life im so glad youve come you can take care of him while i fetch the doctor hes quiet enough now but you just wait till he gets another paralogism when theyre onoh my you mustnt let him talk nor get out of bed doctor says it would prolong the diagnosis go right in now oh dear whatever shall i ought to do  and blowing her eyes on the corner of her shawl maud shot away like a comic  i walked hurriedly into the house and entered the old mans dromedary without knocking  the playful girl had left that room a moment before with every appearance of being frightened she had told the old one there was a robber in the house and the venerable invalid was a howling cowardi tell you this because i scorn to deceive you  i found the old gentleman with his head under the blankets very quiet and speaceful but the moment he heard me he got up and yelled like a heliotrope then he fixed on me a wild spiercing look from his bloodshot eyes and for the first time in my life i believed maud had told me the truth for the first time in hers then he reached out for a heavy cane but i was too punctual for him and clapping my hand on his breast i crowded him down holding him tight he curvetted some then lay still and swore weak oaths that wouldnt have hurt a sick chicken all this time i was firm as a rock of amaranth presently moreover he spoke very low and resigned likeexcept his teeth chattered  desperate man there is no need you will find it to the northwest corner of my upper secretary drawer i spromise not to appear  all right my lobstersnouted bulbul said i delighted with the importunity of abusing him that is the dryest place you could keep it in old spoolcotton be sure you dont let the light get to it angleworm meantime therefore you must take this draught  draught he shrieked meandering from the subject o my poor childand he sprang up again screaming a multiple of things  i had him by the shoulders in a minute and crushed him backexcept his legs kept agitating  keep still will you said i you sugarcoated old mandible or ill conciliate your exegesis with a proletarian  i never had such a flow of language in my life i could say anything i wanted to  he quailed at that threat for deleterious as i thought him he saw i meant it but he affected to prefer it that way to taking it out of the bottle  better he moaned better even that than the poison spare me the poisoned chalice and you may do it in the way you mention  the draught it may be sproper to explain was comprised in a large bottle sitting on the table i thought it was medicineexcept it was blackand although maud sweet screature had not told me to give him anything i felt sure this was nasty enough for him or anybody and it was it was ink so i treated his proposed compromise with silent contempt merely remarking as i uncorked the bottle medicines medicine my fine friend and it is for the sick then spinioning his arms with one of mine i concerted the neck of the bottle between his teeth  now you lacustrine old cylinderescapement i exclaimed with some warmth hand up your stomach for this healing precoction or im blest if i wont controvert your raison dêtre  he struggled hard but owing to my habit of finishing what i undertake without any success in ten minutes it was all downexcept that some of it was spouted about rather circumstantially over the bedding and walls and me there was more of the draught than i had thought as he had been two days ill i had supposed the bottle must be nearly empty but of course when you think of it a man doesnt abrogate much ink in an ordinary attackexcept editors  just as i got my knees off the spatients breast maud peeped in at the door she had remained in the lane till she thought the charm had had time to hibernate then came in to have her laugh she began having it gently but seeing me with the empty bottle in my sable hand and the murky inspiration rolling off my face in gasconades she got graver and came in very soberly  wherewith the draught had done its duty and the old gentleman was enjoying the first rest he had known since i came to heal him he is enjoying it yet for he was as dead as a monogram  as there was a good deal of scandal about my killing a sprospective fatherinlaw i had to live it down by not marrying maudwho has lived single as a rule ever since all this epigastric tercentenary might have been avoided if she had only allowed a good deal of margin for my probable condition when she splanned her little practicable joke  why didnt they hang me waiter bring me a brandy spunchwell that is the most didactic question but if you must knowthey did                                          jim beckwourths pond   not long after that said old jim beckwourth beginning a new story there was a party of about a dozen of us down in the powder river country after buffalo it was the worst place just think of the most barren and sterile spot you ever saw or ever will see now take that spot and double it that is where we were one day about noon we halted near a sickly little arroyo that was just damp enough to have deluded some feeble bunches of bonnetwire into setting up as grass along its banks after picketing the horses and packmules we took luncheon and then while the others smoked and played cards for halfdollars i took my rifle and strolled off into the hills to see if i could find a blind rabbit or a lame antelope that had been unable to leave the country as i went on i heard at intervals of about a quarter of an hour a strange throbbing sound as of smothered thunder which grew more distinct as i advanced presently i came upon a lake of near a mile in diameter and almost circular it was as calm and even as a mirror but i could see by a light steamy haze above it that the water was nearly at boiling heata not very uncommon circumstance in that region while i looked big bubbles began to rise to the surface chase one another about and burst and suddenly without any other preliminary movement there occurred the most awful and astounding event that with a single exception it has ever been my lot to witness i stood rooted to the spot with horror and when it was all over and again the lake lay smiling placidly before me i silently thanked heaven i had been standing at some distance from the deceitful pool in a quarter of an hour the frightful scene was repeated preceded as before by the rising and bursting of bubbles and producing in me the utmost terror but after seeing it three or four times i became calm then i went back to camp and told the boys there was a tolerably interesting pond near by if they cared for such things  at first they did not but when i had thrown in a few lies about the brilliant hues of the water and the great number of swans they laid down their cards left lame dave to look after the horses and followed me back to see just before we crossed the last range of hills we heard a thundering sound ahead which somewhat astonished the boys but i said nothing till we stood on a low knoll overlooking the lake there it lay as peaceful as a dead indian of a dull grey colour and as innocent of waterfowl as a newborn babe  there said i triumphantly pointing to it  well said bill buckster leaning on his rifle and surveying it critically whats the matter with the pond i dont see nothin in that puddle  whars yer swans asked gus jamison  and yer prismatic warter added stumpy jack  well i like this drawled frenchwoman pete what n thunder d ye mean you derned saddlecoloured fraud  i was a little nettled at all this particularly as the lake seemed to have buried the hatchet for that day but i thought i would cheek it through  just you wait i replied significantly  o yes exclaimed stumpy derisively course boys you mus wait taint no use ahurryin up the cattle yer mustnt rush the buck jest wait till some feller comes along with a melted rainbow and lays on the warpaint and another feller fetches the swans eggs and sets on em and hatches em outand me aholding both bowers an the ace he added regretfully thinking of the certainty he had left to follow a delusive hope  then i pointed out to them a wide margin of wet and steaming clay surrounding the water on all sides asking them if that wasnt worth coming to see  that exclaimed gus ive seen the same thing a thousand million times its the reglar thing in idaho clay soaks up the water and sweats it out  to verify his theory he started away down to the shore i was concerned for gus but i did not dare call him back for fear of betraying my secret in some way besides i knew he would not come and he ought not to have been so sceptical anyhow  just then two or three big bubbles rose to the surface and silently exploded quick as lightning i dropped on my knees and raised my arms  now may heaven grant my prayer i began with awful solemnity and send the great ranunculus to loose the binding chain of concupiscence heaving the multitudinous aquacity upon the heads of this wicked and sententious generation whelming these diametrical scoffers in a supercilious constantinople  i knew the long words would impress their simple souls with a belief that i was actually praying and i was right for every man of them pulled his hat off and stood staring at me with a mixed look of reverence incredulity and astonishmentbut not for long for before i could say amen yours truly or anything that entire body of water shot upward five hundred feet into the air as smooth as a column of crystal curled over in broad green cataracts falling outward with a jar and thunder like the explosion of a thousand subterranean cannon then surging and swirling back to the centre one steaming writhing mass of snowy foam  as i rose to my feet to put my hand in my pocket for a chew of tobacco i looked complacently about upon my comrades stumpy jack stood paralysed his head thrown back at an alarming angle precisely as he had tilted it to watch the ascending column and his neck somehow out of joint holding it there all the others were down upon their marrowbones white with terror praying with extraordinary fervency each trying his best to master the ridiculous jargon they had heard me use but employing it with an even greater disregard of sense and fitness than i did away over on the next range of hills toward camp was something that looked like a giant spider scrambling up the steep side of the sandhill and sliding down a trifle faster than it got up it was lame dave who had abandoned his equine trust to come up at the eleventh hour and see the swans he had seen enough and was now trying in his weak way to get back to camp  in a few minutes i had got stumpys head back into the position assigned it by nature had crowded his eyes in and was going about with a reassuring smile helping the pious upon their feet not a word was spoken i took the lead and we strode solemnly to camp picking up lame dave at the foot of his acclivity played a little game for gus jamisons horse and calamities then mounted our steeds departing thence three or four days afterward i ventured cautiously upon a covert allusion to peculiar lakes but the simultaneous clicking of ten revolvers convinced me that i need not trouble myself to pursue the subject                                          stringing a bear   i was looking for my horse one morning up in the san joaquin valley said old sandy fowler absently stirring the camp fire when i saw a big bull grizzly lying in the sunshine picking his teeth with his claws and smiling as if he said you need not mind the horse old fellow hes been found i at once gave a loud whoop which i thought would be heard by the boys in the camp and prepared to string the brute  oh i know how it goes interrupted smarty mellor as we called him seen it done heaps o times six or eight o ye rides up to the bar and srounds him every sonofagun with a riata a mile long and worries him till he gits his mad up and while hes achasin one feller the others is agoin äter him and afloorin of him by loopin his feet as they comes up behind and when he turns onto them fellers the other chappy turns onto him and puts another loop onto his feet as they comes up behind and then  i bound my riata tightly about my wrist resumed old sandy composedly so that the beast should not jerk away when i had got him then i advanced upon himvery slowly so as not to frighten him away seeing me coming he rose upon his haunches to have a look at me he was about the size of a housesay a small twostorey house with a mansard roof i paused a moment to take another turn of the thong about my wrist  again i moved obliquely forward trying to look as if i were thinking about the new waterworks in san francisco or the next presidential election so as not to frighten him away the brute now rose squarely upon end with his paws suspended before him like a dog begging for a biscuit and i thought what a very large biscuit he must be begging for halting a moment to see if the riata was likely to cut into my wrist i perceived the beast had an inkling of my design and was trying stupidly to stretch his head up out of reach  i now threw off all disguise and whirled my cord with a wide circular sweep and in another moment it would have been very unpleasant for bruin but somehow the line appeared to get foul while i was opening the noose the animal settled upon his feet and came toward me but the moment he saw me begin to whirl again he got frightened upended himself as before and shut his eyes  then i felt in my belt to see if my knife was there when the bear got down again and came forward utterly regardless  seeing he was frightened and trying to escape by coming so close i could not have a fair fling at him i dropped the noose on the ground and walked away trailing the line behind me when it was all run out the rascal arrived at the loop he first smelled it then opened it with his paws and putting it about his neck tilted up again and nodded significantly  i pulled out my knife and severing the line at my wrist walked away looking for some one to introduce me to smarty mellor
