eddies there glimmered the customed landscape    yonder and near  blotted to feeble mist  and the coomb and the upland    foliagecrowned ancient chalkpit milestone rills in the grassflat    stroked by the light seemed but a ghostlike gauze and no substantial    meadow or mound  what were the infinite spectacles bulking foremost    under my sight hindering me to discern my paced advancement    lengthening to miles what were the recreations killing the daytime    as by the night  o they were speechful faces gazing insistent    some as with smiles some as with slowborn tears that brinily trundled    over the wrecked cheeks that were fair in their flushtime ash now with anguish    harrowed by wiles  yes i could see them feel them hear them address them     halobedecked  and alas

blow the trumpet if indeed i ever do for you are men and rest eternal sorely need  so down we lay again  i wonder will the world ever saner be said one than when he sent us under in our indifferent century  and many a skeleton shook his head instead of preaching forty year my neighbour parson thirdly said i wish i had stuck to pipes and beer  again the guns disturbed the hour roaring their readiness to avenge as far inland as stourton tower and camelot and starlit stonehenge  april 1914    the convergence of the twain    lines on the loss of the titanic  i     in a solitude of the sea

the smart ship grew    in stature grace and hue in shadowy silent distance grew the iceberg too  ix     alien they seemed to be    no mortal eye could see the intimate welding of their later history  x     or sign that they were bent    by paths coincident on being anon twin halves of one august event  xi     till the spinner of the years    said now  and each one hears and consummation comes and jars two hemispheres    the ghost of the past    we two kept house the past and i    the past and i i tended while it hovered nigh    leaving me never alone it was a spectral housekeeping    where fell no jarring tone as strange as still a housekeeping    as ever has been known  as daily i went up the stair    and down the stair i did not mind the bygone there     the present once to me its moving meek companionship    i wished might ever be there was in that companionship    something of ecstasy  it dwelt with me just as it was    just as it was when first its prospects gave me pause    in wayward wanderings before the years had torn old troths    as they tear all sweet things before gaunt griefs had torn old troths    and dulled old rapturings  and then its form began to fade    began to fade its gentle echoes faintlier played    at eves upon my ear than when the autumns look embrowned    the lonely chambers here the autumns settling shades embrowned    nooks that it haunted near  and so with time my vision less    yea less and less makes of that past my housemistress    it dwindles in my eye it looms a faroff skeleton    and not a comrade nigh a fitful faroff skeleton    dimming as days draw by    after the visit to f e d       come again to the place where your presence was as a leaf that skims down a drouthy way whose ascent bedims    the bloom on the farers face     come again with the feet that were light on the green as a thistledown ball and those mute ministrations to one and to all    beyond a mans saying sweet     until then the faint scent of the bordering flowers swam unheeded away and i marked not the charm in the changes of day    as the cloudcolours came and went     through the dark corridors your walk was so soundless i did not know your form from a phantoms of long ago    said to pass on the ancient floors     till you drew from the shade and i saw the large luminous living eyes regard me in fixed inquiringwise    as those of a soul that weighed     scarce consciously the eternal question of what life was and why we were there and by whose strange laws    that which mattered most could not be    to meet or otherwise    whether to sally and see thee girl of my dreams    or whether to stay and see thee not  how vast the difference seems    of yea from nay just now  yet this same sun will slant its beams    at no far day on our two mounds and then what will the difference weigh  yet i will see thee maiden dear and make    the most i can of what remains to us amid this brake cimmerian through which we grope and from whose thorns we ache    while still we scan round our frail faltering progress for some path or plan  by briefest meeting something sure is won    it will have been nor god nor daemon can undo the done    unsight the seen make muted music be as unbegun    though things terrene groan in their bondage till oblivion supervene  so to the one longsweeping symphony    from times remote till now of human tenderness shall we    supply one note small and untraced yet that will ever be    somewhere afloat amid the spheres as part of sick lifes antidote    the difference    i  sinking down by the gate i discern the thin moon and a blackbird tries over old airs in the pine but the moon is a sorry one sad the birds tune for this spot is unknown to that heartmate of mine  ii  did my heartmate but haunt here at times such as now the song would be joyous and cheerful the moon but she will see never this gate path or bough nor i find a joy in the scene or the tune    the sun on the bookcase students lovesong    once more the cauldron of the sun smears the bookcase with winy red and here my page is and there my bed and the appletree shadows travel along soon their intangible track will be run    and dusk grow strong    and they be fled  yes  now the boiling ball is gone and i have wasted another day    but wastedwasted do i say is it a waste to have imaged one beyond the hills there who anon    my great deeds done    will be mine alway    when i set out for lyonnesse    when i set out for lyonnesse    a hundred miles away    the rime was on the spray and starlight lit my lonesomeness when i set out for lyonnesse    a hundred miles away  what would bechance at lyonnesse    while i should sojourn there    no prophet durst declare nor did the wisest wizard guess what would bechance at lyonnesse    while i should sojourn there  when i came back from lyonnesse    with magic in my eyes    none managed to surmise what meant my godlike gloriousness when i came back from lyonnesse    with magic in my eyes    a thunderstorm in town a reminiscence    she wore a new terracotta dress and we stayed because of the pelting storm within the hansoms dry recess though the horse had stopped yea motionless    we sat on snug and warm  then the downpour ceased to my sharp sad pain and the glass that had screened our forms before flew up and out she sprang to her door i should have kissed her if the rain    had lasted a minute more    the torn letter    i  i tore your letter into strips    no bigger than the airy feathers    that ducks preen out in changing weathers upon the shifting rippletips  ii  in darkness on my bed alone    i seemed to see you in a vision    and hear you say  why this derision of one drawn to you though unknown  iii  yes eves quick mood had run its course    the night had cooled my hasty madness    i suffered a regretful sadness which deepened into real remorse  iv  i thought what pensive patient days    a soul must know of grain so tender    how much of good must grace the sender of such sweet words in such bright phrase  v  uprising then as things unpriced    i sought each fragment patched and mended    the midnight whitened ere i had ended and gathered words i had sacrificed  vi  but some alas of those i threw    were past my search destroyed for ever    they were your name and place and never did i regain those clues to you  vii  i learnt i had missed by rash unheed    my track that so the will decided    in life death we should be divided and at the sense i ached indeed  viii  that ache for you born long ago    throbs on i never could outgrow it    what a revenge did you but know it but that thank god you do not know    beyond the last lamp near tooting common    i  while rain with eve in partnership descended darkly drip drip drip beyond the last lone lamp i passed    walking slowly whispering sadly    two linked loiterers wan downcast some heavy thought constrained each face and blinded them to time and place  ii  the pair seemed lovers yet absorbed in mental scenes no longer orbed by loves young rays  each countenance    as it slowly as it sadly    caught the lamplights yellow glance held in suspense a misery at things which had been or might be  iii  when i retrod that watery way some hours beyond the droop of day still i found pacing there the twain    just as slowly just as sadly    heedless of the night and rain one could but wonder who they were and what wild woe detained them there  iv  though thirty years of blur and blot have slid since i beheld that spot and saw in curious converse there    moving slowly moving sadly    that mysterious tragic pair its olden look may linger on  all but the couple they have gone  v  whither  who knows indeed    and yet to me when nights are weird and wet without those comrades there at tryst    creeping slowly creeping sadly    that lone lane does not exist there they seem brooding on their pain and will while such a lane remain    the face at the casement       if ever joy leave an abiding sting of sorrow so befell it on the morrow    of that may eve        the travelled sun dropped to the northwest low and lower the ponys trot grew slower    and then we stopped     this cosy house just by i must call at for a minute a sick man lies within it    who soon will die     he wished to marry me so i am bound when i drive near him to inquire if but to cheer him    how he may be     a message was sent in and wordlessly we waited till some one came and stated    the bulletin     and that the sufferer said for her call no words could thank her as his angel he must rank her    till lifes spark fled     slowly we drove away when i turned my head although not called why so i turned i know not    even to this day     and lo there in my view pressed against an upper lattice was a white face gazing at us    as we withdrew     and well did i divine it to be the mans there dying who but lately had been sighing    for her pledged mine     then i deigned a deed of hell it was done before i knew it what devil made me do it    i cannot tell     yes while he gazed above i put my arm about her that he might see nor doubt her    my plighted love     the pale face vanished quick as if blasted from the casement and my shame and selfabasement    began their prick     and they prick on ceaselessly for that stab in loves fierce fashion which unfired by lovers passion    was foreign to me     she smiled at my caress but why came the soft embowment of her shoulder at that moment    she did not guess     long long years has he lain in thy garth o sad saint cleather what tears there bared to weather    will cleanse that stain     love is longsuffering brave sweet prompt precious as a jewel but o too love is cruel    cruel as the grave    lost love    i play my sweet old airs     the airs he knew    when our love was true     but he does not balk    his determined walk and passes up the stairs  i sing my songs once more    and presently hear    his footstep near    as if it would stay    but he goes his way and shuts a distant door  so i wait for another morn    and another night    in this soulsick blight    and i wonder much    as i sit why such a woman as i was born    my spirit will not haunt the mound    my spirit will not haunt the mound    above my breast but travel memorypossessed to where my tremulous being found    life largest best  my phantomfooted shape will go    when nightfall grays hither and thither along the ways i and another used to know    in backward days  and there youll find me if a jot    you still should care for me and for my curious air if otherwise then i shall not    for you be there    wessex heights 1896    there are some heights in wessex shaped as if by a kindly hand for thinking dreaming dying on and at crises when i stand say on ingpen beacon eastward or on wyllsneck westwardly i seem where i was before my birth and after death may be  in the lowlands i have no comrade not even the lone mans friend  her who suffereth long and is kind accepts what he is too weak to mend down there they are dubious and askance there nobody thinks as i but mindchains do not clank where ones next neighbour is the sky  in the towns i am tracked by phantoms having weird detective ways  shadows of beings who fellowed with myself of earlier days they hang about at places and they say harsh heavy things  men with a frigid sneer and women with tart disparagings  down there i seem to be false to myself my simple self that was and is not now and i see him watching wondering what crass cause can have merged him into such a strange continuator as this who yet has something in common with himself my chrysalis  i cannot go to the great grey plain theres a figure against the moon nobody sees it but i and it makes my breast beat out of tune i cannot go to the tallspired town being barred by the forms now passed for everybody but me in whose long vision they stand there fast  theres a ghost at yellham bottom chiding loud at the fall of the night theres a ghost in froomside vale thin lipped and vague in a shroud of white there is one in the railwaytrain whenever i do not want it near i see its profile against the pane saying what i would not hear  as for one rare fair woman i am now but a thought of hers i enter her mind and another thought succeeds me that she prefers yet my love for her in its fulness she herself even did not know well time cures hearts of tenderness and now i can let her go  so i am found on ingpen beacon or on wyllsneck to the west or else on homely bulbarrow or little pilsdon crest where men have never cared to haunt nor women have walked with me and ghosts then keep their distance and i know some liberty    in death divided    i     i shall rot here with those whom in their day       you never knew    and alien ones who ere they chilled to clay       met not my view will in your distant graveplace ever neighbour you  ii     no shade of pinnacle or tree or tower       while earth endures    will fall on my mound and within the hour       steal on to yours one robin never haunt our two green covertures  iii     some organ may resound on sunday noons       by where you lie    some other thrill the panes with other tunes       where moulder i no selfsame chords compose our common lullaby  iv     the simplycut memorial at my head       perhaps may take    a gothic form and that above your bed       be greek in make no linking symbol show thereon for our tales sake  v     and in the monotonous moils of strained hardrun       humanity    the eternal tie which binds us twain in one       no eye will see stretching across the miles that sever you from me    the place on the map    i     i look upon the map that hangs by me  its shires and towns and rivers lined in varnished artistry     and i mark a jutting height coloured purple with a margin of blue sea  ii    twas a day of latter summer hot and dry ay even the waves seemed drying as we walked on she and i    by this spot where calmly quite she informed me what would happen by and by  iii     this hanging map depicts the coast and place and resuscitates therewith our unexpected troublous case    all distinctly to my sight and her tension and the aspect of her face  iv     weeks and weeks we had loved beneath that blazing blue which had lost the art of raining as her eyes today had too    while she told what as by sleight shot our firmament with rays of ruddy hue  v     for the wonder and the wormwood of the whole was that what in realms of reason would have joyed our double soul    wore a torrid tragic light under orderkeepings rigorous control  vi     so the map revives her words the spot the time and the thing we found we had to face before the next years prime    the charted coast stares bright and its episode comes back in pantomime    where the picnic was    where we made the fire in the summer time of branch and briar on the hill to the sea i slowly climb through winter mire and scan and trace the forsaken place quite readily  now a cold wind blows and the grass is gray but the spot still shows as a burnt circleaye and stickends charred still strew the sward whereon i stand last relic of the band who came that day  yes i am here just as last year and the sea breathes brine from its strange straight line up hither the same as when we four came  but two have wandered far from this grassy rise into urban roar where no picnics are and onehas shut her eyes for evermore    the schreckhorn with thoughts of leslie stephen june 1897    aloof as if a thing of mood and whim now that its spare and desolate figure gleams upon my nearing vision less it seems a looming alpheight than a guise of him who scaled its horn with ventured life and limb drawn on by vague imaginings maybe of semblance to his personality in its quaint glooms keen lights and rugged trim  at his last change when lifes dull coils unwind will he in old love hitherward escape and the eternal essence of his mind enter this silent adamantine shape and his low voicing haunt its slipping snows when dawn that calls the climber dyes them rose    a singer asleep algernon charles swinburne 18371909    i  in this fair niche above the unslumbering sea that sentrys up and down all night all day from cove to promontory from ness to bay    the fates have fitly bidden that he should be pillowed eternally  ii   it was as though a garland of red roses had fallen about the hood of some smug nun when irresponsibly dropped as from the sun in fulth of numbers freaked with musical closes upon victorias formal middle time    his leaves of rhythm and rhyme  iii  o that far morning of a summer day when down a terraced street whose pavements lay glassing the sunshine into my bent eyes i walked and read with a quick glad surprise    new words in classic guise   iv  the passionate pages of his earlier years fraught with hot sighs sad laughters kisses tears freshfluted notes yet from a minstrel who blew them not naively but as one who knew    full well why thus he blew  v  i still can hear the brabble and the roar at those thy tunes o still one now passed through that fitful fire of tongues then entered new their power is spent like spindrift on this shore    thine swells yet more and more  vi   his singingmistress verily was no other than she the lesbian she the musicmother of all the tribe that feel in melodies who leapt loveanguished from the leucadian steep into the rambling worldencircling deep    which hides her where none sees  vii  and one can hold in thought that nightly here his phantom may draw down to the waters brim and hers come up to meet it as a dim lone shine upon the heaving hydrosphere and mariners wonder as they traverse near    unknowing of her and him  viii  one dreams him sighing to her spectral form o teacher where lies hid thy burning line where are those songs o poetess divine whose very arts are love incarnadine and her smile back  disciple true and warm    sufficient now are thine     ix  so here beneath the waking constellations where the waves peal their everlasting strains and their dull subterrene reverberations shake him when storms make mountains of their plains  him once their peer in sad improvisations and deft as wind to cleave their frothy manes  i leave him while the daylight gleam declines    upon the capes and chines  bonchurch 1910    a plaint to man    when you slowly emerged from the den of time and gained percipience as you grew and fleshed you fair out of shapeless slime  wherefore o man did there come to you the unhappy need of creating me  a form like your ownfor praying to  my virtue power utility within my maker must all abide since none in myself can ever be  one thin as a shape on a lanternslide shown forth in the dark upon some dim sheet and by none but its showman vivified  such a forced device you may say is meet for easing a loaded heart at whiles man needs to conceive of a mercyseat  somewhere above the gloomy aisles of this wailful world or he could not bear the irk no local hope beguiles   but since i was framed in your first despair the doing without me has had no play in the minds of men when shadows scare  and now that i dwindle day by day beneath the deicide eyes of seers in a light that will not let me stay  and tomorrow the whole of me disappears the truth should be told and the fact be faced that had best been faced in earlier years  the fact of life with dependence placed on the human hearts resource alone in brotherhood bonded close and graced  with lovingkindness fully blown and visioned help unsought unknown  190910    gods funeral    i     i saw a slowlystepping train  lined on the brows scoopeyed and bent and hoar  following in files across a twilit plain a strange and mystic form the foremost bore  ii     and by contagious throbs of thought or latent knowledge that within me lay and had already stirred me i was wrought to consciousness of sorrow even as they  iii     the foreborne shape to my blurred eyes at first seemed manlike and anon to change to an amorphous cloud of marvellous size at times endowed with wings of glorious range  iv     and this phantasmal variousness ever possessed it as they drew along yet throughout all it symboled none the less potency vast and lovingkindness strong  v     almost before i knew i bent towards the moving columns without a word they growing in bulk and numbers as they went struck out sick thoughts that could be overheard  vi     o manprojected figure of

be  x     so toward our myths oblivion darkling and languidlipped we creep and grope sadlier than those who wept in babylon whose zion was a still abiding hope  xi     how sweet it was in years far hied to start the wheels of day with trustful prayer to lie down liegely at the eventide and feel a blest assurance he was there  xii     and who or what shall fill his place whither will wanderers turn distracted eyes for some fixed star to stimulate their pace towards the goal of their enterprise     xiii     some in the background then i saw sweet women youths men all incredulous who chimed as one  this figure is of straw this requiem mockery  still he lives to us  xiv     i could not prop their faith  and yet many i had known  with all i sympathized and though struck speechless i did not forget that what was mourned for i too once had prized  xv     still how to bear such loss i deemed the insistent question for each animate mind and gazing to my growing sight there seemed a pale yet positive gleam low down behind  xvi     whereof to lift the general night a certain few who stood aloof had said see you upon the horizon that small light  swelling somewhat  each mourner shook his head  xvii     and they composed a crowd of whom some were right good and many nigh the best    thus dazed and puzzled twixt the gleam and gloom mechanically i followed with the rest  190810    spectres that grieve    it is not death that harrows us they lipped the soundless cell is in itself relief for life is an unfenced flower benumbed and nipped at unawares and at its best but brief  the speakers sundry phantoms of the gone had risen like filmy flames of phosphor dye as if the palest of sheet lightnings shone from the sward near me as from a nether sky  and much surprised was i that spent and dead they should not like the many be at rest but stray as apparitions hence i said why having slipped life hark you back distressed  we are among the few death sets not free the hurt misrepresented names who come at each years brink and cry to history to do them justice or go past them dumb  we are stript of rights our shames lie unredressed our deeds in full anatomy are not shown our words in morsels merely are expressed on the scriptured page our motives blurred unknown  then all these shaken slighted visitants sped into the vague and left me musing there on fames that well

trot i am sorry but i quite forgot    it was your restingplace     satires of circumstances in fifteen glimpses     iat tea    the kettle descants in a cozy drone and the young wife looks in her husbands face and then at her guests and shows in her own her sense that she fills an envied place and the visiting lady is all abloom and says there was never so sweet a room  and the happy young housewife does not know that the woman beside her was first his choice till the fates ordained it could not be so    betraying nothing in look or voice the guest sits smiling and sips her tea and he throws her a stray glance yearningly    iiin church    and now to god the father he ends and his voice thrills up to the topmost tiles each listener chokes as he bows and bends and emotion pervades the crowded aisles then the preacher glides to the vestrydoor and shuts it and thinks he is seen no more  the door swings softly ajar meanwhile and a pupil of his in the bible class who adores him as one without gloss or guile sees her idol stand with a satisfied smile and reenact at the vestryglass each pulpit gesture in deft dumbshow that had moved the congregation so    iiiby her aunts grave

the weddingdressthe wife to be  then why were you so mollyish as not to insist on him for me the mother amazed  why dearest one because you pleaded for this or none  but father and you should have stood out strong since then to my cost i have lived to find that you were right and that i was wrong this man is a dolt to the one declined    ahhere he comes with his buttonhole rose good godi must marry him i suppose    vat a wateringplace    they sit and smoke on the esplanade the man and his friend and regard the bay where the far chalk cliffs to the left displayed smile sallowly in the decline of day and saunterers pass with laugh and jest  a handsome couple among the rest  that smart proud pair says the man to his friend are to marry next week    how little he thinks that dozens of days and nights on end i have stroked her neck unhooked the links of her sleeve to get at her upper arm    well bliss is in ignorance  whats the harm    vi in the cemetery    you see those mothers squabbling there remarks the man of the cemetery one says in tears tis mine lies here another nay mine you pharisee another how dare you move my flowers and put your own on this grave of ours but all their children were laid therein at different times like sprats in a tin  and then the main drain had to cross and we moved the lot some nights ago and packed them away in the general foss with hundreds more  but their folks dont know and as well cry over a newlaid drain as anything else to ease your pain    viioutside the window    my stick he says and turns in the lane to the house just left whence a vixen voice comes out with the firelight through the pane and he sees within that the girl of his choice stands rating her mother with eyes aglare for something said while he was there  at last i behold her soul undraped thinks the man who had loved her more than himself my godtis but narrowly i have escaped  my precious porcelain proves it delf his face has reddened like one ashamed and he steals off leaving his stick unclaimed    viiiin the study    he enters and mute on the edge of a chair sits a thinfaced lady a stranger there a type of decayed gentility and by some small signs he well can guess that she comes to him almost breakfastless  i have calledi hope i do not err  i am looking for a purchaser of some score volumes of the works of eminent divines i own  left by my fatherthough it irks my patience to offer them  and she smiles as if necessity were unknown but the truth of it is that oftenwhiles i have wished as i am fond of art to make my rooms a little smart and lightly still she laughs to him as if to sell were a mere gay whim and that to be frank life were indeed to her not vinegar and gall but fresh and honeylike and need no household skeleton at all    ixat the altarrail    my bride is not coming alas says the groom and the telegram shakes in his hand  i own it was hurried  we met at a dancingroom when i went to the cattleshow alone and then next night where the fountain leaps and the street of the quartercircle sweeps  ay she won me to ask her to be my wife  twas foolish perhapsto forsake the ways of the flaring town for a farmers life she agreed  and we fixed it  now she says its sweet of you dear to prepare me a nest but a swift short gay life suits me best what i really am you have never gleaned i had eaten the apple ere you were weaned    xin the nuptial chamber    o that mastering tune  and up in the bed like a lacerobed phantom springs the bride and why asks the man she had that day wed with a start as the band plays on outside its the townsfolks cheery compliment because of our marriage my innocent  o but you dont know  tis the passionate air to which my old love waltzed with me and i swore as we spun that none should share my home my kisses till death save he and he dominates me and thrills me through and its he i embrace while embracing you    xiin the restaurant    but hear  if you stay and the child be born it will pass as your husbands with the rest while if we fly the teeth of scorn will be gleaming at us from east to west and the child will come as a life despised i feel an elopement is illadvised  o you realize not what it is my dear to a woman  daily and hourly alarms lest the truth should out  how can i stay here and nightly take him into my arms come to the child no name or fame let us go and face it and bear the shame    xiiat the drapers    i stood at the back of the shop my dear    but you did not perceive me well when they deliver what you were shown    i shall know nothing of it believe me  and he coughed and coughed as she paled and said    o i didnt see you come in there  why couldnt you speakwell i didnt  i left    that you should not notice id been there  you were viewing some lovely things  soon required    for a widow of latest fashion and i knew twould upset you to meet the man    who had to be cold and ashen  and screwed in a box before they could dress you    in the last new note in mourning as they defined it  so not to distress you    i left you to your adorning    xiiion the deathbed    ill tellbeing past all praying for  then promptly die    he was out at the war and got some scent of the intimacy that was under way between her and me and he stole back home and appeared like a ghost one night at the very time almost that i reached her house  well i shot him dead and secretly buried him  nothing was said  the news of the battle came next day he was scheduled missing  i hurried away got out there visited the field and sent home word that a search revealed he was one of the slain though lying alone   and stript his body had not been known  but she suspected  i lost her love   yea my hope of earth and of heaven above and my times now come and ill pay the score though it be burning for evermore    xivover the coffin    they stand confronting the coffin between his wife of old and his wife of late and the dead man whose they both had been seems listening aloof as to things past date i have called says the first  do you marvel or not in truth says the second i dosomewhat  well there was a word to be said by me    i divorced that man because of you  it seemed i must do it boundenly but now i am older and tell you true for life is little and dead lies he i would i had let alone you two and both of us scorning parochial ways had lived like the wives in the patriarchs days    xvin the moonlight    o lonely workman standing there in a dream why do you stare and stare at her grave as no other grave there were  if your great gaunt eyes so importune her soul by the shine of this corpsecold moon maybe youll raise her phantom soon  why fool it is what i would rather see than all the living folk there be but alas there is no such joy for me  ahshe was one you loved no doubt through good and evil through rain and drought and when she passed all your sun went out  nay  she was the woman i did not love whom all the others were ranked above whom during her life i thought nothing of     lyrics and reveries continued     selfunconscious       along the way    he walked that day watching shapes that reveries limn    and seldom he    had eyes to see the moment that encompassed him     bright yellowhammers    made mirthful clamours and billed long straws with a bustling air    and bearing their load    flew up the road that he followed alone without interest there     from bank to ground    and over and round they sidled along the adjoining hedge    sometimes to the gutter    their yellow flutter would dip from the nearest slatestone ledge     the smooth sealine    with a metal shine and flashes of white and a sail thereon    he would also descry    with a halfwrapt eye between the projects he mused upon     yes round him were these    earths artistries but specious plans that came to his call    did most engage    his pilgrimage while himself he did not see at all     dead now as sherds    are the yellow birds and all that mattered has passed away    yet god the elf    now shows him that self as he was and should have been shown that day     o it would have been good    could he then have stood at a focussed distance and conned the whole    but now such vision    is mere derision nor soothes his body nor saves his soul     not much some may    incline to say to see therein had it all been seen    nay he is aware    a thing was there that loomed with an immortal mien    the discovery       i wandered to a crude coast       like a ghost    upon the hills i saw fires        funeral pyres    seeminglyand heard breaking waves like distant cannonades that set the land shaking     and so i never once guessed       a lovenest    bowered and candlelit lay       in my way    till i found a hid hollow where i burst on her my heart could not but follow    tolerance    it is a foolish thing said i to bear with such and pass it by yet so i do i know not why  and at each clash i would surmise that if i had acted otherwise i might have saved me many sighs  but now the only happiness in looking back that i possess  whose lack would leave me comfortless   is to remember i refrained from masteries i might have gained and for my tolerance was disdained  for see a tomb  and if it were i had bent and broke i should not dare to linger in the shadows there    before and after summer    i  looking forward to the spring one puts up with anything on this february day though the winds leap down the street wintry scourgings seem but play and these later shafts of sleet sharper pointed than the first  and these later snowsthe worst  are as a halftransparent blind riddled by rays from sun behind  ii  shadows of the october pine reach into this room of mine on the pine there stands a bird he is shadowed with the tree mutely perched he bills no word blank as i am even is he for those happy suns are past forediscerned in winter last when went by their pleasure then i alas perceived not when    at dayclose in november    the ten hours light is abating    and a late bird flies across where the pines like waltzers waiting    give their black heads a toss  beech leaves that yellow the noontime    float past like specks in the eye i set every tree in my june time    and now they obscure the sky  and the children who ramble through here    conceive that there never has been a time when no tall trees grew here    a time when none will be seen    the years awakening    how do you know that the pilgrim track along the belting zodiac swept by the sun in his seeming rounds is traced by now to the fishes bounds and into the ram when weeks of cloud have wrapt the sky in a clammy shroud and never as yet a tinct of spring has shown in the earths apparelling    o vespering bird how do you know       how do you know  how do you know deep underground hid in your bed from sight and sound without a turn in temperature with weather life can scarce endure that light has won a fractions strength and day put on some moments length whereof in merest rote will come weeks hence mild airs that do not numb    o crocus root how do you know       how do you know  february 1910    under the waterfall    whenever i plunge my arm like this in a basin of water i never miss the sweet sharp sense of a fugitive day fetched back from its thickening shroud of gray    hence the only prime    and real loverhyme    that i know by heart    and that leaves no smart is the purl of a little valley fall about three spans wide and two spans tall over a table of solid rock and into a scoop of the selfsame block the purl of a runlet that never ceases in stir of kingdoms in wars in peaces with a hollow boiling voice it speaks and has spoken since hills were turfless peaks  and why gives this the only prime idea to you of a real loverhyme and why does plunging your arm in a bowl full of spring water bring throbs to your soul well under the fall in a crease of the stone though where precisely none ever has known jammed darkly nothing to show how prized and by now with its smoothness opalized    is a drinkingglass    for down that pass    my lover and i    walked under a sky of blue with a leafwoven awning of green in the burn of august to paint the scene and we placed our basket of fruit and wine by the runlets rim where we sat to dine and when we had drunk from the glass together arched by the oakcopse from the weather i held the vessel to rinse in the fall where it slipped and sank and was past recall though we stooped and plumbed the little abyss with long bared arms  there the glass still is and as said if i thrust my arm below cold water in basin or bowl a throe from the past awakens a sense of that time and the glass both used and the cascades rhyme the basin seems the pool and its edge the hard smooth face of the brookside ledge and the leafy pattern of chinaware the hanging plants that were bathing there by night by day when it shines or lours there lies intact that chalice of ours and its presence adds to the rhyme of love persistently sung by the fall above no lip has touched it since his and mine in turns therefrom sipped lovers

plant roses love shall feed upon       and apple trees and pear     he set to build the manorhall       and shaped the turrets there       and the broad newelled stair and the cool well for crystal water    he built for me that manorhall    and planted many trees withal       but no rose anywhere     and as he planted never a rose       that bears the flower of love       though other flowers throve a frostwind moved our souls to sever    since he had planted never a rose    and misconceits raised horrid shows       and agonies came thereof     ill mend these miseries then said i       and so at dead of night       i went and screened from sight that nought should keep our souls in severance    i set a rosebush  this said i    may end divisions dire and wry       and longdrawn days of blight     but i was called from earthyea called       before my rosebush grew       and would that now i knew what feels he of the tree i planted    and whether after i was called    to be a ghost he as of old       gave me his heart anew     perhaps now blooms that queen of trees       i set but saw not grow       and he beside its glow  eyes couched of the misvision that blurred me     ay there beside that queen of trees    he sees me as i was though sees       too late to tell me so    st launces revisited       slip back time yet again i am nearing castle and keep uprearing    gray as in my prime     at the inn smiling close why is it not as on my visit    when hope and i were twin     groom and jade whom i found here moulder strange the tavernholder    strange the tapmaid     here i hired horse and man for bearing me on my wayfaring    to the door desired     evening gloomed as i journeyed forward to the faces shoreward    till their dwelling loomed     if again towards the atlantic sea there i should speed theyd be there    surely now as then        why waste thought when i know them vanished under earth yea banished    ever into nought     poems of 191213 veteris vestigia flammae     the going    why did you give no hint that night that quickly after the morrows dawn and calmly as if indifferent quite you would close your term here up and be gone    where i could not follow    with wing of swallow to gain one glimpse of you ever anon     never to bid goodbye    or give me the softest call or utter a wish for a word while i saw morning harden upon the wall    unmoved unknowing    that your great going had place that moment and altered all  why do you make me leave the house and think for a breath it is you i see at the end of the alley of bending boughs where so often at dusk you used to be    till in darkening dankness    the yawning blankness of the perspective sickens me     you were she who abode    by those redveined rocks far west you were the swannecked one who rode along the beetling beeny crest    and reining nigh me    would muse and eye me while life unrolled us its very best  why then latterly did we not speak did we not think of those days long dead and ere your vanishing strive to seek that times renewal  we might have said    in this bright spring weather    well visit together those places that once we visited     well well  alls past amend    unchangeable  it must go i seem but a dead man held on end to sink down soon    o you could not know    that such swift fleeing    no soul foreseeing  not even iwould undo me so  december 1912    your last drive    here by the moorway you returned and saw the borough lights ahead that lit your faceall undiscerned to be in a week the face of the dead and you told of the charm of that haloed view that never again would beam on you  and on your left you passed the spot where eight days later you were to lie and be spoken of as one who was not beholding it with a cursory eye as alien from you though under its tree you soon would halt everlastingly  i drove not with you    yet had i sat at your side that eve i should not have seen that the countenance i was glancing at had a lasttime look in the flickering sheen nor have read the writing upon your face i go hence soon to my restingplace  you may miss me then  but i shall not know how many times you visit me there or what your thoughts are or if you go there never at all  and i shall not care should you censure me i shall take no heed and even your praises i shall not need  true  never youll know  and you will not mind but shall i then slight you because of such dear ghost in the past did you ever find the thought what profit move me much yet the fact indeed remains the same you are past love praise indifference blame  december 1912    the walk       you did not walk with me    of late to the hilltop tree       by the gated ways       as in earlier days       you were weak and lame       so you never came and i went alone and i did not mind not thinking of you as left behind     i walked up there today    just in the former way       surveyed around       the familiar ground       by myself again       what difference then only that underlying sense of the look of a room on returning thence    rain on a grave    clouds spout upon her    their waters amain    in ruthless disdain  her who but lately    had shivered with pain as at touch of dishonour if there had lit on her so coldly so straightly    such arrows of rain  she who to shelter    her delicate head would quicken and quicken    each tentative tread if drops chanced to pelt her    that summertime spills    in dustpaven rills when thunderclouds thicken    and birds close their bills  would that i lay there    and she were housed here or better together were folded away there exposed to one weather we bothwho would stray there when sunny the day there    or evening was clear    at the prime of the year  soon will be growing    green blades from her mound and daises be showing    like stars on the ground till she form part of them  aythe sweet heart of them loved beyond measure with a childs pleasure    all her lifes round  jan 31 1913    i found her out there    i found her out there on a slope few see that falls westwardly to the saltedged air where the ocean breaks on the purple strand and the hurricane shakes the solid land  i brought her here and have laid her to rest in a noiseless nest no sea beats near she will never be stirred in her loamy cell by the waves long heard and loved so well  so she does not sleep by those haunted heights the atlantic smites and the blind gales sweep whence she often would gaze at dundagels far head while the dipping blaze dyed her face firered  and would sigh at the tale of sunk lyonnesse as a windtugged tress flapped her cheek like a flail or listen at whiles with a thoughtbound brow to the murmuring miles she is far from now  yet her shade maybe will creep underground till it catch the sound of that western sea as it swells and sobs where she once domiciled and joy in its throbs with the heart of a child    without ceremony    it was your way my dear to be gone without a word when callers friends or kin had left and i hastened in to rejoin you as i inferred  and when youd a mind to career off anywheresay to town  you were all on a sudden gone before i had thought thereon or noticed your trunks were down  so now that you disappear for ever in that swift style your meaning seems to me just as it used to be goodbye is not worth while    lament    how she would have loved a party today  brighthatted and gloved with table and tray and chairs on the lawn her smiles would have shone with welcomings    but she is shut she is shut    from friendships spell    in the jailing shell    of her tiny cell  or she would have reigned at a dinner tonight with ardours unfeigned and a generous delight all in her abode shed have freely bestowed on her guests    but alas she is shut under grass    where no cups flow    powerless to know    that it might be so  and she would have sought with a childs eager glance the shy snowdrops brought by the new years advance and peered in the rime of candlemastime for crocuses    chanced it that she were not tranced    from sights she loved best    wholly possessed    by an infinite rest  and we are here staying amid these stale things who care not for gaying and those junketings that used so to joy her and never to cloy her as us they cloy    but she is shut she is shut    from the cheer of them dead    to all done and said    in a yewarched bed    the haunter    he does not think that i haunt here nightly    how shall i let him know that whither his fancy sets him wandering    i too alertly go  hover and hover a few feet from him    just as i used to do but cannot answer his words addressed me     only listen thereto  when i could answer he did not say them    when i could let him know how i would like to join in his journeys    seldom he wished to go now that he goes and wants me with him    more than he used to do never he sees my faithful phantom    though he speaks thereto  yes i accompany him to places    only dreamers know where the shy hares limp long paces    where the night rooks go into old aisles where the past is all to him    close as his shade can do always lacking the power to call to him    near as i reach thereto  what a good haunter i am o tell him    quickly make him know if he but sigh since my loss befell him    straight to his side i go tell him a faithful one is doing    all that love can do still that his path may be worth pursuing    and to bring peace thereto    the voice    woman much missed how you call to me call to me saying that now you are not as you were when you had changed from the one who was all to me but as at first when our day was fair  can it be you that i hear  let me view you then standing as when i drew near to the town where you would wait for me  yes as i knew you then even to the original airblue gown  or is it only the breeze in its listlessness travelling across the wet mead to me here you being ever consigned to existlessness heard no more again far or near     thus i faltering forward    leaves around me falling wind oozing thin through the thorn from norward    and the woman calling  december 1912    his visitor    i come across from mellstock while the moon wastes weaker to behold where i lived with you for twenty years and more i shall go in the gray at the passing of the mailtrain and need no setting open of the long familiar door    as before  the change i notice in my once own quarters a brilliant budded border where the daisies used to be the rooms new painted and the pictures altered and other cups and saucers and no cozy nook for tea    as with me  i discern the dim faces of the sleepwrapt servants they are not those who tended me through feeble hours and strong but strangers quite who never knew my rule here who never saw me painting never heard my softling song    float along  so i dont want to linger in this redecked dwelling i feel too uneasy at the contrasts i behold and i make again for mellstock to return here never and rejoin the roomy silence and the mute and manifold    souls of old  1913    a circular    as legal representative i read a missive not my own on new designs the senders give    for clothes in tints as shown  here figure blouses gowns for tea and presentationtrains of state charming balldresses millinery    warranted up to date  and

but made fancy    by some necromancy that much of my life claims the spot as its key  yes  i have had dreams of that place in the west    and a maiden abiding    thereat as in hiding faireyed and whiteshouldered broadbrowed and browntressed  and of how coastward bound on a night long ago    there lonely i found her    the seabirds around her and other than nigh things uncaring to know  so sweet her life there in my thought has it seemed    that quickly she drew me    to take her unto me and lodge her long years with me  such have i dreamed  but nought of that maid from saintjuliot i see    can she ever have been here    and shed her lifes sheen here the woman i thought a long housemate with me  does there even a place like saintjuliot exist    or a vallency valley    with stream and leafed alley or beeny or bos with its flounce flinging mist  february 1913    after a journey    hereto i come to interview a ghost    whither o whither will its whim now draw me up the cliff down

derision  i see what you are doing  you are leading me on    to the spots we knew when we haunted here together the waterfall above which the mistbow shone    at the then fair hour in the then fair weather and the cave just under with a voice still so hollow    that it seems to call out to me from forty years ago       when you were all aglow and not the thin ghost that i now frailly follow  ignorant of what there is flitting here to see    the waked birds preen and the seals flop lazily soon you will have dear to vanish from me    for the stars close their shutters and the dawn whitens hazily trust me i mind not though life lours    the bringing me here nay bring me here again       i am just the same as when our days were a joy and our paths through flowers  pentargan bay    a

so and who loyally loved me  ii  the pale mews plained below us and the waves seemed far away in a nether sky engrossed in saying their ceaseless babbling say as we laughed lightheartedly aloft on

primaeval rocks form the roads steep border    and much have they faced there first and last of the transitory in earths long order    but what they record in colour and cast       isthat we two passed  and to me though times unflinching rigour    in mindless rote has ruled from sight the substance now one phantom figure    remains on the slope as when that night       saw us alight  i look and see it there shrinking shrinking    i look back at it amid the rain for the very last time for my sand is sinking    and i shall traverse old loves domain       never again  march 1913    places    nobody says  ah that is the place where chanced in the hollow of years ago what none of the three towns cared to know the birth of a little girl of grace  the sweetest the house saw first or last    yet it was so    on that day long past  nobody thinks  there there she lay in a room by the hoe like the bud of a flower and listened just after the bedtime hour to the stammering chimes that used to play the quaint old hundredandthirteenth tune    in saint andrews tower    night morn and noon  nobody calls to mind that here upon boterel hill where the carters skid with cheeks whose airy flush outbid fresh fruit in bloom and free of fear she cantered down as if she must fall    though she never did    to the charm of all  nay  one there is to whom these things that nobody elses mind calls back have a savour that scenes in being lack and a presence more than the actual brings to whom today is beneaped and stale    and its urgent clack    but a vapid tale  plymouth march 1913    the phantom horsewoman    i  queer are the ways of a man i know    he comes and stands    in a careworn craze    and looks at the sands    and the seaward haze    with moveless hands    and face and gaze    then turns to go    and what does he see when he gazes so  ii  they say he sees as an instant thing    more clear than today    a sweet soft scene    that once was in play    by that briny green    yes notes alway    warm real and keen    what his back years bring  a phantom of his own figuring  iii  of this vision of his they might say more    not only there    does he see this sight    but everywhere    in his brainday night    as if on the air    it were drawn rose bright     yea far from that shore does he carry this vision of heretofore  iv  a ghostgirlrider  and though toiltried    he withers daily    time touches her not    but she still rides gaily    in his rapt thought    on that shagged and shaly    atlantic spot    and as when first eyed draws rein and sings to the swing of the tide     miscellaneous pieces     the wistful lady    love while you were away there came to me     from whence i cannot tell  a plaintive lady pale and passionless who bent her eyes upon me critically and weighed me with a wearing wistfulness    as if she knew me well  i saw no lady of that wistful sort    as i came riding home perhaps she was some dame the fates constrain by memories sadder than she can support or by unhappy vacancy of brain    to leave her roof and roam  ah but she knew me  and before this time    i have seen her lending ear to my light outdoor words and pondering each her frail white finger swayed in pantomime as if she fain would close with me in speech    and yet would not come near  and once i saw her beckoning with her hand    as i came into sight at an upper window  and i at last went out but when i reached where she had seemed to stand and wandered up and down and searched about    i found she had vanished quite  then thought i how my dead love used to say    with a small smile when she was waning wan that she would hover round and show herself after her passing day to any newer love i might have found    but show her not to me    the woman in the rye    why do you stand in the dripping rye coldlipped unconscious wet to the knee when there are firesides near said i i told him i wished him dead said she  yea cried it in my haste to one whom i had loved whom i well loved still and die he did  and i hate the sun and stand here lonely aching chill  stand waiting waiting under skies that blow reproach the while i see the rooks sheer off to where he lies wrapt in a peace withheld from me    the chevalglass    why do you harbour that great chevalglass    filling up your narrow room    you never preen or plume or look in a week at your fulllength figure     picture of bachelor gloom  well when i dwelt in ancient england    renting the valley farm    thoughtless of all heartharm i used to gaze at the parsons daughter    a creature of nameless charm  thither there came a lover and won her    carried her off from my view    o it was then i knew misery of a cast undreamt of     more than indeed my due  then far rumours of her illusage    came like a chilling breath    when a man languisheth followed by news that her mind lost balance    and in a space of her death  soon sank her father and next was the auction     everything to be sold    mid things new and old stood this glass in her former chamber    long in her use i was told  well i awaited the sale and bought it       there by my bed it stands    and as the dawn expands often i see her palefaced form there    brushing her hairs bright bands  there too at pallid midnight moments    quick she will come to my call    smile from the frame withal ponderingly as she used to regard me    passing her fathers wall  so that it was for its revelations    i brought it oversea    and drag it about with me    anon i shall break it and bury its fragments    where my grave is to be    the reenactment       between the folding seadowns       in the gloom    of a wailful wintry nightfall       when the boom of the ocean like a hammering in a hollow tomb     throbbed up the copseclothed valley       from the shore    to the chamber where i darkled       sunk and sore with gray ponderings why my loved one had not come before     to salute me in the dwelling       that of late    i had hired to waste a while in        vague of date quaint and remotewherein i now expectant sate     on the solitude unsignalled       broke a man    who in air as if at home there       seemed to scan every fireflecked nook of the apartment span by span     a strangers and no lovers       eyes were these    eyes of a man who measures       what he sees but vaguely as if wrapt in filmy phantasies     yea his bearing was so absent       as he stood    it bespoke a chord so plaintive       in his mood that soon i judged he would not wrong my quietude     ahthe supper is just ready       then he said    and the yearslong binned madeira       flashes red there was no wine no food no suppertable spread     you will forgive my coming       lady fair    i see you as at that time       rising there the selfsame curious querying in your eyes and air     yet no  how so  you wear not       the same gown    your locks show woful difference       are not brown what is it not as when i hither came from town     and the place    but you seem other        can it be    whats this that time is doing       unto me you dwell here unknown woman    whereabouts then is she     and the housethings are much shifted        put them where    they stood on this nights fellow       shift her chair here was the couch  and the piano should be there     i indulged him verily nervestrained       being alone    and i moved the things as bidden       one by one and feigned to push the old piano where he had shown     ahanow i can see her       stand aside    dont thrust her from the table       where meekeyed she makes attempt with matronmanners to preside     she serves me  now she rises       goes to play       but you obstruct her fill her       with dismay and embarrassed scared she vanishes away     and as twere useless longer       to persist    he sighed and sought the entry       ere i wist and retreated disappearing soundless in the mist     that here some mighty passion       once had burned    which still the walls enghosted       i discerned and that by its strong spell mine might be overturned     i sat depressed till later       my love came    but something in the chamber       dimmed our flame  an emanation making our due words fall tame     as if the intenser drama       shown me there    of what the walls had witnessed       filled the air and left no room for later passion anywhere     so came it that our fervours       did quite fail    of future consummation        being made quail by the weird witchery of the parlours hidden tale     which i as years passed faintly       learnt to trace     one of sad love born fullwinged       in that place where the predestined sorrowers first stood face to face     and as that month of winter       circles round    and the evening of the dateday       grows embrowned i am conscious of those presences and sit spellbound     there oftenlone forsaken        queries breed    within me whether a phantom       had my heed on that strange night or was it some wrecked heart indeed    her secret    that loves dull smart distressed my heart    he shrewdly learnt to see but that i was in love with a dead man    never suspected he  he searched for the trace of a pictured face    he watched each missive come and a note that seemed like a loveline    made him look frozen and glum  he dogged my feet to the city street    he followed me to the sea but not to the neighbouring churchyard    did he dream of following me    she charged me    she charged me with having said this and that to another woman long years before in the very parlour where we sat   sat on a night when the endless pour of rain on the roof and the road below bent the spring of the spirit more and more      so charged she me and the cupids bow of her mouth was hard and her eyes and her face and her white forefinger lifted slow  had she done it gently or shown a trace that not too curiously would she view a folly passed ere her reign had place  a kiss might have ended it  but i knew from the fall of each word and the pause between that the curtain would drop upon us two ere long in our play of slave and queen    the newcomers wife    he paused on the sill of a door ajar that screened a lively liquorbar for the name had reached him through the door of her he had married the week before  we called her the hack of the parade but she was discreet in the games she played if slightly worn shes pretty yet and gossips after all forget  and he knows nothing of her past i am glad the girls in luck at last such ones though stale to native eyes newcomers snatch at as a prize  yes being a stranger he sees her blent of all thats fresh and innocent nor dreams how many a lovecampaign she had enjoyed before his reign  that night there was the splash of a fall over the slimy harbourwall they searched and at the deepest place found him with crabs upon his face    a conversation at dawn    he lay awake with a harassed air and she in her cloud of loose lank hair    seemed troubletried as the dawn drew in on their faces there  the chamber looked far over the sea from a white hotel on a whitestoned quay    and stepping a stride he parted the windowdrapery  above the level horizon spread the sunrise firing them foot to head    from its smouldering lair and painting their pillows with dyes of red  what strange disquiets have stirred you dear this dragging night with starts in fear    of me as it were or of something evil hovering near  my husband can i have fear of you what should one fear from a man whom few    or none had matched in that late long spell of delays undue  he watched her eyes in the heaving sun then what has kept o reticent one    those lids unlatched  anything promised ive not yet done  o its not a broken promise of yours for what quite lightly your lip assures    the due time brings that has troubled my sleep and no waking cures     i have shaped my will tis at hand said he i subscribe it today that no risk there be    in the hap of things of my leaving you menaced by poverty  that a boon provision im safe to get signed sealed by my lord as it were a debt    i cannot doubt or ever this peering sun be set  but you flung my arms away from your side and faced the wall  no monthold bride    ere the tour be out in an air so loth can be justified  ahhad you a male friend once loved well upon whose suit disaster fell    and frustrance swift honest you are and may care to tell  she lay impassive and nothing broke the stillness other than stroke by stroke    the lazy lift of the tide below them till she spoke  i once had a frienda love if you will  whose wife forsook him and sank until    she was made a thrall in a prisoncell for a deed of ill     he remained alone and we metto love but barring legitimate joy thereof    stood a doorless wall though we prized each other all else above  and this was why though id touched my prime i put off suitors from time to time     yourself with the rest  till friends who approved you called it crime  and when misgivings weighed on me in my lovers absence hurriedly    and much distrest i took you    ah that such could be     now saw you when crossing from yonder shore at yesternoon that the packet bore    on a whitewreathed bier a coffined body towards the fore  well while you stood at the other end the loungers talked and i could but lend    a listening ear for they named the dead  twas the wife of my friend  he was there but did not note me veiled yet i saw that a joy as of one unjailed    now shone in his gaze he knew not his hope of me just had failed  they had brought her home  she was born in this isle and he will return to his domicile    and pass his days alone and not as he dreamt erstwhile  so youve lost a sprucer spouse than i she held her peace as if fain deny    she would indeed for his pleasures sake but could lip no lie  one far less formal and plain and slow she let the laconic assertion go    as if of need she held the conviction that it was so  regard me as his he always should he had said and wed me he vowed he would    in his prime or sere most verily do if ever he could  and this fulfilment is now his aim for a letter addressed in my maiden name    has dogged me here reminding me faithfully of his claim  and it started a hope like a lightningstreak that i might go to himsay for a week     and afford you right to put me away and your vows unspeak  to be sure you have said as of dim intent that marriage is a plain event    of black and white without any ghost of sentiment  and my heart has quailedbut deny it true that you will never this lock undo    no god intends to thwart the yearning hes father to  the husband hemmed then blandly bowed in the light of the angry morning cloud    so my idyll ends and a drama opens he mused aloud  and his features froze  you may take it as true that i will never this lock undo    for so depraved a passion as that which kindles you  said she  i am sorry you see it so i had hoped you might have let me go    and thus been saved the pain of learning theres more to know  more  what may that be  gad i think you have told me enough to make me blink    yet if more remain then own it to me  i will not shrink  well it is this  as we could not see that a legal marriage could ever be    to end our pain we united ourselves informally  and vowed at a chancelaltar nigh with book and ring a lifelong tie    a contract vain to the world but real to him on high  and you became as his wifei did  he stood as stiff as a caryatid    and said indeed    no matter  youre mine whatever you ye hid  but is it right  when i only gave my hand to you in a sweat to save    through desperate need as i thought my fame for i was not brave  to save your fame  your meaning is dim for nobody knew of your altarwhim    i meani feared there might be fruit of my tie with him  and to cloak it by marriage im not the first though maybe morally most accurst    through your unpeered and strict uprightness  thats the worst  while yesterday his worn contours convinced me that love like his endures    and that my trothplight had been his in fact and not truly yours  so my lady you raise the veil by degrees    i own this last is enough to freeze    the warmest wight now hear the other side if you please  i did say once though without intent that marriage is a plain event    of black and white whatever may be its sentiment  ill act accordingly none the less that you soiled the contract in time of stress    thereto induced by the feared results of your wantonness  but the thing is over and no one knows and its nought to the future what you disclose    that youll be loosed for such an episode dont suppose  no  ill not free you  and if it appear there was too good ground for your first fear    from your amorous tricks ill father the child  yes by god my dear  even should you fly to his arms ill damn opinion and fetch you treat as sham    your mutinous kicks and whip you home  thats the sort i am  she whitened enough    since you disapprove ill yield in silence and never move    till my last pulse ticks a footstep from the domestic groove  then swear it he said and your king uncrown he drew her forth in her long white gown    and she knelt and swore good  now you may go and again lie down  since youve played these pranks and given no sign you shall crave this man of yours pine and pine    with sighings sore till ive starved your love for him nailed you mine  im a practical man and want no tears youve made a fool of me it appears    that you dont again is a lesson ill teach you in future years  she answered not but lay listlessly with her dark dry eyes on the coppery sea    that now and then flung its lazy flounce at the neighbouring quay  1910    a kings soliloquy on the night of his funeral    from the slow march and muffled drum    and crowds distrest and book and bell at length i have come    to my full rest  a ten years rule beneath the sun    is wound up here and what i have done what left undone    figures out clear  yet in the estimate of such    it grieves me more that i by some was loved so much    than that i bore  from others judgment of that hue    which overhope breeds from a theoretic view    of regal scope  for kingly opportunities    right many have sighed how best to bear its devilries    those learn who have tried  i have eaten the fat and drunk the sweet    lived the life out from the first greeting glad drumbeat    to the last shout  what pleasure earth affords to kings    i have enjoyed through its long vivid pulsestirrings    even till it cloyed  what days of drudgery nights of stress    can cark a throne even one maintained in peacefulness    i too have known  and so i think could i step back    to life again i should prefer the average track    of average men  since as with them what kingship would    it cannot do nor to

interlune and the daytime talk of the roman investigations was checked by silence save for the husky tune the bubbling waters played near the excavations  and a warm air came up from underground and a flutter as of a filmy shape unsepulchred that collected itself and waited and looked around nothing was seen but utterances could be heard  those of the goddess whose shrine was beneath the pile of

traditional ires you know not by what a frail thread we equally hang it is said we are images bothtwitched by peoples desires and that i like you fail as a song men yesterday sang      and the olden

seventyfour and twenty    here goes a man of seventyfour who sees not what life means for him and here another in years a score who reads its very figure and trim  the one who shall walk today with me is not the youth who gazes far but the breezy wight who cannot see what earths ingrained conditions are    the elopement    a woman never agreed to it said my knowing friend to me that one thing shed refuse to do for solomons mines in fee no woman ever will make herself look older than she is i did not answer but i thought you err there ancient quiz  it took a rare one true to do it for she was surely rare  as rare a soul at that sweet time of her life as she was fair and urging motives too were strong for ours was a passionate case yea passionate enough to lead to freaking with that young face  i have told no one about it should perhaps make few believe but i think it over now that life looms dull and years bereave how blank we stood at our bright wits end two frail barks in distress how selfregard in her was slain by her large tenderness  i said  the only chance for us in a crisis of this kind is going it thoroughyes she calmly breathed  well i dont mind and we blanched her dark locks ruthlessly  set wrinkles on her brow ayshe was a right rare woman then whatever she may be now  that night we heard a coach drive up and questions asked below a gent with an elderly wife sir was returned from the bureau and the wheels went rattling on and free at last from public ken we washed all off in her chamber and restored her youth again  how many years ago it was  some fifty can it be since that adventure held us and she played old wife to me but in time convention won her as it wins all women at last and now she is rich and respectable and time has buried the past    i rose up as my custom is    i rose up as my custom is    on the eve of allsouls day and left my grave for an hour or so to call on those i used to know    before i passed away  i visited my former love    as she lay by her husbands side i asked her if life pleased her now she was rid of a poet wrung in brow    and crazed with the ills he eyed  who used to drag her here and there    wherever his fancies led and point out pale phantasmal things and talk of vain vague purposings    that she discredited  she was quite civil and replied    old comrade is that you well on the whole i like my life  i know i swore id be no wife    but what was i to do  you see of all men for my sex    a poet is the worst women are practical and they crave the wherewith to pay their way    and slake their social thirst  you were a poetquite the ideal    that we all love awhile but look at this man snoring here  hes no romantic chanticleer    yet keeps me in good style  he makes no quest into my thoughts    but a poet wants to know what one has felt from earliest days why one thought not in other ways    and ones loves of long ago  her words benumbed my fond frail ghost    the nightmares neighed from their stalls the vampires screeched the harpies flew and under the dim dawn i withdrew    to deaths inviolate halls    a week    on monday night i closed my door and thought you were not as heretofore and little cared if we met no more  i seemed on tuesday night to trace something beyond mere commonplace in your ideas and heart and face  on wednesday i did not opine your life would ever be one with mine though if it were we should well combine  on thursday noon i liked you well and fondly felt that we must dwell not far apart whatever befell  on friday it was with a thrill in gazing towards your distant vill i owned you were my dear one still  i saw you wholly to my mind on saturdayeven one who shrined all that was best of womankind  as wingclipt seagull for the sea on sunday night i longed for thee without whom life were waste to me    had you wept    had you wept had you but neared me with a frail uncertain ray dewy as the face of the dawn in your large and luminous eye then would have come back all the joys the tidings had slain that day and a new beginning a fresh fair heaven have smoothed the things awry but you were less feebly human and no passionate need for clinging possessed your soul to overthrow reserve when i came near ay though you suffer as much as i from storms the hours are bringing upon your heart and mine i never see you shed a tear  the deep strong woman is weakest the weak one is the strong the weapon of all weapons best for winning you have not used have you never been able or would you not through the evil times and long has not the gift been given you or such gift have you refused when i bade me not absolve you on that evening or the morrow why did you not make war on me with those who weep like rain you felt too much so gained no balm for all your torrid sorrow and hence our deep division and our dark undying pain    bereft she thinks she dreams    i dream that the dearest i ever knew    has died and been entombed i am sure its a dream that cannot be true    but i am so overgloomed by its persistence that i would gladly    have quick death take me rather than longer think thus sadly    so wake me wake me  it has lasted days but minute and hour    i expect to get aroused and find him as usual in the bower    where we so happily housed yet stays this nightmare too appalling    and like a web shakes me and piteously i keep on calling    and no one wakes me    in the british museum    what do you see in that timetouched stone    when nothing is there but ashen blankness although you give it    a rigid stare  you look not quite as if you saw    but as if you heard parting your lips and treading softly    as mouse or bird  it is only the base of a pillar theyll tell you    that came to us from a far old hill men used to name    areopagus   i know no art and i only view    a stone from a wall but i am thinking that stone has echoed    the voice of paul  paul as he stood and preached beside it    facing the crowd a small gaunt figure with wasted features    calling out loud  words that in all their intimate accents    pattered upon that marble front and were far reflected    and then were gone  im a labouring man and know but little    or nothing at all but i cant help thinking that stone once echoed    the voice of paul    in the servants quarters    man you too arent you one of these rough followers of the criminal all hanging hereabout to gather how hes going to bear examination in the hall  she flung disdainful glances on the shabby figure standing at the fire with others there    who warmed them by its flare  no indeed my skipping maiden  i know nothing of the trial here or criminal if so he bei chanced to come this way and the fire shone out into the dawn and morning airs are cold now i too was drawn in part by charms i see before me play    that i see not every day  ha ha then laughed the constables who also stood to warm themselves the while another maiden scrutinized his features hard as the blaze threw into contrast every line and knot that wrinkled them exclaiming why last night when he was brought in by the guard    you were with him in the yard  nay nay you teasing wench i say  you know you speak mistakenly cannot a tired pedestrian who has footed it afar here on his way from northern parts engrossed in humble marketings come in and rest awhile although judicial doings are    afoot by morning star  o come come laughed the constables  why man you speak the dialect he uses in his answers you can hear him up the stairs so own it  we shant hurt ye  there hes speaking now  his syllables are those you sound yourself when you are talking unawares    as this pretty girl declares  and you shudder when his chain clinks she rejoined  o yes i noticed it and you winced too when those cuffs they gave him echoed to us here theyll soon be coming down and you may then have to defend yourself unless you hold your tongue or go away and keep you clear    when hes led to judgment near  no  ill be damned in hell if i know anything about the man no single thing about him more than everybody knows must not i even warm my hands but i am charged with blasphemies     his face convulses as the morning cock that moment crows    and he stops and turns and goes    the obliterate tomb       more than half my life long did they weigh me falsely to my bitter wrong but they all have shrunk away into the silence    like a lost song     and the day has dawned and come for forgiveness when the past may hold it dumb on the once reverberate words of hatred uttered    half in delirium        with folded lips and hands they lie and wait what next the will commands and doubtless think if think they can  let discord    sink with lifes sands     by these late years their names their virtues their hereditary claims may be as near defacement at their graveplace    as are their fames    such thoughts bechanced to seize a travellers minda man of memories  as he set foot within the western city    where had died these     who in their lifetime deemed him their chief enemyone whose brain had schemed to get their dingy greatness deeplier dingied    and disesteemed     so sojourning in their town he mused on them and on their once renown and said ill seek their restingplace tomorrow    ere i lie down     and end lest i forget those ires of many years that i regret renew their names that men may see some liegeness    is left them yet     duly next day he went and sought the church he had known them to frequent and wandered in the precincts set on eyeing    where they lay pent     till by remembrance led he stood at length beside their slighted bed above which truly scarce a line or letter    could now be read     thus years obliterate their graven worth their chronicle their date at once ill garnish and revive the record    of their past state     that still the sage may say in pensive progress here where they decay this stone records a luminous line whose talents    told in their day     while speaking thus he turned for a form shadowed where they lay inurned and he beheld a stranger in foreign vesture    and tropicburned     sir i am right pleased to view that ancestors of mine should interest you for i have come of purpose here to trace them       they are timeworn true     but thats a fault at most sculptors can cure  on the pacific coast i have vowed for long that relics of my forbears    id trace ere lost     and hitherward i come before this same old time shall strike me numb to carry it outstrange this is said the other    what mind shall plumb     coincident design though these my fathers enemies were and mine i nourished a like purposeto restore them    each letter and line     such magnanimity is now not needed sir for you will see that since i am here a thing like this is plainly    best done by me     the other bowed and left crestfallen in sentiment as one bereft of some fair object he had been moved to cherish    by hands more deft     and as he slept that night the phantoms of the ensepulchred stood upright before him trembling that he had set him seeking    their charnelsite     and as unknowing his ruth asked as with terrors founded not on truth why he should want them  ha they hollowly hackered    you come forsooth     by stealth to obliterate our graven worth our chronicle our date that our descendant may not gild the record    of our past state     and that no sage may say in pensive progress near where we decay this stone records a luminous line whose talents    told in their day     upon the morrow he went and to that town and churchyard never bent his ageing footsteps till some twelvemonths onward    an accident     once more detained him there and stirred by hauntings he must needs repair to where the tomb was  lo it stood still wasting    in no mans care     the travelled man you met the last time said the sexton has not yet appeared again though wealth he had in plenty   can he forget     the architect was hired and came here on smart summons as desired but never the descendant came to tell him    what he required     and so the tomb remained untouched untended crumbling weatherstained and though the onetime foe was fain to right it    he still refrained     ill set about it when i am sure hell come no more  best wait till then but so it was that never the stranger entered    that city again     and the wellmeaner died while waiting tremulously unsatisfied that no return of the familys foreign scion    would still betide     and many years slid by and active churchrestorers cast their eye upon the ancient garth and hoary building    the tomb stood nigh     and when they had scraped each wall pulled out the stately pews and smartened all it will be well declared the spruce churchwarden    to overhaul     and broaden this path where shown nothing prevents it but an old tombstone pertaining to a family forgotten    of deeds unknown     their names can scarce be read depend ont all who care for them are dead so went the tomb whose shards were as pathpaving    distributed     over it and about mens footsteps beat and wind and waterspout until the names aforetime gnawed by weathers    were quite worn out     so that no sage can say in pensive progress near where they decay this stone records a luminous line whose talents    told in their day

would think it strange at first but then everything has been strange in its time when some one said on a day of the prime he would bow to no brazen god again he doubtless dazed the mass of men  none will recognize us as a pair whose claims to righteous judgment we care not making who have doubted if breath be worth the taking and have no respect for the current fames whence the savour has flown

was compromised by meetings and lingerings at his whim and thinking not of herself but him while she lifted orbs aggrieved and round that scandal should so soon abound as she had raised them to nine

yachts ride mute at anchor and the fulling moon is fair and the giddy folk are strutting up and down the smooth parade and in her wild distraction she seems not to be aware    that she lives no more a maid  but has vowed and wived herself to one who blessed the ground she trod to and from his scene of ministry and thought her history known in its last particular to himaye almost as to god    and believed her quite his own  so great her absentmindedness she droops as in a swoon and a movement of aversion mars her recent spousal grace and in silence we two sit here in our waning honeymoon    at

airily dancing    deeming her movements screened  dancing alone in the room there    thindraped in her robe of night her postures glassed in the gloom there    were a strange phantasmal sight  she had

gone whose poor halfperished residue    tombless and trod lay yon but at this moment to our view    rose like a phantom wan  and in his fixed face i could see    lit by a lurid shine the drama reenact which she    had dyed incarnadine for us and more  and doubtless he    beheld it too in mine  a start as at one slightly known    and with an indifferent air we passed without a sign being shown    that as it real were a memoryacted scene had thrown    its tragic shadow there    the death of regret    i opened my shutter at sunrise    and looked at the hill hard by and i heartily grieved for the comrade    who wandered up there to die  i let in the morn on the morrow    and failed not to think of him then as he trod up that rise in the twilight    and never came down again  i undid the shutter a week thence    but not until after id turned did i call back his last departure    by the upland there discerned  uncovering the casement long later    i bent to my toil till the gray when i said to myself ahwhat ails me    to forget him all the day  as daily i flung back the shutter    in the same blank bald routine he scarcely once rose to remembrance    through a month of my facing the scene  and ah seldom now do i ponder    at the window as heretofore on the long valued one who died yonder    and wastes by the sycamore    in the days of crinoline    a plain tiltbonnet on her head she took the path across the leaze  her spouse the vicar gardening said too dowdy that for coquetries    so i can hoe at ease  but when she had passed into the heath and gained the wood beyond the flat she raised her skirts and from beneath unpinned and drew as from a sheath    an ostrichfeathered hat  and where the hat had hung she now concealed and pinned the dowdy hood and set the hat upon her brow and thus emerging from the wood    tripped on in jaunty mood  the sun was low and crimsonfaced as two came that way from the town and plunged into the wood untraced    when separately therefrom they paced    the sun had quite gone down  the hat and feather disappeared the dowdy hood again was donned and in the gloom the fair one neared her home and husband dour who conned    calmly his blueeyed blonde  today he said you have shown good sense a dress so modest and so meek should always deck your goings hence alone  and as a recompense    he kissed her on the cheek    the roman

a stall at priddy fair for handkerchief to hood her hair    when we went gallanting  full soon the four weeks neared their end where dunkery frowns on exon moor and when the four weeks neared their end    and their swift sweets outwore i said what shall i do to own those beauties bright as tulips blown and keep you here with me alone    as mine for evermore  and as she drowsed within my van on exon wild by dunkery tor  and as she drowsed within my van    and dawning turned to day she heavily raised her sloeblack eyes and murmured back in softest wise one more thing and the charms you prize

from the chest divine treasure to buy me eardrops fine    and richly jewelled rings  i said  i am one who has gathered gear from marlbury downs to dunkery tor who has gathered gear for many a year    from mansion mart and fair but at gods house ive stayed my hand hearing within me some command  curbed by a law not of the land    from doing damage there  whereat she pouts this love of mine as dunkery frowns on exon moor and still she pouts this love of mine    so cityward i go but ere i start to do the thing and speed my souls imperilling for one who is my ravishing    and all the joy i know  i come to lay this charge on thee  on exon wild by dunkery tor  i come to lay this charge on thee    with solemn speech and sign should things go ill and my life pay for botchery in this rash

tortured spirit would not rest but wander weary and distrest throughout the world in wild protest    the thought nigh maddens me  part ii  thus did he speakthis brother of mine  on exon wild by dunkery tor born at my birth of mother of mine    and forthwith went his way to dare the deed some coming night    i kept the watch with shaking sight the moon at moments breaking bright    at others glooming gray  for three full days i heard no sound where dunkery frowns on exon moor i heard no sound at all around    whether his fay prevailed or one malign the master were till some afoot did tidings bear how that for all his practised care    he had been caught and jailed  they had heard a crash when twelve had chimed by mendip east of dunkery tor when twelve had chimed and moonlight climbed    they watched and he was tracked by arch and aisle and saint and knight of sculptured stonework sheeted white in the cathedrals ghostly light    and captured in the act  yes for this love he loved too well where dunkery sights the severn shore all for this love he loved too well    he burst the holy bars seized golden vessels from the chest to buy her ornaments of the best at her illwitcherys request    and lure of eyes like stars     when blustering march confused the sky in toneborough town by exon moor when blustering march confused the sky    they stretched him and he died down in the crowd where i to see the end of him stood silently with a set face he lipped to me     remember  ay i cried  by night and day i shadowed her from toneborough deane to dunkery tor i shadowed her asleep astir    and yet i could not bear  till wrestler joe anon began to figure as her chosen man and took her to his shining van     to doom a form so fair  he made it handsome for her sake  and dunkery smiled to exon moor  he made it handsome for her sake    painting it out and in and on the door of applegreen a bright brass knocker soon was seen and windowcurtains white and clean    for her to sit within  and all could see she clave to him as cleaves a cloud to dunkery tor yea all could see she clave to him    and every day i said a pity it seems to part those two that hourly grow to love more true yet shes the wanton woman who    sent one to swing till dead  that blew to blazing all my hate while dunkery frowned on exon moor and when the river swelled her fate    came to her pitilessly    i dogged her crying  across that plank they use as bridge to reach yon bank a coat and hat lie limp and dank    your goodmans can they be  she paled and went i close behind  and exon frowned to dunkery tor she went and i came up behind    and tipped the plank that bore her fleetly flitting across to eye what such might bode  she slid awry and from the current came a cry    a gurgle and no more  how that befell no mortal knew from marlbury downs to exon moor no mortal knew that deed undue    but he who schemed the crime which night still covers    but in dream those ropes of hair upon the stream he sees and he will hear that scream    until his judgmenttime    the abbey mason inventor of the perpendicular style of gothic architecture    the newvamped abbey shaped apace in the fourteenth century of grace  the church which at an after date acquired cathedral rank and state  panel and circumscribing wall of latest feature trim and tall  rose roundabout the norman core in prouder pose than theretofore  encasing magically the old with parpend ashlars manifold  the trowels rang out and tracery appeared where blanks had used to be  men toiled for pleasure more than pay and all went smoothly day by day  till in due course the transept part engrossed the mastermasons art   homecoming thence he tossed and turned throughout the night till the new sun burned  what fearful visions have inspired these gaingivings his wife inquired  as if your tools were in your hand you have hammered fitted muttered planned  you have thumped as you were working hard i might have found me bruised and scarred  what thens amiss  what eating care looms nigh whereof i am unaware  he answered not but churchward went viewing his draughts with discontent  and fumbled there the livelong day till holloweyed he came away   twas said the mastermasons ill and all the abbey works stood still  quoth abbot wygmore  why o why distress yourself  youll surely die  the mason answered troubletorn this longvogued style is quite outworn  the upper archmould nohow serves to meet the lower tracery curves  the ogees bend too far away to give the flexures interplay  this it is causes my distress    so it will ever be unless  new forms be found to supersede the circle when occasions need  to carry it out i have tried and toiled and now perforce must own me foiled  jeerers will say  here was a man who could not end what he began   so passed that day the next the next the abbot scanned the task perplexed  the townsmen mustered all their wit to fathom how to compass it  but no raw artistries availed where practice in the craft had failed      one night he tossed all openeyed and early left his helpmeets side  scattering the rushes of the floor he wandered from the chamber door  and sought the sizing pile whereon struck dimly a cadaverous dawn  through freezing rain that drenched the board of diagramlines he last had scored   chalked phantasies in vain begot to knife the architectural knot   in front of which he dully stood regarding them in hopeless mood  he closelier looked then looked again the chalkscratched draughtboard faced the rain  whose icicled drops deformed the lines innumerous of his lame designs  so that they streamed in small white threads from the upper segments to the heads  of arcs below uniting them each by a stalactitic stem   at once with eyes that struck out sparks he adds accessory cuspingmarks  then laughs aloud  the thing was done so long assayed from sun to sun      now in his joy he grew aware of one behind him standing there  and turning saw the abbot who the weathers whim was watching too  onward to prime the abbot went tacit upon the incident   men now discerned as days revolved the ogive riddle had been solved  templates were cut fresh lines were chalked where lines had been defaced and balked  and the work swelled and mounted higher achievement distancing desire  here jambs with transoms fixed between where never the like before had been   there little mullions thinly sawn where meeting circles once were drawn  we knew men said the thing would go after his craftwit got aglow  and once fulfilled what he has designed well honour him and his great mind  when matters stood thus poised awhile and all surroundings shed a smile  the mastermason on an eve homed to his wife and seemed to grieve      the abbot spoke to me today he hangs about the works alway  he knows the source as well as i of the new style men magnify  he said  you pride yourself too much on your creation  is it such  surely the hand of god it is that conjured so and only his   disclosing by the frost and rain forms your invention chased in vain  hence the devices deemed so great you copied and did not create  i feel the abbots words are just and that all thanks renounce i must  can a man welcome praise and pelf for hatching art that hatched itself     so i shall own the deft design is heavens outshaping and not mine  what said she  praise your works ensure to throw away and quite obscure  your beaming and beneficent star better you leave things as they are  why think awhile  had not your zest in your loved craft curtailed your rest   had you not gone there ere the day the sun had melted all away   but though his good wife argued so the mason let the people know  that not unaided sprang the thought whereby the glorious fane was wrought  but that by frost when dawn was dim the method was disclosed to him  yet said the townspeople thereat tis your own doing even with that  but hechafed childlike in extremes  the temperament of men of dreams   aloofly scrupled to admit that he did aught but borrow it  and diffidently made request that with the abbot all should rest   as none could doubt the abbots word or question what the church averred  the mason was at length believed of no more count than he conceived  and soon began to lose the fame that late had gathered round his name      time passed and like a living thing the pile went on embodying  and workmen died and young ones grew and the old mason sank from view  and abbots wygmore and staunton went and horton sped the embellishment  but not till years had far progressed chanced it that one day much impressed  standing within the wellgraced aisle he asked who first conceived the style  and some decrepit sage detailed how when invention nought availed  the cloudcast waters in their whim came down and gave the hint to him  who struck each arc and made each mould and how the abbot would not hold  as sole begetter him who applied forms the almighty sent as guide  and how the master lost renown and wore in death no artists crown   then horton who in inner thought had more perceptions than he taught  replied  nay art can but transmute invention is not absolute  things fail to spring from nought at call and artbeginnings most of all  he did but what all artists do wait upon nature for his cue   had you been here to tell them so lord abbot sixty years ago  the mason now long underground doubtless a different fate had found  he passed into oblivion dim and none knew what became of him  his name  twas of some common kind and now has faded out of mind  the abbot  it shall not be hid ill trace it    but he never did   when longer yet dank death had wormed the brain wherein the style had germed  from gloucester church it flew afar  the style called perpendicular   to winton and to westminster it ranged and grew still beautifuller  from solway frith to dover strand its fascinations starred the land  not only on cathedral walls but upon courts and castle halls  till every edifice in the isle was patterned to no other style  and till long having played its part the curtain fell on gothic art   well  when in wessex on your

curious on where his hauntings are  but soon or later when you hear that he has doffed this wrinkled gear some evening at the first starray come to his graveside pause and say  whatever the message his to tell two brightsouled women loved him well stand and say that amid the dim it will be praise enough for him  july 1914    postscript men who march away song of the soldiers    what of the faith and fire within us    men who march away    ere the barncocks say    night is growing gray to hazards whence no tears can win us what of the faith and fire within us    men who march away  is it a purblind prank o think you    friend with the musing eye    who watch us stepping by    with doubt and dolorous sigh can much pondering so hoodwink you is it a purblind prank o think you    friend with the musing eye  nay  we well see what we are doing    though some may not see     dalliers as they be     englands need are we her distress would leave us rueing nay  we well see what we are doing    though some may not see  in our heart of hearts believing    victory crowns the just    and that braggarts must    surely bite the dust press we to the field ungrieving in our heart of hearts believing    victory crowns the just  hence the faith and fire within us    men who march away    ere the barncocks say    night is growing gray to hazards whence no tears can win us hence the faith
