frontispiece  i know why youre going its to see that clubfooted cowboy moore dont let me catch you with him  facing p 98  im beginnin to feel that i couldnt let her marry that buster jack soliloquized wade as he rode along the grassy trail      164  jack belllounds she cried you put the sheriff on that trail      280     the mysterious rider    chapter i  a september sun losing some of its heat if not its brilliance was dropping low in the west over the black colorado range purple haze began to thicken in the timbered notches gray foothills round and billowy rolled down from the higher country they were smooth sweeping with long velvety slopes and isolated patches of aspens that blazed in autumn gold splotches of red vine colored the soft gray of sage old white slides a mountain scarred by avalanche towered with bleak rocky peak above the valley sheltering it from the north  a girl rode along the slope with gaze on the sweep and range and color of the mountain fastness that was her home she followed an old trail which led to a bluff overlooking an arm of the valley once it had been a familiar lookout for her but she had not visited the place of late it was associated with serious hours of her life here seven years before when she was twelve she had made a hard choice to please her guardianthe old rancher whom she loved and called father who had indeed been a father to her that choice had been to go to school in denver four years she had lived away from her beloved gray hills and black mountains only once since her return had she climbed to this height and that occasion too was memorable as an unhappy hour it had been three years ago today girlish ordeals and griefs seemed back in the past she was a woman at nineteen and face to face with the first great problem in her life  the trail came up back of the bluff through a clump of aspens with white trunks and yellow fluttering leaves and led across a level bench of luxuriant grass and wild flowers to the rocky edge  she dismounted and threw the bridle her mustang used to being petted rubbed his sleek dark head against her and evidently expected like demonstration in return but as none was forthcoming he bent his nose to the grass and began grazing the girls eyes were intent upon some waving slender whiteandblue flowers they smiled up wanly like pale stars out of the long grass that had a tinge of gold  columbines she mused wistfully as she plucked several of the flowers and held them up to gaze wonderingly at them as if to see in them some revelation of the mystery that shrouded her birth and her name then she stood with dreamy gaze upon the distant ranges  columbine so they named methose miners who found mea babylost in the woodsasleep among the columbines she spoke aloud as if the sound of her voice might convince her  so much of the mystery of her had been revealed that day by the man she had always called father vaguely she had always been conscious of some mystery something strange about her childhood some relation never explained  no name but columbine she whispered sadly and now she understood a strange longing of her heart  scarcely an hour back as she ran down the wide porch of white slides ranchhouse she had encountered the man who had taken care of her all her life he had looked upon her as kindly and fatherly as of old yet with a difference she seemed to see him as old bill belllounds pioneer and rancher of huge frame and broad face hard and scarred and grizzled with big eyes of blue fire  collie the old man had said i reckon hyars news a letter from jack hes comin home  belllounds had waved the letter his huge hand trembled as he reached to put it on her shoulder the hardness of him seemed strangely softened jack was his son buster jack the range had always called him with other terms less kind that never got to the ears of his father jack had been sent away three years ago just before columbines return from school therefore she had not seen him for over seven years but she remembered him wella big rangy boy handsome and wild who had made her childhood almost unendurable  yesmy sonjackhes comin home said belllounds with a break in his voice an collienow i must tell you somethin  yes dad she had replied with strong clasp of the heavy hand on her shoulder  thets just it lass i aint your dad ive tried to be a dad to you an ive loved you as my own but youre not flesh an blood of mine an now i must tell you  the brief story followed seventeen years ago miners working a claim of bellloundss in the mountains above middle park had found a child asleep in the columbines along the trail near that point indians probably arapahoes coming across the mountains to attack the utes had captured or killed the occupants of a prairieschooner there was no other clue the miners took the child to their camp fed and cared for it and after the manner of their kind named it columbine then they brought it to belllounds  collie said the old rancher it neednt never have been told an wouldnt but fer one reason im gettin old i reckon id never split my property between you an jack so i mean you an him to marry you always steadied jack with a wife like youll bewal mebbe jackll  dad burst out columbine marry jack why ii dont even remember him  haw haw laughed belllounds wal you doggone soon will jacks in kremmlin an hell be hyar tonight or tomorrow  butii dont llove him faltered columbine  the old man lost his mirth the stronglined face resumed its hard cast the big eyes smoldered her appealing objection had wounded him she was reminded of how sensitive the old man had always been to any reflection cast upon his son  wal thets onlucky he replied gruffly mebbe youll change i reckon no girl could help a boy much onless she cared for him anyway you an jack will marry  he had stalked away and columbine had ridden her mustang far up the valley slope where she could be alone standing on the verge of the bluff she suddenly became aware that the quiet and solitude of her lonely restingplace had been disrupted cattle were bawling below her and along the slope of old white slides and on the grassy uplands above she had forgotten that the cattle were being driven down into the lowlands for the fall roundup a great redandwhitespotted herd was milling in the park just beneath her calves and yearlings were making the dust fly along the mountain slope wild old steers were crashing in the sage holding level unwilling to be driven down cows were running and lowing for their lost ones melodious and clear rose the clarion calls of the cowboys the cattle knew those calls and only the wild steers kept upgrade  columbine also knew each call and to which cowboy it belonged they sang and yelled and swore but it was all music to her here and there along the slope where the aspen groves clustered a horse would flash across an open space the dust would fly and a cowboy would peal out a lusty yell that rang along the slope and echoed under the bluff and lingered long after the daring rider had vanished in the steep thickets  i wonder which is wils murmured columbine as she watched and listened vaguely conscious of a little difference a strange check in her remembrance of this particular cowboy she felt the change yet did not understand one after one she recognized the riders on the slopes below but wilson moore was not among them he must be above her then and she turned to gaze across the grassy bluff up the long yellow slope to where the gleaming aspens half hid a red bluff of mountain towering aloft then from far to her left high up a scrubby ridge of the slope rang down a voice that thrilled her goaloongyouooooo red cattle dashed pellmell down the slope raising the dust tearing the brush rolling rocks and letting out hoarse bawls  whoopee highpitched and pealing came a clearer yell  columbine saw a white mustang flash out on top of the ridge silhouetted against the blue with mane and tail flying his gait on that edge of steep slope proved his rider to be a reckless cowboy for whom no heights or depths had terrors she would have recognized him from the way he rode if she had not known the slim erect figure the cowboy saw her instantly he pulled the mustang about to plunge down the slope and lifted him rearing and wheeling then columbine waved her hand the cowboy spurred his horse along the crest of the ridge disappeared behind the grove of aspens and came in sight again around to the right where on the grassy bench he slowed to a walk in descent to the bluff  the girl watched him come conscious of an unfamiliar sense of uncertainty in this meeting and of the fact that she was seeing him differently from any other time in the years he had been a playmate a friend almost like a brother he had ridden for belllounds for years and was a cowboy because he loved cattle well and horses better and above all a life in the open unlike most cowboys he had been to school he had a family in denver that objected to his wild range life and often importuned him to come home he seemed aloof sometimes and not readily understood  while many thoughts whirled through columbines mind she watched the cowboy ride slowly down to her and she became more concerned with a sudden restraint how was wilson going to take the news of this forced change about to come in her life that thought leaped up it gave her a strange pang but she and he were only good friends as to that she reflected of late they had not been the friends and comrades they formerly were in the thrilling uncertainty of this meeting she had forgotten his distant manner and the absence of little attentions she had missed  by this time the cowboy had reached the level and with the lazy grace of his kind slipped out of the saddle he was tall slim roundlimbed with the small hips of a rider and square though not broad shoulders he stood straight like an indian his eyes were hazel his features regular his face bronzed all men of the open had still lean strong faces but added to this in him was a steadiness of expression a restraint that seemed to hide sadness  howdy columbine he said what are you doing up here you might get run over  hello wils she replied slowly oh i guess i can keep out of the way  some bad steers in that bunch if any of them run over here pronto will leave you to walk home that mustang hates cattle and hes only half broke you know  i forgot you were driving today she replied and looked away from him there was a moments pauselong it seemed to her  whatd you come for he asked curiously  i wanted to gather columbines see she held out the nodding flowers toward him take one do you like them  yes i like columbine he replied taking one of them his keen hazel eyes softened darkened colorados flower  columbine it is my name  well could you have a better it sure suits you  why she asked and she looked at him again  youre slendergraceful you sort of hold your head high and proud your skin is white your eyes are blue not bluebell blue but columbine blueand they turn purple when youre angry  compliments wilson this is new kind of talk for you she said  youre different today  yes i am she looked across the valley toward the westering sun and the slight flush faded from her cheeks i have no right to hold my head proud no one knows who i amwhere i came from  as if that made any difference he exclaimed  belllounds is not my dad i have no dad i was a waif they found me in the woodsa babylost among the flowers columbine belllounds ive always been but that is not my name no one can tell what my name really is  i knew your story years ago columbine he replied earnestly everybody knows old bill ought to have told you long before this but he loves you so doeseverybody you must not let this knowledge sadden you im sorry youve never known a mother or a sister why i could tell you of many orphans whowhose stories were different  you dont understand ive been happy ive not longed for anyany one except a mother its only  what dont i understand  ive not told you all  no well go on he said slowly  meaning of the hesitation and the restraint that had obstructed her thought now flashed over columbine it lay in what wilson moore might think of her prospective marriage to jack belllounds still she could not guess why that should make her feel strangely uncertain of the ground she stood on or how it could cause a constraint she had to fight herself to hide moreover to her annoyance she found that she was evading his direct request for the news she had withheld  jack belllounds is coming home tonight or tomorrow she said then waiting for her companion to reply she kept an unseeing gaze upon the scanty pines fringing old white slides but no reply appeared to be forthcoming from moore his silence compelled her to turn to him the cowboys face had subtly altered it was darker with a tinge of red under the bronze and his lower lip was released from his teeth even as she looked he had his eyes intent upon the lasso he was coiling suddenly he faced her and the dark fire of his eyes gave her a shock  ive been expecting that shorthorn back for months he said bluntly  youneverliked jack queried columbine slowly that was not what she wanted to say but the thought spoke itself  i should smile i never did  ever since you and he foughtlong agoall over  his sharp gesture made the coiled lasso loosen  ever since i licked him gooddont forget that interrupted wilson the red had faded from the bronze  yes you licked him mused columbine i remember that and jacks hated you ever since  theres been no love lost  but wils you never before talked this wayspoke out soagainst jack she protested  well im not the kind to talk behind a fellows back but im not mealymouthed either andand  he did not complete the sentence and his meaning was enigmatic altogether moore seemed not like himself the fact disturbed columbine always she had confided in him here was a most complex situationshe burned to tell him yet somehow feared toshe felt an incomprehensible satisfaction in his bitter reference to jackshe seemed to realize that she valued wilsons friendship more than she had known and now for some strange reason it was slipping from her  wewe were such good friendspards said columbine hurriedly and irrelevantly  who he stared at her  why youand me  oh his tone softened but there was still disapproval in his glance what of that  something has happened to make me think ive missed youlatelythats all  ahuh his tone held finality and bitterness but he would not commit himself columbine sensed a pride in him that seemed the cause of his aloofness  wilson why have you been different lately she asked plaintively  whats the good to tell you now he queried in reply  that gave her a blank sense of actual loss she had lived in dreams and he in realities right now she could not dispel her dreamsee and understand all that he seemed to she felt like a child then growing old swiftly the strange past longing for a mother surged up in her like a strong tide some one to lean on some one who loved her some one to help her in this hour when fatality knocked at the door of her youthhow she needed that  it might be bad for meto tell me but tell me anyhow she said finally answering as some one older than she had been an hour agoto something feminine that leaped up she did not understand this impulse but it was in her  no declared moore with dark red staining his face he slapped the lasso against his saddle and tied it with clumsy hands he did not look at her his tone expressed anger and amaze  dad says i must marry jack she said with a sudden return to her natural simplicity  i heard him tell that months ago snapped moore  you did was thatwhy she whispered  it was he answered ringingly  but that was no reason for you to bebeto stay away from me she declared with rising spirit  he laughed shortly  wils didnt you like me any more after dad said that she queried  columbine a girl nineteen years and about toto get marriedought not be a fool he replied with sarcasm  im not a fool she rejoined hotly  you ask fool questions  well you didnt like me afterward or youd never have mistreated me  if you say i mistreated youyou say whats untrue he replied just as hotly  they had never been so near a quarrel before columbine experienced a sensation new to hera commingling of fear heat and pang it seemed all in one throb wilson was hurting her a quiver ran all over her along her veins swelling and tingling  you mean i lie she flashed  yes i doif  but before he could conclude she slapped his face it grew pale then while she began to tremble  ohi didnt intend that forgive me she faltered  he rubbed his cheek the hurt had not been great so far as the blow was concerned but his eyes were dark with pain and anger  oh dont distress yourself he burst out you slapped me beforeonce years agofor kissing you ii apologize for saying you lied youre only out of your head so am i  that poured oil upon the troubled waters the cowboy appeared to be hesitating between sudden flight and the risk of staying longer  maybe thats it replied columbine with a halflaugh she was not far from tears and fury with herself let us make upbe friends again  moore squared around aggressively he seemed to fortify himself against something in her she felt that but his face grew harder and older than she had ever seen it  columbine do you know where jack belllounds has been for these three years he asked deliberately entirely ignoring her overtures of friendship  no somebody said denver some one else said kansas city i never asked dad because i knew jack had been sent away ive supposed he was workingmaking a man of himself  well i hope to heavenfor your sakewhat you suppose comes true returned moore with exceeding bitterness  do you know where he has been asked columbine some strange feeling prompted that there was a mystery here wilsons agitation seemed strange and deep  yes i do the cowboy bit that out through closing teeth as if locking them against an almost overmastering temptation  columbine lost her curiosity she was woman enough to realize that there might well be facts which would only make her situation harder  wilson she began hurriedly i owe all i am to dad he has cared for mesent me to school he has been so good to me ive loved him always it would be a shabby return for all his protection and love ifif i refused  old bill is the best man ever interrupted moore as if to repudiate any hint of disloyalty to his employer everybody in middle park and all over owes bill something hes sure good there never was anything wrong with him except his crazy blindness about his son buster jackthethe  columbine put a hand over moores lips  the man i must marry she said solemnly  you mustyou will he demanded  of course what else could i do i never thought of refusing  columbine wilsons cry was so poignant his gesture so violent his dark eyes so piercing that columbine sustained a shock that held her trembling and mute how can you love jack belllounds you were twelve years old when you saw him last how can you love him  i dont replied columbine  then how could you marry him  i owe dad obedience its his hope that i can steady jack  steady jack exclaimed moore passionately why you girlyou whitefaced flower you with your innocence and sweetness steady that damned pup my heavens he was a gambler and a drunkard he  hush implored columbine  he cheated at cards declared the cowboy with a scorn that placed that vice as utterly base  but jack was only a wild boy replied columbine trying with brave words to champion the son of the man she loved as her father he has been sent away to work hell have outgrown that wildness hell come home a man  bah cried moore harshly  columbine felt a sinking within her where was her strength she who could walk and ride so many miles to become sick with an inward quaking it was childish she struggled to hide her weakness from him  its not like you to be this way she said you used to be generous am i to blame did i choose my life  moore looked quickly away from her and standing with a hand on his horse he was silent for a moment the squaring of his shoulders bore testimony to his thought presently he swung up into the saddle the mustang snorted and champed the bit and tossed his head ready to bolt  forget my temper begged the cowboy looking down upon columbine i take it all back im sorry dont let a word of mine worry you i was only jealous  jealous exclaimed columbine wonderingly  yes that makes a fellow see red and green bad medicine you never felt it  what were you jealous of asked columbine  the cowboy had himself in hand now and he regarded her with a grim amusement  well columbine its like a story he replied im the fellow disowned by his familya wanderer of the wildsno goodand no prospects now our friend jack hes handsome and rich he has a doting old dad cattle horsesranches he wins the girl see  spurring his mustang the cowboy rode away at the edge of the slope he turned in the saddle ive got to drive in this bunch of cattle its late you hurry home then he was gone the stones cracked and rolled down under the side of the bluff  columbine stood where he had left her dubious yet with the blood still hot in her cheeks  jealous he wins the girl she murmured in repetition to herself what ever could he have meant he didnt meanhe didnt  the simple logical interpretation of wilsons words opened columbines mind to a disturbing possibility of which she had never dreamed that he might love her if he did why had he not said so jealous maybe but he did not love her the next throb of thought was like a knock at a door of her hearta door never yet opened inside which seemed a mystery of feeling of hope despair unknown longing and clamorous voices the woman just born in her instinctive and selfpreservative shut that door before she had more than a glimpse inside but then she felt her heart swell with its nameless burdens  pronto was grazing near at hand she caught him and mounted it struck her then that her hands were numb with cold the wind had ceased fluttering the aspens but the yellow leaves were falling rustling out on the brow of the slope she faced home and the west  a glorious colorado sunset had just reached the wonderful height of its color and transformation the sage slopes below her seemed rosy velvet the golden aspens on the farther reaches were on fire at the tips the foothills rolled clear and mellow and rich in the light the gulf of distance on to the great black range was veiled in mountain purple and the dim peaks beyond the range stood up sunsetflushed and grand the narrow belt of blue sky between crags and clouds was like a river full of fleecy sails and wisps of silver above towered a pall of dark cloud full of the shades of approaching night  oh beautiful breathed the girl with all her worship of nature that wild world of sunset grandeur and loneliness and beauty was hers over there under a peak of the black range was the place where she had been found a baby lost in the forest she belonged to that and so it belonged to her strength came to her from the glory of light on the hills  pronto shot up his ears and checked his trot  what is it boy called columbine the trail was getting dark shadows were creeping up the slope as she rode down to meet them the mustang had keen sight and scent she reined him to a halt  all was silent the valley had begun to shade on the far side and the rose and gold seemed fading from the nearer below on the level floor of the valley lay the rambling old ranchhouse with the cabins nestling around and the corrals leading out to the soft hayfields misty and gray in the twilight a single light gleamed it was like a beacon  the air was cold with a nip of frost from far on the other side of the ridge she had descended came the bawls of the last straggling cattle of the roundup but surely pronto had not shot up his ears for them as if in answer a wild sound pealed down the slope making the mustang jump columbine had heard it before  pronto its only a wolf she soothed him  the peal was loud rather harsh at first then softened to a mourn wild lonely haunting a pack of coyotes barked in angry answer a sharp staccato yelping chorus the more piercing notes biting on the cold night air these mountain mourns and yelps were music to columbine she rode on down the trail in the gathering darkness less afraid of the night and its wild denizens than of what awaited her at white slides ranch    chapter ii  darkness settled down like a black mantle over the valley columbine rather hoped to find wilson waiting to take care of her horse as used to be his habit but she was disappointed no light showed from the cabin in which the cowboys lived he had not yet come in from the roundup she unsaddled and turned pronto loose in the pasture  the windows of the long low ranchhouse were bright squares in the blackness sending cheerful rays afar columbine wondered in trepidation if jack belllounds had come home it required effort of will to approach the house yet since she must meet him the sooner the ordeal was over the better nevertheless she tiptoed past the bright windows and went all the length of the long porch and turned around and went back and then hesitated fighting a slow drag of her spirit an oppression upon her heart the door was crude and heavy it opened hard  columbine entered a big room lighted by a lamp on the upper table and by blazing logs in a huge stone fireplace this was the livingroom rather gloomy in the corners and bare but comfortable for all simple needs the logs were new and the chinks between them filled with clay still white showing that the house was of recent build  the rancher belllounds sat in his easychair before the fire his big horny hands extended to the warmth he was in his shirtsleeves a gray boldfaced man of over sixty years still muscular and rugged  at columbines entrance he raised his drooping head and so removed the suggestion of sadness in his posture  wal lass hyar you are was his greeting jake has been hollerin thet chuck was ready now we can eat  daddiddid your son come asked columbine  no i got word jest at sundown one of bakers cowpunchers from up the valley he rode up from kremmlin an stopped to say jack was celebratin his arrival by too much red liquor reckon he wont be home tonight mebbe tomorrow  belllounds spoke in an even heavy tone without any apparent feeling always he was mercilessly frank and never spared the truth but columbine who knew him well felt how this news flayed him resentment stirred in her toward the wayward son but she knew better than to voice it  natural like i reckon fer jack to feel gay on gettin home i aint holdin thet agin him these last three years must have been gallin to thet boy  columbine stretched her hands to the blaze  its cold dad she averred i didnt dress warmly so i nearly froze autumn is here and theres frost in the air oh the hills were all gold and redthe aspen leaves were falling i love autumn but it means winter is so near  wal wal time flies sighed the old man whered you ride  up the west slope to the bluff its far i dont go there often  meet any of the boys i sent the outfit to drive stock down from the mountain ive lost a good many head lately theyre eatin some weed thet poisons them they swell up an die wuss this year than ever before  why that is serious dad poor things thats worse than eating loco yes i met wilson moore driving down the slope  ahuh wal lets eat  they took seats at the table which the cook jake was loading with steaming victuals supper appeared to be a rather sumptuous one this evening in honor of the expected guest who had not come columbine helped the old man to his favorite dishes stealing furtive glances at his lined and shadowed face she sensed a subtle change in him since the afternoon but could not see any sign of it in his look or demeanor his appetite was as hearty as ever  so you met wils is he still makin up to you asked belllounds presently  no he isnt i dont see that he ever didthatdad she replied  youre a kid in mind an a woman in body thet cowpuncher has been lovesick over you since you were a little girl its what kept him hyar ridin fer me  dad i dont believe it said columbine feeling the blood at her temples you always imagined such things about wilson and the other boys as well  ahuh im an old fool about wimmen hey mebbe i was years ago but i can see now didnt wils always get oryeyed when any of the other boys shined up to you  i cant remember that he did replied columbine she felt a desire to laugh yet the subject was anything but amusing to her  wal youve always been innocentlike thank the lord you never leaned to tricks of most pretty lasses makin eyes at all the men anyway a matter of three months ago i told wils to keep away from youthet you were not fer any poor cowpuncher  you never liked him why was it fair taking him as boys come  wal i reckon it wasnt replied belllounds and as he looked up his broad face changed to ruddy color thet boys the best rider an roper ive had in years he aint the broncobustin kind he never drank he was honest an willin he saves his money hes good at handlin stock thet boy will be a rich rancher some day  strange then you never liked him murmured columbine she felt ashamed of the good it did her to hear wilson praised  no it aint strange i have my own reasons replied belllounds gruffly as he resumed eating  columbine believed she could guess the cause of the old ranchers unreasonable antipathy for this cowboy not improbably it was because wilson had always been superior in every way to jack belllounds the boys had been natural rivals in everything pertaining to life on the range what bill belllounds admired most in men was paramount in wilson and lacking in his own son  will you put jack in charge of your ranches now asked columbine  not much i reckon ill try him hyar at white slides as foreman an if he runs the outfit then ill see  dad hell never run the white slides outfit asserted columbine  wal it is a hard bunch ill agree but i reckon the boys will stay exceptin mebbe wils an itll be jest as well fer him to leave  its not good business to send away your best cowboy ive heard you complain lately of lack of men  i sure do need men replied belllounds seriously stock gettin more n we can handle i sent word over the range to meeker hopin to get some men there what i need most jest now is a fellar who knows dogs an wholl hunt down the wolves an lions an bears thetre livin off my cattle  dad you need a whole outfit to handle the packs of hounds youve got such an assortment of them there must be a hundred only yesterday some man brought a lot of mangy longeared canines its funny why dad youre the laughingstock of the range  yes an the rangell be thankin me when i rid it of all these varmints declared belllounds lass i swore id buy every dog fetched to me until i had enough to kill off the coyotes an lofers an lions ill do it too but i need a hunter  why not put wilson moore in charge of the hounds hes a hunter  wal lass thet might be a good idee replied the rancher nodding his grizzled head say youre sort of wantin me to keep wils on  yes dad  why do you like him so much  i like himof course he has been almost a brother to me  ahuh wal are you sure you dont like him moren you oughtconsiderin whats in the wind  yes im sure i dont replied columbine with tingling cheeks  wal im glad of thet reckon itll be no great matter whether wils stays or leaves if he wants to ill give him a job with the hounds  that evening columbine went to her room early it was a cozy little blanketed nest which she had arranged and furnished herself there was a little square window cut through the logs and through which many a night the snow had blown in upon her bed she loved her little isolated refuge this night it was cold the first time this autumn and the lighted lamp though brightening the room did not make it appreciably warmer there was a stone fireplace but as she had neglected to bring in wood she could not start a fire so she undressed blew out the lamp and went to bed columbine was soon warm and the darkness of her little room seemed good to her sleep she felt never would come that night she wanted to think she could not help but think and she tried to halt the whirl of her mind wilson moore occupied the foremost place in her varying thoughtsa fact quite remarkable and unaccountable she tried to change it in vain wilson persistedon his white mustang flying across the ridgetopcoming to her as never beforewith his anger and disapprovalhis strange poignant cry columbine that haunted herwith his bitter smile and his resignation and his mocking talk of jealousy he persisted and grew with the old ranchers frank praise  i must not think of him she whispered why ill bebe married soon married  that word transformed her thought and where she had thrilled she now felt cold she revolved the fact in mind  its true ill be married because i oughti must she said half aloud because i cant help myself i ought to want tofor dads sake but i donti dont  she longed above all things to be good loyal loving helpful to show her gratitude for the home and the affection that had been bestowed upon a nameless waif bill belllounds had not been under any obligation to succor a strange lost child he had done it because he was big noble many splendid deeds had been laid at the old ranchers door she was not of an ungrateful nature she meant to pay but the significance of the price began to dawn upon her  it will change my whole life she whispered aghast  but how columbine pondered she must go over the details of that change no mother had ever taught her the few women that had been in the belllounds home from time to time had not been sympathetic or had not stayed long enough to help her much even her school life in denver had left her still a child as regarded the serious problems of women  if im his wife she went on ill have to be with himill have to give up this little roomill never be freealonehappy any more  that was the first detail she enumerated it was also the last realization came with a sickening little shudder and that moment gave birth to the nucleus of an unconscious revolt  the coyotes were howling wild sharp sweet notes they soothed her troubled aching head lulled her toward sleep reminded her of the goldandpurple sunset and the slopes of sage the lonely heights and the beauty that would never change on the morrow she drowsily thought she would persuade wilson not to kill all the coyotes to leave a few because she loved them                                       bill belllounds had settled in middle park in 1860 it was wild country a home of the ute indians and a natural paradise for elk deer antelope buffalo the mountain ranges harbored bear these ranges sheltered the rolling valley land which some explorer had named middle park in earlier days  much of this inclosed tableland was prairie where long grass and wild flowers grew luxuriantly belllounds was a cattleman and he saw the possibilities there to which end he sought the friendship of piah chief of the utes this noble red man was well disposed toward the white settlers and his tribe during those troublous times kept peace with these invaders of their mountain home  in 1868 belllounds was instrumental in persuading the utes to relinquish middle park the slopes of the hills were heavily timbered gold and silver had been found in the mountains it was a country that attracted prospectors cattlemen lumbermen the summer season was not long enough to grow grain and the nights too frosty for corn otherwise middle park would have increased rapidly in population  in the years that succeeded the departure of the utes bill belllounds developed several cattleranches and acquired others white slides ranch lay some twentyodd miles from middle park being a winding arm of the main valley land its development was a matter of later years and belllounds lived there because the country was wilder the rancher as he advanced in years seemed to want to keep the loneliness that had been his in earlier days at the time of the return of his son to white slides belllounds was rich in cattle and land but he avowed frankly that he had not saved any money and probably never would his hand was always open to every man and he never remembered an obligation he trusted every one a proud boast of his was that neither white man nor red man had ever betrayed his trust his cowboys took advantage of him his neighbors imposed upon him but none were there who did not make good their debts of service or stock belllounds was one of the great pioneers of the frontier days to whom the west owed its settlement and he was finer than most because he proved that the indians if not robbed or driven would respond to friendliness                                       belllounds was not seen at his customary tasks on the day he expected his son he walked in the fields and around the corrals he often paced up and down the porch scanning the horizon below where the road from kremmling showed white down the valley and part of the time he stayed indoors  it so happened that early in the afternoon he came out in time to see a buckboard drawn by dustandlatherstained horses pull into the yard and then he saw his son some of the cowboys came running there were greetings to the driver who appeared well known to them  jack belllounds did not look at them he threw a bag out of the buckboard and then clambered down slowly to go toward the porch  wal jackmy sonim sure glad youre back home said the old rancher striding forward his voice was deep and full singularly rich but that was the only sign of feeling he showed  howdydad replied the son not heartily as he put out his hand to his fathers  jack bellloundss form was tail with a promise of his fathers bulk but he did not walk erect he slouched a little his face was pale showing he had not of late been used to sun and wind any stranger would have seen the resemblance of boy to man would have granted the handsome boldness but denied the strength the lower part of jack bellloundss face was weak  the constraint of this meeting was manifest mostly in the manner of the son he looked ashamed almost sullen but if he had been under the influence of liquor at kremmling as reported the day before he had entirely recovered  come on in said the rancher  when they got into the big livingroom and belllounds had closed the doors the son threw down his baggage and faced his father aggressively  do they all know where ive been he asked bitterly broken pride and shame flamed in his face  nobody knows the secrets been kept replied belllounds  amaze and relief transformed the young man aw now imglad he exclaimed and he sat down half covering his face with shaking hands  jack well start over said belllounds earnestly and his big eyes shone with a warm and beautiful light right hyar well never speak of where youve been these three years never again  jack gazed up then with all the sullenness and shadow gone  father you were wrong aboutdoing me good its done me harm but now if nobody knowswhy ill try to forget it  mebbe i blundered

he said theyll find out whos boss oh im aching to get into boots and ride and tear around  belllounds stroked his grizzled beard and regarded his son with mingled pride and doubt not at this moment most assuredly could he get away from the wonderful fact that his only son was home  thets all right son but youve been off the range fer three years youll need advice now listen be gentle with hosses you used to be mean with a hoss some cowboys jam their hosses around an make em pitch an bite but it aint the best way a hoss has got sense ive some fine stock an dont want it spoiled an be easy an

right you have but them was particular bad cases im not advisin thet way son its close to my heartthis hope i have thet youll  the full voice quavered and broke it would indeed have been a hardened youth who could not have felt something of the deep and unutterable affection in the old man jack belllounds put an arm around his fathers shoulder  dad ill make you proud of me yet give me a chance and dont be sore if i cant do wonders right at first  son you shall have every chance an thet reminds me do you remember columbine  i should say so replied jack eagerly they spoke of her in kremmling where is she  i reckon somewheres about jack you an columbine are to marry  marry columbine and me he ejaculated  yes youre my son an shes my adopted daughter i wont split my property an its right she had a share a fine strong quiet pretty lass jack an shell make a good wife ive set my heart on the idee  but columbine always hated me  wal she was a kid then an you teased her now shes a woman an willin to please me jack youll not buck agin this deal  that depends replied jack id marry most any girl you wanted me to but if columbine were to flout me as she used towhy id buck sure enough dad are you sure she knows nothing suspects nothing of where youyou sent me  son i swear she doesnt  do you mean youd want us to marry soon  wal yes as soon as collie would think reasonable jack shes shy an strange an deep too if you ever win her heart youll be richer than if you owned all the gold in the rockies id say go slow but contrariwise itd mebbe be surer to steady you keep you home if you married right off  married right off echoed jack with a laugh its like a story but wait till i see her                                       at that very moment columbine was sitting on the topmost log of a high corral deeply interested in the scene before her  two cowboys were in the corral with a saddled mustang one of them carried a canvas sack containing tools and horseshoes as he dropped it with a metallic clink the mustang snorted and jumped and rolled the whites of his eyes he knew what that clink meant  miss collie air youall goin to sit up thar inquired the taller cowboy a lean supple and powerful fellow with a rough redblue face hard as a rock and steady bright eyes  i sure am jim she replied imperturbably  but weve gotta hawgtie him protested the cowboy  yes i know and youre going to be gentle about it  jim scratched his sandy head and looked at his comrade a little gnarled fellow like the bleached root of a tree he seemed all legs  you hear you wyomin galoot he said to jim them shoes goes on whang right gentle  jim grinned and turned to speak to his mustang whang the laws laid down an we wanta see how much hoss sense you hev  the shaggy mustang did not appear to be favorably impressed by this speech it was a mighty distrustful look he bent upon the speaker  jim seein as how this here jobs aboot the last miss collie will ever boss us on we gotta do it without whang turnin a hair drawled the other cowboy  lem why is this the last job ill ever boss you boys demanded columbine quickly  jim gazed quizzically at her and lem assumed that blank innocent face columbine always associated with cowboy deviltry  wal miss collie we reckon the new boss of white slides rode in today  you mean jack belllounds came home said columbine well ill boss you boys the same as always  thetd be mighty fine for us but im feared it aint writ in the fatal history of white slides replied jim  buster jack will run over the ole man an marry you added lem  oh so thats your idea rejoined columbine lightly well if such a thing did come to pass id be your boss more than ever  i reckon no miss collie for well not be ridin fer white sides said jim simply  columbine had sensed this very significance long before when the possibility of buster jacks return had been rumored she knew cowboys as well try to change the rocks of the hills  boys the day you leave white slides will be a sad one for me sighed columbine  miss collie we aint gone yet put in lem with awkward softness jim has long hankered fer wyomin an he jest talks thet way  then the cowboys turned to the business in hand jim removed the saddle but left the bridle on this move of course deceived whang he had been broken to stand while his bridle hung and like a horse that would have been good if given a chance he obeyed as best he could shaking in every limb jim apparently to hobble whang roped his forelegs together low down but suddenly slipped the rope over the knees then whang knew he had been deceived he snorted fire let out a scream and rearing on his hind legs he pawed the air savagely jim hauled on the rope while whang screamed and fought with his forefeet high in the air then jim with a powerful jerk pulled whang down and threw him while lem seizing the bridle hauled him over on his side and sat upon his head whereupon jim slipped the loop off one front hoof and pulled the other leg back across one of the hind ones where both were secured by a quick hitch then the lasso was wound and looped around front and back hoofs together when this had been done the mustang was rolled over on his other side his free front hoof lassoed and pulled back to the hind one where both were secured as had been the others this rendered the mustang powerless and the shoeing proceeded  columbine hated to sit by and watch it but she always stuck to her post when opportunity afforded because she knew the cowboys would not be brutal while she was there  wal hell step high tomorrer said lem as he got up from his seat on the head of whang  ahuh an like a mule hell be my friend fer twenty years jest to get a chance to kick me replied jim  for columbine the most interesting moment of this incident was when the mustang raised his head to look at his legs in order to see what had been done to them there was something almost human in that look it expressed intelligence and fear and fury  the cowboys released his legs and let him get up whang stamped his ironshod hoofs  it was a mean trick whang said columbine if i owned you thatd never be done to you  i reckon you can have him fer the askin said jim as he threw on the saddle nobody but me can ride him do you want to try  not in these clothes replied columbine laughing  wal miss collie youre shore dressed up fine today fer some reason or other said lem shaking his head while he gathered up the tools from the ground  ahuh an here comes the reason exclaimed jim in low hoarse whisper  columbine heard the whisper and at the same instant a sharp footfall on the gravel road she quickly turned almost losing her balance and she recognized jack belllounds the boy buster jack she remembered so well was approaching now a young man taller heavier older with paler face and bolder look columbine had feared this meeting had prepared herself for it but all she felt when it came was annoyance at the fact that he had caught her sitting on top of the corral fence with little regard for dignity it did not occur to her to jump down she merely sat straight smoothed down her skirt and waited  jim led the mustang out of the corral and lem followed it looked as if they wanted to avoid the young man but he prevented that  howdy boys im jack belllounds he said rather loftily but his manner was nonchalant he did not offer to shake hands  jim mumbled something and lem said hod do  thats an ornerylooking bronc went on belllounds and he reached with careless hand for the mustang whang jerked so hard that he pulled jim half over  wal he aint a bronc but i reckon hes all the rest drawled jim  both cowboys seemed slow careless they were neither indifferent nor responsive columbine saw their keen steady glances go over belllounds then she took a second and less hasty look at him he wore highheeled fancytopped boots tightfitting trousers of dark material a heavy belt with silver buckle and a white soft shirt with wide collar open at the neck he was bareheaded  im going to run white slides he said to the cowboys whatre your names  columbine wanted to giggle which impulse she smothered the idea of any one asking jim his name she had never been able to find out  my handle is lemuel archibawld billings replied lem blandly the middle name was an addition no one had ever heard  belllounds then directed his glance and steps toward the girl the cowboys dropped their heads and shuffled on their way  theres only one girl on the ranch said belllounds so you must be columbine  yes and youre jack she replied and slipped off the fence im glad to welcome you home  she offered her hand and he held it until she extricated it there was genuine surprise and pleasure in his expression  well id never have known you he said surveying her from head to foot its funny i had the clearest picture of you in mind but youre not at all like i imagined the columbine i remember was thin whitefaced and all eyes  its been a long time seven years she replied but i knew you youre older taller bigger but the same buster jack  i hope not he said frankly condemning that former self dad needs me he wants me to take charge hereto be a man im back now its good to be home i never was worth much lord i hope i dont disappoint him again  i hope so too she murmured to hear him talk frankly seriously like this counteracted the unfavorable impression she had received he seemed earnest he looked down at the ground where he was pushing little pebbles with the toe of his boot she had a good opportunity to study his face and availed herself of it he did look like his father with his big handsome head and his blue eyes bolder perhaps from their prominence than from any direct gaze or fire his face was pale and shadowed by worry or discontent it seemed as though a repressed character showed there his mouth and chin were undisciplined columbine could not imagine that she despised anything she saw in the features of this young man yet there was something about him that held her aloof she had made up her mind to do her part unselfishly she would find the best in him like him for it be strong to endure and to help yet she had no power to control her vague and strange perceptions why was it that she could not feel in him what she liked in jim montana or lem or wilson moore  this was my second long stay away from home said belllounds the first was when i went to school in kansas city i liked that i was sorry when they turned me outsent me home but the last three years were hell  his face worked and a shade of dark blood rippled over it  did you work queried columbine  work it was worse than work sure i worked he replied  columbines sharp glance sought his hands they looked as soft and unscarred as her own what kind of work had he done if he told the truth  well if you work hard for dad learn to handle the cowboys and never take up those old bad habits  you mean drink and cards i swear id forgotten them for three yearsuntil yesterday i reckon ive the better of them  then youll make dad and me happy youll be happy too  columbine thrilled at the touch of fineness coming out in him there was good in him whatever the mad wild pranks of his boyhood  dad wants us to marry he said suddenly with shyness and a strange amused smile isnt that funny you and mewho used to fight like cat and dog do you remember the time i pushed you into the old mudhole and you lay in wait for me behind the house to hit me with a rotten cabbage  yes i remember replied columbine dreamily it seems so long ago  and the time you ate my pie and how i got even by tearing off your little dress so you had to run home almost without a stitch on  guess ive forgotten that replied columbine with a blush i must have been very little then  you were a little devil do you remember the fight i had with mooreabout you  she did not answer for she disliked the fleeting expression that crossed his face he remembered too well  ill settle that score with moore he went on besides i wont have him on the ranch  dad needs good hands she said with her eyes on the gray sage slopes mention of wilson moore augmented the aloofness in her an annoyance pricked along her veins  before we get any farther id like to know something has moore ever made love to you  columbine felt that prickling augment to a hot sharp wave of blood why was she at the mercy of strange quick unfamiliar sensations why did she hesitate over that natural query from jack belllounds  no he never has she replied presently  thats damn queer you used to like him better than anybody else you sure hated me columbine have you outgrown that  yes of course she answered but i hardly hated you  dad said you were willing to marry me is that so  columbine dropped her head his question kindly put did not affront her for it had been expected but his actual presence the meaning of his words stirred in her an unutterable spirit of protest she had already in her will consented to the demand of the old man she was learning now however that she could not force her flesh to consent to a surrender it did not desire  yes im willing she replied bravely  soon he flashed with an eager difference in his voice  if i had my way itd not betoo soon she faltered her downcast eyes had seen the stride he had made closer to her and she wanted to run  why dad thinks itd be good for me went on belllounds now with strong selfcentered thought itd give me responsibility i reckon i need it why not soon  wouldnt it be better to wait awhile she asked we do not know each otherlet alone care  columbine ive fallen in love with you he declared hotly  oh how could you cried columbine incredulously  why i always was moony over youwhen we were kids he said and now to meet you grown up like thisso pretty and sweetsuch aa healthy blooming girl and dads word that youd be my wife soonminewhy i just went off my head at sight of you  columbine looked up at him and was reminded of how as a boy he had always taken a quick passionate longing for things he must and would have and his father had not denied him it might really be that jack had suddenly fallen in love with her  would you want to take me without mymy love she asked very low i dont love you now i might some time if you were goodif you made dad happyif you conquered  take you id take you if youif you hated me he replied now in the grip of passion  ill tell dad how i feel she said faintly andand marry you when he says  he kissed her would have embraced her had she not put him back  dont somesome one will see  columbine were engaged he asserted with a laugh of possession say you neednt look so white and scared i wont eat you but id like to oh youre a sweet girl here i was hating to come home and look at my luck  then with a sudden change that seemed significant of his character he lost his ardor dropped the halfbold halfmasterful air and showed the softer side  collie i never was any good he said but i want to be better ill prove it ill make a clean breast of everything i wont marry you with any secret between us you might find out afterward and hate me do you have any idea where ive been these last three years  no answered columbine  ill tell you right now but you must promise never to mention it to any oneor throw it up to meever  he spoke hoarsely and had grown quite white suddenly columbine thought of wilson moore he had known where jack had spent those years he had resisted a strong temptation to tell her that was as noble in him as the implication of jacks whereabouts had been base  jack that is big of you she replied hurriedly i respect youlike you for it but you neednt tell me id rather you didnt ill take the will for the deed  belllounds evidently experienced a poignant shock of amaze of relief of wonder of gratitude in an instant he seemed transformed  collie if i hadnt loved you before id love you now that was going to be the hardest job i ever hadto tell you mymy story i meant it and now ill not have to feel your shame for me and ill not feel im a cheat or a liar but i will tell you thisif you love me youll make a man of me    chapter iii  the rancher thought it best to wait till after the roundup before he turned over the foremanship to his son this was wise but jack did not see it that way he showed that his old intolerant spirit had if anything grown during his absence belllounds patiently argued with him explaining what certainly should have been clear to a young man brought up in colorado the fall roundup was the most important time of the year and during the strenuous drive the appointed foreman should have absolute control jack gave in finally with a bad grace  it was unfortunate that he went directly from his fathers presence out to the corrals some of the cowboys who had ridden all the day before and stood guard all night had just come in they were begrimed with dust weary and sleepyeyed  this hyar outfit wont see my tracks no more said one disgustedly i never kicked on doin two mens work but when it comes to rustlin day and night all the time im agoin to pass  turn in boys and sleep till we get back with the chuckwagon said wilson moore well clean up that bunch today  aint you tired wils queried bludsoe a squat bowlegged cowpuncher who appeared to be crippled or very lame  me naw grunted moore derisively blud you sure ask fool questions why youmahoganycolored stumplegged biped of a cowpuncher ive had three hours sleep in four nights  whats a biped asked bludsoe dubiously  nobody enlightened him  wils youall air the only eddicated cowman i ever loved but im a sonofagun if we aint agoin to come to blows some day declared bludsoe  he shore can sling english drawled lem billings i reckon he swallowed a dictionary onct  wal he can sling a rope too an thet evens up added jim montana  just at this moment jack belllounds appeared upon the scene the cowboys took no notice of him jim was bandaging a leg of his horse bludsoe was wearily gathering up his saddle and trappings lem was giving his tired mustang a parting slap that meant much moore evidently awaited a fresh mount a mexican lad had come in out of the pasture leading several horses one of which was the mottled white mustang that moore rode most of the time  belllounds lounged forward with interest as moore whistled and the mustang showed his pleasure manifestly he did not like the mexican boy and he did like moore  spottie its drag yearlings around for you today said the cowboy as he caught the mustang spottie tossed his head and stepped high until the bridle was on when the saddle was thrown and strapped in place the mustang showed to advantage he was beautiful but not too graceful or sleek or finepointed or prancing to prejudice any cowboy against his qualities for work  jack belllounds admiringly walked all around the mustang a little too close to please spottie  moore hes a fairtomiddling horse said belllounds with the air of judge of horseflesh whats his name  spottie replied moore shortly as he made ready to mount  hold on will you ordered jack peremptorily i like this horse i want to look him over  when he grasped the bridlereins out of the cowboys hand spottie jumped as if he had been shot at belllounds jerked at him and went closer the mustang reared snorting plunging to get loose then jack belllounds showed the sudden temper for which he was noted red stained his pale cheeks  damn youcome down he shouted infuriated at the mustang and with both hands he gave a powerful lunge spottie came down and stood there trembling all over his ears laid back his eyes showing fright and pain blood dripped from his mouth where the bit had cut him  ill teach you to stand said belllounds darkly moore lend me your spurs i want to try him out  i dont lend my spursor my horse either replied the cowboy quietly with a stride that put him within reach of spottie  the other cowboys had dropped their trappings and stood at attention with intent gaze and mute lips  is he your horse demanded jack with a quick flush  i reckon so replied moore slowly no one but me ever rode him  does my father own him or do you own him  well if thats the way you figurehe belongs to white slides returned the cowboy i never bought him i only raised him from a colt broke him and rode him  i thought so moore hes mine and im going to ride him now lend me spurs one of you cowpunchers  nobody made any motion to comply there seemed to be a suspense at hand that escaped belllounds  ill ride him without spurs he declared presently and again he turned to mount the mustang  belllounds itd be better for you not to ride him now said moore coolly  why id like to know demanded belllounds with the temper of one who did not tolerate opposition  hes the only horse left for me to ride answered the cowboy were branding today hudson was hurt yesterday he was foreman and he appointed me to fill his place ive got to rope yearlings now if you get up on spottie youll excite him hes highstrung nervous thatll be bad for him as he hates cuttingout and roping  the reasonableness of this argument was lost upon belllounds  moore maybe itd interest you to know that im foreman of white slides he asserted not without loftiness  his speech manifestly decided something vital for the cowboy  ahuh im sure interested this minute replied moore and then stepping to the side of the mustang with swift hands he unbuckled the cinch and with one sweep he drew saddle and blanket to the ground  the action surprised belllounds he stared there seemed something boyish in his lack of comprehension then his temper flamed  what do you mean by that he demanded with a strident note in his voice put that saddle back  not much its my saddle cost sixty dollars at kremmling last year good old hardearned saddle and you cant ride it savvy  yes i savvy replied belllounds violently now youll savvy what i say ill have you discharged  nope too late said moore with cool easy scorn i figured that and i quit a minute agowhen you showed what little regard you had for a horse  you quit well its damned good riddance i wouldnt have you in the outfit  you couldnt have kept me buster jack  the epithet must have been an insult to belllounds dont you dare call me that he burst out furiously  moore pretended surprise why not its your range name we all get a handle whether we like it or not theres montana and blud and lemme two bits they call me professor why should you kick on yours  i wont stand it now not from any oneespecially not you  ahuh well im afraid itll stick replied moore with sarcasm it sure suits you dont you bust everything you monkey with your old dad will sure be glad to see you bust the roundup todayand i reckon the outfit tomorrow  you insolent cowpuncher shouted belllounds growing beside himself with rage if you dont shut up ill bust your face  shut up me nope it cant be did this is a free country buster jack there was no denying moores cool stinging repetition of the epithet that had so affronted belllounds  i always hated you he rasped out hoarsely striking hard at moore he missed but a second effort landed a glancing blow on the cowboys face  moore staggered back recovered his balance and hitting out shortly he returned the blow belllounds fell against the corral fence which upheld him  buster jackyoure crazy cried the cowboy his eyes flashing do you think you can lick meafter where youve been these three years  like a maddened boy belllounds leaped forward this time his increased violence and wildness of face expressive of malignant rage he swung his arms at random moore avoided his blows and planted a fist squarely on his adversarys snarling mouth belllounds fell with a thump he got up with clumsy haste but did not rush forward again his big prominent eyes held a dark and ugly look his lower jaw wabbled as he panted for breath and speech at once  mooreill killyou he hissed with glance flying everywhere for a weapon from ground to cowboys he looked bludsoe was the only one packing a gun belllounds saw it and he was so swift in bounding forward that he got a hand on it before bludsoe could prevent  let go give methat gun by god ill fix him yelled belllounds as bludsoe grappled with him  there was a sharp struggle bludsoe wrenched the others hands free and pulling the gun he essayed to throw it but belllounds blocked his action and the gun fell at their feet  grab it sang out bludsoe ringingly quick somebody the damned foolll kill wils  lem running in kicked the gun just as belllounds reached for it when it rolled against the fence jim was there to secure it lem likewise grappled with the struggling belllounds  hyar you jack belllounds said lem couldnt you see wils wasnt packin no gun ararin like thet stop your rantin or well sure handle you rough  the old mans comin called jim warningly  the rancher appeared he strode swiftly ponderously his gray hair waved his look was as stern as that of an eagle  what the hells goin on he roared  the cowboys released jack that worthy sullen and downcast muttering to himself stalked for the house  jack stand your ground called old belllounds  but the son gave no heed once he looked back over his shoulder and his dark glance saw no one save moore  boss thars been a little argyment explained jim as with swift hand he hid bludsoes gun nuthin much  jim youre a liar replied the old rancher  aw exclaimed jim crestfallen  whatre you hidin youve got somethin there gimme thet gun  without more ado jim handed the gun over  its mine boss put in bludsoe  ahuh wal what was jim hidin it fer demanded belllounds  why i jest tossed it to himwhen isort of jined in with the argyment we was tusslin some an i didnt want no gun  how characteristic of cowboys that they lied to shield jack belllounds but it was futile to attempt to deceive the old rancher here was a man who had been forty years dealing with all kinds of men and events  bludsoe you cant fool me said old bill calmly he had roared at them and his eyes still flashed like blue fire but he was calm and cool returning the gun to its owner he continued i reckon youd spare my feelins an lie about some trick of jacks did he bust out  wal tolerable like replied bludsoe dryly  ahuh tell me thenan no lies  bellloundss shrewd eyes had rested upon wilson moore the cowboys face showed the red marks of battle and the white of passion  im not going to lie you can bet on that he declared forcefully  ahuh i might hev knowed you an jackd clash said belllounds gruffly what happened  he hurt my horse if it hadnt been for that thered been no trouble  a light leaped up in the old mans bold eyes he was a lover of horses many hard words and blows too he had dealt cowboys for being brutal  whatd he do  look at spotties mouth  the ranchers way of approaching a horse was singularly different from his sons notwithstanding the fact that spottie knew him and showed no uneasiness the examination took only a moment  tongue cut bad thets a damn shame take thet bridle off there if itd been an ornery hoss now moore howd this happen  we just rode in replied wilson hurriedly i was saddling spottie when jack came up he took a shine to the mustang and wanted to ride him when spottie rearedhes shy with strangerswhy jack gave a hell of a jerk on the bridle the bit cut spottie well that made me mad but i held in i objected to jack riding spottie you see hudson was hurt yesterday and he appointed me foreman for today i needed spottie but your son couldnt see it and that made me sore jack said the mustang was his  his interrupted belllounds  yes he claimed spottie well he wasnt really mine so i gave in when i threw off the saddle which was mine jack began to roar he said he was foreman and hed have me discharged but i said id quit already we both kept getting sorer and i called him buster jack he hit me first then we fought i reckon i was getting the best of him when he made a dive for bludsoes gun and thats all  boss as sure as im a born cowman put in bludsoe hed hev plugged wils if hed got my gun at thet he damn near got it  the old man stroked his scant gray beard with his huge steady hand apparently not greatly concerned by the disclosure  montana what do you say he queried as if he held strong store by that quiet cowboys opinion  wal boss replied jim reluctantly buster jacks temper was bad onct but now its plumb wuss  whereupon belllounds turned to moore with a gesture and a look of a man who in justice to something in himself had to speak  wils its onlucky you clashed with jack right off he said but thet was to be expected i reckon jack was in the wrong thet hoss was yours by all a cowboy holds right an square mebbe by law spottie belonged to white slides ranchto me but hes yours now fer i give him to you  much obliged belllounds i sure do appreciate that replied moore warmly its what anybodyd gamble bill belllounds would do  ahuh an id take it as a favor if youd stay on today an get thet brandin done  all right ill do that for you replied moore lem i guess you wont get your sleep till tonight come on  awl sighed lem as he picked up his bridle                                       late that afternoon columbine sat upon the porch watching the sunset it had been a quiet day for her mostly indoors once only had she seen jack and then he was riding by toward the pasture whirling a lasso round his head jack could ride like one born to the range but he was not an adept in the use of a rope nor had columbine seen the old rancher since breakfast she had heard his footsteps however pacing slowly up and down his room  she was watching the last rays of the setting sun rimming with gold the ramparts of the mountain eastward and burning a crown for old white slides peak a distant bawl and bellow of cattle had died away the branding was over for that fall how glad she felt the wind beginning to grow cold as the sun declined cooled her hot face in the solitude of her room columbine had cried enough that day to scald her cheeks  presently down the lane between the pastures she saw a cowboy ride into view very slowly he came leading another horse columbine recognized lem a second before she saw that he was leading pronto that struck her as strange another glance showed pronto to be limping apparently he could just get along and that was all columbine ran out in dismay reaching the corral gate before lem did at first she had eyes only for her beloved mustang  oh lemprontos hurt she cried  wal i should smile he is replied lem  but lem was not smiling and when he wore a serious face for columbine something had indeed happened the cowboy was the color of dust and so tired that he reeled  lem hes all bloody exclaimed columbine as she ran toward pronto  hyar you jest wait ordered lem testily prontos all cut up an you gotta hustle some linen an salve  columbine flew away to do his bidding and so quick and violent was she that when she got back to the corral she was out of breath pronto whinnied as she fell

but he wears blinders when he looks at his son im predictin bad days fer white slides ranch    chapter iv  only one man at meeker appeared to be attracted by the news that rancher bill belllounds was offering employment this was a little cadaverouslooking fellow apparently neither young nor old who said his name was bent wade he had drifted into meeker with two poor horses and a pack  whar you from asked the innkeeper observing how wade cared for his horses before he thought of himself the query had to be repeated  cripple creek i was cook for some miners an i panned gold between times was the reply  humph thet oughter been a betterpayin job than any to be hed hereabouts  yes got big pay there said wade with a sigh  whatd you leave fer  we hed a fight over the diggins an i was the only one left ill tell you whereupon wade sat down on a box removed his old sombrero and began to talk an idler sauntered over attracted by something then a miner happened by to halt and join the group  next old kemp the patriarch of the village came and listened attentively wade seemed to have a strange magnetism a magic tongue  he was small of stature but wiry and muscular his garments were old soiled worn when he removed the widebrimmed sombrero he exposed a remarkable face it was smooth except for a drooping mustache and pallid with drops of sweat standing out on the high broad forehead gaunt and hollowcheeked with an enormous nose and cavernous eyes set deep under shaggy brows these features however were not so striking in themselves long sloping almost invisible lines of pain the shadow of mystery and gloom in the deepset dark eyes a sad harmony between features and expression these marked the mans face with a record no keen eye could miss  wade told a terrible tale of gold and blood and death it seemed to relieve him his face changed and lost what might have been called its tragic light its driven intensity  his listeners shook their heads in awe hard tales were common in colorado but this one was exceptional two of the group left without comment old kemp stared with narrow halfrecognizing eyes at the newcomer  wal wal ejaculated the innkeeper it do beat hell what can happen stranger will you put up your hosses an stay  im lookin for work replied wade  it was then that mention was made of belllounds sending to meeker for hands  old bill belllounds thet settled middle park an made friends with the utes said wade as if certain of his facts  yep you have bill to rights do you know him  i seen him once twenty years ago  ever been to middle park belllounds owns ranches there said the innkeeper  he aint livin in the park now interposed kemp hes at white slides i reckon these last eight or ten years thets over the gore range  prospected all through that country said wade  wal its a fine part of colorado hay an stock countrytoo high fer grain did you mean youd been through the park  oncelong ago replied wade staring with his great cavernous eyes into space some memory of middle park haunted him  wal then i wont be steerin you wrong said the innkeeper i like thet country some people dont an i say if you can cook or pack or punch cows or most anythin youll find a bunk with old bill i understand he was needin a hunter most of all lions an wolves bad can you hunt  hey queried wade absently as he inclined his ear im deaf on one side  are you a good man with dogs an guns shouted his questioner  tolerable replied wade  then youre sure of a job  ill go much obliged to you  not atall im doin belllounds a favor reckon youll put up here tonight  i always sleep out but ill buy feed an supplies replied wade as he turned to his horses  old kemp trudged down the road wagging his gray head as if he was contending with a memory sadly failing him an hour later when bent wade rode out of town he passed kemp and hailed him the oldtimer suddenly slapped his leg by golly i knowed id met him before  later he said with a show of gossipy excitement to his friend the innkeeper thet fellar was bent wade  so he told me returned the other  but didnt you never hear of him bent wade  now you tax me thet name do pear familiar but dash take it i cant remember i knowed he was somebody though hope i didnt wish a gunfighter or outlaw on old bill who was he anyhow  they call him hellbent wade i seen him in wyomin whar he were a stagedriver but i never heerd who he was an what he was till years after thet was onct i dropped down into boulder wade was thar all shot up bein nussed by sam coles sams dead now he was a friend of wades an knowed him fer long wal i heerd all thet anybody ever heerd about him i reckon accordin to coles this hyar hellbent wade was a strange wonderful sort of fellar he had the most amazin ways he could do anythin under the sun bettern any one else bad with guns he never stayed in one place fer long he never hunted trouble but trouble follered him as i remember coles thet was wades queer ideehe couldnt shake trouble no matter whar he went always thar was hell thets what gave him the name hellbent an coles swore thet wade was the whitest man he ever knew heart of gold he said always savin somebody helpin somebody givin his money or timenever thinkin of himself atall when he began to tell thet story about cripple creek then my ole head begun to ache with rememberin fer id heerd bent wade talk before jest the same kind of story he told hyar only wuss lordy but thet fellar has seen times an queerest of all is thet idee he has how hells on his trail an everywhere he roams it ketches up with him an thar he meets the man whos got to hear his tale                                       sunset found bent wade far up the valley of white river under the shadow of the flat top mountains it was beautiful country grassy hills with colored aspen groves swelled up on his left and across the brawling stream rose a leaguelong slope of black spruce above which the bare redandgray walls of the range towered glorious with the blaze of sinking sun white patches of snow showed in the sheltered nooks wades gaze rested longest on the colored heights  by and by the narrow valley opened into a park at the upper end of which stood a log cabin a few cattle and horses grazed in an inclosed pasture the trail led by the cabin as wade rode up a bushyhaired man came out of the door rifle in hand he might have been going out to hunt but his scrutiny of wade was that of a lone settler in a wild land  howdy stranger he said  good evenin replied wade reckon youre blair an im nigh the headwaters of this river  yep a matter of three miles to trappers lake  my names wade im packin over to take a job with bill belllounds  git down an come in returned blair bills man stopped with me some time ago  obliged im sure but ill be goin on responded wade do you happen to have a hunk of deer meat game powerful scarce comin up this valley  lots of deer an elk higher up i chased a bunch of moren thirty i reckon right out of my pasture this mornin  blair crossed to an open shed near by and returned with half a deer haunch which he tied upon wades packhorse  my ole womans ailin do you happen to hev some terbaccer  i sure doboth smokin an chewin an i can spare more chewin a little goes a long ways with me  wal gimme some of both most chewin replied blair with evident satisfaction  you acquainted with belllounds asked wade as he handed over the tobacco  wal yes everybody knows bill youd never find a whiter boss in these hills  has he any family  now i cant say as to thet replied blair i heerd he lost a wife years ago mebbe he married agin but bills gittin along  good day to you blair said wade and took up his bridle  good day an good luck take the righthand trail better trot up a bit if you want to make camp before dark  wade soon entered the spruce forest then he came to a shallow roaring river the horses drank the water foaming white and amber around their knees and then with splash and thump they forded it over the slippery rocks as they cracked out upon the trail a covey of grouse whirred up into the low branches of sprucetrees they were tame  thats somethin like said wade first birds ive seen this fall reckon i can have stew any day  he halted his horse and made a move to dismount but with his eyes on the grouse he hesitated tame as chickens an they sure are pretty  then he rode on leading his packhorse the trail was not steep although in places it had washed out thus hindering a steady trot as he progressed the forest grew thick and darker and the fragrance of pine and spruce filled the air a dreamy roar of water rushing over rocks rang in the travelers ears it receded at times then grew louder presently the forest shade ahead lightened and he rode out into a wide space where green moss and flags and flowers surrounded a wonderful springhole sunset gleams shone through the trees to color the wide round pool it was shallow all along the margin with a deep large green hole in the middle where the water boiled up trout were feeding on gnats and playing on the surface and some big ones left wakes behind them as they sped to deeper water wade had an appreciative eye for all this beauty his gaze lingering longest upon the flowers  wild woods is the place for me he soliloquized as the cool wind fanned his cheeks and the sweet tang of evergreen tingled his nostrils but sure im most haunted in these lonely silent places  bent wade had the look of a haunted man perhaps the consciousness he confessed was part of his secret  twilight had come when again he rode out into the open trappers lake lay before him a beautiful sheet of water mirroring the black slopes and the fringed spruces and the flat peaks over all its gray twilightsoftened surface showed little swirls and boils and splashes where the myriads of trout were rising the trail led out over open grassy shores with a few pines straggling down to the lake and clumps of spruces raising dark blurs against the background of gleaming lake wade heard a sharp crack of hoofs on rock and he knew he had disturbed deer at their drinking also he heard a ring of horns on the branch of a tree and was sure an elk was slipping off through the woods across the lake he saw a campfire and a pale sharppointed object that was a trappers tent or an indians tepee  selecting a campsite for himself he unsaddled his horse threw the pack off the other and hobbling both animals he turned them loose his roll of bedding roped in canvas tarpaulin he threw under a sprucetree then he opened his oxhidecovered packs and laid out utensils and bags little and big all his movements were methodical yet swift accurate habitual he was not thinking about what he was doing it took him some little time to find a suitable log to split for firewood and when he had started a blaze night had fallen and the light as it grew and brightened played fantastically upon the isolating shadows  lid and pot of the little dutch oven he threw separately upon the sputtering fire and while they heated he washed his hands mixed the biscuits cut slices of meat off the deer haunch and put water on to boil he broiled his meat on the hot red coals and laid it near on clean pine chips while he waited for bread to bake and coffee to boil the smell of woodsmoke and odorous steam from pots and the fragrance of spruce mingled together keen sweet appetizing then he ate his simple meal hungrily with the content of the man who had fared worse  after he had satisfied himself he washed his utensils and stowed them away with the bags whereupon his movements acquired less dexterity and speed the rest hour had come still like the longexperienced man in the open he looked around for more to do and his gaze fell upon his weapons lying on his saddle his rifle was a henryshiny and smooth from long service and care his small gun was a colts 45 it had been carried in a saddle holster wade rubbed the rifle with his hands and then with a greasy rag which he took from the sheath after that he held the rifle to the heat of the fire a squall of rain had overtaken him that day wetting his weapons a subtle and singular difference seemed to show in the way he took up the colts his action was slow his look reluctant the small gun was not merely a thing of steel and powder and ball he dried it and rubbed it with care but not with love and then he stowed it away  next wade unrolled his bed under the spruce with one end of the tarpaulin resting on the soft mat of needles on top of that came the two woolly sheepskins which he used to lie upon then his blankets and over all the other end of the tarpaulin  this ended his tasks for the day he lighted his pipe and composed himself beside the campfire to smoke and rest awhile before going to bed the silence of the wilderness enfolded lake and shore yet presently it came to be a silence accentuated by near and distant sounds faint wild lonelythe low hum of falling water the splash of tiny waves on the shore the song of insects and the dismal hoot of owls  bill bellloundsan he needs a hunter soliloquized bent wade with gloomy penetrating eyes seeing far through the red embers that will suit me an change my luck likely livin in the woods away from peoplei could stick to a job like that but if this white slides is close to the old trail ill never stay  he sighed and a darker shadow not from flickering fire overspread his cadaverous face eighteen years ago he had driven the woman he loved away from him out into the world with her baby girl never had he rested beside a campfire that that old agony did not recur jealous fool too late he had discovered his fatal blunder and then had begun a search over colorado ending not a hundred miles across the wild mountains from where he brooded that lonely houra search ended by news of the massacre of a wagontrain by indians  that was bent wades secret  and no earthly sufferings could have been crueler than his agony and remorse as through the long years he wandered on and on the very good that he tried to do seemed to foment evil the wisdom that grew out of his suffering opened pitfalls for his wandering feet the wildness of men and the passion of women somehow waited with incredible fatality for that hour when chance led him into their lives he had toiled he had given he had fought he had sacrificed he had killed he had endured for the human nature which in his savage youth he had betrayed yet out of his supreme and endless striving to undo to make reparation to give his life to find god had come it seemed to wade in his abasement only a driving torment  but though his thought and emotion fluctuated varying wandering his memory held a fixed and changeless picture of a woman fair and sweet with eyes of nameless blue and face as white as a flower  baby would have beenlets seemost nineteen years old nowif shed lived he said a big girl i reckon like her mother strange how as i grow older i remember better  the night wind moaned through the spruces dark clouds scudded across the sky blotting out the bright stars a steady low roar of water came from the outlet of the lake the campfire flickered and burned out so that no sparks blew into the blackness and the red embers glowed and paled and crackled wade at length got up and made ready for bed he threw back tarpaulin and blankets and laid his rifle alongside where he could cover it his coat served for a pillow and he put the colts gun under that then pulling off his boots he slipped into bed dressed as he was and like all men in the open at once fell asleep  for wade and for countless men like him who for many years had roamed the west this sleeping alone in wild places held both charm and peril but the fascination of it was only a vague realization and the danger was laughed at  over bent wades quiet form the shadows played the spruce boughs waved the piny needles rustled down the wind moaned louder as the night advanced by and by the horses rested from their grazing the insects ceased to hum and the continuous roar of water dominated the solitude if wild animals passed wades camp they gave it a wide berth                                       sunrise found wade on the trail climbing high up above the lake making for the pass over the range he walked leading his horses up a zigzag trail that bore the tracks of recent travelers although this country was sparsely settled yet there were men always riding from camp to camp or from one valley town to another wade never tarried on a welltrodden trail  as he climbed higher the sprucetrees grew smaller no longer forming a green aisle before him and at length they became dwarfed and stunted and at last failed altogether soon he was above timberline and out upon a flattopped mountain range where in both directions the land rolled and dipped free of tree or shrub colorful with grass and flowers the elevation exceeded eleven thousand feet a whipping wind swept across the plainland the sun was palebright in the east slowly being obscured by gray clouds snow began to fall first in scudding scanty flakes but increasing until the air was full of a great fleecy swirl wade rode along the rim of a mountain wall watching a beautiful snowstorm falling into the brown gulf beneath him once as he headed round a break he caught sight of mountainsheep cuddled under a protecting shelf the snowsquall blew away like a receding wall leaving grass and flowers wet as the dark clouds parted the sun shone warmer out of the blue gray peaks with patches of white stood up above their blacktimbered slopes  wade soon crossed the flattopped pass over the range and faced a descent rocky and bare at first but yielding gradually to the encroachment of green he left the cold winds and bleak trails above him in an hour when he was half down the slope the forest had become warm and dry fragrant and still at length he rode out upon the brow of a last wooded bench above a grassy valley where a bright winding stream gleamed in the sun while the horses rested wade looked about him nature never tired him if he had any peace it emanated from the silent places the solemn hills the flowers and animals of the wild and lonely land  a few straggling pines shaded this last low hill above the valley grass grew luxuriantly there in the open but not under the trees where the brown needlemats jealously obstructed the green clusters of columbines waved their graceful sweet paleblue flowers that wade felt a joy in seeing he loved flowerscolumbines the glory of colorado came first and next the manyhued purple asters and then the flaunting spikes of paintbrush and after them the nameless and numberless wild flowers that decked the mountain meadows and colored the grass of the aspen groves and peeped out of the edge of snow fields  strange how it seems good to livewhen i look at a columbineor watch a beaver at his workor listen to the bugle of an elk mused bent wade he wondered why with all his life behind him he could still find comfort in these things  then he rode on his way the grassy valley with its winding stream slowly descended and widened and left foothill and mountain far behind far across a wide plain rose another range black and bold against the blue in the afternoon wade reached elgeria a small hamlet but important by reason of its being on the main stage line and because here miners and cattlemen bought supplies it had one street so wide it appeared to be a square on which faced a line of bold board houses with high flat fronts wade rode to the inn where the stagecoaches made headquarters it suited him to feed and rest his horses there and partake of a meal himself before resuming his journey  the proprietor was a stout pleasantfaced little woman loquacious and amiable glad to see a stranger for his own sake rather than from considerations of possible profit though wade had never before visited elgeria he soon knew all about the town and the miners up in the hills and the only happenings of momentthe arrival and departure of stages  prosperous place remarked wade i saw that an it ought to be growin  not so prosperous fer me as it uster be replied the lady we did well when my husband was alive before our competitor come to town he runs a hotel where miners can drink an gamble i dont but i reckon ive no cause to complain i live  who runs the other hotel  man named smith reckon thets not his real name ive had people here whobut it aint no matter  men change their names replied wade  stranger air you packin through or goin to stay  on my way to white slides ranch where im goin to work for belllounds do you know him  know belllounds me wal hes the best friend i ever had when i was at kremmlin i lived there several years my husband had stock there in fact bill started us in the cattle business but we got out of there an come here where bob died an ive been stuck ever since  everybody has a good word for belllounds observed wade  youll never hear a bad one replied the woman with cheerful warmth bill never had but one fault an people loved him fer thet  what was it  hes got a wild boy thet he thinks the sun rises an sets in buster jack they call him he used to come here often but bill sent him away somewhere the boy was spoiled i saw his mother years agoshes dead this long timean she was no wife fer bill belllounds jack took after her an bill was thet womans slave when she died all his big heart went to the son an thet accounts jack will never be any good  wade thoughtfully nodded his head as if he understood and was pondering other possibilities  is he the only child  theres a girl but shes not bills kin he adopted her when she was a baby an jacks mother hated this childjealous we used to think because it might grow up an get some of bills money  whats the girls name asked wade  columbine she was over here last summer with old bill they stayed with me it was then bill had hard words with smith across the street bill was resentin somethin smith put in my way wal the lasss the prettiest i ever seen in colorado an as good as shes pretty old bill hinted to me hed likely make a match between her an his son jack an i ups an told him if jack hadnt turned over a new leaf when he comes home thet such a marriage would be tough on columbine whew but old bill was mad he jest cant stand a word agin thet buster jack  columbine belllounds mused wade queer name  oh ive knowed three girls named columbine dont you know the flower its common in these parts very delicate like a sago lily only paler  were you livin in kremmlin when belllounds adopted the girl asked wade  laws no was the reply thet was long before i come to middle park but i heerd all about it the baby was found by golddiggers up in the mountains must have got lost from a wagontrain thet indians set on soon afterso the miners said anyway old bill took the baby an raised her as his own  how old is she now queried wade with a singular change in his tone  columbines around nineteen  bent wade lowered his head a little hiding his features under the old battered widebrimmed hat the amiable innkeeper did not see the tremor that passed over him nor the slight stiffening that followed nor the gray pallor of his face she went on talking until some one called her  wade went outdoors and with bent head walked down the street across a little river out into green pastureland he struggled with an amazing possibility columbine belllounds might be his own daughter his heart leaped with joy but the joy was shortlived no such hope in this world for bent wade this coincidence however left him with a strange prophetic sense in his soul of a tragedy coming to white slides ranch wade possessed some power of divination some strange gift to pierce the veil of the future but he could not exercise this power at will it came involuntarily like a messenger of trouble in the dark night moreover he had never yet been able to draw away from the fascination of this knowledge it lured him on always his decision had been to go on to meet this boding circumstance or to remain and meet it in the hope that he might take some ones burden upon his shoulders he sensed it now in the keen poignant clairvoyance of the momentthe tangle of life that he was about to enter old bill belllounds big and fine victim of love for a wayward son buster jack the waster the tearerdown the destroyer the wild youth at a wild time columbine the girl of unknown birth good and loyal subject to a condition sure to ruin her wades strange mind revolved a hundred outcomes to this conflict of characters but not one of them was the one that was written that remained dark never had he received so strong a call out of the unknown nor had he ever felt such intense curiosity hope had long been dead in him except the one that he might atone in some way for the wrong he had done his wife so the pangs of emotion that recurred in spite of reason and bitterness were not recognized by him as lingering hopes wade denied the human in him but he thrilled at the thought of meeting columbine belllounds there was something here beyond all his comprehension  it mightbe true he whispered ill know when i see her  then he walked back toward the inn on the way he looked into the barroom of the hotel run by smith it was a hardlooking place half full of idle men whose faces were as open pages to bent wade curiosity did not wholly control the impulse that made him wait at the door till he could have a look at the man smith somewhere at some time wade had met most of the veterans of western colorado so much he had traveled but the impulse that held him was answered and explained when smith came ina burly man with an ugly scar marring one eye bent wade recognized smith he recognized the scar for that scar was his own mark dealt to this man whose name was not smith and who had been as evil as he looked and whose nomadic life was not due to remorse or love of travel  wade passed on without being seen this recognition meant less to him than it would have ten years ago as he was not now the kind of man who hunted old enemies for revenge or who went to great lengths to keep out of their way men there were in colorado who would shoot at him on sight there had been more than one that had shot to his cost                                       that night wade camped in the foothills east of elgeria and upon the following day at sunrise his horses were breaking the frosty grass and ferns of the timbered range this he crossed rode down into a valley where a lonely cabin nestled and followed an old blazed trail that wound up the course of a brook the water was of a color that made rock and sand and moss seem like gold he saw no signs or tracks of game a gray jay now and then screeched his approach to unseen denizens of the woods the stream babbled past him over mossy ledges under the dark shade of clumps of spruces and it grew smaller as he progressed toward its source at length it was lost in a swale of high rank grass and the blazed trail led on through heavy pine woods at noon he reached the crest of the divide and halting upon an open rocky eminence he gazed down over a green and black forest slowdescending to a great irregular park that was his destination for the night  wade needed meat and to that end as he went on he kept a sharp lookout for deer especially after he espied fresh tracks crossing the trail slipping along ahead of his horses that followed him almost too closely to permit of his noiseless approach to game he hunted all the way down to the great open park without getting a shot  this park was miles across and miles long covered with tall waving grass and it had straggling arms that led off into the surrounding belt of timber it sloped gently toward the center where a round green acreage of grass gave promise of water wade rode toward this keeping somewhat to the right as he wanted to camp at the edge of the woods soon he rode out beyond one of the projecting peninsulas of forest to find the park spreading wider in that direction he saw horses grazing with elk and far down at the notch where evidently the park had outlet in a narrow valley he espied the black humpshaped shaggy forms of buffalo they bobbed off out of sight then the elk saw or scented him and they trotted away the antlered bulls ahead of the cows wade wondered if the horses were wild they showed great interest but no fear beyond them was a rising piece of ground covered with pine and it appeared to stand aloft from the forest on the far side as well as upon that by which he was approaching riding a mile or so farther he ascertained that this bit of wooded ground resembled an island in a lake presently he saw smoke arising above the treetops  a tiny brook welled out of the green center of the park and meandered around to pass near the island of pines wade saw unmistakable signs of prospecting along this brook and farther down where he crossed it he found tracks made that day  the elevated plot of ground appeared to be several acres in extent covered with smallsized pines and at the far edge there was a little log cabin wade expected to surprise a lone prospector at his evening meal as he rode up a dog ran out of the cabin barking furiously a man dressed in fringed buckskin followed he was tall and had long irongray hair over his shoulders his bronzed and weatherbeaten face was a mass of fine wrinkles where the grizzled hair did not hide them and his shining red countenance proclaimed an honest fearless spirit  howdy stranger he called as wade halted several rods distant his greeting was not welcome but it was civil his keen scrutiny however attested to more than his speech  evenin friend replied wade might i throw my pack here  sure get down answered the other i calkilate i never seen you in these diggins  no im bent wade an on my way to white slides to work for belllounds  glad to meet you im new hereabouts myself but i know belllounds my names lewis i was jest cookin grub an itll burn too if i dont rustle turn your hosses loose an come in  wade presented himself with something more than his usual methodical action he smelled buffalo steak and he was hungry the cabin had been built years ago and was a ramshackle shelter at best the stone fireplace however appeared well preserved a bed of red coals glowed and cracked upon the hearth  reckon i sure smelled buffalo meat observed wade with much satisfaction its long since i chewed a hunk of that  all ready now pitch in yes thars some buffalo left in here not hunted much thars lots of elk an herds of deer after a little snow youd think a drove of sheep had been trackin around an some bear  wade did not waste many words until he had enjoyed that meal later while he helped his host he recurred to the subject of game  if theres so many deer then theres lions an wolves  you bet i see tracks every day had a shot at a lofer not long ago missed him but i reckon thars more varmints over in the troublesome country back of white slides  troublesome do they call it that asked wade with a queer smile  sure an it is troublesome belllounds has been tryin to hire a hunter offered me big wages to kill off the wolves an lions  thats the job im goin to take  good exclaimed lewis im sure glad belllounds is a nice fellar i felt sort of cheap till i told him i wasnt really a hunter you see im prospectin up here an pretendin to be a hunter  what do you make that bluff for queried wade  you couldnt fool any one whod ever prospected for gold i saw your signs out here  wal youve sharp eyes thets all wade ive some ondesirable neighbors over here id just as lief they didnt see me diggin gold lately ive had a hunch theyre rustlin cattle anyways theyve sold cattle in kremmlin thet came from over around elgeria  wherever theres cattle theres sure to be some stealin observed wade  wal you neednt say anythin to belllounds because mebbe im wrong an if i found out i was right id go down to white slides an tell it myself belllounds done some favors  how far to white slides asked wade with a puff on his pipe  roundabout trail an rough but youll make it in one day easy beautiful country open big peaks an ranges with valleys an lakes never seen such grass  did you ever see bellloundss son  no didnt know he hed one but i seen his gal the fust day i was thar she was nice to me i went thar to be fixed up a bit nearly chopped my hand off the galcolumbine shes calleddoctored me up fact is i owe considerable to thet white slides ranch theres a cowboy wils somethin who rode up here with some medicine fer mesome they didnt have when i was thar youll like thet boy i seen he was sweet on the gal an i sure couldnt blame him  bent wade removed his pipe and let out a strange laugh significant with its little note of grim confirmation  whats funny about thet demanded lewis rather surprised  i was only laughin replied wade what you said about the cowboy bein sweet on the girl popped into my head before you told it well boys will be boys i was young once an had my day  lewis grunted as he bent over to lift a red coal to light his pipe and as he raised his head he gave wade a glance of sympathetic curiosity  wal i hope ill see more of you he said as his guest rose evidently to go  reckon you will as ill be chasin hounds all over an i want a look at them neighbors you spoke of that might be rustlers ill turn in now good night    chapter v  bent wade rode out of the forest to look down upon the white slides country at the hour when it was most beautiful  never seen the beat of that he exclaimed as he halted  the hour was sunset with the golden rays and shadows streaking ahead of him down the rolling sage hills all rosy and gray with rich strange softness groves of aspens stood isolated from one anotherhere crowning a hill with blazing yellow and there fringing the brow of another with gleaming gold and lower down reflecting the sunlight with brilliant red and purple the valley seemed filled with a delicate haze almost like smoke white slides ranch was hidden from sight as it lay in the bottomland the gray old peak towered proud and aloof clearcut and sunsetflushed against the blue the eastern slope of the valley was a vast sweep of sage and hill and grassy bench and aspen bench on fire with the colors of autumn made molten by the last flashing of the sun great black slopes of forest gave sharp contrast and led up to the redwalled ramparts of the mountain range  wade watched the scene until the fire faded the golden shafts paled and died the rosy glow on sage changed to cold steel gray then he rode out upon the foothills the trail led up and down slopes of sage grass grew thicker as he descended once he startled a great flock of prairiechickens or sagehens large gray birds lumbering swift fliers that whirred up and soon plumped down again into the sage twilight found him on a last long slope of the foothills facing the pastureland of the valley with the ranch still five miles distant now showing misty and dim in the gathering shadows  wade made camp where a brook ran near an aspen thicket he had no desire to hurry to meet events at white slides ranch although he longed to see this girl that belonged to belllounds night settled down over the quiet foothills a pack of roving coyotes visited wade and sat in a halfcircle in the shadows back of the campfire they howled and barked nevertheless sleep visited wades tired eyelids the moment he lay down and closed them                                       next morning rather late wade rode down to white slides ranch it looked to him like the property of a rich rancher who held to the old and proven customs of his generation the corrals were new but their style was old wade reflected that it would be hard for rustlers or horsethieves to steal out of those corrals a long lane led from the pastureland following the brook that ran through the corrals and by the back door of the rambling comfortablelooking cabin a cowboy was leading horses across a wide square between the main ranchhouse and a cluster of cabins and sheds he saw the visitor and waited  mornin said wade as he rode up  hod do replied the cowboy  then these two eyed each other not curiously nor suspiciously but with that steady measuring gaze common to western men  my names wade said the traveler come from meeker way im lookin for a job with belllounds  im lem billings replied the other ridin fer white slides fer years reckon the bossll be glad to take you on  is he around  sure i jest seen him replied billings as

that  wal git down an come in added billings heartily  he led the way across the square around the corner of the ranchhouse and up on a long porch where the arrangement of chairs and blankets attested to the hand of a woman the first door was open and from it issued voices first a shrill petulant boys complaint and then a mans deep slow patient reply  lem billings knocked on the doorjamb  wal whats wanted called belllounds  boss thars a man wantin to see you replied lem  heavy steps approached the doorway and it was filled with the large figure of the rancher wade remembered belllounds and saw only a gray difference in years  good mornin lem an good moinin to you stranger was the ranchers greeting his bold blue glance honest and frank and keen with all his long experience of men taking wade in with one flash  lem discreetly walked to the end of the porch as another figure that of the son who resembled the father filled the doorway with eyes less kind bent upon the visitor  my names wade im over from meeker way hopin to find a job with you said wade  glad to meet you replied belllounds extending his huge hand to shake wades i need you sure bad whats your special brand of work  i

a quiet smile and a lowering of his head reckon you didnt catch my name  walno i didnt slowly replied belllounds and his pause with the keener look he bestowed upon wade told how the latters query had struck home  wadebent wade said wade with quiet distinctness  not hellbent wade ejaculated belllounds  the same i aint proud of the handle but i never sail under false colors  wal ill be damned went on the rancher wade ive heerd of you fer years some bad but most good an i reckon im jest as glad to meet you as if youd been somebody else  youll give me the job  i should smile  im thankin you reckon i was some worried jobs are hard for me to get an harder to keep  thets not onnatural considerin the hell whichs said to camp on your trail replied belllounds dryly wade i cant say i take a hell of a lot of stock in such talk fifty years ive been west of the missouri i know the west an i know men talk flies from camp to ranch from diggins to town an always some one adds a little more now i trust my judgment an i trust men no one ever betrayed me yet  im that way too replied wade but it doesnt pay an yet i still kept on bein that way belllounds my names as bad as good all over western colorado but as man to man i tell youi never did a lowdown trick in my life never but once  an what was thet queried the rancher gruffly  i killed a man who was innocent replied wade with quivering lips anan drove the woman i loved to her death  aw we all make mistakes some time in our lives said belllounds hurriedly i made most as big a one as yoursso help me god  ill tell you interrupted wade  you neednt tell me anythin said belllounds interrupting in his turn but at thet some time id like to hear about the lascelles outfit over on the gunnison i knowed lascelles an a pardner of mine down in middle park came back from the gunnison with the doggondest story i ever heerd thet was five years ago this summer of course i knowed your name long before but this time i heerd it powerful strong you got in thet mixup to your neck wal what consarns me now is this is there any sense in the talk thet wherever you land theres hell to pay  belllounds theres no sense in it but a lot of truth confessed wade gloomily  ahuh wal hellbent wade ill take a chance on you boomed the ranchers deep voice rich with the intent of his big heart ive gambled all my life an the best friends i ever made were men id helped what wages do you ask  ill take what you offer  im payin the boys forty a month but thets not enough fer you  yes thatll do  good its settled concluded belllounds rising then he saw his son standing inside the door say jack shake hands with bent wade hunter an allaround man wade thiss my boy ive jest put him on as foreman of the outfit an while im at it ill say thet youll take orders from me an not from him  wade looked up into the face of jack belllounds returned his brief greeting and shook his limp hand the contact sent a strange chill over wade young bellloundss face was marred by a bruise and shaded by a sullen light  get billins to take you out to thet new cabin an sheds i jest had put up said the rancher youll bunk in the cabin aw i know men like you sleep in the open but you cant do thet under old white slides in winter not much make yourself to home an ill walk out after a bit an well look over the dog outfit when you see thet outfit youll holler fer help  wade bowed his thanks and putting on his sombrero he turned away as he did so he caught a sound of light quick footsteps on the far end of the porch  hello youall cried a girls voice with melody in it that vibrated piercingly upon wades sensitive ears  mornin columbine replied the rancher  bent wades heart leaped up this girlish voice rang upon the chord of memory wade had not the strength to look at her then it was not that he could not bear to look but that he could not bear the disillusion sure to follow his first glimpse of this adopted daughter of belllounds sweet to delude himself ah the years were bearing sterner upon his head the old dreams persisted sadder now for the fact that from long use they had become halfrealities wade shuffled slowly across the green square to where the cowboy waited for him his eyes were dim and a sickness attended the sinking of his heart  wade i aint a bettin fellar but ill bet old bill took you up vouchsafed billings with interest  glad to say he did replied wade youre to show me the new cabin where im to bunk  come along said lem leading off air you agoin to handle stock or chase coyotes  my jobs huntin  wal it may be thet from sunup to sundown but between times youll be sure busy otherwise i opine went on lem did you meet the bosss son  yes he was there an belllounds made it plain i was to take orders from him an not from his son  thetll make your job a million times easier declared lem as if to make up for former hasty pessimism he led the way past some log cabins and sheds with dirt roofs and low flattopped barns out across another brook where willowtrees were turning yellow then the new cabin came into view it was small with one door and one window and a porch across the front it stood on a small elevation near the swift brook and overlooking the ranchhouse perhaps a quarter of a mile below above it and across the brook had been built a high fence constructed of aspen poles laced closely together the sounds therefrom proclaimed this stockade to be the dogpen  lem helped wade unpack and carry his outfit into the cabin it contained one room the corner of which was filled with blocks and slabs of pine evidently left there after the construction of the cabin and meant for firewood the ample size of the stone fireplace attested to the severity of the winters  real sawed boards on the floor exclaimed lem meaning to impress the newcomer i call this a plumb good bunk  much too good for me replied wade  wal ill look after your hosses said lem i reckon youll fix up your bunk take my hunch an ask miss collie to find you some furniture an sich like shes ole bills daughter an she makes up ferferwal fer a lot we hev to stand ill fetch the boys over later  do you smoke asked wade ive somethin fine i fetched up from leadville  smoke me ill give you a hoss right now for a cigar i git one onct a year mebbe  heres a box ive been packin for long replied wade as he handed it up to billings theyre spanish all right too rich for my blood  a box of gold could not have made that cowboys eyes shine any brighter  whoopee he yelled why man youre like the fairy in the kids story wont i make the outfit wild aw i forgot thars only jim an blud left wal ill divvy with them sure wade you hit me right i was dyin fer a real smoke an i reckon whats mine is yours  then he strode out of the cabin whistling a merry cowboy tune  wade was left sitting in the middle of the room on his roll of bedding and for a long time he remained there motionless with his head bent his worn hands idly clasped a heavy footfall outside aroused him from his meditation  hey wade called the cheery voice of belllounds then the rancher appeared at the door hows this bunk suit you  much too fine for an oldtimer like me replied wade  oldtimer say youre young yet look at me sixtyeight last birthday wal every dog has his day whatre you needin to fix this bunk comfortable like  reckon i dont need much  wal youve beddin an cook outfit go get a table an a chair an a bench from thet first cabin the boys thet had it are gone somethin with a back to it a rockinchair if theres one youll find tools an boxes an stuff in the workshop if you want to make a cupboard or anythin  how about a lookinglass asked wade i had a piece but i broke it  haw haw mebbe we can rustle thet too my girls good on helpin the boys fix up womanlike you know an shell fetch you some decorations on her own hook now lets take a look at the hounds  belllounds led the way out toward the crude dogcorral and the way he leaped the brook bore witness to the fact that he was still vigorous and spry the door of the pen was made of boards hung on wire as belllounds opened it there came a pattering rush of many padded feet and a chorus of barks and whines wades surprised gaze took in forty or fifty dogs mostly hounds browns and blacks and yellows all sizesa motley mangy hungry pack if he had ever seen one  i swore id buy every hound fetched to me till id cleaned up the varmints around white slides an sure i was imposed on explained the rancher  some goodlookin hounds in the bunch replied wade an theres hardly too many ill train two packs so i can rest one when the others huntin  wal ill be doggoned ejaculated belllounds with relief i sure thought youd roar all this rabble to take care of  no trouble after ive got acquainted said wade have they been hunted any  some of the boys took out a bunch but they split on deer tracks an elk tracks an lord knows what all never put up a lion then again billings took some out after a pack of coyotes an gol darn me if the coyotes didnt lick the hounds an wuss jack my son got it into his head thet he was a hunter the other mornin he found a fresh lion track back of the corral an he ups an puts the whole pack of hounds on the trail i had a good many more hounds in the pack than you see now wal anyway it was great to hear the noise thet pack made jack lost every blamed hound of them thet night an next day an the followin they straggled in but twenty some never did come back  wade laughed they may come yet i reckon though theyve gone home where they came from are any of these hounds recommended  every consarned one of them declared belllounds  thats funny but i guess its natural do you know for sure whether you bought any good dogs  yes i gave fifty dollars for two hounds got them of a friend in middle park whose pack killed off the lions there theyre good dogs trained on lion wolf an bear  pick em out said wade  with a throng of canines crowding and fawning round him and snapping at one another it was difficult for the rancher to draw the two particular ones apart so they could be looked over at length he succeeded and wade drove back the rest of the pack  the big fellars sampson an the others jim said belllounds  sampson was a huge hound gray and yellow with mottled black marks very long ears and big solemn eyes jim a goodsized dog but small in comparison with the other was black all over except around the nose and eyes jim had many scars he was old yet not past a vigorous age and he seemed a quiet dignified wise hound quite out of his element in that mongrel pack  if theyre as good as they look were lucky said wade as he tied the ends of his rope round their necks now are there any more you know are good  denver come hyar yelled belllounds a white yellowspotted hound came wagging his tail ill swear by denver an theres one morekane hes half bloodhound a queer wicked kind of dog he keeps to himself kane come hyar  belllounds tramped around the corral and finally found the hound in question asleep in a dusty hole kane was the only beautiful dog in the lot if half of him was bloodhound the other half was shepherd for his black and brown hair was inclined to curl and his head had the fine thoroughbred contour of the shepherd his ears long and drooping and thin betrayed the hound in him kane showed no disposition to be friendly his dark eyes sad and mournful burned with the fires of doubt  wade haltered kane jim and sampson which act almost precipitated a fight and led them out of the corral denver friendly and glad followed at the ranchers heels  ill keep them with me an make lead dogs out of them said wade belllounds that bunch hasnt had enough to eat theyre half starved  wal thets worried me moren youll guess declared belllounds with irritation what do a lot of cowpunchin fellars know about dogs why they nearly ate bludsoe up he wouldnt feed em an wils who seemed good with dogs was taken off bad hurt the other day lems been tryin to rustle feed fer them now well give back the dogs you dont want to keep an thet way thin out the pack  yes we wont need em all an i reckon ill take the worry of this dogpack off your mind  thets your job wade my orders are fer you to kill off the varmints lions wolves coyotes an every fall some ole silvertip gits bad an now an then other bears whatever you need in the way of supplies jest ask fer we send regular to kremmlin you can hunt fer two months yet barrin an onusual early winter im askin youif my son tramps on your toesid take it as a favor fer you to be patient hes only a boy yet an coltish  wade divined that was a favor difficult for belllounds to ask the old rancher dominant and forceful and selfsufficient all his days had begun to feel an encroachment of opposition beyond his control if he but realized it the favor he asked of wade was an appeal  belllounds i get along with everybody wade assured him an maybe i can help your son before id reached here id heard he was wild an so im prepared  if youd do thetwal id never forgit it replied the rancher slowly jacks been away fer three years only got back a week or so ago i calkilated hed be sobered steadied bythetthet work i put him to but im not sure hes changed when he gits his own way hes all i could ask but thet way he wants aint always what it ought to be an so thars been clashes but jacks a fine young man an hell outgrow his temper an crazy notions workll do it  boys will be boys replied wade philosophically ive not forgotten when i was a boy  neither hev i wal ill be goin wade i reckon columbine will be up to call on you bein the only womanfolk in my house she sort of runs it an shes sure interested in thet pack of hounds  belllounds trudged away his fine old head erect his gray hair shining in the sun  wade sat down upon the step of his cabin pondering over the ranchers remarks about his son recalling the young mans physiognomy wade began to feel that it was familiar to him he had seen jack belllounds before wade never made mistakes in faces though he often had a task to recall names and he began to go over the recent past recalling all that he could remember of meeker and cripple creek where he had worked for several months and so on until he had gone back as far as his last trip to denver  must have been there mused wade thoughtfully and he tried to recall all the faces he had seen this was impossible of course yet he remembered many then he visualized the places in denver that for one reason or another had struck him particularly suddenly into one of these flashed the pale sullen bold face of jack belllounds  it was there he exclaimed incredulously well if thets not the strangest yet could i be mistaken no i saw him belllounds must have known itmust have let him stay there maybe put him there hes just the kind of a man to go to extremes to reform his son  singular as was this circumstance wade dwelt only momentarily on it he dismissed it with the conviction that it was another strange happening in the string of events that had turned his steps toward white slides ranch wades mind stirred to the probability of an early sight of columbine belllounds he would welcome it both as interesting and pleasurable and surely as a relief the sooner a meeting with her was over the better his life had been one long succession of shocks so that it seemed nothing the future held could thrill him amaze him torment him and yet how well he knew that his heart was only the more responsive for all it had withstood perhaps here at white slides he might meet with an experience dwarfing all others it was possible it was in the nature of events and though he repudiated such a possibility he fortified himself against a subtle divination that he might at last have reached the end of his long trail where anything might happen  three of the hounds lay down at wades feet kane the bloodhound stood watching this new master after the manner of a dog who was a judge of men he sniffed at wade he grew a little less surly  wades gaze however was on the path that led down along the border of the brook to disappear in the willows above this clump of yellowing trees could be seen the ranchhouse a girl with fair hair stepped off the porch she appeared to be carrying something in her arms and shortly disappeared behind the willows wade saw her and surmised that she was coming to his cabin he did not expect any more or think any more his faculties condensed to the objective one of sight  the girl when she reappeared was perhaps a hundred yards distant wade bent on her one keen clear glance then his brain and his blood beat wildly he saw a slender girl in ridingcostume lithe and strong with the free step of one used to the open it was this form this step that struck wade mygod how like lucy he whispered and he tried to pierce the distance to see her face it gleamed in the sunshine her fair hair waved in the wind she was coming but so slowly all of wade that was physical and emotional seemed to waitclamped the moment was agelong with nothing beyond it while she was still at a distance her face became distinct and wade sustained a terrible shock then as one in a dream as in a blur of strained peering into a maze he saw the face of his sweetheart his wife the lucy of his early manhood it moved him out of the past closer pang on pang quivered in his heart was this only a nightmare or had he at last gone mad this girl raised her head she was lookingshe saw him terror mounted upon wades consciousness  thats lucys face he gasped so helpme god its for thisi wandered here shes my flesh an bloodmy lucys childmy own  fear and presentiment and blank amaze and stricken consciousness left him in the lightningflash of divination that was recognition as well a shuddering cataclysm enveloped him a passion so stupendous that it almost brought oblivion  the three hounds leaped up with barks and wagging tails they welcomed this visitor kane lost still more of his canine aloofness  wades breast heaved the blue sky the gray hills the green willows all blurred in his sight that seemed to hold clear only the face floating closer  im columbine belllounds said a voice  it stilled the storm in wade it was real it was a voice of twenty years ago the burden on his breast lifted then flashed the spirit the old selfcontrol of a man whose life had held many terrible moments  mornin miss im glad to meet you he replied and there was no break no tone unnatural in his greeting  so they gazed at each other she with that instinctive look peculiar to women in its intuitive powers but common to all persons who had lived far from crowds and to whom a newcomer was an event wades gaze intense and allembracing found that face now closer in resemblance to the imagined lucysa pretty face rather than beautiful but strong and sweetits striking qualities being a colorless fairness of skin that yet held a rose and golden tint and the eyes of a rare and exquisite shade of blue  oh are you feeling ill she asked you look soso pale  no im only tuckered out replied wade easily as he wiped the clammy drops from his brow it was a long ride to get here  im the lady of the house she said with a smile im glad to welcome you to white slides and hope youll like it  well miss columbine i reckon i will he replied returning the smile now if i was younger id like it powerful much  she laughed at that men are all alike young or old  dont ever think so said wade earnestly  no i guess youre right about that ive fetched you up some things for your cabin may i peep in  come in replied wade rising you must excuse my manners its long indeed since i had a lady caller  she went in and wade standing on the threshold saw her survey the room with a womans sweeping glance  i told dad to put some  miss your dad told me to go get them an ive not done it yet but i will presently  very well ill leave these things and come back later she replied depositing a bundle upon the floor you wont mind if i try toto make you a little comfortable its dreadful the way outdoor men live when they do get indoors  i reckon ill be slow in lettin you see what a good housekeeper i am he replied because then maybe ill see more of you  werent you a sad flatterer in your day she queried archly  her intonation the tilt of her head gave wade such a pang that he could not answer and to hide his momentary restraint he turned back to the hounds then she came out upon the porch  i love hounds she said patting denver which caress immediately made jim and sampson jealous ive gotten on pretty well with these but that kane wont make up isnt he splendid but hes afraidno not afraid of me but he doesnt like me  its mistrust hes been hurt i reckon hell get over that after a while  you dont beat dogs she asked eagerly  no miss thats not the way to get on with hounds or horses  her glance was a blue flash of pleasure  how glad that makes me why i quit coming here to see and feed the dogs because somebody was always kicking them around  wade handed the rope to her you hold them so when i come out with some meat they wont pile over me he went inside took all that was left of the deer haunch out of his pack and picking up his knife returned to the porch the hounds saw the meat and yelped they pulled on the rope  you hounds behave ordered wade as he sat down on the step and began to cut the meat jim youre the oldest an hungriest here now you sampson here the big hound snapped at the meat whereupon wade slapped him are you a pup or a wolf that you grab for it here sampson was slower to act but he snapped again whereupon wade hit him again with open hand not with violence or rancor but a blow that meant sampson must obey  next time the hound did not snap denver had to be cuffed several times before he showed deference to this new master but the bloodhound kane refused to take any meat out of wades hand he growled and showed his teeth and sniffed hungrily  kane will have to be handled carefully observed wade hed bite pretty quick  but hes so splendid said the girl i dont like to think hes mean youll be good to himtry to win him  ill do my best with him  dads full of glee that he has a real hunter at white slides at last now im glad and sorry too i hate to think of little calves being torn and killed by lions and wolves and its dreadful to know bears eat grownup cattle but i love the mourn of a wolf and the yelp of a coyote i cant help hoping you dont kill them allquite  its not likely miss he replied ill be pretty sure to clean out the lions an drive off the bears but the wolf family cant be exterminated no animal so cunnin as a wolf ill tell you some years ago i went to cook on a ranch north of denver on the edge of the plains an right off i began to hear stories about a big loboa wolf that was an old residenter hed been known for long an he got meaner an wiser as he was hunted his specialty got to be yearlings an the ranchers all over rose up in arms against him they hired all the old hunters an trappers in the country to kill him no good old lobo went right on pullin down yearlings every night hed get one or more an he was so cute an so swift that hed work on different ranches on different nights finally he killed eleven yearlings for my boss on one night eleven think of that an then i said to my boss i reckon youd better let me go kill that gray butcher an my boss laughed at me but he let me go hed have tried anythin i took a hunk of meat a blanket my gun an a pair of snowshoes an i set out on old lobos tracks an miss columbine i walked old lobo to death in the snow  why how wonderful exclaimed the girl breathless and glowing with interest oh it seems a pity such a splendid brute should be killed wild animals are cruel i wish it were different  life is cruel miss an i echo your wish replied wade sadly  you have had great experiences dad said to me collie here at last is a man who can tell you enough stories but i dont believe you ever could  you like stories asked wade curiously  love them all kinds but i like adventure best i should have been a boy isnt it strange i cant hurt anything myself or bear to see even a steer slaughtered but you cant tell too bloody and terrible stories for me except i hate indian stories the very thought of indians makes me shudder some day ill tell you a story  wade could not find his tongue readily  i must go now she continued and moved off the porch then she hesitated and turned with a smile that was wistful and impulsive ii believe well be good friends  miss columbine we sure will if i can live up to my part replied wade  her smile deepened even while her gaze grew unconsciously penetrating wade felt how subtly they were drawn to each other but she had no inkling of that  it takes two to make a bargain she replied seriously ive my part goodby  wade watched her lithe stride and as she drew away the restraint he had put upon himself loosened when she disappeared his feeling burst all bounds dragging the dogs inside he closed the door then like one broken and spent he fell face against the wall with the hoarsely whispered words im thankin god    chapter vi  septembers glory of gold and red and purple began to fade with the autumnal equinox it rained enough to soak the frostbitten leaves and then the mountain winds sent them flying and fluttering and scurrying to carpet the dells and spot the pools in the brooks and color the trails when the weather cleared and the sun rose bright again many of the aspen thickets were leafless and bare and the willows showed stark against the gray sage hills and the vines had lost their fire hills and valleys had sobered with subtle change that left them none the less beautiful  a mile or more down the road from white slides in a protected nook nestled two cabins belonging to a cattleman named andrews who had formerly worked for belllounds and had recently gone into the stock business for himself he had a rather young wife and several children and a brother who rode for him these people were the only neighbors of belllounds for some ten miles on the road toward kremmling  columbine liked mrs andrews and often rode or walked down there for a little visit and a chat with her friend and a romp with the children  toward the end of september columbine found herself combating a strong desire to go down to the andrews ranch and try to learn some news about wilson moore if anything had been heard at white slides it certainly had not been told her jack belllounds had ridden to kremmling and back in one day but columbine would have endured much before asking him for information  she did however inquire of the freighter who hauled bellloundss supplies and the answer she got was awkwardly evasive that nettled columbine also it raised a suspicion which she strove to subdue finally it seemed apparent that wilson moores name was not to be mentioned to her  first in her growing resentment she had an impulse to go to her new friend the hunter wade and confide in him not only her longing to learn about wilson but also other matters that were growing daily more burdensome how strange for her to feel that in some way jack belllounds had come between her and the old man she loved and called father columbine had not divined that until lately she felt it now in the fact that she no longer sought the rancher as she used to and he had apparently avoided her but then columbine reflected she might be entirely wrong for when belllounds did meet her at mealtimes or anywhere he seemed just as affectionate as of old still he was not the same man a chill an atmosphere of shadow had pervaded the once wholesome ranch and so feeling not yet well enough acquainted with wade to confide so intimately in him she stifled her impulses and resolved to make some effort herself to find out what she wanted to know  as luck would have it when she started out to walk down to the andrews ranch she encountered jack belllounds  where are you going he inquired inquisitively  im going to see mrs andrews she replied  no youre not he declared quickly with a flash  columbine felt a queer sensation deep within her a hot little gathering that seemed foreign to her physical being and ready to burst out of late it had stirred in her at words or acts of jack belllounds she gazed steadily at him and he returned her look with interest what he was thinking she had no idea of but for herself it was a recurrence and an emphasis of the fact that she seemed growing farther away from this young man she had to marry the weeks since his arrival had been the most worrisome she could remember  i am going she replied slowly  no he replied violently i wont have you running off down there toto gossip with that andrews woman  oh you wont inquired columbine very quietly how little he understood her  thats what i said  youre not my boss yet mister jack belllounds she flashed her spirit rising he could irritate her as no one else  i soon will be and whats a matter of a week or a month he went on calming down a little  ive promised yes she said feeling her face blanch and i keep my promises but i didnt say when if you talk like that to me it might be a good many weeksoror months before i name the day  columbine he cried as she turned away there was genuine distress in his voice columbine felt again an assurance that had troubled her no matter how she was reacting to this new relation it seemed a fearful truth that jack was really falling in love with her this time she did not soften  ill call dad to make you stay home he burst out again his temper rising  columbine wheeled as on a pivot  if you do youve got less sense than i thought  illustration i know why youre going its to see that clubfooted cowboy moore dont let me catch you with him  passion claimed him then  i know why youre going its to see that clubfooted cowboy moore dont let me catch you with him  columbine turned her back upon belllounds and swung away every pulse in her throbbing and smarting she hurried on into the road she wanted to run not to get out of sight or hearing but to fly from something she knew not what  oh its more than his temper she cried hot tears in her eyes hes meanmeanmean whats the use of me denying thatany morejust because i love dad my life will be wretched it is wretched  her anger did not last long nor did her resentment she reproached herself for the tart replies that had inflamed jack never again would she forget herself  but hehe makes me furious she cried in sudden excuse for herself what did he say that clubfooted cowboy moore oh that was vile hes heard then that poor wilson has a bad foot perhaps permanently crippled if its true but why should he yell that he knew i wanted to see wilson i did not i do not oh but i do i do  and then columbine was to learn straightway that she would forget herself again that she had forgotten and that a sadder stranger truth was dawning upon hershe was discovering another columbine within herself a wilful passionate different creature who would no longer be denied  almost before columbine realized that she had started upon the visit she was within sight of the andrews ranch so swiftly had she walked it behooved her to hide such excitement as had dominated her and to that end she slowed her pace trying to put her mind on other matters  the children saw her first and rushed upon her so that when she reached the cabin door she could not well have been otherwise than rosy and smiling mrs andrews ruddy and strong looked the pioneer ranchers hardworking wife her face brightened at the advent of columbine and showed a little surprise and curiosity as well  laws but its good to see you columbine was her greeting you aint been here for a long spell  ive been coming but just put it off replied columbine  and so after the manner of women neighbors they began to talk of the fall roundup and the near approach of winter with its loneliness and the children all of which naturally led to more personal and interesting topics  an is it so columbine that youre to marry jack belllounds asked mrs andrews presently  yes i guess it is replied columbine smiling  humph im no relative of yours or even a particular close friend but id like to say  please dont interposed columbine  all right my girl i guess its better i dont say anythin its a pity though onless you love this buster jack an you never used to do that ill swan  no i dont love jackyetas i ought to love a husband but ill try and ifif ii never dostill its my duty to marry him  some woman ought to talk to bill belllounds declared mrs andrews with a grimness that boded ill for the old rancher  did you know we had a new man up at the ranch asked columbine changing the subject  you mean the hunter hellbent wade  yes but i hate that ridiculous name said columbine  its queer like lots of names men get in these parts an itll stick wades been here twice once as he was passin with the hounds an the other night i like him columbine hes trueblue for all his strange name my menfolks took to him like ducks to water  im glad i took to him almost like that rejoined columbine he has the saddest face i ever saw  sad wal yes that man has seen a good deal of what they tacked on to his name i laughed when i seen him first little lame fellar crookedlegged an ragged with thet awful homely face but i forgot how he looked next time he came  thats just it hes not much to look at but you forget his homeliness right off replied columbine warmly you feel something behind all hishis looks  wal you an me are women an we feel different replied mrs andrews now my menfolks take much store on what wade can do he fixed up toms gun thats been out of whack for a year he made our clock run agin an run better than ever then he saved our cow from that poisonweed an tom gave her up to die  the boys up home were telling me mr wade had saved some of our cattle dad was delighted you know hes lost a good many head of stock from this poisonweed i saw so many dead steers on my last ride up the mountain its too bad our new man didnt get here sooner to save them i asked him how he did it and he said he was a doctor  a cowdoctor laughed mrs andrews wal thats a new one on me accordin to tom this here wade when he seen our sick cow said shed eat poisonweedlarkspur i think he called itan then when she drank water it formed a gas in her stomach an she swelled up turrible wade jest stuck his knife in her side a little an let the gas out and she got well  ughh what cruel doctoring but if it saves the cattle then its good  itll save them if they can be got to right off replied mrs andrews  speaking of doctors went on columbine striving to make her query casual do you know whether or not wilson moore had his foot treated by a doctor at kremmling  he did not answered mrs andrews wasnt no doctor there theyd had to send to denver an as wils couldnt take that trip or wait so long why mrs plummer fixed up his foot she made a good job of it too as i can testify  oh imvery thankful murmured columbine hell not be crippled oror clubfooted then  i reckon not you can see for yourself for wilss here he was drove up night before last an is stayin with my brotherinlawin the other cabin there  mrs andrews launched all this swiftly with evident pleasure but with more of womans subtle motive her eyes were bent with shrewd kindness upon the younger woman  here exclaimed columbine with a start and for an instant she was at the mercy of conflicting surprise and joy and alarm alternately she flushed and paled  sure hes here replied mrs andrews now looking out of the door he ought to be in sight somewheres hes walkin with a crutch  crutch cried columbine in dismay  yes crutch an he made it himself i dont see him nowheres mebbe he went in when he see you comin for hes powerful sensitive about that crutch  thenif hes soso sensitive perhaps id better go said columbine struggling with embarrassment and discomfiture what if she happened to meet him would he imagine her purpose in coming there her heart began to beat unwontedly  suit yourself lass replied mrs andrews kindly i know you and wils quarreled for he told me an its a pity wal if you must go i hope youll come again before the snow flies goodby  columbine bade her a hurried goodby and ventured forth with misgivings and almost around the corner of the second cabin which she had to pass and before she had time to recover her composure she saw wilson moore hobbling along on a crutch holding a bandaged foot off the ground he had seen her he was hurrying to avoid a meeting or to get behind the corrals there before she observed him  wilson she called involuntarily the instant the name left her lips she regretted it but too late the cowboy halted slowly turned  then columbine walked swiftly up to him suddenly as brave as she had been fearful sight of him had changed her  wilson moore you meant to avoid me she said with reproach  howdy columbine he drawled ignoring her words  oh i was so sorry you were hurt she burst out and now im so gladyoureyoure  wilson youre thin and paleyouve suffered  it pulled me down a bit he replied  columbine had never before seen his face anything except bronzed and lean and healthy but now it bore testimony to pain and strain and patient endurance he looked older something in the fine dark hazel eyes hurt her deeply  you never sent me word she went on reproachfully no one would tell me anything the boys said they didnt know dad was angry when i asked him id never have asked jack and the freighter who drove uphe lied to me so i came down here today purposely to ask news of you but i never dreamed you were here now im glad i came  what a singular darkly kind yet strange glance he gave her  that was like you columbine he said i knew youd feel badly about my accident but how could i send word to you  you savedpronto she returned with a strong tremor in her voice i cant thank you enough  that was a funny thing pronto went out of his head i hope hes all right  hes almost well it took some time to pick all the splinters out of him hell be all right soonnone the worse for thatthat cowboy trick of mister jack belllounds  columbine finished bitterly moore turned his thoughtful gaze away from her  i hope old bill is well he remarked lamely  have you told your folks of your accident asked columbine ignoring his remark  no  oh wilson you ought to have sent for them or have written at least  me to go crying for them when i got in trouble i couldnt see it that way  wilson youll be goinghomesoonto denverwont you she faltered  no he replied shortly  but what will you do surely you cant worknot so soon  columbine ill neverbe able to ride againlike i used to he said tragically ill ride yes but never the old way  oh columbines tone and the exquisite softness and tenderness with which she placed a hand on the rude crutch would have been enlightening to any one but these two absorbed in themselves i cant bear to believe that  im afraid its true bad smash columbine i just missed being clubfooted  you should have care you should have wilson do you intend to stay here with the andrews  not much they have troubles of their own columbine im going to homestead one hundred and sixty acres  homestead she exclaimed in amaze where  up there under old white slides ive long intended to you know that pretty little valley under the red bluff theres a fine spring youve been there with me there by the old cabin built by prospectors  yes i know its a pretty placefine valley but wils you cant live there she expostulated  why not id like to know  that little cubbyhole its only a tiny oneroom cabin roof all gone chinks open chimney crumbling wilson you dont mean to tell me you want to live there alone  sure whatd you think he replied with sarcasm  expect me to marry some girl well i wouldnt even if any one would have a cripple  whowho will take care of you she asked blushing furiously  ill take care of myself he declared good lord columbine im not an invalid yet ive got a few friends wholl help me fix up the cabin and that reminds me theres a lot of my stuff up in the bunkhouse at white slides im going to drive up soon to haul it away  wilson moore do you mean it she asked with grave wonder are you going to homestead near white slides ranchand live therewhen  she could not finish an overwhelming disaster for which she had no name seemed to be impending  yes i am he replied funny how things turn out isnt it  its veryvery funny she said dazedly and she turned slowly away without another word  goodby columbine he called out after her with farewell indeed in his voice  all the way home columbine was occupied with feelings that swayed her to the exclusion of rational consideration of the increasing perplexity of her situation and to make matters worse when she arrived at the ranch it was to meet jack belllounds with a face as black as a thundercloud  the old man wants to see you he announced with an accent that recalled his threat of a few hours back  does he queried columbine loftily from the courteous way you speak i imagine its important  belllounds did not deign to reply to this he sat on the porch where evidently he had awaited her return and he looked anything but happy  where is dad continued columbine  jack motioned toward the second door beyond which he sat the one that opened into the room the rancher used as a kind of office and storeroom as columbine walked by jack he grasped her skirt  columbine youre angry he said appealingly  i reckon i am replied columbine  dont go in to dad when youre that way implored jack hes angry tooandanditll only make matters worse  from long experience columbine could divine when jack had done something in the interest of self and then had awakened to possible consequences she pulled away from him without replying and knocked on the office door  come in called the rancher  columbine went in hello dad do you want me  belllounds sat at an old table bending over a soiled ledger with a stubby pencil in his huge hand when he looked up columbine gave a little start  whereve you been he asked gruffly  ive been calling on mrs andrews replied columbine  did you go thar to see her  whycertainly answered columbine with a slow break in her speech  you didnt go to meet wilson moore  no  an i reckon youll say you hadnt heerd he was there  i had not flashed columbine  wal did you see him  yes sir i did but quite by accident  ahuh columbine are you lyin to me  the hot blood flooded to columbines cheeks as if she had been struck a blow  dad she cried in hurt amaze  belllounds seemed thick imponderable as if something had forced a crisis in him and his brain was deeply involved the habitual cool easy bold and frank attitude in the meeting of all situations seemed to have been encroached upon by a break a bewilderment a lessening of confidence  wal are you lyin he repeated either blind to or unaware of her distress  i could notlie to you she faltered evenifi wanted to  the heavy shadowed gaze of his big eyes was bent upon her as if she had become a new and perplexing problem  but you seen moore  yessir columbines spirit rose  an talked with him  of course  lass i aint likin thet an i aint likin the way you look an speak  i am sorry i cant help either  whatd this cowboy say to you  we talked mostly about his injured foot  an what else went on belllounds his voice rising  aboutwhat he meant to do now  ahuh an thets homesteadin the sage creek valley  yes sir  did you want him to do thet  i indeed i didnt  columbine not so long ago you told me this fellar wasnt sweet on you an do you still say that to meare you still insistin he aint in love with you  he never said soi never believed it  and now im surehe isnt  ahuh wal thet same day you was jest as sure you didnt care anythin particular fer him are you thet sure now  no whispered columbine very low she trembled with a suggestion of unknown forces not to save a new and growing pride would she evade any question from this man upon whom she had no claim to whom she owed her life and her bringing up but something cold formed in her  belllounds selfcentered and serious as he strangely was seemed to check his probing either from fear of hearing more from her or from an awakening of former kindness but her reply was a shock to him and throwing down his pencil with the gesture of a man upon whom decision was forced he rose to tower over her  youve been like a daughter to me ive done all i knowed how fer you ive lived up to the best of my lights an ive loved you he said sonorously and pathetically you know what my hopes arefer the boyan fer you we neednt waste any more talk from this minnit youre free to do as you like whatever you do wont make any change in my carin fer you but you gotta decide will you marry jack or not  i promised youi would ill keep my word replied columbine steadily  so far so good went on the rancher im respectin you fer what you say an now when will you marry him  the little room drifted around in columbines vague blank sight all seemed to be drifting she had no solid anchor  anyday you saythe sooner thebetter she whispered  wal lass im thankin you he replied with voice that sounded afar to her an i swear if i didnt believe its best fer jack an you why id never let you marry so well set the day october first thets the day you was fetched to me a babymoren seventeen years ago  octoberfirstthen dad she said brokenly and she kissed him as if in token of what she knew she owed him then she went out closing the door behind her  jack upon seeing her hastily got up with more than concern in his pale face  columbine he cried hoarsely how you look tell me what happened girl dont tell me youveyouve  jack belllounds interrupted columbine in tragic amaze at this truth about to issue from her lips ive promised to marry youon october first  he let out a shout of boyish exultation and suddenly clasped her in his arms but there was nothing boyish in the way he handled her in the almost savage evidence of possession collie im mad about you he began ardently you never let me tell you and ive grown worse and worse today iwhen i saw you going down therewhere that wilson moore isi got terribly jealous i was sick id been glad to kill him it made me see how i loved you oh i didnt know but now  oh im mad for you he crushed her to him unmindful of her struggles his face and neck were red his eyes on fire and he began trying to kiss her mouth but failed as she struggled desperately his kisses fell upon cheek and ear and hair  let mego panted columbine youve nonooh you might have waited breaking from him she fled and got inside her room with the door almost closed when his foot intercepted it  belllounds was half laughing his exultation half furious at her escape and altogether beside himself  no she replied so violently that it appeared to awake him to the fact that there was some one besides himself to consider  aw he heaved a deep sigh all right i wont try to get in only listen collie dont mind mymy way of showing you how i felt fact is i went plumb off my head is that any wonder youyou darlingwhen ive been so scared youd never have me collie ive felt that you were the one thing in the world i wanted most and would never get but now october first listen i promise you ill not drink any morenor gamblenor nag dad for money i dont like his way of running the ranch but ill do it as long as he lives ill even try to tolerate that clubfooted cowboys brass in homesteading a ranch right under my nose illill do anything you ask of me  thenpleasego away cried columbine with a sob  when he was gone columbine barred the door and threw herself upon her bed to shut out the light and to give vent to her surcharged emotions she wept like a girl whose youth was ending and after the paroxysm had passed leaving her weak and strangely changed she tried to reason out what had happened to her over and over again she named the appeal of the rancher the sense of her duty the decision she had reached and the disgust and terror inspired in her by jack bellloundss reception of her promise these were facts of the day and they had made of her a palpitating unhappy creature who nevertheless had been brave to face the rancher and confess that which she had scarce confessed to herself but now she trembled and cringed on the verge of a catastrophe that withheld its whole truth  i begin to see now she whispered after the thought had come and gone and returned to change again if wilson hadcared for me ii might havecared too but i docaresomething i couldnt lie to dad only im not surehow much i never dreamed ofof loving him or any one its so strange all at once i feel old and i cant understand thesethese feelings that shake me  so columbine brooded over the trouble that had come to her never regretting her promise to the old rancher but growing keener in the realization of a complexity in her nature that sooner or later would separate the life of her duty from the life of her desire she seemed all alone and when this feeling possessed her a strange reminder of the hunter wade flashed up she stifled another impulse to confide in him wade had the softness of a woman and his face was a record of the trials and travails through which he had come unhardened unembittered yet how could she tell her troubles to him a stranger a rough man of the wilds whose name had preceded him notorious and deadly with that vital tang of the west in its meaning nevertheless wade drew her and she thought of him until the recurring memory of jack bellloundss rude clasp again crept over her with an augmenting disgust and fear must she submit to that had she promised that and then columbine felt the dawning of realities    chapter vii  columbine was awakened in the gray dawn by the barking of coyotes she dreaded the daylight thus heralded never before in her life had she hated the rising of the sun resolutely she put the past behind her and faced the future believing now that with the great decision made she needed only to keep her mind off what might have been and to attend to her duty  at breakfast she found the rancher in better spirits than he had been for weeks he informed her that jack had ridden off early for kremmling there to make arrangements for the wedding on october first  jacks out of his head said belllounds wal thet comes only onct in a mans life i remember  jacks goin to drive you to kremmlin an ther take stage fer denver i allow youd better put in your best licks on fixin up an packin the clothes youll need womenfolk naturally want to look smart on weddintrips  dad exclaimed columbine in dismay i never thought of clothes and i dont want to leave white slides  but lass youre goin to be married expostulated belllounds  didnt it occur to jack to take me to kremmling i cant make new dresses out of old ones  wal i reckon neither of us thought of thet but you can buy what you like in denver  columbine resigned herself after all what did it matter to her the vague haunting dreams of girlhood would never come true so she went to her wardrobe and laid out all her wearing apparel taking stock of it this way caused her further dismay for she had nothing fit to wear in which either to be married or to take a trip to denver there appeared to be nothing to do but take the ranchers advice and columbine set about refurbishing her meager wardrobe she sewed all day  what with selfcontrol and work and the passing of hours columbine began to make some approach to tranquillity in her simplicity she even began to hope that being good and steadfast and dutiful would earn her a little meed of happiness some haunting doubt of this flashed over her mind like a swift shadow of a black wing but she dispelled that as she had dispelled the fear and disgust which often rose up in her mind  to columbines surprise and to the ranchers concern the prospective bridegroom did not return from kremmling on the second day when night came belllounds reluctantly gave up looking for him  jacks nonappearance suited columbine and she would have been glad to be let alone until october first which date now seemed appallingly close on the afternoon of jacks third day of absence from the ranch columbine rode out for some needed exercise pronto not being available she rode another mustang and one that kept her busy on the way back to the ranch she avoided the customary trail which led by the cabins of wade and the cowboys columbine had not seen one of her friends since the unfortunate visit to the andrews ranch she particularly shrank from meeting wade which feeling was in strange contrast to her former impulses  as she rode around the house she encountered wilson moore seated in a light wagon her mustang reared almost unseating her but she handled him roughly being suddenly surprised and angry at this unexpected meeting with the cowboy  howdy columbine greeted wilson as she brought the mustang to his feet youre sure learning to handle a horsesince i left this here ranch wonder whos teaching you i never could get you to rake even a bronc  the cowboy had drawled out his admiring speech half amused and half satiric  immad declared columbine thats why  whatre you mad at queried wilson  she did not reply but kept on gazing steadily at him moore still looked pale and drawn but he had improved since last she saw him  arent you going to speak to a fellow he went on  how are you wils she asked  pretty good for a clubfooted hasbeen cow puncher  i wish you wouldnt call yourself such names rejoined columbine peevishly youre not a clubfoot i hate that word  me too well joking aside im better my foot is fine now if i dont hurt it again ill sure never be a clubfoot  you must be careful she said earnestly  sure but its hard for me to be idle think of me lying still all day with nothing to do but read thats what knocked me out i wouldnt have minded the pain if i could have gotten about columbine ive moved in  what moved in she queried blankly  sure im in my cabin on the hill its plumb great tom andrews and bert and your hunter wade fixed up the cabin for me that wade is sure a good fellow and say what he can do with his hands hes been kind to me took an interest in me and between you and me he sort of cheered me up  cheered you up wils were you unhappy she asked directly  well rather whatd you expect of a cowboy whod crippled himselfand lost his girl  columbine felt the smart of tingling blood in her face and she looked from wilson to the wagon it contained saddles blankets and other cowboy accoutrements for which he had evidently come  thats a double misfortune she replied evenly its too bad both came at once it seems to me if i were a cowboy andand felt so toward a girl id have let her know  this girl i mean knew all right he said nodding his head  she didntshe didnt cried columbine  how do you know he queried with feigned surprise he was bent upon torturing her  you meant me im the girl you lost  yes you aregod help me replied moore with genuine emotion  but youyou never told meyou never told me faltered columbine in distress  never told you what that you were my girl  nono but that youyou cared  columbine belllounds i told youlet you seein every way under the sun he flashed at her  let me seewhat faltered columbine feeling as if the world were about to end  that i loved you  oh wilson whispered columbine wildly  yesloved you could you have been so innocentso blind you never knew i cant believe it  but i never dreamed youyou she broke off dazedly overwhelmed by a tragic glorious truth  collie would it have made any difference  oh all the difference in the world she wailed  what difference he asked passionately  columbine gazed wideeyed and helpless at the young man she did not know how to tell him what all the difference in the world really was  suddenly wilson turned away from her to listen then she heard rapid beating of hoofs on the road  thats buster jack said the cowboy just my luck there wasnt any one here when i arrived reckon i oughtnt have stayed columbine you look pretty much upset  what do i care how i look she exclaimed with a sharp resentment attending this abrupt and painful break in her agitation  next moment jack belllounds galloped a foamlashed horse into the courtyard and hauled up short with a recklessness he was noted for he swung down hard and violently cast the reins from him  ahuh i gambled on just this he declared harshly  columbines heart sank his gaze was fixed on her face with its telltale evidences of agitation  whatve you been crying about he demanded  i havent been she retorted  his bold and glaring eyes hot with sudden temper passed slowly from her to the cowboy columbine became aware then that jack was under the influence of liquor his heated red face grew darker with a sneering contempt  wheres dad he asked wheeling toward her  i dont know hes not here replied columbine dismounting the leap of thought and blood to jacks face gave her a further sinking of the heart the situation unnerved her  wilson moore had grown a shade paler he gathered up his reins ready to drive off  belllounds i came up after my things id left in the bunk he said coolly happened to meet columbine and stopped to chat a minute  thats what you say sneered belllounds you were making love to columbine i saw that in her face you know itand she knows itand i know it youre a liar  belllounds i reckon i am replied moore turning white i did tell columbine what i thought she knewwhat i ought to have told long ago  ahuh well i dont want to hear it but im going to search that wagon  what ejaculated the cowboy dropping his reins as if they stung him  you just hold on till i see what youve got in there went on belllounds and he reached over into the wagon and pulled at a saddle  say do you mean anything this stuffs mine every strap of it take your hands off  belllounds leaned on the wagon and looked up with insolent dark intent  moore i wouldnt trust you i think youd steal anything you got your hands on  columbine uttered a passionate little cry of shame and protest  jack how dare you  you shut up go in the house he ordered  you insult me she replied in bitter humiliation  will you go in he shouted  no i wont  all right look on then id just as lief have you then he turned to the cowboy moore show up that wagonload of stuff unless you want me to throw it out in the road  belllounds you know i cant do that replied moore coldly and ill give you a hunch youd better shut up yourself and let me drive on if not for her sake then for your own  belllounds grasped the reins and with a sudden jerk pulled them out of the cowboys hands  you damn clubfoot your gift of gab doesnt go with me yelled belllounds as he swung up on the hub of the wheel but it was manifest that his desire to search the wagon was only a pretense for while he pulled at this and that his evil gaze was on the cowboy keen to meet any move that might give excuse for violence moore evidently read this for gazing at columbine he shook his head as if to acquaint her with a situation impossible to help  columbine please hand me up the reins he said im lame you know then ill be going  columbine stepped forward to comply when belllounds leaping down from the wheel pushed her hack with masterful hand opposition to him was like waving a red flag in the face of a bull columbine recoiled from his look as well as touch  you keep out of this or ill teach you whos boss here he said stridently  youre going too far burst out columbine  meanwhile wilson had laboriously climbed down out of the wagon and utilizing his crutch he hobbled to where belllounds had thrown the reins and stooped to pick them up belllounds shoved columbine farther back and then he leaped to confront the cowboy  ive got you now moore he said hoarse and low stripped of all pretense he showed the ungovernable nature of his temper his face grew corded and black the hand he thrust out shook like a leaf you smoothtongued liar im on to your game i know youd put her against me i know youd try to win herless than a week before her weddingday but its not for that im going to beat hell out of you its because i hate you ever since i can remember my father held you up to me and he sent me totohe sent me away because of you by god thats why i hate you  all that was primitive and violent and base came out with strange frankness in bellloundss tirade only when calm could his mind be capable of hidden calculation the devil that was in him now seemed rampant  belllounds youre mighty brave to stack up this way against a onelegged man declared the cowboy with biting sarcasm  if you had two clubfeet id only be the gladder yelled belllounds and swinging his arm he slapped moore so that it nearly toppled him over only the injured foot coming down hard saved him  when columbine saw that and then how wilson winced and grew deathly pale she uttered a low cry and she seemed suddenly rooted to the spot weak terrified at what was now inevitable and growing sick and cold and faint  its a damn lucky thing for you im not packing a gun said moore grimly but you knewor youd never hit meyou coward  ill make you swallow that snarled belllounds and this time he swung his fist aiming a heavy blow at moore  then the cowboy whirled aloft the heavy crutch if you hit at me again ill let out what little brains youve got god knows thats little enough belllounds im going to call you to your facebefore this girl your bateyed old man means to give you youre not drunk youre only uglymean youve got a chance now to lick me because im crippled and youre going to make the most of it why you cur i could come near licking you with only one leg but if you touch me again ill brain you you never were any good youre no good now you never will be anything but buster jackhalf dotty selfish as hell bullheaded and mean and thats the last word ill ever waste on you  ill kill you bawled belllounds black with fury  moore wielded the crutch menacingly but as he was not steady on his feet he was at the disadvantage his adversary had calculated upon belllounds ran around the cowboy and suddenly plunged in to grapple with him the crutch descended but to little purpose bellloundss heavy onslaught threw moore to the ground before he could rise belllounds pounced upon him  columbine saw all this dazedly as wilson fell she closed her eyes fighting a faintness that almost overcame her she heard wrestling threshing sounds and sodden thumps and a scattering of gravel these noises seemed at first distant then grew closer as she gazed again with keener perception moores horse plunged away from the fiercely struggling forms that had rolled almost under his feet during the ensuing moments it was an equal battle so far as columbine could tell repelled yet fascinated she watched they beat each other grappled and rolled over first one on top then the other but the advantage of being uppermost presently was bellloundss moore was weakening that became noticeable more and more after each time he had wrestled and rolled about then belllounds getting this position lay with his weight upon moore holding him down and at the same time kicking with all his might he was aiming to disable the cowboy by kicking the injured foot and he was succeeding moore let out a strangled cry and struggled desperately but he was held and weighted down belllounds raised up now and looking backward he deliberately and furiously kicked moores bandaged foot once twice again and again until the straining form under him grew limp columbine slowly freezing with horror saw all this she could not move she could not scream she wanted to rush in and drag jack off of wilson to hurt him to kill him but her muscles were paralyzed in her agony she could not even look away belllounds got up astride his prostrate adversary and began to beat him brutally swinging heavy sodden blows his face then was terrible to see he meant murder  columbine heard approaching voices and the thumping of hasty feet that unclamped her cloven tongue wildly she screamed old bill belllounds appeared striding off the porch and the hunter wade came running down the path  dad hes killing wilson cried columbine  hyar you devil roared the rancher  jack belllounds got up panting disheveled with hair ruffled and face distorted he was not a pleasant sight for even the father moore lay unconscious with ghastly bloody features and his bandaged foot showed great splotches of red  my gawd son gasped old bill you didnt pick on this hyar crippled boy  the evidence was plain in moores quiet pathetic form in the panting purplefaced son jack belllounds did not answer he was in the grip of a passion that had at last been wholly unleashed and was still unsatisfied yet a malignant and exultant gratification showed in his face  thatevens usup moore he panted and stalked away  by this time wade reached the cowboy and knelt beside him columbine came running to fall on her knees the old rancher seemed stricken  ohoh it was terrible cried columbine ohhes so whiteand the blood  now lass thats no way for a woman said wade and there was something in his kind tone in his look in his presence that calmed columbine ill look after moore you go get some water an a towel  columbine rose to totter into the house she saw a red stain on the hand she had laid upon the cowboys face and with a strange hot bursting sensation strong and thrilling she put that red place to her lips running out with the things required by wade she was in time to hear the rancher say looks hurt bad to me  yes i reckon replied wade  while columbine held moores head upon her lap the hunter bathed the bloody face it was battered and bruised and cut and in some places as fast as wade washed away the red it welled out again  columbine watched that quiet face while her heart throbbed and swelled with emotions wholly beyond her control and understanding when at last wilson opened his eyes fluttering at first and then wide she felt a surge that shook her whole body he smiled wanly at her and at wade and then his gaze lifted to belllounds  i guesshe licked me he said in weak voice he kept kicking my sore foottill i fainted but he licked meall right  wils mebbe he did lick you replied the old rancher brokenly but i reckon hes damn little to be proud oflickin a crippled manthet way  boss jackd been drinking said moore weakly and he sure hadsome excuse for going off his head he caught metalking sweet to columbine  and theni called him all the namesi could lay my tongue to  ahuh the old man seemed at a loss for words and presently he turned away sagging in the shoulders and plodded into the house  the cowboy supported by wade on one side with columbine on the other was helped to an upright position and with considerable difficulty was gotten into the wagon he tried to sit up but made a sorry showing of it  ill drive him home an look after him said wade now miss collie youre upset which aint no wonder but now you brace it might have been worse just you go to your room till youre sure of yourself again  moore smiled another wan smile at her im sorry he said  what for me she asked  i mean im sorry i was so infernal unluckyrunning into youand bringing all this distressto you it was my fault if id only keptmy mouth shut  you need not be sorry you met me she said with her eyes straight upon his im glad but oh if your foot is badly hurt ill nevernever  dont say it interrupted wilson  lass youre bent on doin somethin said wade in his gentle voice  bent she echoed with something deep and rich in her voice yes im bentbent like your nameto speak my mind  then she ran toward the house and up on the porch to enter the livingroom with heaving breast and flashing eyes manifestly the rancher was berating his son the former gaped at sight of her and the latter shrank  jack belllounds she cried youre not half a man youre a coward and a brute  one tense moment she stood there lightning scorn and passion in her gaze and then she rushed out impetuously as she had come    chapter viii  columbine did not leave her room any more that day what she suffered there she did not want any one to know what it cost her to conquer herself again she had only a faint conception of she did conquer however and that night made up the sleep she had lost the night before  strangely enough she did not feel afraid to face the rancher and his son recent happenings had not only changed her but had seemed to give her strength when she presented herself at the breakfasttable jack was absent the old rancher greeted her with more thar usual solicitude  jacks sick he remarked presently  indeed replied columbine  yes he said it was the drinkin hes not accustomed to wal i reckon it was what you called him he didnt take much store on what i called him which was wuss i tell you lass jacks set his heart so hard on you thet its turrible  queer way he has of showing thethe affections of his heart replied columbine shortly  thet was the drink remonstrated the old man pathetic and earnest in his motive to smooth over the quarrel  but he promised me he would not drink any more  belllounds shook his gray old head sadly  ahuh jack fires up an promises anythin he means it at the time but the next hankerin thet comes over him wipes out the promise i know but hes had good excuse fer this break the boys in town began celebratin fer october first great wonder jack didnt come home clean drunk  dad youre as good as gold said columbine softening how could she feel hard toward him  collie then youre not agoin back on the ole man  no  i was afeared youd change your mind about marryin jack  when i promised i meant it i didnt make it on conditions  but lass promises can be broke he said with the sonorous roll in his voice  i never yet broke one of mine  wal i hev not often mebbe but i hev an lass its reasonable thars times when a man jest cant live up to what he swore by an fer a girlwhy i can see how easy shed change an grow overnight its only fair fer me to say that no matter what you think you owe me you couldnt be blamed now fer dislikin jack  dad if by marrying jack i can help him to be a better son to you and more of a man ill be glad she replied  lass im beginnin to see how big an fine you are replied belllounds with strong feeling an its worryin me my neighbors hev always accused me of seein only my son only buster jack i was blind an deaf as to him wal im not so damn blind as i used to be the scales are droppin off my ole eyes but ive got one hope left as far as jacks concerned thets marryin him to you an im stickin to it  so will i stick to it dad she replied ill go through with october first  columbine broke off vouchsafing no more and soon left the breakfasttable to take up the work she had laid out to do and she accomplished it though many times her hands dropped idle and her eyes peered out of her window at the drab slides of the old mountain  later when she went out to ride she saw the cowboy lem working in the blacksmith shop  wal miss collie air youall still hangin round this hyar ranch he asked with welcoming smile  lem im almost ashamed now to face my good friends ive neglected them so long she replied  aw now whatre friends fer but to go to youre lookin pale i reckon more like thet thar flower i see so much on the hills  lem i want to ride pronto do you think hes all right now  i reckon some movin round will do pronto good hes eatin his haid off  the cowboy went with her to the pasture gate and whistled pronto up the mustang came trotting evidently none the worse for his injuries and eager to resume the old climbs with his mistress lem saddled him paying particular attention to the cinch  reckon wed better not cinch him tight said lem you jest be careful an remember your saddles loose  all right lem replied columbine as she mounted where are the boys this morning  blud an jim air repairin fence up the crick  and wheres ben  ben oh you mean wade wal i aint seen him since yestidday he was skinnin a lion then over hyar on the ridge thet was in the mawnin i reckon hes around fer i seen some of the hounds  then lemyou havent heard about the fight yesterday between jack and wilson moore  lem straightened up quickly nope i aint heerd a word  well they fought all right said columbine hurriedly i saw it i was the only one there wilson was badly used up before dad and ben got there ben drove off with him  but miss collie howd it come off i seen wils the other day was up to his homestead an the boy jest manages to rustle round on a crutch he couldnt fight  that was just it jack saw his opportunity and he forced wilson to fightaccused him of stealing wils tried to avoid trouble then jack jumped him wilson fought and held his own until jack began to kick his injured foot then wilson fainted andand jack beat him  lem dropped his head evidently to hide his expression wal doggone me he ejaculated thets too bad  columbine left the cowboy and rode up the lane toward wades cabin she did not analyze her deliberate desire to tell the truth about that fight but she would have liked to proclaim it to the whole range and to the world once clear of the house she felt free unburdened and to talk seemed to relieve some congestion of her thoughts  the hounds heralded columbines approach with a deep and booming chorus sampson and jim lay upon the porch unleashed the other hounds were chained separately in the aspen grove a few rods distant sampson thumped the boards with his big tail but he did not get up which laziness attested to the fact that there had been a lion chase the day before and he was weary and stiff if wade had been at home he would have come out to see what had occasioned the clamor as columbine rode by she saw another fresh lionpelt pegged upon the wall of the cabin  she followed the brook it had cleared since the rains and was shining and sparkling in the rough swift places and limpid and green in the eddies she passed the dam made by the solitary beaver that inhabited the valley freshly cut willows showed how the beaver was preparing for the long winter ahead columbine remembered then how greatly pleased wade had been to learn about this old beaver and more than once wade had talked about trapping some younger beavers and bringing them there to make company for the old fellow  the trail led across the brook at a wide shallow place where the splashing made by pronto sent the trout scurrying for deeper water columbine kept to that trail knowing that it led up into sage valley where wilson moore had taken up the homestead property fresh horse tracks told her that wade had ridden along there some time earlier pronto shied at the whirring of sagehens presently columbine ascertained they were flushed by the hound kane that had broken loose and followed her he had done so before and the fact had not displeased her  kane kane come here she called he came readily but halted a rod or so away and made an attempt at wagging his tail a function evidently somewhat difficult for him when she resumed trotting he followed her  old white slides had lost all but the drabs and dull yellows and greens and of course those pale light slopes that had given the mountain its name sage valley was only one of the valleys at its base it opened out half a mile wide dominated by the looming peak and bordered on the far side by an aspenthicketed slope the brook babbled along under the edge of this thicket cattle and horses grazed here and there on the rich grassy levels columbine was surprised to see so many cattle and wondered to whom they belonged all of bellloundss stock had been driven lower down for the winter there among the several horses that whistled at her approach she espied the white mustang belllounds had given to moore it thrilled her to see him and next she suffered a pang to think that perhaps his owner might never ride him again but columbine held her emotions in abeyance  the cabin stood high upon a level terrace with clusters of aspens behind it and was sheltered from winter blasts by a gray cliff picturesque and crumbling with its face overgrown by creeping vines and colorful shrubs wilson moore could not have chosen a more secluded and beautiful valley for his homesteading adventure the little gray cabin with smoke curling from the stone chimney had lost its look of dilapidation and disuse yet there was nothing new that columbine could see the last quarter of the ascent of the slope and the few rods across the level terrace seemed extraordinarily long to columbine as she dismounted and tied pronto her heart was beating and her breath was coming fast  the door of the cabin was open kane trotted past the hesitating columbine and went in  you sonofahounddog came to columbines listening ears in wades wellknown voice ill have to beat yousure as youre born  i heard a horse came in a lower voice that was wilsons  darn me if im not gettin deafer every day was the reply  then wade appeared in the doorway  its nobody but miss collie he announced as he made way for her to enter  good morning said columbine in a voice that had more than cheerfulness in it  collie did you come to see me  she heard this incredulous query just an instant before she saw wilson at the far end of the room lying under the light of a window the inside of the cabin seemed vague and unfamiliar  i surely did she replied advancing how are you  oh im all right tickled to death right now only i hate to have you see this battered mug of mine  you needntcare said columbine unsteadily and indeed in that first glance she did not see him clearly a mist blurred her sight and there was a lump in her throat then to recover herself she looked around the cabin  wellwils mooreif this isnt fine she ejaculated in amaze and delight columbine sustained an absolute surprise a magic hand had transformed the interior of that rude old prospectors abode a carpenter and a mason and a decorator had been wonderfully at work from one end to the other columbine gazed from the big window under which wilson lay on a blanketed couch to the open fireplace where wade grinned she looked and looked and then up to the clean aspenpoled roof and down to the floor carpeted with deer hides the chinks between the logs of the walls were plastered with red clay the dust and dirt were gone the place smelled like sage and woodsmoke and fragrant frying meat indeed there were a glowing bed of embers and a steaming kettle and a smoking pot and the way the smoke and steam curled up into the gray old chimney attested to its splendid draught in each corner hung a deerhead from the antlers of which depended accoutrements of a cowboyspurs ropes belts scarfs guns one corner contained cupboard ceiling high with new clean doors of wood neatly made and next to it stood a table just as new on the blank wall beyond that were pegs holding saddles bridles blankets clothes  he did itall this inside burst out moore delighted with her delight quicker than a flash collie isnt this great i dont mind being down on my back and he says they call him hellbent wade i call him heavensent wade  when columbine turned to the hunter bursting with her pleasure and gratitude he suddenly dropped the forked stick he used as a lift and she saw his hand shake when he stooped to recover it how strangely that struck her  ben its perfectly possible that youve been sent by heaven she remarked with a humor which still held gravity in it  me a good angel thatd be a new job for bent wade he replied with a queer laugh but i reckon id try to live up to it  there were small sprigs of golden aspen leaves and crimson oak leaves on the wall above the foot of wilsons bed beneath them on pegs hung a rifle and on the windowsill stood a glass jar containing columbines they were fresh they had just been picked they waved gently in the breeze sweetly white and blue strangely significant to the girl  moore laughed defiantly  wade thought to fetch these flowers in he explained theyre his favorites as well as mine it wont be long now till the frost kills them  and i want to be happy while i may  again columbine felt that deep surge within her beyond her control beyond her understanding but now gathering and swelling soon to be reckoned with she did not look at wilsons face then her downcast gaze saw that his right hand was bandaged and she touched it with an unconscious tenderness  your hand why is it all wrapped up  the cowboy laughed with grim humor  have you seen jack this morning  no she replied shortly  well if you had youd know what happened to my fist  did you hurt it on him she asked with a queer little shudder that was not unpleasant  collie i busted that fist on his handsome face  oh it was dreadful she murmured wilson he meant to kill you  sure and id cheerfully have killed him  you two must never meet again she went on  i hope to heaven we never do replied moore with a dark earnestness that meant more than his actual words  wilson will you avoid himfor my sake implored columbine unconsciously clasping the bandaged hand  i will ill take the back trails ill sneak like a coyote ill hide and ill watch but columbine belllounds if he ever corners me again  why youll leave him to hellbent wade interrupted the hunter and he looked up from where he knelt fixing those great inscrutable eyes upon the cowboy columbine saw something beyond his face deeper than the gloom a passion and a spirit that drew her like a magnet an now miss collie he went on i reckon youll want to wait on our invalid hes got to be fed  i surely will replied columbine gladly and she sat down on the edge of the bed ben you fetch that box and put his dinner on it  while wade complied columbine shyly aware of her nearness to the cowboy sought to keep up conversation couldnt you help yourself with your left hand she inquired  thats one worse he answered taking it from under the blanket where it had been concealed  oh cried columbine in dismay  broke two bones in this one said wilson with animation say collie our friend wade is a doctor too never saw his beat  and a cook too for heres your dinner you must sit up ordered columbine  fold that blanket and help me up on it replied moore  how strange and disturbing for columbine to bend over him to slip her arms under him and lift him it recalled a longforgotten motherliness of her dollplaying days and her face flushed hot  cant you move she asked suddenly becoming aware of how dead a weight the cowboy appeared  notvery much he replied drops of sweat appeared on his bruised brow it must have hurt him to move  you said your foot was all right  it is he returned its still on my leg as i know darned well  oh exclaimed columbine dubiously without further comment she began to feed him  its worth getting licked to have this treat he said  nonsense she rejoined  id stand it againto have you come here and feed me but not from him  wilson i never knew you to be facetious before here take this  apparently he did not see her outstretched hand  collie youve changed youre older youre a woman nowand the prettiest  are you going to eat demanded columbine  huh exclaimed the cowboy blankly eat oh yes sure im powerful hungry and maybe heavensent wade cant cook  but columbine had trouble in feeding him what with his helplessness and his propensity to watch her face instead of her hands and her own mounting sensations of a sweet natural joy and fitness in her proximity to him she was hard put to it to show some dexterity as a nurse and all the time she was aware of wade with his quiet forceful presence hovering near could he not see her hands trembling and would he not think that weakness strange then driftingly came the thought that she would not shrink from wades reading her mind perhaps even now he understood her better than she understood herself  i canteat any more declared moore at last  youve done very well for an invalid observed columbine then changing the subject she asked wilson youre going to stay herewinter here dad would call it  yes  are those your cattle down in the valley  sure ive got near a hundred head i saved my money and bought cattle  thats a good start for you im glad but whos going to take care of you and your stock until you can work again  why my friend there heavensent wade replied moore indicating the little man busy with the utensils on the table and apparently hearing nothing  can i fetch you anything to eator read she inquired  fetch yourself he replied softly  but boy how could i fetch you anything without fetching myself  sure thats right then fetch me some jam and a booktomorrow will you  i surely will  thats a promise i know your promises of old  then goodby till tomorrow i must go i hope youll be better  ill stay sick in bed till you stop coming  columbine left rather precipitously and when she got outdoors it seemed that the hills had never been so softly dreamily gray nor their loneliness so sweet nor the sky so richly and deeply blue as she untied pronto the hunter came out with kane at his heels  miss collie if youll go easy ill ketch my horse an ride down with you he said  she mounted and walked pronto out to the trail and slowly faced the gradual descent it was really higher up there than she had surmised and the view was beautiful the gray rolling foothills so exquisitely colored at that hour and the blackfringed ranges one above the other and the distant peaks sunsetflushed across the purple all rose open and clear to her sight so wildly and splendidly expressive of the colorado she loved  at the foot of the slope wade joined her  lass im askin you not to tell belllounds that im carin for wils he said in his gentle persuasive way  i wont but why not tell dad he wouldnt mind hed do that sort of thing himself  reckon he would but this deals out of the ordinary an wilss not in as good shape as he thinks im not takin any chances i dont want to lose my job an i dont want to be hindered from attendin to this boy  they had ridden as far as the first aspen grove when wade concluded this remark columbine halted her horse causing her companion to do likewise her former misgivings were augmented by the intelligence of wades sad lined face  ben tell me she whispered with a hand going to his arm  miss collie im a sort of doctor in my way i studied some medicine an surgery an i know i wouldnt tell you this if it wasnt that ive got to rely on you to help me  i willbut go ontell me interposed columbine trying to fortify herself  wilss foot is all messed up buster jack kicked it all out of shape an its a hundred times worse than ever im afraid of bloodpoisonin an gangrene you know gangrene is a dyin an rottin of the flesh i told the boy straight out that hed better let me cut his foot off an he swore hed keep his foot or die well if gangrene does set in we cant save his leg an maybe not his life  oh it cant be as bad as all that cried columbine oh i knewi knew there was something ben you mean even at best nowhell be a she broke off unable to finish  miss collie in any case wilsll never ride againnot like a cowboy  that for columbine seemed the worst and the last straw hot tears blinded her hot blood gushed over her hot heartbeats throbbed in her throat  poor boy thatllruin him she cried he loveda horse he loved to ride he was thebest rider of them all and now hes ruined hell be lamea crippleclubfooted all because of that jack belllounds the brutethe coward i hate him oh i hate him and ive got to marry himon october first oh god pity me  blindly columbine reeled out of her saddle and slowly dropped to the grass where she burst into a violent storm of sobs and tears it shook her every fiber it was hopeless terrible grief the dry grass received her flood of tears and her incoherent words  wade dismounted and kneeling beside her placed a gentle hand upon her heaving shoulder but he spoke no word by and by when the storm had begun to subside he raised her head  lass nothin is ever so bad as it seems he said softly come sit up let me talk to you  oh ben something terrible has happened she cried its in me i dont know what it is but itll kill me  i know he replied as her head fell upon his shoulder miss collie im an old fellow thats had everythin happen to him an im livin yet tryin to help people along no one dies so easy why youre a fine strong girlan somethin tells me you was made for happiness i know how things turn out listen  but benyou dont knowabout me she sobbed ive told youihate jack belllounds but ivegot to marry

jackhe loves you as well as he can love anythin an the old manno daughter could be loved more an ii love you lass just likeas if youmight have been my own im goin to be the friendthe brother you need an i reckon i can come somewheres near bein a mother if youll let me  something some subtle power or charm stole over columbine assuaging her terrible sense of loss of grief there was tenderness in this mans hands in his voice and through them throbbed strong and passionate life and spirit  do you really love melove me she whispered somehow comforted somehow feeling that what he offered was what she had missed as a child and you want to be all that for me  yes lass an i reckon youd better try me  oh how good you are i felt thatthe very first time i was with you ive wanted to come to youto tell you my troubles i love dad and he loves me but he doesnt understand dad is wrapped up in his son ive had no one i never had any one  you have some one now returned wade with a rich deep mellowness in his voice that soothed columbine and made her wonder an because ive been through so much i can tell you whatll help you lass if a woman isnt big an brave how will a man ever be theres more in women than in men life has given you a hard knock placin you hereno real parentsan makin you responsible to a man whose only fault is blinded love for his son well youve got to meet it face it

its hell but you can never tell whatll happen when youre honest and square if you feel it your duty to pay your debt to the old man you call dadto pay it by marryin his son why do it an be a woman theres nothin as great as a woman can be theres happiness that comes in strange unheardof ways theres more in this life than what you want most you didnt place yourself in this fix so if you meet it with courage an faithfulness to yourself why itll not turn out as you dread some day if you ever think youre brokenhearted ill tell you my story an then youll not think your lot so hard for ive had a broken heart an ruined life an yet ive lived on an on findin happiness i never dreamed would come fightin or workin an how i found the world beautiful an how i love the flowers an hills an wild things so wellthat just that would be enough to live for an think lass of what a wonderful happiness will come to me in showin all this to you thatll be the crownin glory an if its that much to me then you be sure theres nothin on earth i wont do for you  columbine lifted her tearstained face with a light of inspiration  oh wilson was right she murmured you are heavensent and im going to love you    chapter ix  a new spirit or a liberation of her own had fired columbine and was now burning within her unquenchable and unutterable some divine spark had penetrated into that mysterious depth of her to inflame and to illumine so that when she arose from this hour of calamity she felt that to the tenderness and sorrow and fidelity in her soul had been added the lightning flash of passion  oh benshall i be able to hold onto this she cried flinging wide her arms as if to embrace the winds of heaven  this what lass he asked  thisthis woman she answered passionately with her hands sweeping back to press her breast  no woman who wakes ever goes back to a girl again he said sadly  i wanted to dieand now i want to liveto fight ben youve uplifted me i was little weak miserable but in my dreams or in some state i cant remember or understand ive waited for your very words i was ready its as if i knew you in some other world before i was born on this earth and when you spoke to me here so wonderfullyas my mother might have spokenmy heart leaped up in recognition of you and your call to my womanhood oh how strange and beautiful  miss collie he replied slowly as he bent to his saddlestraps youre young an youve no understandin of whats strange an terrible in life an beautiful too as you say who knows maybe in some former state i was somethin to you i believe in that reckon i cant say how or what maybe we were flowers or birds ive a weakness for that idea  birds i like the thought too replied columbine i love most birds but there are hawks crows buzzards  i reckon lass theres got to be balance in nature if it werent for the ugly an the evil we wouldnt know the beautiful an good an now lets ride home its gettin late  ben ought i not go back to wilson right now she asked slowly  what for  to tell himsomethingand why i cant come tomorrow or ever afterward she replied low and tremulously  wade pondered over her words it seemed to columbine that her sharpened faculties sensed something of hostility of opposition in him  reckon tomorrow would be better he said presently wilsons had enough excitement for one day  then ill go tomorrow she returned  in the gathering cold twilight they rode down the trail in silence  good night lass said wade as he reached his cabin an remember youre not alone any more  good night my friend she replied and rode on  columbine encountered jim montana at the corrals and it was not too dark for her to see his foamlashed horse jim appeared noncommittal almost surly but columbine guessed that he had ridden to kremmling and back in one day on some order of jacks  miss collie ill tend to pronto he offered an yore supperll be waitin  a bright fire blazed on the livingroom hearth the rancher was reading by its light  hello rosycheeks greeted the rancher with unusual amiability been ridin agin the wind hey wal if you aint pretty then my eyes are pore  its cold dad she replied and the wind stings but i didnt ride fast nor far ive been up to see wilson moore  ahuh wal hows the boy asked belllounds gruffly  he said he was all right butbut i guess thats not so responded columbine  any friends lookin after him  oh yeshe must have friendsthe andrewses and others im glad to say his cabin is comfortable hell be looked after  wal im glad to hear thet ill send lem or wade up thar an see if we can do anythin fer the boy  dadthats just like you replied columbine with her hand seeking his broad shoulder  ahuh say collie hyars letters from most everybody in kremmlin wantin to be invited up fer october first how about askin em  the more the merrier replied columbine  wal i reckon ill not ask anybody  why not dad  no one can gamble on thet son of mine even on his weddinday replied belllounds gloomily  dad whatd jack do today  im not sayin he did anythin answered the rancher  dad you can gamble on me  wal i should smile he said putting his big arm around her i wish you was jack an jack was you  at that moment the young man spoken of slouched into the room with his head bandaged and took a seat at the suppertable  wal collie lets go an get it said the rancher cheerily i can always eat anyhow  im hungry as a bear rejoined columbine as she took her seat which was opposite jack  where ye you been he asked curiously  why good evening jack did you finally notice me ive been riding pronto the first time since he was hurt had a lovely rideup through sage valley  jack glowered at her with the one unbandaged eye and growled something under his breath and then began to stab meat and potatoes with his fork  whats the matter jack arent you well asked columbine with a solicitude just a little too sweet to be genuine  yes im well snapped jack  but you look sick that is what i can see of your face looks sick your mouth droops at the corners youre very paleand red in spots and your one eye glows with unearthly woe as if you were not long for this world  the amazing nature of this speech coming from the girl who had always been so sweet and quiet and backward was attested to by the consternation of jack and the mirth of his father  are you making fun of me demanded jack  why jack do you think i would make fun of you i only wanted to say how queer you look are you going to be married with one eye  jack collapsed at that and the old man after a long stare of openmouthed wonder broke out haw haw haw by golly lassid never believed thet was in you jack be game an take your medicine an both of you forgive an forget tharll be quarrels enough mebbe without rakin over the past  when alone again columbine reverted to a mood vastly removed from her apparent levity with the rancher and his son a grave and inwardsearching thought possessed her and it had to do with the uplift the spiritual advance the rise above mere personal welfare that had strangely come to her through bent wade from their first meeting he had possessed a singular attraction for her that now in the light of the meaning of his life seemed to columbine to be the mans nobility and wisdom arising out of his travail out of the terrible years that had left their record upon his face  and so columbine strove to bind forever in her soul the spirit which had arisen in her interpreting from wades rude words of philosophy that which she needed for her own light and strength  she appreciated her duty toward the man who had been a father to her whatever he asked that would she do and as for the son she must live with the rest of her life her duty there was to be a good wife to bear with his faults to strive always to help him by kindness patience loyalty and such affection as was possible to her hate had to be reckoned with and hate she knew had no place in a good womans heart it must be expelled if that were humanly possible all this was hard would grow harder but she accepted it and knew her mind  her soul was her own unchangeable through any adversity she could be with that alone always aloof from the petty cares and troubles common to people wades words had thrilled her with their secret with their limitless hope of an unknown world of thought and feeling happiness in the ordinary sense might never be hers alas for her dreams but there had been given her a glimpse of something higher than pleasure and contentment dreams were but dreams but she could still dream of what had been of what might have been of the beauty and mystery of life of something in nature that called sweetly and irresistibly to her who could rob her of the rolling gray velvety hills and the purple peaks and the black ranges among which she had been found a waif a little lost creature born like a columbine under the spruces  love suddendawning inexplicable love was her secret still tremulously new and perilous in its sweetness that only did she fear to realize and to face because it was an unknown factor a threatening flame her sudden knowledge of it seemed inextricably merged with the mounting strong and steadfast stream of her spirit  ill go to him ill tell him she murmured he shall have that then i must bid himgoodbyforever  to tell wilson would be sweet to leave him would be bitter vague possibilities haunted her what might come of the telling how dark loomed the bitterness she could not know what hid in either of these acts until they were fulfilled and the hours became long and sleep far off and the quietness of the house a torment and the melancholy wail of coyotes a reminder of happy girlhood never to return                                       when next day the longdeferred hour came columbine selected a horse that she could run and she rode up the winding valley swift as the wind but at the aspen grove where wades keen gentle voice had given her secret life she suffered a reaction that made her halt and ascend the slope very slowly and with many stops  sight of wades horse haltered near the cabin relieved columbine somewhat of a gathering might of emotion the hunter would be inside and so she would not be compelled at once to confess her secret this expectancy gave impetus to her lagging steps before she reached the open door she called out  collie youre late answered wilson with both joy and reproach as she entered the cowboy lay upon his bed and he was alone in the room  oh where is ben exclaimed columbine  he was here he cooked my dinner we waited but you never came the dinner got cold i made sure youd backed outwerent coming at alland i couldnt eat wade said he knew youd come he went off with the hounds somewhere  and oh collie its all right now  columbine walked to his bedside and looked down upon him with a feeling as if some giant hand was tugging at her heart he looked better the swelling and redness of his face were less marked and at that moment no pain shadowed his eyes they were soft dark eloquent if columbine had not come with her avowed resolution and desire to unburden her heart she would have found that look in his eyes a desperately hard one to resist had it ever shone there before blind she had been  youre better she said happily  surenow but i had a bad night didnt sleep till near daylight wade found me asleep collie its good of you to come you look soso wonderful i never saw your face glow like that and your eyesoh  you think im pretty then she asked dreamily not occupied at all with that thought  he uttered a contemptuous laugh  come closer he said reaching for her with a clumsy bandaged hand  down upon her knees columbine fell both hands flew to cover her face and as she swayed forward she shook violently and there escaped her lips a little muffled sound  whycollie cried moore astounded good heavens dont cry ii didnt mean anything i only wanted to feel youtouch your hand  here she answered blindly holding out her hand groping for his till she found it her other was still pressed to her eyes one moment longer would columbine keep her secrethide her eyesrevel in the unutterable joy and sadness of this crisis that could come to a woman only once  what in the world ejaculated the cowboy now bewildered but he possessed himself of the trembling hand offered collie you act so strange youre not crying am i only locoed or flighty or what dear look at me  columbine swept her hand from her eyes with a gesture of utter surrender  wilson im ashamedand sadand gloriously happy she said with swift breathlessness  why he asked  because ofof something i have to tell you she whispered  what is that  she bent over him  cant you guess  he turned pale and his eyes burned with intense fire  i wont guess  i darent guess  its something thats been true for yearsforever it seemssomething i never dreamed of till last night she went on softly  collie he cried dont torture me  do you remember long agowhen we quarreled so dreadfullybecause you kissed me she asked  do you think i could kiss youand live to forget  i love you she whispered shyly feeling the hot blood burn her  that whisper transformed wilson moore his arm flashed round her neck and pulled her face down to his and holding her in a close embrace he kissed her lips and cheeks and wet eyes and then again her lips passionately and tenderly  then he pressed her head down upon his breast  my god i cant believe say it again he cried hoarsely  columbine buried her flaming face in the blanket covering him and her hands clutched it tightly the wildness of his joy the strange strength and power of his kisses utterly changed her upon his breast she lay without desire to lift her face all seemed different wilder as she responded to his appeal yes i love you oh i lovelovelove you  dearest lift your face its true now i know its proved but let me look at you  columbine lifted herself as best she could but she was blinded by tears and choked with utterance that would not come and in the grip of a shuddering emotion that was realization of loss in a moment when she learned the supreme and imperious sweetness of love  kiss me columbine he demanded  through blurred eyes she saw his face white and rapt and she bent to it meeting his lips with her first kiss which was her last  again collieagain he begged  nono more she whispered very low and encircling his neck with her arms she hid her face and held him convulsively and stifled the sobs that shook her  then moore was silent holding her with his free hand breathing hard and slowly quieting down columbine felt then that he knew that there was something terribly wrong and that perhaps he dared not voice his fear at any rate he silently held her waiting that silent wait grew unendurable for columbine she wanted to prolong this moment that was to be all she could ever surrender but she dared not do so for she knew if he ever kissed her again her duty to belllounds would vanish like mist in the sun  to release her hold upon him seemed like a tearing of her heartstrings she sat up she wiped the tears from her eyes she rose to her feet all the time striving for strength to face him again  a loud voice ringing from the cliffs outside startled columbine it came from wade calling the hounds he had returned and the fact stirred her  im to marry jack belllounds on october first  the cowboy raised himself up as far as he was able it was agonizing for columbine to watch the changing and whitening of his face  nono he gasped  yes its true she replied hopelessly  no he exclaimed hoarsely  but wilson i tell you yes i came to tell you its trueoh its true  but girl you said you love me he declared transfixing her with dark accusing eyes  thats just as terribly true  he softened a little and something of terror and horror took the place of anger  just then wade entered the cabin with his soft tread hesitated and then came to columbines side she could not unrivet her gaze from moore to look at her friend but she reached out with trembling hand to him wade clasped it in a horny palm  wilson fought for selfcontrol in vain  collie if you love me how can you marry jack belllounds he demanded  i must  why must you  i owe my life and my bringing up to his father he wants me to do it his heart is set upon my helping jack to become a man dad loves me and i love him i must stand by him i must repay him it is my duty  youve a duty to yourselfas a woman he rejoined passionately belllounds is wrapped up in his son hes blind to the shame of such a marriage but youre not  shame faltered columbine  yes the shame of marrying one man when you love another you cant love two men youll give yourself youll be his wife do you understand what that means  ii thinki do replied columbine faintly where had vanished all her wonderful spirit this fireeyed boy was breaking her heart with his reproach  but youll bear his children cried wilson mother ofthemwhen you love me didnt you think of that  oh noi never didi never did wailed columbine  then youll think before its too late he implored wildly dearest collie think you wont ruin yourself you wont say you wont  butoh wilson what can i say ive got to marry him  collie ill kill him before he gets you  you mustnt talk so if you fought againif anything terrible happened itd kill me  youd be better off he flashed white as a sheet  columbine leaned against wade for support she was fast weakening in strength although her spirit held she knew what was inevitable but wilsons agony was rending her  listen began the cowboy again its your lifeyour happinessyour soul belllounds is crazy over that spoiled boy he thinks the sun rises and sets in him but jack belllounds is no good on this earth collie dearest dont think thats my jealousy i am horribly jealous but i know him hes not worth you no man isand he the least hell break your heart drag you down ruin your healthkill you as sure as you stand there i want you to know i could prove to you what he is but dont make me trust me collie believe me  wilson i do believe you cried columbine but it doesnt make any difference it only makes my duty harder  hell treat you like he treats a horse or a dog hell beat you  he never will if he ever lays a hand on me  if not that hell tire of you jack belllounds never stuck to anything in his life and never will its not in him he wants what he cant have if he gets it then right off he doesnt want it oh ive known him since he was a kid columbine youve a mistaken sense of duty no girl need sacrifice her all because some man found her a lost baby and gave her a home a woman owes more to herself than to any one  oh thats true wilson ive thought it all but youre unjusthard you make no allowance forfor some possible good in every one dad swears i can reform jack maybe i can ill pray for it  reform jack belllounds how can you save a bad egg that damned coward didnt he prove to you what he was when he jumped on me and kicked my broken foot till i fainted what do you want  dont say any moreplease cried columbine oh im so sorry i oughtnt have come ben take me home  but collie i love you frantically urged wilson and hehe may love youbut hescolliehes been  here moore seemed to bite his tongue to hold back speech to fight something terrible and desperate and cowardly in himself  columbine heard only his impassioned declaration of love and to that she vibrated  you speak as if this was onesided she burst out as once more the gush of hot blood surged over her you dont love me any more than i love you not as much for im a woman i love with all my heart and soul  moore fell back upon the bed spent and overcome  wade my friend for gods sake do something he whispered appealing to the hunter as if in a last hope tell collie what itll mean for her to marry belllounds if that doesnt change her then tell her what itll mean to me ill never go home ill never leave here if she hadnt told me she loved me then i might have stood anything but now i cant itll kill me wade  boy youre talkin flighty again replied wade this mornin when i come you were dreamin an talkinclean out of your head well now you an collie listen youre right an shes right i reckon i never run across a deal with two people fixed just like you but that doesnt hinder me from feelin the same about it as id feel about somethin i was used to  he paused and gently releasing columbine he went to moore and retied his loosened bandage and spread out the disarranged blankets then he sat down on the edge of the bed and bent over a little running a roughened hand through the scant hair that had begun to silver upon his head presently he looked up and from that sallow face with its lines and furrows and from the deep inscrutable eyes there fell a light which however sad and wise in its infinite understanding of pain and strife was still ruthless and unquenchable in its hope  wade for gods sake save columbine importuned wilson  oh if you only could cried columbine impelled beyond her power to resist by that prayer  lass you stand by your convictions he said impressively an moore you be a man an dont make it so hard for her neither of you can do anythin now theres old bellloundshell never change he might rar up for this or that but hell never change his cherished hopes for his son but jack might change lookin back over all the years i remember many boys like this buster jack an i remember how in the nature of their doins they just hanged themselves ive a queer foresight about people whose trouble ive made my own its somethin that never fails when their troubles goin to turn out bad then i feel a terrible yearnin to tell the story of hellbent wade that foresight of trouble gave me my name but its not operatin here an so my young friends you can believe me when i say somethin will happen as far as october first is concerned or any time near collie isnt goin to marry jack belllounds    chapter x  one day wade remarked to belllounds you can never tell what a dog is until you know him dogs are like men some of em look good but theyre really bad an that works the other way round if a dogs born to run wild an be a sheepkiller thats what hell be ive known dogs that loved men as no humans could have loved them it doesnt make any difference to a dog if his master is a worthless scamp  wal i reckon most of them hounds i bought had no good masters judgin from the way they act replied the rancher  im developin a firstrate pack said wade jim hasnt any faults exceptin he doesnt bay enough sampsons not as truenosed as jim but hell follow jim an he has a deep heavy bay you can hear for miles so that makes up for jims one fault these two hounds hang together an with them im developin others denver will split off of bear or lion tracks when he jumps a deer i reckon hes not young enough to be cured of that some of the younger hounds are comin on fine but theres two dogs in the bunch that beat me all hollow  which ones asked belllounds  theres that bloodhound kane replied the hunter hes sure a queer dog i cant win him he minds me now because i licked him an once good an hard when he bit me but he doesnt cotton to me worth a damn hes gettin fond of miss columbine an i believe might make a good watchdog for her whered he come from belllounds  wal if i dont disremember he was born in a prairieschooner comin across the plains his mother was a fullblood an come from louisiana  that accounts for an instinct i see croppin out in kane rejoined wade he likes to trail a man ive caught him doin it an he doesnt take to huntin lions or bear why the other day when the hounds treed a lion an went howlin wild kane came up an he looked disgusted an went off by himself he hunts by himself anyhow first off i thought he might be a sheepkiller but i reckon not he can trail men an thats about all the good he is his mother must have been a slavehunter an kane inherits that trailin instinct  ahuh wal train him on trailin men then ive seen times when a dog like thetd come handy an if he takes to collie an you approve of him let her have him shes been coaxin me fer a dog  that isnt a bad idea miss collie walks an rides alone a good deal an she never packs a gun  funny about thet said belllounds collie is game in most ways but shed never kill anythin wade you aint thinkin she ought to stop them lonesome walks an rides  no sure not so long as she doesnt go too far away  ahuh wal supposin she rode up out of the valley west on the black range  that wont do belllounds replied wade seriously but miss collies not goin to for ive cautioned her fact is ive run across some hardlookin men between here an buffalo park theyre not hunters or prospectors or cattlemen or travelers  wal you dont say rejoined belllounds now wade are you connectin up them strangers with the stock i missed on this last roundup  reckon i cant go as far as that returned wade but i didnt like their looks  thet comin from you wade is like the findins of a jury its gettin along toward october snowll be flyin soon you dont reckon them strangers will winter in the woods  no i dont neither does lewis you recollect him  yes thet prospector who hangs out around buffalo park lookin fer gold hes been hyar good fellar but crazy on gold  ive met lewis several times one place and another i lost the hounds day before yesterday they treed a lion an lewis heard the racket an he stayed with them till i come up then he told me some interestin news you see hes been worryin about this gang thets rangin around buffalo park an hes tried to get a line on them somebody took a shot at him in the woods he couldnt swear it was one of that outfit but he could swear he wasnt near shot by accident now lewis says these men pack to an fro from elgeria an he has a hunch theyre in cahoots with smith who runs a place there you know smith  no i dont an havent any wish to declared belllounds shortly he always looked shady to me an hes not been square with friends of mine in elgeria but no one ever proved him crooked whatever was thought fer my part i never missed a guess in my life men dont have scars on their face like his fer nothin  boss im confidin what i want kept under your hat said wade quietly i knew smith hes as bad as the west makes them i gave him that scar an when he sees me hes goin for his gun  wal ill be darned doesnt surprise me its a small world wade ill keep my mouth shut sure but whats your game  lewis an i will find out if there is any connection between smith an this gang of strangersan the occasional loss of a few head of stock  ahuh wal you have my good will you bet sure thars been some rustlin of cattle not enough to make any rancher holler an i reckon there never will be any more of thet in colorado still if we get the drop on some outfit we sure ought to corral them  boss im tellin you  wade you aint agoin to start thet tellin hellbent happenins to come hyar at white slides interrupted belllounds plaintively  no i reckon ive no hunch like that now responded wade seriously but i was about to say that if smith is in on any rustlin of cattle hell be hard to catch an if hes caught therell be shootin to pay hes cunnin an has had long experience its not likely hed work openly as he did years ago if hes stealin stock or buyin an sellin stock that some one steals for him its only on a small scale an itll be hard to trace  wal he might be deep said belllounds reflectively but men like thet no matter how deep or cunnin they are always come to a bad end jest works out natural had you any grudge agin smith  what i give him was for somebody else an was sure little enough hes got the grudge against me  ahuh wal then dont you go huntin fer trouble try an make white slides one place thetll disprove your name all the same dont shy at sight of anythin suspicious round the ranch  the old man plodded thoughtfully away leaving the hunter likewise in a brown study  hes gettin a hunch that ill tell him of some shadow hoverin black over white slides soliloquized wade maybemaybe so but i dont see any yet strange how a man will say what he didnt start out to say now i started to tell him about that amazin dog fox  fox was the great dog of the whole pack and he had been absolutely overlooked which fact wade regarded with contempt for himself discovery of this particular dog came about by accident somewhere in the big corral there was a hole where the smaller dogs could escape but wade had been unable to find it for that matter the corral was full of holes not any of which however it appeared to wade would permit anything except a squirrel to pass in and out  one day when the hunter very much exasperated was prowling around and around inside the corral searching for this mysterious vent a rather small dog with short gray and brown woolly hair and shaggy brows half hiding big bright eyes came up wagging his stump of a tail  well what do you know about it demanded wade of course he had noticed this particular dog but to no purpose on this occasion the dog repeated so unmistakably former overtures of friendship that wade gave him close scrutiny he was neither young nor comely nor thoroughbred but there was something in his intelligent eyes that struck the hunter significantly say maybe i overlooked somethin but theres been a heap of dogs round here an youre no great shucks for looks now if youre talkin to me come an find that hole  whereupon wade began another search around the corral it covered nearly an acre of ground and in some places the fencepoles had been sunk near rocks more than once wade got down upon his hands and knees to see if he could find the hole the dog went with him watching with knowing eyes that the hunter imagined actually laughed at him but they were glad eyes which began to make an appeal presently when wade came to a rough place the dog slipped under a shelving rock and thence through a halfconcealed hole in the fence and immediately came back through to wag his stump of a tail and look as if the finding of that hole was easy enough  you old fox declared wade very much pleased as he patted the dog you found it for me didnt you good dog now ill fix that hole an then you can come to the cabin with me an your names fox  that was how fox introduced himself to wade and found his opportunity the fact that he was not a hound had operated against his being taken out hunting and therefore little or no attention had been paid him very shortly fox showed himself to be a dog of superior intelligence the hunter had lived much with dogs and had come to learn that the longer he lived with them the more there was to marvel at and love  fox insisted so strongly on being taken out to hunt with the hounds that wade vowing not to be surprised at anything let him go it happened to be a particularly hard day on hounds because of old tracks and crosstracks and difficult ground fox worked out a labyrinthine trail that sampson gave up and jim failed on this delighted wade and that night he tried to find out from andrews who sold the dog to belllounds something about fox all the information obtainable was that andrews suspected the fellow from whom he had gotten fox had stolen him belllounds had never noticed him at all wade kept the possibilities of fox to himself and reserved his judgment and every day gave the dog another chance to show what he knew  illustration im beginnin to feel that i couldnt let her marry that buster jack soliloquized wade as he rode along the grassy trail  long before the end of that week wade loved fox and decided that he was a wonderful animal fox liked to hunt but it did not matter what he hunted that depended upon the pleasure of his master he would find hobbled horses that were hiding out and standing still to escape detection he would trail cattle he would tree squirrels and point grouse invariably he suited his mood to the kind of game he hunted if put on an elk track or that of deer he would follow it keeping well within sight of the hunter and never uttering a single bark or yelp and without any particular eagerness he would stick until he had found the game or until he was called off bear and cat tracks however roused the savage instinct in him and transformed him he yelped at every jump on a trail and whenever his yelp became piercing and continuous wade well knew the quarry was in sight he fought bear like a wise old dog that knew when to rush in with a snap and when to keep away when lions or wildcats were treed fox lost much of his ferocity and interest then the matter of that particular quarry was ended his most valuable characteristic however was his ability to stick on the track upon which he was put wade believed if he put fox on the trail of a rabbit and if a bear or lion were to cross that trail ahead of him fox would stick to the rabbit even more remarkable was it that fox would not steal a piece of meat and that he would fight the other dogs for being thieves  fox and kane it seemed to the hunter in his reflective foreshadowing of events at white slides were destined to play most important parts                                       upon a certain morning several days before october firstwhich date rankled in the mind of wadehe left moores cabin leading a packhorse the hounds he had left behind at the ranch but fox accompanied him  wade i want some elk steak old belllounds had said the day before nothin like a good rump steak i was raised on elk meat now hyar moren a week ago i told you i wanted some theres elk all around i heerd a bull whistle at sunup today made me wish i was young agin you go pack in an elk  i havent run across any bulls lately wade had replied but he did not mention that he had avoided such a circumstance the fact was wade admired and loved the elk above all horned wild animals so strange was his attitude toward elk that he had gone meathungry many a time with these great stags bugling near his camp  as he climbed the yellow grassy mountainside working round above the valley his mind was not centered on the task at hand but on wilson moore who had come to rely on him with the unconscious tenacity of a son whose faith in his father was unshakable the crippled cowboy kept his hope kept his cheerful grateful spirit obeyed and suffered with a patience that was fine there had been no improvement in his injured foot wade worried about that much more than moore the thing that mostly occupied the cowboy was the near approach of october first with its terrible possibility for him he did not talk about it except when fever made him irrational but it was plain to wade how he prayed and hoped and waited in silence strange how he trusted wade to avert catastrophe of columbines marriage yet such trust seemed familiar to wade as he reflected over past years had he not wanted such trusthad he not invited it  for twenty years no happiness had come to wade in any sense comparable to that now secretly his as he lived near columbine belllounds divining more and more each day how truly she was his own flesh and the image of the girl he had loved and married and wronged columbine was his daughter he saw himself in her and columbine from being strongly attracted to him and trusting in him and relying upon him had come to love him that was the most beautiful and terrible fact of his lifebeautiful because it brought back the past her babyhood and his barren years and gave him this sudden change where he lived transported with the sense and the joy of his possession it was terrible because she was unhappy because she was chained to duty and honor because ruin faced her and lastly because wade began to have the vague gloomy intimations of distant tragedy far off like a cloud on the horizon but there long ago he had learned the uselessness of fighting his morbid visitations but he clung to hope to faith in life to the victory of the virtuous to the defeat of evil a thousand proofs had strengthened him in that clinging  there were personal dread and poignant pain for wade in columbine bellloundss situation after all he had only his subtle and intuitive assurance that matters would turn out well for her in the end to trust that now when the shadow began to creep over his own daughter seemed unwisea juggling with chance  im beginnin to feel that i couldnt let her marry that buster jack soliloquized wade as he rode along the grassy trail fust off seein how strong was her sense of duty an loyalty i wasnt so set against it but somethins growin in me her love for that crippled boy now an his for her lord theyre so young an life must be so hot an love so sweet i reckon thats why i couldnt let her marry jack but on the other hand theres the old mans faith in his son an theres collies faith in herself an in life now i believe in that an the years have proved to me theres hope for the worst of men i havent even had a talk with this buster jack i dont know him except by hearsay an im sure prejudiced whichs no wonder considerin where i saw him in denver i reckon before i go any farther id better meet this belllounds boy an see whats in him                                       it was characteristic of wade that this soliloquy abruptly ended his thoughtful considerations for the time being this was owing to the fact that he rested upon a decision and also because it was time he began to attend to the object of his climb  bench after bench he had ascended and the higher he got the denser and more numerous became the aspen thickets and the more luxuriant the grass presently the long black slope of spruce confronted him with its edge like a dark wall he entered the fragrant forest where not a twig stirred nor a sound pervaded the silence upon the soft matted earth the hoofs of the horses made no impression and scarcely a perceptible thud  wade headed to the left avoiding rough rocky defiles of weathered cliff and windfallen trees and aimed to find easy going up to the summit of the mountain bluff far above this was new forest to him consisting of moderatesized sprucetrees growing so closely together that he had to go carefully to keep from snapping dead twigs fox trotted on in the lead now and then pausing to look up at his master as if for instructions  a brightening of the darkgreen gloom ahead showed the hunter that he was approaching a large glade or open patch where the sunlight fell strongly it turned out to be a swale or swampy place some few acres in extent and directly at the foot of a last steep wooded slope here fox put his nose into the air and halted  whatre you scentin fox old boy asked wade with low voice as he peered ahead the wind was in the wrong direction for him to approach close to game without being detected fox wagged his stumpy tail and looked up with knowing eyes wade proceeded cautiously the swamp was a rank growth of long weedy grasses and ferns with here and there a greenmossed bog half hidden and a number of dwarf oaktrees wades horse sank up to his knees in the mire on the other side showed fresh tracks along the wet margin of the swale  its elk all right said wade as he dismounted heard us comin now fox stick your nose in that track an go slow  with rifle ready wade began the ascent of the slope on foot leading his horse an old elk trail showed a fresh track fox accommodated his pace to that of the toiling hunter the ascent was steep and led up through dense forest at intervals when wade halted to catch his breath and listen he heard faint snapping of dead branches far above at length he reached the top of the mountain to find a wide open space with heavy forest in front and a bare ghastly burnedover district to his right fox growled and appeared about to dash forward then in an opening through the forest wade espied a large bull elk standing at gaze evidently watching him he was a gray old bull with broken antlers wade made no move to shoot and presently the elk walked out of sight  too old an tough fox explained the hunter to the anxious dog but perhaps that was not all wades motive in sparing him  once more mounted wade turned his attention to the burned district it was a dreary hideous splotch a blackened slash in the green cover of the mountain it sloped down into a wide hollow and up another bare slope the ground was littered with bleached logs trees that had been killed first by fire and then felled by wind here and there a lofty spectral trunk still withstood the blasts across the hollow sloped a considerable area where all trees were dead and still standinga melancholy sight beyond and far round and down to the left opened up a slope of spruce and bare ridge where a few cedars showed dark and then came black speartipped forest again leading the eye to the magnificent panorama of endless range on range purple in the distance  wade found patches of grass where beds had been recently occupied  mountainsheep by cracky exclaimed the hunter an fresh tracks too now i wonder if it wouldnt do to kill a sheep an tell belllounds i couldnt find any elk  the hunter had no qualms about killing mountainsheep but he loved the lordly stags and would have lied to spare them he rode on with keen gaze shifting everywhere to catch a movement of something in this wilderness before him if there was any living animal in sight it did not move wade crossed the hollow wended a circuitous route through the upstanding forest of dead timber and entered a thick woods that skirted the rim of the mountain presently he came out upon the open rim from which the depths of green and gray yawned mightily far across old white slides loomed up higher now with a dignity and majesty unheralded from below  wade found fresh sheep tracks in the yellow clay of the rim small as little deer tracks showing that they had just been made by ewes and lambs not a ram track in the group  well that lets me out said wade as he peered under the bluff for sight of the sheep they had gone over the steep rim as if they had wings beats hell how sheep can go down without fallin an how they can hide  he knew they were near at hand and he wasted time peering to spy them out nevertheless he could not locate them fox waited impatiently for the word to let him prove how easily he could rout them out but this permission was not forthcoming  were huntin elk you jackofalldogs reprovingly spoke the hunter to fox  so they went on around the rim and after a couple of miles of travel came to the forest and then open heads of hollows that widened and deepened down here was excellent pasture and cover for elk wade left the rim to ride down these slowdescending halfopen ridges where cedars grew and jackpines stood in clumps and little grassybordered brooks babbled between he saw tracks where a big buck deer had crossed ahead of him and then he flushed a covey of grouse that scared the horses and then he saw where a bear had pulled a rotten log to pieces fox did not show any interest in these things  by and by wade descended to the junction of these hollows where three tiny brooklets united to form a stream of pure swift clear water perhaps a foot deep and several yards wide  i reckon thiss the head of the troublesome said wade whoever named this brook had no sense yet here at its source its gatherin trouble for itself thats the way of youth  the grass grew thickly and luxuriantly and showed signs of recent grazing elk had been along the brook that morning there were many tracks like cow tracks only smaller deeper and more oval and there were beds where elk had lain and tornup places where bulls had plowed and stamped with heavy hoofs  fox trailed the herd to higher ground where evidently they had entered the woods here wade tied his horses and whispering to fox he proceeded stealthily through this strip of spruce he came out to an open point taking care however to keep well screened from which he had a glimpse of a parklike hollow grassy and watered working round to better vantage he soon espied what had made fox stand so stiff and bristling a herd of elk were trooping up the opposite slope scarcely a hundred yards distant they had heard or scented him but did not appear alarmed they halted to look back the hunters quick estimate credited nearly two dozen to the herd mostly cows a magnificent bull with widespreading antlers and black head and shoulders and gray hind quarters stalked out from the herd and stood an instant head aloft splendidly significant of the wild then he trotted into the woods his antlers noiselessly spreading the green others trotted off likewise wade raised his rifle and looked through the sight at the bull and let him pass then he saw another over his rifle and another reluctant and forced he at last aimed and pulled trigger the heavy henry boomed out in the stillness fox dashed down with eager barks when the smoke cleared away wade saw the opposite slope bare except for one fallen elk  then he returned to his horses and brought them back to where fox perched beside the dead quarry  well fox that stagll never bugle any more of a sunrise said wade strange how were made so we have to eat meat id a liked it otherwise  he cut up the elk and packed all the meat the horse could carry and hung the best of what was left out of the reach of coyotes mounting once more he ascended to the rim and found a slope leading down to the west over the basin country below he had hunted several days this way back to the ranch was longer he calculated but less arduous for man and beast his packhorse would have hard enough going in any event from time to time wade halted to rest the burdened packanimal at length he came to a trail he had himself made which he now proceeded to follow it led out of the basin through burned and boggy ground and down upon the forest slope thence to the grassy and aspened uplands one aspen grove where he had rested before faced the west and for reasons hard to guess had suffered little from frost all the leaves were intact some still green but most of them a glorious gold against the blue it was a large grove sloping gently carpeted with yellow grass and such a profusion of purple asters as wade had never seen in his flowerloving life here he dismounted and sat against an aspentree his horses ruthlessly cropped the purple blossoms  nature in her strong prodigality had outdone herself here pale white the aspentrees shone and above was the fluttering quivering canopy of gold tinged with green and below clustered the asters thick as stars in the sky waving nodding swaying gracefully to each little autumn breeze lilachued and lavender and pale violet and all the shades of exquisite purple  wade lingered his senses predominating this was one of those moments that colored his lonely wanderings only to see was enough he would have shut out the encroaching thoughts of self of others of life had that been wholly possible but here after the first few moments of exquisite riot of his senses where fragrance of grass and blossom filled the air and blaze of gold canopied the purple he began to think how beautiful the earth was how nature hid her rarest gifts for those who loved her most how good it was to live if only for these blessings and sadness crept into his meditations because all this beauty was ephemeral all the gold would soon be gone and the asters so pale and pure and purple would soon be like the glory of a dream that had passed  yet still followed the saving thought that frost and winter must again yield to sun and spring summer autumn would return with the flowers of their season in that perennial birth so gracious and promising the aspen leaves would quiver and slowly gild the grass would wave in the wind the asters would bloom lifting starpale faces to the sky next autumn and every year and forever as long as the sun warmed the earth  it was only man who would not always return to the haunts he loved    chapter xi  when bent wade desired opportunities they seemed to gravitate to him  upon riding into the yard of white slides ranch he espied jack belllounds sitting in idle moping posture on the porch something in his dejected appearance roused wades pity no one else was in sight so the hunter took advantage of the moment  hey belllounds will you give me a lift with this meat called wade  sure replied jack readily enough and he got up wade led the packhorse to the door of the storecabin which stood back of the kitchen and was joined to it by a roof there with jacks assistance he unloaded the meat and hung it up on pegs this done wade set to work with knife in hand  i reckon a little trimmin will improve the looks of this carcass observed wade  wade we never had any one round except dad who could cut up a steer or elk said jack but youve got him beat  im pretty handy at most things  handy i wish i could do just one thing as well as you i can ride but thats all no one ever taught me anything  youre a young fellow yet an youve time if you only take kindly to learnin i was past your age when i learned most i know  the hunters voice and his look and that fascination which subtly hid in his presence for the first time seemed to find the response of interest in young belllounds  i cant stick dad says and he swears at me replied belllounds but ill bet i could learn from you  reckon you could why cant you stick to anythin  i dont know ive been as enthusiastic over work as over riding mustangs to ride came natural but in work when i do it wrong then i hate it  ahuh thats too bad you oughtnt to hate work hard work makes for what i reckon you like in a man but dont understand as i look back over my lifean let me say young fellar its been a tough onewhat i remember most an feel best over are the hardest jobs i ever did an those that cost the most sweat an blood  as wade warmed to his subject hoping to sow a good seed in bellloundss mind he saw that he was wasting his earnestness belllounds did not keep to the train of thought his mind wandered and now he was examining wades rifle  old henry fortyfour he said dad has one also an old needlegun say can i go hunting with you  glad to have you how do you handle a rifle  i used to shoot pretty well before i went to denver he replied havent tried since ive been home suppose you let me take a shot at that post and from where he stood in the door he pointed to a big hitchingpost near the corral gate  the corral contained horses and in the pasture beyond were cattle any of which might be endangered by such a shot wade saw that the young man was in earnest that he wanted to respond to the suggestion in his mind consequences of any kind did not awaken after the suggestion  sure go ahead shoot low now a little below where you want to hit said wade  belllounds took aim and fired a thundering report shook the cabin dust and splinters flew from the post  i hit it he exclaimed in delight i was sure i wouldnt because i aimed way under  reckon you did it was a good shot  then a door slammed and old bill belllounds appeared his hair upstanding his look and gait proclaiming him on the rampage  jack whatn hell are you doin he roared and he stamped up to the door to see his son standing there with the rifle in his hands by heaven if it aint one thing its another  boss dont jump over the traces said wade ill allow if id known the gun would let out a bellar like that id not have told jack to shoot reckon its because were under the open roof that it made the racket im wantin to clean the gun while its hot  ahuh wal i was scared fust harkin back to indian days an then i was mad because i figgered jack was up to mischief did you fetch in the meat  you bet an id like a piece for myself replied wade  help yourself man an say come down an eat with us fer supper  much obliged boss i sure will  then the old rancher trudged back to the house  wade it was bully of you exclaimed jack gratefully you see how quick dads ready to jump me ill bet he thought id picked a shootingscrape with one of the cowboys  well hes gettin old an testy replied wade you ought to humor him hell not be here always  belllounds answered to that suggestion with a shadowing of eyes and look of realization affection remorse feelings seemed to have a quick rise and play in him but were not lasting wade casually studied him weighing his impressions holding them in abeyance for a sum of judgment  belllounds has anybody told you about wils moore bein bad hurt abruptly asked the hunter  he is is he replied jack and to his voice and face came sudden change how bad  i reckon hell be a cripple for life answered wade seriously and now he stopped in his work to peer at belllounds the next moment might be critical for that young man  clubfooted he wont lord it over the cowboys any moreor ride that white mustang the softer weaker expression of his face that which gave him some title to good looks changed to an ugliness hard for wade to define since it was neither glee nor joy nor gratification over his rivals misfortune it was rush of blood to eyes and skin a heated change that somehow to wade suggested an anxious selfish hunger belllounds lacked something that seemed certain but it remained to be proved how deserving he was of wades pity  belllounds it was a dirty trickyour jumpin moore declared wade with deliberation  the hell you say belllounds flared up with scarlet in his face with sneer of amaze with promise of bursting rage he slammed down the gun  yes the hell i say returned the hunter they call me hellbent wade  are you friends with moore asked belllounds beginning to shake  yes im that with every one id like to be friends with you  i dont want you and im giving you noticeyou wont last long at white slides  neither will you  belllounds turned dead white not apparently from fury or fear but from a shock that had its birth within the deep mysterious emotional reachings of his mind he was utterly astounded as if confronting a vague terrible premonition of the future wades swift words like the ring of bells had not been menacing but prophetic  young fellar you need to be talked to so if youve got any sense at all itll get a wedge in your brain went on wade im a stranger here but i happen to be a man who sees through things an i see how your dad handles you wrong you dont know who i am an you dont care but if youll listen youll learn what might help you no boy can answer to all his wild impulses without ruinin himself its not natural there are other peoplepeople who have wills an desires same as you have youve got to live with people heres your dad an miss columbine an the cowboys an me an all the ranchers so down to kremmlin an other places these are the people youve got to live with you cant go on as youve begun without ruinin yourself an your dad an thethe girl its never too late to begin to be better i know that but it gets too late sometimes to save the happiness of others now i see where youre headin as clear as if i had pictures of the future ive got a gift that way an belllounds youll not last unless you begin to control your temper to forget yourself to kill your wild impulses to be kind to learn what love isyoull never last in the very nature of things one comin after another like your fights with moore an your scarin of pronto an your drinkin at kremmlin an just now your rarin at meits in the very nature of life that goin on so youll sooner or later meet with hell youve got to change belllounds no halfway spoiledboy changin but the straight rightaboutface of a man it means you must see youre no good an have a change of heart men have revolutions like that i was no good i did worse than youll ever do because youre not big enough to be really bad an yet ive turned out worth livin there im through an im offerin to be your friend an to help you  belllounds stood with arms spread outside the door still astounded still pale but as the long admonition and appeal ended he exploded stridently who the hell are you if i hadnt been so surprisedif id had a chance to get a word inid shut your trap are you a preacher masquerading here as hunter let me tell you i wont be talked to like thatnot by any man keep your advice an friendship to yourself  you dont want me then  no belllounds snapped  reckon you dont need either advice or friend hey  no you owleyed softvoiced fool yelled belllounds  it was then wade felt a singular and familiar sensation a cold creeping thing physical and elemental that had not visited him since he had been at white slides  i reckoned so he said with low and gloomy voice and he knew if belllounds did not know that he was not acquiescing with the others harsh epithet but only greeting the advent of something in himself  belllounds shrugged his burly shoulders and slouched away  wade finished his dressing of the meat then he rode up to spend an hour with moore when he returned to his cabin he proceeded to change his hunter garb for the best he owned it was a proof of his unusual preoccupation that he did this before he fed the hounds it was sunset when he left his cabin montana jim and lem hailed as he went by wade paused to listen to their goodnatured raillery  see hyar bent this aint sunday said lem  youre spruced up powerful fine whats it fer added montana  boss asked me down to supper  wal you lucky sonofagun an hyar weve no invite returned lem say wade i heerd buster jack roarin at you i was ridin in by the storehouse who the hell are you was what collared my attention an i had to laugh an i listened to all he said so you was offerin him advice an friendship  i reckon  wal all i say is thet you was wastin yore breath declared lem youre a queer fellar wade  queer aw lem he aint queer said montana hes jest white wade i feel the same as you id like to do somethin fer thet locoed buster jack  montana youre the locoed one rejoined lem buster jack knows what hes doin he can play a slicker hand of poker than you  wal mebbe wade do you play poker  id hate to take your money replied wade  you neednt be so allfired kind about thet come over tonight an take some of it buster jack invited himself up to our bunk hes itchin fer cards so we says shore bluds goin to sit in now you come an make it fivehanded  wouldnt young belllounds object to me  what buster jack shy at gamblin with you not much hes a born gambler hed bet with his grandmother an hed cheat the coppers off a dead niggers eyes  slick with cards eh inquired wade  naw jacks not slick but he tries to be an we jest go him one slicker  wouldnt old bill object to this cardplayin  hed be oryeyed but by golly were not leadin jack astray an we aint hankerin to play with him all the same a little game is welcome enough  ill come over replied wade and thoughtfully turned away  when he presented himself at the ranchhouse it was columbine who let him in she was prettily dressed in a way he had never seen her before and his heart throbbed her smile her voice added to her nameless charm that seemed to come from the past her look was eager and longing as if his presence might bring something welcome to her  then the rancher stalked in hullo wade suppers most ready whats this trouble you had with jack he says he wont eat with you  i was offerin him advice replied wade  what on  reckon on general principles  humph wal he told me you harangued him till you was black in the face an  jack had it wrong he got black in the face interrupted wade  did you say he was a spoiled boy an thet he was no good an was headin plumb fer hell  that was a little of what i said returned wade gently  ahuh howd thet come about queried belllounds gruffly a slight stiffening and darkening overcast his face  wade then recalled and recounted the remarks that had passed between him and jack and he did not think he missed them very far he had a great curiosity to see how belllounds would take them and especially the young mans scornful rejection of a sincerely offered friendship all the time wade was talking he was aware of columbine watching him and when he finished it was sweet to look at her  wade wasnt you takin a lot on yourself queried the rancher plainly displeased  reckon i was but my conscience is beholden to no man if jack had met me halfway that would have been better for him an for me because i get good out of helpin any one  his reply silenced belllounds no more was said before supper was announced and then the rancher seemed taciturn columbine did the serving and most all of the talking wade felt strangely at ease some subtle difference was at work in him transforming him but the moment had not yet come for him to question himself he enjoyed the supper and when he ventured to look up at columbine to see her strong capable hands and her warm blue glance glad for his presence sweetly expressive of their common secret and darker with a shadow of meaning beyond her power to guess then wade felt havoc within him the strife and pain and joy of the truth he never could reveal for he could never reveal his identity to her without betraying his baseness to her mother otherwise to hear her call him father would have been earning that happiness with a lie besides she loved belllounds as her father and were this trouble of the present removed she would grow still closer to the old man in his declining days wade accepted the inevitable she must never know if she might love him it must be as the stranger who came to her gates it must be through the mysterious affinity between them and through the service he meant to render  wade did not linger after the meal was ended despite the fact that belllounds recovered his cordiality it was dark when he went out columbine followed him talking cheerfully once outside she squeezed his hand and whispered hows wilson  the hunter nodded his reply and pausing at the porch step he pressed her hand to make his assurance stronger his reward was instant in the bright starlight she stood white and eloquent staring down at him with dark wide eyes  presently she whispered oh my friend it wants only three days till october first  lass it might be a thousand years for all you need worry he replied his voice low and full then it seemed as she flung up her arms that she was about to embrace him but her gesture was an appeal to the stars to heaven above for something she did not speak  wade bade her good night and went his way                                       the cowboys and the ranchers son were about to engage in a game of poker when wade entered the dimly lighted smokehazed room montana jim was sticking tallow candles in the middle of a rude table lem was searching his clothes manifestly for money bludsoe shuffled a greasy deck of cards and jack belllounds was filling his pipe before a fire of blazing logs on the hearth  doggone it i hed more money n thet complained lem jim you rode to kremmlin last did you take my money  wal come to think of it i reckon i did replied jim in surprise at the recollection  an whars it now  pard i aint no idee i reckon its still in kremmlin but ill pay you back  i should smile you will pony up now  bent wade did you come over calkilated to git skinned queried bludsoe  boys i was playin poker tolerable well in missouri when you all was nursin replied wade imperturbably  i heerd he was a cardsharp said jim wal grab a box or a chair to set on an lets start come along jack you dont look as keen to play as usual  belllounds stood with his back to the fire and his manner did not compare favorably with that of the genial cowboys  i prefer to play fourhanded he said  this declaration caused a little check in the conversation and put an end to the amiability the cowboys looked at one another not embarrassed but just a little taken aback as if they had forgotten something that they should have remembered  you object to my playin asked wade quietly  i certainly do replied belllounds  why may i ask  for all i know what montana said about you may be true returned belllounds insolently  such a remark flung in the face of a westerner was an insult the cowboys suddenly grew stiff with steady eyes on wade he however did not change in the slightest  i might be a cardsharp at that he replied coolly you fellows play without me im not carin about poker any more ill look on  thus he carried over the moment that might have been dangerous lem gaped at him montana kicked a box forward to sit upon and his action was expressive bludsoe slammed the cards down on the table and favored wade with a comprehending look belllounds pulled a chair up to the table  whatll we make the limit asked jim  two bits replied lem quickly  then began an argument belllounds was for a dollar limit the cowboys objected  why jack if the ole man got on to us playin a dollar limit hed fire the outfit protested bludsoe  this reasonable objection in no wise influenced the old mans son he overruled the good arguments and then hinted at the cowboys lack of nerve the fun faded out of their faces lem in fact grew red  wal if were agoin to gamble thets different he said with a cold ring in his voice as he straddled a box and sat down wade lemme some money  wade slipped his hand into his pocket and drew forth a goodly handful of gold which he handed to the cowboy not improbably if this large amount had been shown earlier before the change in the sentiment lem would have looked aghast and begged for mercy as it was he accepted it as if he were accustomed to borrowing that much every day belllounds had rendered futile the easygoing friendly advances of the cowboys as he had made it impossible to play a jolly little game for fun  the game began with wade standing up looking on these boys did not know what a vast store of poker knowledge lay back of wades inscrutable eyes as a boy he had learned the intricacies of poker in the country where it originated and as a man he had played it with piles of yellow coins and guns on the table his eagerness to look on here as far as the cowboys were concerned was mere pretense in bellloundss case however he had a profound interest rumors had drifted to him from time to time since his advent at white slides regarding bellloundss weakness for gambling it might have been cowboy gossip wade held that there was nothing in the west as well calculated to test a boy to prove his real character as a game of poker  belllounds was a feverish better an exultant winner a poor loser his understanding of the game was rudimentary with him the strong feeling beginning to be manifested to wade was not the fun of matching wits and luck with his antagonists nor a desire to accumulate moneyfor his recklessness disproved thatbut the liberation of the gambling passion wade recognized that when he met it and jack belllounds was not in any sense big he was selfish and grasping in the numberless little ways common to the game and positive about his own rights while doubtful of the claims of others his cheating was clumsy and crude he held out cards hiding them in his palm he shuffled the deck so he left aces at the bottom and these he would slip off to himself and he was so blind that he could not detect his fellowplayer in tricks as transparent as his own wade was amazed and disgusted the pity he had felt for belllounds shifted to the old father who believed in his son with stubborn and unquenchable faith  havent you got something to drink jack asked of his companions  nope whard we git it replied jim  belllounds evidently forgot for presently he repeated the query the cowboys shook their heads wade knew they were lying for they did have liquor in the cabin it occurred to him then to offer to go to his own cabin for some just to see what this young man would say but he refrained  the luck went against belllounds and so did the gambling he was not a lamb among wolves by any means but the fleecing he got suggested that according to wade he was getting what he deserved no cowboys even such goodnatured and fine fellows as these could be expected to be subjects for bellloundss cupidity and they won all he had  ill borrow he said with feverish impatience his face was pale clammy yet heated especially round the swollen bruises his eyes stood out bold dark rolling and glaring full of sullen fire but more than anything else his mouth betrayed the weakling the born gambler the selfcentered spoiled intolerant youth it was here his bad blood showed  wal i aint lendin money replied lem as he assorted his winnings wade heres what you staked me an much obliged  im out an i cant lend you any said jim  bludsoe had a good share of the profits of that quick game but he made no move to lend any of it belllounds glared impatiently at them  hell you took my money ill have satisfaction he broke out almost shouting  we won it didnt we rejoined lem cool and easy an you can have all the satisfaction you want right now or any time  wade held out a handful of money to belllounds  here he said with his deep eyes gleaming in the dim room wade had made a gamble with himself and it was that belllounds would not even hesitate to take money  come on you stingy cowpunchers he called out snatching the money from wade his action then violent and vivid as it was did not reveal any more than his face  but the cowboys showed amaze and something more they fell straightway to gambling sharper and fiercer than before actuated now by the flaming spirit of this son of belllounds luck misleading and alluring favored jack for a while transforming him until he was radiant boastful exultant then it changed as did his expression his face grew dark  i tell you i want drink he suddenly demanded i know damn well you cowpunchers have some here for i smelled it when i came in  jack we drank the last drop replied jim who seemed less stiff than his two bunkmates  ive some very old rye interposed wade looking at jim but apparently addressing all fine stuff but awful strong an hot makes a fellows blood dance  go get it bellloundss utterance was thick and full as if he had something in his mouth  wade looked down into the heated face into the burning eyes and through the darkness of passion that brooked no interference with its fruition he saw this youths stark and naked soul wade had seen into the depths of many such abysses  see hyar wade broke in jim with his quiet force never mind fetchin thet redhot rye tonight some other time mebbe when jack wants more satisfaction reckon weve got a drop or so left  all right boys replied wade ill be sayin good night  he left them playing and strode out to return to his cabin the night was still cold starlit and black in the shadows a lonesome coyote barked to be answered by a wakeful hound wade halted at his porch and lingered there a moment peering up at the gray old peak bare and starcrowned  im sorry for the old man muttered the hunter but id see jack belllounds in hell before id let columbine marry him                                       october first was a holiday at white slides ranch it happened to be a glorious autumn day with the sunlight streaming gold and amber over the grassy slopes far off the purple ranges loomed hauntingly  wade had come down from wilson moores cabin his ears ringing with the crippled boys words of poignant fear  fox favored his master with unusually knowing gaze there was not going to be any lionchasing or elkhunting this day something was in the wind and fox as a privileged dog manifested his interest and wonder  before noon a buckboard with team of sweating horses halted in the yard of the ranchhouse besides the driver it contained two women whom belllounds greeted as relatives and a stranger a pale man whose dark garb proclaimed him a minister  come right in folks welcomed belllounds with hearty excitement  it was wade who showed the driver where to put the horses strangely not a cowboy was in sight an omission of duty the rancher had noted wade might have informed him where they were  the door of the big livingroom stood open and from it came the sound of laughter and voices wade who had returned to his seat on the end of the porch listened to them while his keen gaze seemed fixed down the lane toward the cabins how intent must he have been not to hear columbines step behind him  good morning ben she said  wade wheeled as if internal violence had ordered his movement  lass good mornin he replied you sure look sweet this october firstlike the flower for which youre named  my friend it is october firstmy marriage day murmured columbine  wade felt her intensity and he thrilled to the brave sweet resignation of her face hope and faith were unquenchable in her yet she had fortified herself to the wreck of dreams and love  id seen you before now but i had some job with wils persuadin him that wed not have to offer you congratulations yet awhile replied wade in his slow gentle voice  oh breathed columbine  wade saw her full breast swell and the leaping blood wave over her pale face she bent to him to see his eyes and for wade when she peered with straining heart and soul all at once to become transfigured that instant was a sweet and allfulfilling reward for his years of pain  you drive me mad she whispered  the heavy tread of the rancher like the last of successive steps of fate in wades tragic expectancy sounded on the porch  wal lass hyar you are he said with a gladness deep in his voice now whars the boy  dadive notseen jack since breakfast replied columbine tremulously  sort of a laggard in love on his weddinday rejoined the rancher his gladness and forgetfulness were as big as his heart wade have you seen jack  noi havent replied the hunter with slow longdrawn utterance buti seehim now  wade pointed to the figure of jack belllounds approaching from the direction of the cabins he was not walking straight  old man belllounds shot out his gray head like a striking eagle  what the hell he muttered as if bewildered at this strange uneven gait of his son wade whats the matter with jack  wade did not reply that moment had its sorrow for him as well as understanding of the wonder expressed by columbines cold little hand trembling in his  the rancher suddenly recoiled  so help me gawdhes drunk he gasped in a distress that unmanned him  then the parson and the invited relatives came out upon the porch with gay voices and laughter that suddenly stilled when old belllounds cried brokenly lassgointhe house  but columbine did not move and wade felt her shaking as she leaned against him  the bridegroom approached drunk indeed he was not hilariously as one who celebrated his good fortune but sullenly tragically hideously drunk  old belllounds leaped off the porch his gray hair stood up like the mane of a lion like a giants were his strides with a lunge he met his reeling son swinging a huge fist into the sodden red face limply jack fell to the ground  lay there you damned prodigal he roared terrible in his rage you disgrace mean you disgrace the girl whos been a daughter to me if you ever have another weddinday itll not be me who sets it    chapter xii  november was well advanced before there came indications that winter was near at hand  one morning when wade rode up to moores cabin the whole world seemed obscured in a dense gray fog through which he could not see a rod ahead of him later as he left the fog had lifted shoulderhigh to the mountains and was breaking to let the blue sky show another morning it was worse and apparently thicker and grayer as wade climbed the trail up toward the mountainbasin where he hunted most these days he expected the fog to lift but it did not the trail under the hoofs of the horse was scarcely perceptible to him and he seemed lost in a dense gray soundless obscurity  suddenly wade emerged from out the fog into brilliant sunshine in amaze he halted this phenomenon was new to him he was high up on the mountainside the summit of which rose clearcut and bold into the sky below him spread what resembled a white sea it was an immense cloudbank filling all the valleys as if with creamy foam or snow soft thick motionless contrasting vividly with the blue sky above old white slides stood out gray and bleak and brilliant as if it were an island rock in a rolling sea of fleece far across this strange level cloudfloor rose the black line of the range wade watched the scene with a kind of rapture he was alone on the heights there was not a sound the winds were stilled but there seemed a mighty being awake all around him in the presence of which wade felt how little were his sorrows and hopes  another day brought dullgray scudding clouds and gusts of wind and squalls of rain and a wailing through the bare aspens it grew colder and bleaker and darker rain changed to sleet and sleet to snow that night brought winter  next morning when wade plodded up to moores cabin it was through two feet of snow a beautiful glistening white mantle covered valley and slope and mountain transforming all into a world too dazzlingly brilliant for the unprotected gaze of man  when wade pushed open the door of the cabin and entered he awakened the cowboy  mornin wils drawled wade as he slapped the snow from boots and legs summer has gone winter has come an the flowers lay in their graves how are you boy  moore had grown paler and thinner during his long confinement in bed a weary shade shone in his face and a shadow of pain in his eyes but the spirit of his smile was the same as always  hello bent old pard replied moore i guess im fine nearly froze last night didnt sleep much  well i was worried about that said the hunter weve got to arrange things somehow  i heard it snowing gee how the wind howled and im snowed in  sure are two feet on a level its good i snaked down a lot of firewood now ill set to work an cut it up an stack it round the cabin reckon id better sleep up here with you wils  wont old bill make a kick  let him kick but i reckon he doesnt need to know anythin about it it is cold in here well ill soon warm it up heres some letters lem got at kremmlin the other day you read while i rustle some grub for you  moore scanned the addresses on the several envelopes and sighed  from home i hate to read them  why queried wade  oh because when i wrote i didnt tell them i was hurt i feel like a liar  its just as well wils because you swear youll not go home  me i should smile not bentiihoped collie might answer the note you took her from me  not yet wils give the lass time  time heavens its three weeks and more  go ahead an read your letters or ill knock you on the head with one of these chunks ordered wade mildly  the hunter soon had the room warm and cheerful with steaming breakfast on the redhot coals presently when he made ready to serve moore he was surprised to find the boy crying over one of the letters  wils whats the trouble he asked  oh nothing iijust feel bad thats all replied moore  ahuh so it seems well tell me about it  pard my fatherhas forgiven me  the old sonofagun good what for you never told me youd done anythin  i knowbut i diddo a lot i was sixteen then we quarreled and i ran off up here to punch cows but after a while i wrote home to mother and my sister since then theyve tried to coax me to come home this letters from the old man himself gee well he says hes had to knuckle that hes ready to forgive me but i must come home and take charge of his ranch isnt that great only i cant go and i couldnti couldnt ever ride a horse againif i did go  who says you couldnt queried wade i never said so i only said youd never be a broncobustin cowboy again well suppose youre not youll be able to ride a little if i can save that leg boy your letter is damn good news im sure glad that will make collie happy  the cowboy had a better appetite that morning which fact mitigated somewhat the burden of wades worry there was burden enough however and wade had set this day to make important decisions about moores injured foot he had dreaded to remove the last dressing because conditions at that time had been unimproved he had done all he could to ward off the threatened gangrene  wils im goin to look at your foot an tell you things declared wade when the dreaded time could be put off no longer  go ahead and pard if you say my leg has to be cut offwhy just pass me my gun  the cowboys voice was gay and bantering but his eyes were alight with a spirit that frightened the hunter  ahuh i know how you feel but boy id rather live with one leg an be loved by collie belllounds than have nine legs for some other lass  wilson moore groaned his helplessness  damn you bent wade you always say what kills me of course i would  well lie quiet now an let me look at this poor messedup foot  wades deft fingers did not work with the usual precision and speed natural to them but at last moores injured member lay bare discolored and misshapen the first glance made the hunter quicker in his movements closer in his scrutiny then he yelled his joy  boy its better no sign of gangrene well save your leg  pard i never feared id lose that all ive feared was that id be clubfooted let me look replied the cowboy and he raised himself on his elbow wade lifted the unsightly foot  my god its crooked cried moore passionately wade its healed itll stay that way always i cant move it oh but buster jacks ruined me  the hunter pushed him back with gentle hands wils it might have been worse  but i never gave up hope replied moore in poignant grief i couldnt but now how can you look at thatthat clubfoot and not swear  well well boy cussin wont do any good now lay still an let me work youve had lots of good news this mornin so i think you can stand to hear a little bad news  what bad news queried moore with a start  i reckon now listen the reason collie hasnt answered your note is because shes been sick in bed for three weeks  oh no exclaimed the cowboy in amaze and distress  yes an im her doctor replied wade with pride first off they had mrs andrews an collie kept askin for me she was out of her head you know an soon as i took charge she got better  heavens collie ill and you never told me cried moore i cant believe it shes so healthy and strong what ailed her bent  well mrs andrews said it was nervous breakdown an old bill was afraid of consumption an jack belllounds swore she was only shammin  the cowboy cursed violently  herei wont tell you any more if youre goin to cuss that way an jerk around protested wade  iill shut up appealed moore  well that puddinhead jack is moren you called him if you care to hear my opinion now wils the fact is that none of them know what ails collie but i know shed been under a high strain leadin up to october first an the way that weddinday turned outwith old bill layin jack cold an with no marriage at allwhy collie had a shock an after that she seemed pale an tired all the time an she didnt eat right well when buster jack got over that awful punch hed got from the old man he made up to collie harder than ever she didnt tell me then but i saw it an she couldnt avoid him except by stayin in her room which she did a good deal then jack showed a streak of bein decent he surprised everybody even collie he delighted old bill but he didnt pull the wool over my eyes he was like a boy spoilin for a new toy an he got crazy over collie hes sure terribly in love with her an for days he behaved himself in a way calculated to make up for his drinkin too much it shows he can behave himself when he wants to i mean he can control his temper an impulse anyway he made himself so good that old bill changed his mind after what he swore that day an set another day for the weddin right off then collie goes down on her back they didnt send for me very soon but when i did get to see her an felt the way she grabbed meas if she was drowninthen i knew what ailed her it was love  love gasped moore breathlessly  sure jest love for a doggone lucky cowboy named wils moore her heart was breakin an shed have died but for me dont imagine wils that people cant die of broken hearts they do i know well all collie needed was me an i cured her ravin and made her eat an now shes comin along fine  wade ive believed in heaven since you came down to white slides burst out moore with shining eyes but tell mewhat did you tell her  well my particular medicine first off was to whisper in her ear that shed never have to marry jack belllounds an after that i gave her daily doses of talk about you  pard she loves mestill he whispered  wils hers is the kind that grows stronger with time i know  moore strained in his intensity of emotion and he clenched his fists and gritted his teeth  oh god thiss hard on me he cried im a man i love that girl more than life and to know shes suffering for love of mefor fear of that marriage being forced upon herto know that while i lie here a helpless crippleits almost unbearable  boy youve got to mend now weve the best of hope nowfor youfor herfor everythin  wade i think i love you too said the cowboy youre saving me from madness somehow i have faith in youto do whatever you want but how could you tell collie shed never have to marry buster jack  because i know she never will replied wade with his slow gentle smile  you know that  sure  how on earth can you prevent it belllounds will never give up planning that marriage for his son jack will nag collie till she cant call her soul her own between them they will wear her down my friend how can you prevent it  wils fact is i havent reckoned out how im goin to save collie but thats no matter sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof i will do it you can gamble on me wils you must use that hope an faith to help you get well for we mustnt forget that youre in more danger than collie  i will gamble on youmy lifemy very soul replied moore fervently by heaven ill be the man i might have been ill rise out of despair ill even reconcile myself to being a cripple  an wils will you rise above hate asked wade softly  hate hate of whom  jack belllounds  the cowboy stared and his lean pale face contracted  pard you wouldntyou couldnt expect me toto forgive him  no i reckon not but you neednt hate him i dont an i reckon ive some reason more than you could guess wils hate is a poison in the blood its worse for him who feels it than for him against whom it rages i know well if you put thought of jack out of your mindquit broodin over what he did to youan realize that hes not to blame youll overcome your hate for the son of old bill is to be pitied yes jack belllounds needs pity he was ruined before he was born he never should have been born an i want you to understand that an stop hatin him will you try  wade youre afraid ill kill him whispered moore  sure thats it im afraid you might an consider how hard that would be for columbine she an jack were raised sister an brother almost it would be hard on her you see collie has a strange an powerful sense of duty to old bill if you killed jack it would likely kill the old man an collie would suffer all her life you couldnt cure her of that you want her to be happy  i doi do wade i swear ill never kill buster jack and for collies sake ill try not to hate him  well thats fine im sure glad to hear you promise that now ill go out an chop some wood we mustnt let the fire go out any more  pard ill write another notea letter to collie hand me the blankbook there and my pencil and dont hurry with the wood  wade went outdoors with his twobladed ax and shovel the woodpile was a great mound of snow he cleaned a wide space and a path to the side of the cabin working in snow was not unpleasant for him he liked the cleanness the whiteness the absolute purity of newfallen snow the air was crisp and nipping the frost crackled under his feet the smoke from his pipe seemed no thicker than the steam from his breath the ax rang on the hard aspens wade swung this implement like a born woodsman the chips flew and the dead wood smelled sweet some logs he chopped into threefoot pieces others he chopped and split when he tired a little of swinging the ax he carried the cut pieces to the cabin and stacked them near the door now and then he would halt a moment to gaze away across the whitened slopes and rolling hills the sense of his physical power matched something within and his heart warmed with more than the vigorous exercise  when he had worked thus for about two hours and had stacked a pile of wood almost as large as the cabin he considered it sufficient for the day so he went indoors moore was so busily and earnestly writing that he did not hear wade come in his face wore an eloquent glow  say wils are you writin a book he inquired  hello sure i am but im most done now if columbine doesnt answer this   by the way ill have two letters to give her thenfor i never gave her the first one replied wade  you sonofagun  well hurry along boy ill be goin now heres a pole ive fetched in you keep it there where you can reach it an when the fire needs more wood you roll one of these logs on ill be up tonight before dark an if i dont fetch you a letter itll be because i cant persuade collie to write  pard if you bring me a letter ill obey youill lie stillill sleepill stand anything  ahuh then ill fetch one replied wade as he took the little book and deposited it in his pocket goodby now an think of your good news that come with the snow  goodby heavensent hellbent wade called moore its no joke of a name any more its a fact  wade plodded down through the deep snow stepping in his old tracks and as he toiled on his thoughts were deep and comforting he was thinking that if he had his life to live over again he would begin at once to find happiness in other peoples happiness upon arriving at his cabin he set to work cleaning a path to the dog corral the snow had drifted there and he had no easy task it was well that he had built an inclosed house for the hounds to winter in such a heavy snow as this one would put an end to hunting for the time being the ranch had ample supply of deer bear and elk meat all solidly frozen this morning that would surely keep well until used wade reflected that his tasks round the ranch would be feeding hounds and stock chopping wood and doing such chores as came along in wintertime the pack of hounds which he had thinned out to a smaller number would be a care on his hands kane had become a muchprized possession of columbines and lived at the house where he had things his own way and always greeted wade with a look of disdain and distrust kane would never forgive the hand that had hurt him sampson and jim and fox of course shared wades cabin and vociferously announced his return  early in the afternoon wade went down to the ranchhouse the snow was not so deep there having blown considerably in the open places some one was pounding iron in the blacksmith shop horses were cavorting in the corrals cattle were bawling round the hayricks in the barnyard  the hunter knocked on columbines door  come in she called  wade entered to find her alone she was sitting up in bed propped up with pillows and she wore a warm woolly jacket or dressinggown her paleness was now marked and the shadows under her eyes made them appear large and mournful  ben wade you dont care for me any more she exclaimed reproachfully  why not lass he asked  you were so long in coming she replied now with petulance i guess now i dont want you at all  ahuh thats the reward of people who worry an work for others well then i reckon ill go back an not give you what i brought  he made a pretense of leaving and he put a hand to his pocket as if to insure the safety of some article columbine blushed she held out her hands she was repentant of her words and curious as to his  why ben wade i count the minutes before you come she said whatd you bring me  whos been in here he asked going forward thats a poor fire ill have to fix it  mrs andrews just left it was good of her to drive up she came in the sled she said oh ben its winter there was snow on my bed when i woke up i think i am better today jack hasnt been in here yet  at this wade laughed and columbine followed suit  well you look a little sassy today which i take is a good sign said wade ive got some news that will come near to makin you well  oh tell it quick she cried  wils wont lose his leg its gettin well an there was a letter from his father forgivin him for somethin he never told me  my prayers were answered whispered columbine and she closed her eyes tight  an his father wants him to come home to run the ranch went on wade  oh her eyes popped open with sudden fright but he canthe wont go  i reckon not he wouldnt if he could but some day he will an take you home with him  columbine covered her face with her hands and was silent a moment  such prophecies theythey she could not conclude  ahuh i know the strange fact is lass that they all come true i wish i had all happy ones instead of them black croakin ones that come like ravens well youre better today  yes oh yes ben what have you got for me  youre in an awful hurry i want to talk to you an if i show what ive got then there will be no talkin you say jack hasnt been in today  not yet thank goodness  how about old bill  ben you never call him my dad i wish you would when you dont it always reminds me that hes really not my dad  ahuh well well replied wade with his head bowed it is just queer i can never remember an how was he today  for a wonder he didnt mention poor me he was full of talk about going to kremmling means to take jack along do you know ben dad cant fool me hes afraid to leave jack here alone with me so dad talked a lot about selling stock an buying supplies and how he needed jack to go and so forth im mighty glad he means to take him but my wont jack be sore  i reckon its time he broke out  and now dear benwhat have you got for me i know its from wilson she coaxed  lass would you give much for a little note from wils asked wade teasingly  would i when ive been hoping and praying for just that  well if youd give so much for a note how much would you give me for a whole bookful that took wils two hours to write  ben oh idid give she cried wild with delight id kiss you  you mean it he queried waving the book aloft  mean it come here  there was fun in this for wade but also a deep and beautiful emotion that quivered through him bending over her he placed the little book in her hand he did not see clearly then as she pulled him lower and kissed him on the cheek generously with sweet frank gratitude and affection  moments strong and allsatisfying had been multiplying for bent wade of late but this one magnified all as he sat back upon the chair he seemed a little husky of voice  well well an so you kissed ugly old bent wade  yes and ive wanted to do it before she retorted the dark excitation in her eyes the flush of her pale cheeks made her beautiful then  lass now you read your letter an answer it you can tear out the pages ill sit here an be makin out to be readin aloud out of this book here if any one happens in suddenlike  oh how you think of everything  the hunter sat beside her pretending to be occupied with the book he had taken from the table when really he was stealing glances at her face indeed she was more than pretty then illness and pain had enhanced the sweetness of her expression as she read on it was manifest that she had forgotten the hunters presence she grew pink rosy scarlet radiant and wade thrilled with her as she thrilled loved her more and more as she loved moore must have written words of enchantment wades hungry heart suffered a pang of jealousy but would not harbor it he read in her perusal of that letter what no other dreamed of not even the girl herself and it was certitude of tragic and brief life for her if she could not live for wilson moore those moments of watching her were unutterably precious to wade he saw how some divine guidance had directed his footsteps to this home how many years had it taken him to get there columbine read and read and rereada girl with her first loveletter and for wade with his keen eyes that seemed to see the senses and the soul there shone something infinite through her rapture never until that unguarded moment had he divined her innocence nor had any conception been given him of the exquisite torture of her maiden fears or the havoc of love fighting for itself he learned then much of the mystery and meaning of a womans heart    chapter xiii  dear wilsonthe note and letter from you have taken my breath away i couldnt telli wouldnt dare tell how they made me feel  your good news fills me with joy and when ben told me you wouldnt lose your legthat you would get wellthen my eyes filled and my heart choked me and i thanked god whod answered my prayers after all the heartache and dread its so wonderful to find things not so terrible as they seemed oh i am thankful you have only to take care of yourself now to lie patiently and wait and obey ben and soon the time will have flown by and you will be well again maybe after all your foot will not be so bad maybe you can ride again if not so wonderfully as before then well enough to ride on your fathers range and look after his stock for wilson dear youll have to go home its your duty your father must be getting old now he needs you he has forgiven youyou bad boy and you are very lucky it almost kills me to think of your leaving white slides but that is selfish im going to learn to be like ben wade he never thinks of himself  rest assured wilson that i will never marry jack belllounds it seems years since that awful october first i gave my word then and i would have lived up to it but ive changed im older i see things differently i love dad as well i feel as sorry for jack belllounds i still think i might help him i still believe in my duty to his father but i cant marry him it would be a sin i have no right to marry a man whom i do not love when it comes to thought of his touching me then i hate him duty toward dad is one thing and i hold it high but that is not reason enough for a woman to give herself some duty to myself is higher than that its hard for me to tell youfor me to understand love of you has opened my eyes still i dont think its love of you that makes me selfish im true to something in me that i never knew before i could marry jack loving you and utterly sacrifice myself if it were right but it would be wrong i never realized this until you kissed me since then the thought of anything that approaches personal relationsany hint of intimacy with jack fills me with disgust  so im not engaged to jack belllounds and im never going to be there will be trouble here i feel it i see it coming dad keeps at me persistently he grows older i dont think hes failing but then theres a loss of memory and an almost childish obsession in regard to the marriage he has set his heart on then his passion for jack seems greater as he learns little by little that jack is not all he might be wilson i give you my word i believe if dad ever really sees jack as i see him or you see him then something dreadful will happen in spite of everything dad still believes in jack its beautiful and terrible thats one reason why ive wanted to help jack well its not to be every day every hour jack belllounds grows farther from me he and his father will try to persuade me to consent to this marriage they may even try to force me but in that way ill be as hard and as cold as old white slides no never for the rest ill do my duty to dad ill stick to him i could not engage myself to you no matter how much i love you and thats more every minute so dont mention taking me to your homedont ask me again please wilson your asking shook my very soul oh how sweet that would beyour wife but if dad turns me awayi dont think he would yet hes so strange and like iron for all concerning jack if ever he turned me out id have no home im a waif you know thenthen wilson  oh its horrible to be in the position im in i wont say any more youll understand dear  its your love that awoke me and its ben wade who has saved me wilson i love him almost as i do dad only strangely do you know i believe he had something to do with jack getting drunk that awful october first i dont mean ben would stoop to get jack drunk but he might have cunningly put that opportunity in jacks way drink is jacks weakness as gambling is his passion well i know that the liquor was some fine old stuff which ben gave to the cowboys and its significant now how jack avoids ben he hates him hes afraid of him hes jealous because ben is so much with me ive heard jack rave to dad about this but dad is just to others if he cant be to his son  and so i want you to know that its ben wade who has saved me since ive been sick ive learned more of ben hes like a woman he understands i never have to tell him anything you wilson were sometimes stupid or stubborn forgive me about little things that girls feel but cant explain ben knows i tell you this because i want you to understand how and why i love him i think i love him most for his goodness to you dear boy if i hadnt loved you before ben wade came id have fallen in love with you since just listening to his talk of you but this will make you conceited so ill go on about ben hes our friend why wilson that sweetness softness gentleness about him the heart that makes him love us that must be only the woman in him i dont know what a mother would feel like but i do know that i seem strangely happier since ive confessed my troubles to this man it was lem who told me how ben offered to be a friend to jack and jack flouted him ive a queer notion that the moment jack did this he turned his back on a better life  to repeat then ben wade is our friend and to me something more that ive tried to explain maybe telling you this will make you think more of him and listen to his advice i hope so did any boy and girl ever before so need a friend i need that something he instils in me if i lost it id be miserable and wilson im such a coward im so weak i have such sinkings and burnings and tossings oh im only a woman but ill die fighting that is what ben wade instils into me while there was life this strange little man would never give up hope he makes me feel that he knows more than he tells through him i shall get the strength to live up to my convictions to be true to myself to be faithful to you       with love           columbine       december 3d  dearest collieyour last was only a note and i told wade if he didnt fetch more than a note next time there would be trouble round this bunkhouse and then he brought your letter  im feeling exuberant i think its that today first time ive been up collie im able to get up whoopee i walk with a crutch and dont dare put my foot down not that it hurts but that my boss would have a fit im glad youve stopped heaping praise upon our friend ben because now i can get over my jealousy and be half decent hes the whitest man i ever knew  now listen collie ive had ideas lately ive begun to eat and get stronger and to feel good the pain is gone and to think i swore to wade id forgive jack belllounds and never hate himor kill him there thats letting the cat out of the bag and its done now but no matter the truth is though that i never could stop hating jack while the pain lasted now i could shake hands with him and smile at him  well as i said ive ideas theyre great grab hold of the pommel now so you wont get thrown im going to pitch when i get wellable to ride and go about which ben says will be in the springill send for my father to come to white slides hell come then ill tell him everything and if ben and i cant win him to our side then you can father never could resist you when he has fallen in love with you which wont take long then well go to old bill belllounds and lay the case before him are you still in the saddle collie  well if you are be sure to get a better hold for im going to run some next ben wade approved of my plan he says belllounds can be brought to reason he says he can make him see the ruin for everybody were you forced to marry jack strange collie how wade included himself with you me jack and the old man in the foreshadowed ruin wade is as deep as the cañon there sometimes when hes thoughtful he gives me a creepy feeling at others when he comes out with one of his easy cool assurances that we are all rightthat we will get each otherwhy then something grim takes possession of me i believe him im happy but there crosses my mind a fleeting realizationnot of what our friend is now but what he has been and it disturbs me chills me i dont understand it for collie though i understand your feeling of what he is i dont understand mine you see im a man ive been a cowboy for ten years and more ive seen some hard experiences and worked with a good many rough boys and men cowboys indians mexicans miners prospectors ranchers hunterssome of whom were bad medicine so ive come to see men as you couldnt see them and bent wade has been everything a man could be he seems all men in one and despite all his kindness and goodness and hopefulness there is the sense i have of something deadly and terrible and inevitable in him  it makes my heart almost stop beating to know i have this man on my side because i sense in him the man element the physicaloh i cant put it in words but i mean something great in him that cant be beaten what he says must come true and so ive already begun to dream and to think of you as my wife if you ever areno when you are then i will owe it to bent wade no man ever owed another for so precious a gift but collie i cant help a little vague dreadof what i dont know unless its a sense of the possibilities of hellbent wade dearest i dont want to worry you or frighten you and i cant follow out my own gloomy fancies dont you mind too much what i think only you must realize that wade is the greatest factor in our hopes of the future my faith in him is so unshakable that its foolish next to you i love him best he seems even dearer to me than my own people he has made me look at life differently likewise he has inspired you but you dearest columbine are only a sensitive delicate girl a frail and tender thing like the columbine flowers of the hills and for your own sake you must not be blind to what wade is capable of if you keep on loving him and idealizing him blind to what has made him great that is blind to the tragic side of him then if he did something terrible here for you and for me the shock would be bad for you lord knows i have no suspicions of wade i have no clear ideas at all but i do know that for you he would not stop at anything he loves you as much as i do only differently such power a pale sweetfaced girl has over the lives of men  goodby for this time       faithfully           wilson       january 10th  dear wilsonin every letter i tell you im better why pretty soon therell be nothing left to say about my health ive been up and around now for days but only lately have i begun to gain since jack has been away im getting fat i eat and thats one reason i suppose then i move around more  you ask me to tell you all i do goodness i couldnt and i wouldnt you are getting mighty bossy since youre able to hobble around as you call it but you cant boss me however ill be nice and tell you a little i dont work very much ive helped dad with his accounts all so hopelessly muddled since he let jack keep the books i read a good deal your letters are worn out then when it snows i sit by the window and watch i love to see the snowflakes fall so fleecy and white and soft but i dont like the snowy world after the storm has passed i shiver and hug the fire i must have indian in me on moonlit nights to look out at old white slides so cold and icy and grand and over the white hills and ranges makes me shudder i dont know why its all beautiful but it seems to me like death well i sit idly a lot and think of you and how terribly big my love has grown and  but thats all about that  as you know jack has been gone since before new years day he said he was going to kremmling but dad heard he went to elgeria well i didnt tell you that dad and jack quarreled over money jack kept up his good behavior for so long that i actually believed hed changed for the better he kept at me not so much on the marriage question but to love him wilson he nearly drove me frantic with his lovemaking finally i got mad and i pitched into him oh i convinced him then he came back to his own self again like a flash he was buster jack once more you can go to hell he yelled at me and such a look well he went out and thats when he quarreled with dad it was about money i couldnt help but hear some of it i dont know whether or not dad gave jack money but i think he didnt anyway jack went  dad was all right for a few days really he seemed nicer and kinder for jacks absence then all at once he sank into the glooms i couldnt cheer him up when ben wade came in after supper dad always got him to tell some of those terrible stories you know what perfectly terrible stories ben can tell well dad had to hear the worst ones and poor me i didnt want to listen but i couldnt resist ben can tell stories and oh what hes lived through  i got the idea it wasnt jacks absence so much that made dad sit by the hour before the fire staring at the coals sighing and looking so godforsaken my heart just aches for dad he broods and broods hell break out some day and then i dont want to be here there doesnt seem to be any idea when jack will come home he might never come but ben says he will he says jack hates work and that he couldnt be gambler enough or wicked enough to support himself without working cant you hear ben wade say that ill tell you he begins and then comes a prophecy of trouble or evil and on the other hand think how he used to say wait dont give up nothin is ever so bad as it seems at first be true to what your heart says is right its never too late love is the only good in life love each other and wait and trust itll all come right in the end and wilson im bound to confess that both his sense of calamity and his hope of good seem infallible ben wade is supernatural sometimes just for a moment i dare to let myself believe in what he saysthat our dream will come true and ill be yours then oh oh oh joy and stars and bells and heaven ii  but what am i writing wilson moore this is quite enough for today take care you dont believe im soso very much in love       ever           columbine       february   dearest colliei dont know the date but springs coming today i kicked bent wade with my once sore foot it didnt hurt me but hurt wades feelings he says therell be no holding me soon i should say not ill eat you up im as hungry as the mountainlion thats been prowling round my cabin of nights hes sure starved wade tracked him to a hole in the cliff  collie i can get around first rate dont need my crutch any more i can make a fire and cook a meal wade doesnt think so but i do he says if i want to hold your affection not to let you eat anything i cook i can rustle around too havent been far yet my stock has wintered fairly well this valley is sheltered you know snow hasnt been too deep then i bought hay from andrews im hoping for spring now and the good old sunshine on the gray sage hills and summer with its columbines wade has gone back to his own cabin to sleep i miss him but im glad to have the nights alone once more ive got a future to plan read that over collie  today when wade came with your letter he asked me sort of queer say wils do you know how many letters ive fetched you from collie i said lord no i dont but theyre a lot then he said there were just fortyseven letters fortyseven i couldnt believe it and told him he was crazy i never had such good fortune well he made me count them and doggone it he was right fortyseven wonderful loveletters from the sweetest girl on earth but think of wade remembering every one it beats me hes beyond understanding  so jack belllounds still stays away from white slides collie im sure sorry for his father what it would be to have a son like buster jack my god but for your sake i go around yelling and singing like a locoed indian pretty soon spring will come then you wildflower of the hills you girl with the sweet mouth and the sad eyesthen im coming after you and all the kings horses and all the kings men can never take you away from me again       your faithful           wilson       march 19th  dearest wilsonyour last letters have been read and reread and kept under my pillow and have been both my help and my weakness during these trying days since jacks return  it has not been that i was afraid to writethough heaven knows if this letter should fall into the hands of dad it would mean trouble for me and if jack read iti am afraid to think of that i just have not had the heart to write you but all the time i knew i must write and that i would only now what to say tortures me i am certain that confiding in you relieves me thats why ive told you so much but of late i find it harder to tell what i know about jack belllounds im in a queer state of mind wilson dear and youll wonder and youll be sorry to know i havent seen much of ben latelythat is not to talk to it seems i cant bear his faith in me his hope his lovewhen lately matters have driven me into torturing doubt  but lest you might misunderstand im going to try to tell you something of what is on my mind and i want you to read it to ben he has been hurt by my strange reluctance to be with him  jack came home on the night of march second youll remember that day so gloomy and dark and dreary it snowed and sleeted and rained i remember how the rain roared on the roof it roared so loud we didnt hear the horse but we heard heavy boots on the porch outside the livingroom and the swish of a slicker thrown to the floor there was a bright fire dad looked up with a wild joy all of a sudden he changed he blazed he recognized the heavy tread of his son if i ever pitied and loved him it was then i thought of the return of the prodigal son there came a knock on the door then dad recovered he threw it open wide the streaming light fell upon jack belllounds indeed but not as i knew him he entered it was the first time i ever saw jack look in the least like a man he was pale haggard much older sullen and bold he strode in with a howdy folks and threw his wet hat on the floor and walked to the fire his boots were soaked with water and mud his clothes began to steam  when i looked at dad i was surprised he seemed cool and bright with the selfcontained force usual for him when something critical is about to happen  ahuh so you come back he said  yes im home replied jack  wal it took you quite a spell to get hyar  do you want me to stay  this question from jack seemed to stump dad he stared jack had appeared suddenly and his manner was different from that with which he used to face dad he had something up his sleeve as the cowboys say he wore an air of defiance and indifference  i reckon i do replied dad deliberately what do you mean by askin me thet  im of age long ago you cant make me stay home i can do as i like  ahuh i reckon you think you can but not hyar at white slides if you ever expect to get this property youll not do as you like  to hell with that i dont care whether i ever get it or not  dads face went as white as a sheet he seemed shocked after a moment he told me id better go to my room i was about to go when jack said no let her stay shed best hear now what ive got to say it concerns her  so ho then youve got a heap to say exclaimed dad queerly all right you have your say first  jack then began to talk in a level and monotonous voice so unlike him that i sat there amazed he told how early in the winter before he left the ranch he had found out that he was honestly in love with me that it had changed himmade him see he had never been any goodand inflamed him with the resolve to be better he had tried he had succeeded for six weeks he had been all that could have been asked of any young man i am bound to confess that he was well he went on to say how he had fought it out with himself until he absolutely knew he could control himself the courage and inspiration had come from his love for me that was the only good thing hed ever felt he wanted dad and he wanted me to understand absolutely without any doubt that he had found a way to hold on to his good intentions and good feelings and that was for me i was struck all atremble at the truth it was true well then he forced me to a decision forced me without ever hinting of this change this possibility in him i had told him i couldnt love him never then he said i could go to hell and he gave up failing to get money from dad he stole it without compunction and without regret he had gone to kremmling then to elgeria  i let myself go he said without shame and i drank and gambled when i was drunk i didnt remember collie but when i was sober i did and she haunted me that grew worse all the time so i drank to forget her the money lasted a great deal longer than i expected but that was because i won as much as i lost until lately then i borrowed a good deal from those men i gambled with but mostly from ranchers who knew my father would be responsible i had a shootingscrape with a man named elbert in smiths place at elgeria we quarreled over cards he cheated and when i hit him he drew on me but he missed then i shot him he lived three daysand died that sobered me and once more there came to me truth of what i might have been i went back to kremmling and i tried myself out again i worked awhile for judson who was the rancher i had borrowed most from at night i went into town and to the saloons where i met my gambling cronies i put myself in the atmosphere of drink and cards and i resisted both i could make myself indifferent to both as soon as i was sure of myself i decided to come home and here i am  this long speech of jacks had a terrible effect upon me i was stunned and sick but if it did that to me what did it do to dad heaven knows i cant tell you dad gave a lurch and a great heave as if at the removal of a rope that had all but strangled him  ahuhhuh he groaned an now youre hyarwhats thet mean  it means that its not yet too late replied jack dont misunderstand me im not repenting with that side of me which is bad but ive sobered up ive had a shock i see my ruin i still love you dad despitethe cruel thing you did to me im your son and id like to make up to you for all my shortcomings and so help me heaven i can do that and will do it if collie will marry me not only marry methatd not be enoughbut love meim crazy for her love its terrible  you spoiled weaklin thundered dad how n hell can i believe you  because i know it declared jack standing right up to his father white and unflinching  then dad broke out in such a rage that i sat there scared so stiff i could not move my heart beat thick and heavy dad got livid of face his hair stood up his eyes rolled he called jack every name i ever heard any one call him and then a thousand more then he cursed him such dreadful curses oh how sad and terrible to hear dad  right you are cried jack bitter and hard and ringing of voice right by god but am i all to blame did i bring myself here on this earth theres something wrong in me thats not all my fault you cant shame me or scare me or hurt me i could fling in your face those damned three years of hell you sent me to but whats the use for you to roar at me or for me to reproach you im ruined unless you give me colliemake her love me that will save me and i want it for your sake and hersnot for my own even if i do love her madly im not wanting her for that im no good im not fit to touch her ive just come to tell you the truth i feel for collieid do for collieas you did for my mother cant you understand im your son ive some of you in me and ive found out what it is do you and collie want to take me at my word  i think it took dad longer to read something strange and convincing in jack than it took me anyway dad got the stunning consciousness that jack knew by some divine or intuitive power that his reformation was inevitable if i loved him never have i had such a distressing and terrible moment as that revelation brought to me i felt the truth i could save jack belllounds no woman is ever fooled at such critical moments of life ben wade once said that i could have reformed jack were it possible to love him now the truth of that came home to me and somehow it was overwhelming  dad received this truthand it was beyond me to realize what it meant to him he must have seen all his earlier hopes fulfilled his pride vindicated his shame forgotten his love rewarded yet he must have seen all that as would a man leaning with one foot over a bottomless abyss he looked transfigured yet conscious of terrible peril his great heart seemed to leap to meet this last opportunity with all forgiveness with all gratitude but his will yielded with a final and irrevocable resolve a resolve dark and sinister  he raised his huge fists higher and higher and all his body lifted and strained towering and trembling while his face was that of a righteous and angry god  my son i take your word he rolled out his voice filling the room and reverberating through the house i give you collie she will be yours but by the love i bore your motheri swearif you ever steal againill kill you  i cant say any more       columbine    chapter xiv  spring came early that year at white slides ranch the snow melted off the valleys and the wild flowers peeped from the greening grass while yet the mountain domes were white the long stone slides were glistening wet and the brooks ran fullbanked noisy and turbulent and roily  soft and fresh of color the gray old sage slopes came out from under their winter mantle the bleached tufts of grass waved in the wind and showed tiny blades of green at the roots the aspens and oaks and the vines on fences and cliffs and the roundclumped brookbordering willows took on a hue of spring  the mustangs and colts in the pastures snorted and ran and kicked and cavorted and on the hillsides the cows began to climb higher searching for the tender greens bawling for the newborn calves eagles shrieked the release of the snowbound peaks and the elks bugled their piercing calls the grousecocks spread their gorgeous brown plumage in parade before their twittering mates and the jays screeched in the woods and the sagehens sailed along the bosom of the gray slopes  black bears and browns and grizzlies came out of their winters sleep and left huge muddy tracks on the trails the timber wolves at dusk mourned their hungry calls for life for meat for the wildness that was passing the coyotes yelped at sunset joyous and sharp and impudent  but winter yielded reluctantly its hold on the mountains the black scudding clouds and the squalls of rain and sleet and snow whitening and melting and vanishing and the cold clear nights with crackling frost all retarded the work of the warming sun the day came however when the greens held their own with the grays and this was the assurance of nature that spring could not be denied and that summer would follow                                       bent wade was hiding in the willows along the trail that followed one of the brooks of late on several mornings he had skulked like an indian under cover watching for some one on this morning when columbine belllounds came riding along he stepped out into the trail in front of her  oh ben you startled me she exclaimed as she held hard on the frightened horse  good mornin collie replied wade im sorry to scare you but im particular anxious to see you an considerin how you avoid me these days i had to waylay you in regular roadagent style  wade gazed up searchingly at her it had been some time since he had been given the privilege and pleasure of seeing her close at hand he needed only one look at her to confirm his fears the pale sweet resolute face told him much  well now youve waylaid me what do you want she queried deliberately  im goin to take you to see wils moore replied wade watching her closely  no she cried with the red staining her temples  collie see here did i ever oppose anythin you wanted to do  notyet she said  i reckon you expect me to  she did not answer that her eyes drooped and she nervously twisted the bridle reins  do you doubt mymy good intentions toward youmy love for you he asked in gentle and husky voice  oh ben no no its that im afraid of your love for me i cant bearwhat i have to bearif i see you if i listen to you  then youve weakened youre no proud highstrung thoroughbred girl any more youre showin yellow  ben wade i deny that she answered spiritedly with an uplift of her head its not weakness but strength ive found  ahuh well i reckon i understand collie listen wils let me read your last letter to him  i expected that i think i told him to anyway i wanted you to knowwhatwhat ailed me  lass it was a fine brave letterwritten by a girl facin an upheaval of conscience an soul but in your own trouble you forget the effect that letter might have on wils moore  ben iive lain awake at nightoh was he hurt  collie i reckon if you dont see wils hell kill himself or kill buster jack replied wade gravely  ill seehim she faltered but oh benyou dont mean that wilson would be so baseso cowardly  collie youre a child you dont realize the depths to which a man can sink wils has had a long hard pull this winter my nursin an your letters have saved his life hes well now but that long dark spell of mind left its shadow on him hes morbid  what does hewant to see mefor asked columbine tremulously there were tears in her eyes itll only cause more painmake matters worse  reckon i dont agree with you wils just wants an needs to see you why he appreciated your position ive heard him cry like a woman over it an our helplessness what ails him is lovesickness the awful feelin which comes to a man who believes he has lost his sweethearts love  poor boy so he imagines i dont love him any more good heavens how stupid men are ill see him ben take me to him  for answer wade grasped the bridle of her horse and turning him took a course leading away behind the hill that lay between them and the ranchhouse the trail was narrow and brushy making it necessary for him to walk ahead of the horse so the hunter did not speak to her or look at her for some time he plodded on with his eyes downcast something tugged at wades mind an old familiar beckoning thing vague and mysterious and black a presage of catastrophe but it was only an opening wedge into his mind it had not entered gravity and unhappiness occupied him his senses nevertheless were alert he heard the low roar of the flooded brook the whir of rising grouse ahead the hoofs of deer on stones the song of spring birds he had an eye also for the wan wild flowers in the shaded corners presently he led the horse out of the willows into the open and up a lowswelling long slope of fragrant sage here he dropped back to columbines side and put his hand upon the pommel of her saddle it was not long until her own hand softly fell upon his and clasped it wade thrilled under the warm touch how well he knew her heart when she ceased to love any one to whom she had given her love then she would have ceased to breathe  lass this isnt the first mornin ive waited for you he said presently an when i had to go back to wils without youwell it was hard  then he wants to see meso badly she asked  reckon youve not thought much about him or me lately said wade  no ive tried to put you out of my mind ive had so much to think ofwhy even the sleepless nights have flown  are you goin to confide in meas you used to  ben theres nothing to confide im just where i left off in that letter to wilson and the more i think the more muddled i get  wade greeted this reply with a long silence it was enough to feel her hand upon his and to have the glad comfort and charm of her presence once more he seemed to have grown older lately the fragrant breath of the sage slopes came to him as something precious he must feel and love more a haunting transience mocked him from these rolling gray hills old white slides loomed gray and dark up into the blue grim and stern reminder of age and of fleeting time there was a cloud on wades horizon  wils is waitin down there said wade pointing to a grove of aspens below reckon its pretty close to the house an a trail runs along there but wils cant ride very well yet an this appeared to be the best place  ben i dont care if dad or jack know ive met wilson ill tell them said columbine  ahuh well if i were you i wouldnt he replied  they went down the slope and entered the grove it was an open pretty spot with grass and wild flowers and old bleached logs half sunny and half shady under the newborn fluttering aspen leaves wade saw moore sitting on his horse and it struck the hunter significantly that the cowboy should be mounted when an hour back he had left him sitting disconsolately on a log moore wanted columbine to see him first after all these months of fear and dread mounted upon his horse wade heard columbines glad little cry but he did not turn to look at her then but when they reached the spot where moore stood wade could not resist the desire to see the meeting between the lovers  columbine being a woman and therefore capable of hiding agitation except in moments of stress met that trying situation with more apparent composure than the cowboy moores long piercing gaze took the rose out of columbines cheeks  oh wilson im so happy to see you on your horse again she exclaimed its too good to be true ive prayed for that more than anything else can you get up into your saddle like you used to can you ride well again let me see your foot  moore held out a bulky foot he wore a shoe and it was slashed  i cant wear a boot he explained  oh i see exclaimed columbine slowly with her glad smile fading you cant put thatthat foot in a stirrup can you  no  butitit willyoull be able to wear a boot soon she implored  never again collie he said sadly  and then wade perceived that like a flash the old spirit leaped up in columbine it was all he wanted to see  now folks he said i reckon twos company an threes a crowd ill go off a little ways an keep watch  ben you stay here replied columbine hurriedly  why collie are you afraidor ashamed to be with me alone asked moore bitterly  columbines eyes flashed it was seldom they lost their sweet tranquillity but now they had depth and fire  no wilson im neither afraid nor ashamed to be with you alone she declared but i can be as naturalas much myself with ben here as i could be alone why cant you be if dad and jack heard of our meeting the fact of bens presence might make it look different to them and why should i heap trouble upon my shoulders  i beg pardon collie said the cowboy ive just been afraid ofof things  my horse is restless returned columbine lets get off and talk  so they dismounted it warmed wades gloomy heart to see the womanlook in columbines eyes as she watched the cowboy get off and walk for a crippled man he did very well but that moment was fraught with meaning for wade these unfortunate lovers brave and fine in their suffering did not realize the peril they invited by proximity but wade knew he pitied them he thrilled for them he lived their torture with them  tell meeverything said columbine impulsively  moore with dragging step approached an aspen log that lay off the ground propped by the stump and here he leaned for support columbine laid her gloves on the log  theres nothing to tell that you dont know replied moore i wrote you all there was to write excepthere he dropped his headexcept that the last three weeks have been hell  theyve not been exactly heaven for me replied columbine with a little laugh that gave wade a twinge  then the lovers began to talk about spring coming about horses and cattle and feed about commonplace ranch matters not interesting to them but which seemed to make conversation and hide their true thoughts wade listened and it seemed to him that he could read their hearts  lass an you wilsyoure wastin time an gettin nowhere interposed wade now let me go sos youll be alone  you stay right there ordered moore  why ben im ashamed to say that i actually forgot you were here said columbine  then ill remind you rejoined the hunter collie tell us about old bill an jack  tell you what  well ive seen changes in both so has wils though wils hasnt seen as much as hes heard from lem an montana an the andrews boys  oh columbine choked a little over her exclamation of understanding dad has gotten a new lease on life i guess hes happy like a boy sometimes an good as gold its all because of the change in jack that is remarkable ive not been able to believe my own eyes since that night jack came home and had thethe understanding with dad he has been another person he has left me alone he treats me with deference but not a familiar word or look hes kind he offers the little civilities that occur you know but he never intrudes upon me not one word of the past it is as if he would earn my respect and have that or nothing then he works as he never worked beforeon dads books in the shop out on the range he seems obsessed with some thought all the time he talks little all the old petulance obstinacy selfishness and especially his sudden queer impulses and bullheaded tenacityall gone he has suffered physical distress because he never was used to hard work and more hes suffered terribly for the want of liquor ive heard him say to dad its hellthis burning thirst i never knew i had it ill stand it if it kills me but wouldnt it be easier on me to take a drink now and then at these bad times and dad said no son break off for keeps this taperin off is no good way to stop drinkin stand the burnin an when its gone youll be all the gladder an ill be all the prouder i have not forgotten all jacks former failings but i am forgetting them little by little for dads sake im overjoyed for jacks i am glad im convinced now that hes had his lessonthat hes sowed his wild oatsthat he has become a man  moore listened eagerly and when she had concluded he thoughtfully bent his head and began to cut little chips out of the log with his knife  collie ive heard a good deal of the change in jack he said earnestly honest injun im gladglad for his fathers sake for his own and for yours the boys think jacks locoed but his reformation is not strange to me if i were no goodjust like he waswell i could change as greatly forfor you  columbine hastily averted her face wades keen eyes apparently hidden under his old hat saw how wet her lashes were how her lips trembled  wilson you think thenyou believe jack will lastwill stick to his new ways she queried hurriedly  yes i do he replied nodding  how good of you oh wilson its like you to be noblesplendid when you might havewhen itd have been so natural for you to doubtto scorn him  collie im honest about that and now you be just as honest do you think jack will stand to his colors never drinknever gamblenever fly off the handle again  yes i honestly believe thatproviding he getsproviding i  her voice trailed off faintly  moore wheeled to address the hunter  pard what do you think tell me now tell us it will help me and collie too ive asked you before but you wouldnttell us now do you believe buster jack will live up to his new ideals  wade had long parried that question because the time to answer it had not come till this moment  no he replied gently  columbine uttered a little cry  why not demanded moore his face darkening  reckon there are reasons that you young folks wouldnt think of an couldnt know  wade its not like you to be hopeless for any man said moore  yes i reckon it is sometimes replied wade wagging his head solemnly young folks im grantin all you say as to jacks reformation except that its permanent im grantin hes sincerethat hes not playin a partthat his vicious instincts are smothered under a noble impulse to be what he ought to be its no trick buster jack has all but done the impossible  then why isnt his sincerity and good work to be permanent asked moore impatiently and his gesture was violent  wils his change is not moral force its passion  the cowboy paled columbine stood silent with intent eyes upon the hunter neither of them seemed to understand him well enough to make reply  love can work marvels in any man went on wade but love cant change the fiber of a mans heart a man is born so an so he loves an hates an feels accordin to the nature itd be accordin to nature for jack belllounds to stay reformed if his love for collie lasted an thats the point it cant last not in a man of his stripe  why not demanded moore  because jacks love will never be returnedsatisfied it takes a man of different caliber to love a woman wholl never love him jacks obsessed by passion now hed perform miracles but thats not possible the miracle necessary here would be for him to change his moral force his blood the habits of his mind thats beyond his power  columbine flung out an appealing hand  ben i could pretend to love himi might make myself love him if that would give him the power  lass dont delude yourself you cant do that replied wade  how do you know what i can do she queried struggling with her helplessness  why child i know you better than you know yourself  wilson hes right hes right she cried thats why its so terrible for me now he knows my very heart he reads my soul i can never love jack belllounds nor ever pretend love  collie if ben knows you so well you ought to listen to him as you used to said moore touching her hand with infinite sympathy  wade watched them his pity and affection did not obstruct the ruthless expression of his opinions or the direction of his intentions  lass an you wils listen he said with all his gentleness its bad enough without you makin it worse dont blind yourselves thats the hell with so many people in trouble its hard to see clear when youre sufferin and fightin but i see clear now with just a word i could fetch this new jack belllounds back to his buster jack tricks  oh ben no no no cried columbine in a distress that showed how his force dominated her  moores face turned as white as ashes  wade divined then that moore was aware of what he himself knew about jack belllounds and to his love for moore was added an infinite respect  i wont unless collie forces me to he said significantly  this was the critical moment and suddenly wade answered to it without restraint he leaped up startling columbine  wils you call me pard dont you i reckon you never knew me why the games most played out an i havent showed my hand id see jack belllounds in hell before id let him have collie an if she carried out her strange an lofty idea of dutyan married him right this afternooni could an i would part them before night  he ended that speech in a voice neither had ever heard him use before and the look of him must have been in harmony with it columbine wideeyed and gasping seemed struck to the heart moores white face showed awe and fear and irresponsible primitive joy wade turned away from them the better to control the passion that had mastered him and it did not subside in an instant he paced to and fro his head bowed presently when he faced around it was to see what he had expected to see  columbine was clasped in moores arms  collie you didntyou haventpromised to marry himagain  no ohno i havent i was onlyonly trying toto make up my mind wilson dont look at me so terribly  youll not agree again youll not set another day demanded moore passionately he strained her to him yet held her so he could see her face thus dominating her with both strength and will his face was corded now and darkly flushed his jaw quivered youll never marry jack belllounds youll not let sudden impulsesudden persuasion or force change you promise swear youll never marry him swear  oh wilson i promisei swear she cried never im yours it would be a sin ive been mad toto blind myself  you love me you love me he cried in a sudden transport  oh yes yes i do  say it then say itso ill never doubtnever suffer again  i love you wilson ii love youunutterably the whispered i love yousoim brokenhearted now ill never live without you ill diei love you so  youyou floweryou angel he whispered in return you woman you precious creature ive been crazed at loss of you  wade paced out of earshot and this time he remained away for a considerable time he lived again moments of his own past unforgetable and sad when at length he returned toward the young couple they were sitting apart composed once more talking earnestly as he neared them columbine rose to greet him with wonderful eyes in which reproach blended with affection  ben so this is what youve done she exclaimed  lass im only a humble instrument an i believe god guides me right replied the hunter  i love you more it seems for what you make me suffer she said and she kissed him with a serious sweetness im only a leaf in the storm butlet what will come take me home  they said goodby to wilson who sat with head bowed upon his hands his voice trembled as he answered them wade found the trail while columbine mounted as they went slowly down the gentle slope stepping over the numerous logs fallen across the way wade caught out of the tail of his eye a moving object along the outer edge of the aspen grove above them it was the figure of a man skulking behind the trees he disappeared wade casually remarked to columbine that now she could spur the pony and hurry on home but columbine refused when they got a little farther on out of sight of moore and somewhat around to the left wade espied the man again he carried a rifle wade grew somewhat perturbed  collie you run on home he said sharply  why youve complained of not seeing me now that i want to be with you  ben you see some one  columbines keen faculties evidently sensed the change in wade and the direction of his uneasy glance convinced her  oh theres a man ben it isyes its jack she exclaimed excitedly  reckon youd have it better if you say buster jack replied wade with his tragic smile  ah whispered columbine as she gazed up at the aspen slope with eyes lighting to battle  run home collie an leave him to me said wade  ben you mean hehe saw us up there in the grove saw me in wilsons armssaw me kissing him  sure as youre born collie he watched us he saw all your lovemakin i can tell that by the way he walks its buster jack again alas for the new an noble jack i told you collie now you run on an leave him to me  wade became aware that she turned at his last words and regarded him attentively but his gaze was riveted on the striding form of belllounds  leave him to you for what reason my friend she asked  buster jacks on the rampage cant you see that hell insult you hell  i will not go interrupted columbine and halting her pony she deliberately dismounted  wade grew concerned with the appearance of young belllounds and it was with a melancholy reminder of the infallibility of his presentiments as he and columbine halted in the trail bellloundss hurried stride lengthened until he almost ran he carried the rifle forward in a most significant manner black as a thundercloud was his face alas for the dignity and pain and resolve that had only recently showed there  belllounds reached them he was frothing at the mouth he cocked the rifle and thrust it toward wade holding low down  youmeddling sneak if you open your trap ill bore you he shouted almost incoherently  wade knew when danger of life loomed imminent he fixed his glance upon the glaring eyes of belllounds  jack seein im not packin a gun itd look sorta natural along with your other tricks if you bored me  his gentle voice his cool mien his satire were as giants arms to drag belllounds back from murder the rifle was raised the hammer reset the butt lowered to the ground while belllounds snarling and choking fought for speech  ill get evenwith you he said huskily im on to your game now ill fix you later butill do you harm now if you mix in with this  then he wheeled to columbine and as if he had just recognized her a change that was pitiful and shocking convulsed his face he leaned toward her pointing with shaking accusing hand  i saw youup there i watchedyou he panted  columbine faced him white and mute  it was youwasnt it he yelled  yes of course it was  she might have struck him for the way he flinched  what was thata tricka gamea play all fixed up for my benefit  i dont understand you she replied  bah youyou whitefaced cat i saw you saw you in moores arms saw him hug youkiss you theni sawyou put up your armsround his neckkiss himkiss himkiss him i saw all thatdidnt i  you must have since you say so she returned with perfect composure  but did you he almost shrieked the blood cording and bulging red as if about to burst the veins of temples and neck  yes i did she flashed there was primitive woman uppermost in her now and a spirit no man might provoke with impunity  you love him he asked very low incredulously with almost insane eagerness for denial in his query  then wade saw the glory of hersaw her mother again in that proud fierce uplift of face that flamed red and then blazed whitesaw hate and passion and love in all their primal nakedness  love him love wilson moore yes you fool i love him yes yes yes  that voice would have pierced the heart of a wooden image so wade thought as all his strung nerves quivered and thrilled  belllounds uttered a low cry of realization and all his instinctive energy seemed on the verge of collapse he grew limp he sagged he tottered his sensorial perceptions seemed momentarily blunted  wade divined the tragedy and a pang of great compassion overcame him whatever jack belllounds was in character he had inherited his fathers power to love and he was human wade felt the death in that stricken soul and it was the last flash of pity he ever had for jack belllounds  youyou muttered belllounds raising a hand that gathered speed and strength in the action the moment of a great blow had passed like a stormblast through a leafless tree now the thousand devils of his nature leaped into ascendancy you he could not articulate dark and terrible became his energy it was like a resistless current forced through leaping thought and leaping muscle  he struck her on the mouth a cruel blow that would have felled her but for wade and then he lunged away bowed and trembling yet with fierce instinctive motion as if driven to run with the spirit of his rage    chapter xv  wade noticed that after her trying experience with him and wilson and belllounds columbine did not ride frequently  he managed to get a word or two with her whenever he went to the ranchhouse and he needed only look at her to read her sensitive mind all was well with columbine despite her trouble she remained upheld in spirit while yet she seemed to brood over an unsolvable problem she had said butlet what will comeand she was waiting  wade hunted for more than lions and wolves these days like an indian scout who scented peril or heard an unknown step upon his trail wade rode the hills and spent long hours hidden on the lonely slopes watching with somber keen eyes they were eyes that knew what they were looking for they had marked the strange sight of the son of bill belllounds gliding along that trail where moore had met columbine sneaking and stooping at last with many a covert glance about to kneel in the trail and compare the horse tracks there with horseshoes he took from his pocket that alone made bent wade eternally vigilant he kept his counsel he worked more swiftly so that he might have leisure for his peculiar seeking he spent an hour each night with the cowboys listening to their recounting of the day and to their homely and shrewd opinions he haunted the vicinity of the ranchhouse at night watching and listening for that moment which was to aid him in the crisis that was impending many a time he had been near when columbine passed from the livingroom to her corner of the house he had heard her sigh and could almost have touched her  buster jack had suffered a regurgitation of the old driving and insatiate temper and there was gloom in the house of belllounds trouble clouded the old mans eyes  may came with the spring roundup wade was called to use a rope and brand calves under the order of jack belllounds foreman of white slides that roundup showed a loss of one hundred head of stock some branded steers and yearlings and many calves in all a mixed herd belllounds received the amazing news with a roar he had been ready for something to roar at the cowboys gave as reasons winterkill and lions and perhaps some head stolen since the thaw wade emphatically denied this very few cattle had fallen prey to the big cats and none so far as he could find had been frozen or caught in drifts it was the young foreman who stunned them all rustled he said darkly theres too many loafers and homesteaders in these hills and he stalked out to leave his hearers food for reflection  jack belllounds drank but no one saw him drunk and no one could tell where he got the liquor he rode hard and fast he drove the cowboys one way while he went another he had grown shifty cunning more intolerant than ever some nights he rode to kremmling or said he had been there when next day the cowboys found another spent and broken horse to turn out on other nights he coaxed and bullied them into playing poker they won more of his money than they cared to count  columbine confided to wade with mournful whisper that jack paid no attention to her whatever and that the old rancher attributed this coldness and jacks backsliding to her irresponsiveness and her tardiness in setting the weddingday that must be set to this wade had whispered in reply dont ever forget what i said to you an wils that day  so wade upheld columbine with his subtle dominance and watched over her as it were from afar no longer was he welcome in the big livingroom belllounds reacted to his sons influence  twice in the early mornings wade had surprised jack belllounds in the blacksmith shop the meetings were accidental yet wade ever remembered how coincidence beckoned him thither and how circumstance magnified strange reflections there was no reason why jack should not be tinkering in the blacksmith shop early of a morning but wade followed an uncanny guidance like his hound fox he never split on trails when opportunity afforded he went into the shop and looked it over with eyes as keen as the nose of his dog and in the dust of the floor he had discovered little circles with dots in the middle all uniform in size sight of them did not shock him until they recalled vividly the little circles with dots in the earthen floor of wilson moores cabin little marks made by the end of moores crutch wade grinned then like a wolf showing his fangs and the vitals of a wolf could no more strongly have felt the instinct to rend  for wade the cloud on his horizon spread and darkened gathered sinister shape of storm harboring lightning and havoc it was the cloud in his mind the foreshadowing of his soul the prophetic sense of like to like where he wandered there the blight fell                                       significant was the fact that belllounds hired new men bludsoe had quit montana jim grew surly these days and packed a gun lem billings had threatened to leave new and strange hands for jack belllounds to direct had a tendency to release a strain and tide things over  every time the old rancher saw wade he rolled his eyes and wagged his head as if combating superstition with an intelligent sense of justice wade knew what troubled belllounds and it strengthened the gloomy mood that like a poison lichen seemed finding root  every day wade visited his friend wilson moore and most of their conversation centered round that which had become a ruling passion for both but the time came when wade deviated from his gentleness of speech and leisure of action  bent youre not like you were said moore once in surprise at the discovery youre losing hope and confidence  no ive only somethin on my mind  what  i reckon im not goin to tell you now  youve got hell on your mind flashed the cowboy in grim inspiration  wade ignored the insinuation and turned the conversation to another subject  wils youre buyin stock right along  sure am i saved some money you know and whats the use to hoard it ill buy cheap in five years ill have five hundred maybe a thousand head wade my old dad will be pleased to find out ive made the start i have  well its a fine start ill allow have you picked up any unbranded stock  sure i have say pard are you worrying about this twobit rustler work thats been going on  wils it aint two bits any more i reckon its gettin into the fourbit class  ive been careful to have my business transactions all in writing said moore it makes these fellows sore because some of them cant write and theyre not used to it but im starting this game in my own way  have you sold any stock  not yet but the andrews boys are driving some thirtyodd head to kremmling for me to be sold  ahuh well ill be goin wade replied and it was significant of his state of mind that he left his young friend sorely puzzled not that wade did not see moores anxiety but the drift of events at white slides had passed beyond the stage where sympathetic and inspiring hope might serve wades purpose besides his mood was gradually changing as these events like many fibers of a web gradually closed in toward a culminating knot  that night wade lounged with the cowboys and new hands in front of the little storehouse where belllounds kept supplies for all he had lounged there before in the expectation of seeing the ranchers son and this time anticipation was verified jack belllounds swaggered over from the ranchhouse he met civility and obedience now where formerly he had earned but ridicule and opposition so long as he worked hard himself the cowboys endured the subtle change in him seemed of sterner stuff the talk as usual centered round the stock subjects and the banter and gossip of ranchhands wade selected an interval when there was a lull in the conversation and with eyes that burned under the shadow of his broadbrimmed sombrero he watched the son of belllounds  say boys wils moore has begun sellin cattle remarked wade casually the andrews brothers are drivin for him  wal so wilss spreadeaglin into a real rancher ejaculated lem billings mighty glad to hear it thet boy shore will git rich  wades remark incited no further expressions of interest but it was jack bellloundss secret mind that wade wished to pierce he saw the leaping of a thought that was neither interest nor indifference nor contempt but a creative thing which lent a fleeting flash to the face a slight shock to the body then jack belllounds bent his head lounged there for a little while longer lost in absorption and presently he strolled away  whatever that mounting thought of jack bellloundss was it brought instant decision to wade he went to the ranchhouse and knocked upon the livingroom door there was a light within sending rays out through the windows into the semidarkness columbine opened the door and admitted wade a bright fire crackled in the hearth wade flashed a reassuring look at columbine  evenin miss collie is your dad in  oh its you ben she replied after her start yes dads here  the old rancher looked up from his reading howdy wade what can i do fer you  belllounds ive cleaned out the cats an most of the varmints on your range an my work lately has been all sorts not leavin me any time for little jobs of my own an i want to quit  wade youve clashed with jack exclaimed the rancher jerking erect  nothin of the kind jack an me havent had words a good while im not denyin we might an probably would clash sooner or later but thats not my reason for quittin  manifestly this put an entirely different complexion upon the matter belllounds appeared immensely relieved  wal all right ill pay you at the end of the month lets see thets not long now you can lay off tomorrow  wade thanked him and waited for further remarks columbine had fixed big questioning eyes upon wade which he found hard to endure again he tried to flash her a message of reassurance but columbine did not lose her look of blank wonder and gravity  ben oh youre not going to leave white slides she asked  reckon ill hang around yet awhile he replied  belllounds was wagging his head regretfully and ponderingly  wal i remember the day when no man quit me wal waltimes change im an old man now mebbe mebbe im testy an then thars thet boy  with a shrug of his broad shoulders he dismissed what seemed an encroachment of pessimistic thought  wade youre packin off then on the trail always on the go eh  no im not hurryin off replied wade  wal might i ask what youre figgerin on  sure im considerin a cattle deal with moore hes a pretty keen boy an his father has big ranchin interests ive saved a little money an im no spring chicken any more wils has begun to buy an sell stock so i reckon ill go in with him  ahuh belllounds gave a grunt of comprehension he frowned and his big eyes set seriously upon the blazing fire he grasped complications in this information  wal its a free country he said at length and evidently his personal anxieties were subjected to his sense of justice owin to the peculiar circumstances hyar at my range id prefer thet moore an you began somewhar else thets natural but youve my good will to start on an i hope ive yours  belllounds youve every mans good will replied wade i hope you wont take offense at my leavin you see im on wils moores side inin what you called these peculiar circumstances hes got

sure be help for me belllounds im goin to round up this outfit thats rustlin your cattle theyre gettin sort of bold  wade youll do thet on your own hook asked the rancher in surprise  sure i like huntin men more than other varmints then ive a personal interest you know the hint about homesteaders hereabouts reflects some on wils moore  stuff exploded the rancher heartily do you think any cattleman in these hills would believe wils moore a rustler  the hunch has been whispered said wade an you know how all ranchers say they rustled a little on the start  aw hell thets different every new rancher drives in a few unbranded calves an keeps them but stealin stockthets different an id as soon suspect my own son of rustlin as wils moore  belllounds spoke with a sincere and frank ardor of defense for a young man once employed by him and known to be honest the significance of the comparison he used had not struck him his was the epitome of a successful rancher sure in his opinions speaking proudly and unreflectingly of his own son and being just to another man  wade bowed and backed out of the door sure thats what id reckon youd say belllounds ill drop in on you if i find any sign in the woods good night  columbine went with him to the end of the porch as she had used to go before the shadow had settled over the lives of the belllounds  ben youre up to something she whispered seizing him with hands that shook  sure but dont you worry he whispered back  do they hint that wilson is a rustler she asked intensely  somebody did collie  how vile who who she demanded and her face gleamed white  hush lass youre all atremble he returned warily and he held her hands  ben theyre pressing me hard to set another weddingday dad is angry with me now jack has begun again to demand oh im afraid of him he has no respect for me he catches at me with hands like claws i have to jerk away oh ben ben dear friend what on earth shall i do  dont give in fight jack tell the old man you must have time watch your chance when jack is away an ride up the buffalo park trail an look for me  wade had to release his hands from her clasp and urge her gently back how pale and tragic her face gleamed                                       wade took his horses his outfit and the dog fox and made his abode with wilson moore the cowboy hailed wades coming with joy and pestered him with endless questions  from that day wade haunted the hills above white slides early and late alone with his thoughts his plans more and more feeling the suspense of happenings to come it was on a june day when jack belllounds rode to kremmling that wade met columbine on the buffalo park trail she needed to see him to find comfort and strength wade far exceeded his own confidence in his effort to uphold her columbine was in a strange state not of vacillation between two courses but of a standstill as if her will had become obstructed and waited for some force to upset the hindrance she did not inquire as to the welfare of wilson moore and wade vouchsafed no word of him but she importuned the hunter to see her every day or no more at all and wade answered her appeal and her need by assuring her that he would see her come what might so she was to risk more frequent rides  during the second week of june wade rode up to visit the prospector lewis and learned that which complicated the matter of the rustlers lewis had been suspicious and active on his own account according to the best of his evidence and judgment there had been a gang of rough men come of late to gore peak where they presumably were prospecting this gang was composed of strangers to lewis they had ridden to his cabin bought and borrowed of him and during his absence had stolen from him he believed they were in hiding probably being guilty of some depredation in another locality they gave both kremmling and elgeria a wide berth on the other hand the smith gang from elgeria rode to and fro like ranchers searching for lost horses there were only three in this gang including smith lewis had seen these men driving unbranded stock and lastly lewis casually imparted the information highly interesting to wade that he had seen jack belllounds riding through the forest the prospector did not in the least however connect the appearance of the son of belllounds with the other facts so peculiarly interesting to wade cowboys and hunters rode trails across the range and though they did so rather infrequently there was nothing unusual about encountering them  wade remained all night with lewis and next morning rode six miles along the divide and then down into a valley where at length he found a cabin described by the prospector it was well hidden in the edge of the forest where a spring gushed from under a low cliff but for water and horse tracks wade would not have found it easily rifle in hand and on foot he slipped around in the woods as a hunter might have to stalk drinking deer there were no smoke no noise no horses anywhere round the cabin and after watching awhile wade went forward to look at it it was an old ramshackle hunters or prospectors cabin with dirt floor a crumbling fireplace and chimney and a bed platform made of boughs including the door it had three apertures and the two smaller ones serving as windows looked as if they had been intended for portholes as well the inside of the cabin was large and unusually well lighted owing to the windows and to the open chinks between the logs wade saw a deck of cards lying bent and scattered in one corner as if a violent hand had flung them against the wall strange that wades memory returned a vivid picture of jack belllounds in just that act of violence the only other thing around the place which earned scrutiny from wade was a number of horseshoe tracks outside with the left front shoe track familiar to him he examined the clearest imprints very carefully if they had not been put there by wilson moores white mustang spottie then they had been made by a horse with a strangely similar hoof and shoe spottie had a hoof malformed somewhat in the shape of a triangle and the iron shoe to fit it always had to be bent so that the curve was sharp and the ends closer together than those of his other shoes  wade rode down to white slides that day and at the evening meal he casually asked moore if he had been riding spottie of late  sure what other horse could i ride do you think im up to trying one of those broncs asked moore in derision  reckon you havent been leavin any tracks up buffalo park way  the cowboy slammed down his knife say wade are you growing dotty good lord if id ridden that farif i was able to do itwouldnt you hear me yell  reckon so come to think of it i just saw a track like spotties made two days ago  well it wasnt his you can gamble on that returned the cowboy                                       wade spent four days hiding in an aspen grove on top of one of the highest foothills above white slides ranch there he lay at ease like an indian calm and somber watching the trails below waiting for what he knew was to come  on the fifth morning he was at his post at sunrise a casual remark of one of the new cowboys the night before accounted for the early hour of wades reconnoiter the dawn was fresh and cool with sweet odor of sage on the air the jays were squalling their annoyance at this early disturber of their grove the east was rosy above the black range and soon glowed with gold and then changed to fire the sun had risen all the mountain world of black range and gray hill and green valley with its shining stream was transformed as if by magic color wade sat down with his back to an aspentree his gaze down upon the ranchhouse and the corrals a lazy column of blue smoke curled up toward the sky to be lost there the burros were braying the calves were bawling the colts were whistling one of the hounds bayed full and clear  the scene was pastoral and beautiful wade saw it clearly and whole peace and plenty a happy ranchers home the joy of the dawn and the birth of summer the rewards of toilall seemed significant there but wade pondered on how pregnant with life that scene wasnature in its simplicity and freedom and hidden cruelty and the existence of people blindly hating loving sacrificing mostly serving some noble aim and yet with baseness among them the lees with the wine evil intermixed with good  by and by the cowboys appeared on their spring mustangs and in twos and threes they rode off in different directions but none rode wades way the sun rose higher and there was warmth in the air bees began to hum by wade and fluttering moths winged uncertain flight over him  at the end of another hour jack belllounds came out of the house gazed around him and then stalked to the barn where he kept his horses for a little while he was not in sight then he reappeared mounted on a white horse and he rode into the pasture and across that to the hayfield and along the edge of this to the slope of the hill here he climbed to a small clump of aspens this grove was not so far from wilson moores cabin in fact it marked the boundaryline between the ranchers range and the acres that moore had acquired jack vanished from sight here but not before wade had made sure he was dismounting  reckon he kept to that grassy ground for a reason of his ownand plainer to me than any tracks soliloquized wade as he strained his eyes at length belllounds came out of the grove and led his horse round to where wade knew there was a trail leading to and from moores cabin at this point jack mounted and rode west contrary to his usual custom which was to ride hard and fast he trotted the white horse as a cowboy might have done when going out on a days work wade had to change his position to watch belllounds and his somber gaze followed him across the hill down the slope along the willowbordered brook and so on to the opposite side of the great valley where jack began to climb in the direction of buffalo park  after belllounds had disappeared and had been gone for an hour wade went down on the other side of the hill found his horse where he had left him in a thicket and mounting he rode around to strike the trail upon which belllounds had ridden the imprint of fresh horse tracks showed clear in the soft dust and the left front track had been made by a shoe crudely triangular in shape identical with that peculiar to wilson moores horse  ahuh muttered wade in greeting to what he had expected to see well buster jack its a plain trail nowdamn your crooked soul  the hunter took up that trail and he followed it into the woods there he hesitated men who left crooked trails frequently ambushed them and belllounds had made no effort to conceal his tracks indeed he had chosen the soft open ground even after he had left the trail to take to the grassy wooded benches there were cattle here but not as many as on the more open aspen slopes across the valley after deliberating a moment wade decided that he must risk being caught trailing belllounds but he would go slowly trusting to eye and ear to outwit this strangely acting foreman of white slides ranch  to that end he dismounted and took the trail wade had not followed it far before he became convinced that belllounds had been looking in the thickets for cattle and he had not climbed another mile through the aspens and spruce before he discovered that belllounds was driving cattle thereafter wade proceeded more cautiously if the long grass had not been wet he would have encountered great difficulty in trailing belllounds evidence was clear now that he was hiding the tracks of the cattle by keeping to the grassy levels and slopes which after the sun had dried them would not leave a trace there were stretches where even the keeneyed hunter had to work to find the direction taken by belllounds but here and there in other localities there showed faint signs of cattle and horse tracks  the morning passed with wade slowly climbing to the edge of the black timber then in a hollow where a spring gushed forth he saw the tracks of a few cattle that had halted to drink and on top of these the tracks of a horse with a crooked left front shoe the rider of this horse had dismounted there was an imprint of a cowboys boot and near it little sharp circles with dots in the center  well ill be damned ejaculated wade i call that mighty cunnin here they areproofs as plain as writinthat wils moore rustled old bills cattle buster jack youre not such a fool as i thought hes made somethin like the end of wilss crutch an knowin how wils uses that every time he gets off his horse why the dirty pup carried his instrument with him an made these tracks  wade left the trail then and leading his horse to a covert of spruce he sat down to rest and think was there any reason for following belllounds farther it did not seem needful to take the risk of being discovered the forest above was open no doubt belllounds would drive the cattle somewhere and turn them over to his accomplices  buster jacks outbusted himself this time sure soliloquized wade hes doublecrossin his rustler friends same as he is moore for hes goin to blame this cattlestealin onto wils an to do that hes layin his tracks so he can follow them or so any good trailer can it doesnt concern me so much now whore his pards in this deal reckon its smith an some of his gang  suddenly it dawned upon wade that jack belllounds was stealing cattle from his father whew he whistled softly awful hard on the old man whos to tell him when all this comes out aw id hate to do it i wouldnt theres some things even id not tell  straightway this strange aspect of the case confronted wade and gripped his soul he seemed to feel himself changing inwardly as if a gray gloomy sodden hand as intangible as a ghostly dream had taken him bodily from himself and was now leading him into shadows into drear lonely dark solitude where all was cold and bleak and on and on over naked shingles that marked the world of tragedy here he must tell his tale and as he plodded on his relentless leader forced him to tell his tale anew  wade recognized this as his black mood it was a morbid dominance of the mind he fought it as he would have fought a devil and mastery still was his but his brow was clammy and his heart was leaden when he had wrested that somber mystic control from his will  reckon id do well to take up this trail tomorrow an see where it leads he said and as a gloomy man burdened with thought he retraced his way down the long slope and over the benches to the grassy slopes and aspen groves and thus to the sage hills  it was dark when he reached the cabin and moore had supper almost ready  well oldtimer you look fagged out called out the cowboy cheerily throw off your boots wash up and come and get it  pard wils im not reboundin as natural as id like i reckon ive lived some years before i got here an a lifetime since  wade you have a queer look lately observed moore shaking his head solemnly why ive seen a dying man look just like younowround the mouthbut most in the eyes  maybe the end of the long trail is white slides ranch replied wade sadly and dreamily as if to himself  if collie heard you say that exclaimed moore in anxious concern  collie an you will hear me say a lot before long returned wade but as its calculated to make you happywhy alls well im tired an hungry  wade did not choose to sit round the fire that night fearing to invite interrogation from his anxious friend and for that matter from his other inquisitively morbid self  next morning though wade felt rested and the sky was blue and full of fleecy clouds and the melody of birds charmed his ear and over all the june air seemed thick and beating with the invisible spirit he loved he sensed the oppression the nameless something that presaged catastrophe  therefore when he looked out of the door to see columbine swiftly riding up the trail her fair hair flying and shining in the sunlight he merely ejaculated ahuh  whats that queried moore sharp to catch the inflection  look out replied wade as he began to fill his pipe  heavens its collie look at her riding uphill too  wade followed him outdoors columbine was not long in arriving at the cabin and she threw the bridle and swung off in the same motion landing with a light thud then she faced them pale resolute stern all the sweetness gone to bitter strengthanother and a strange columbine  ive not slept a wink she said and i came as soon as i could get away  moore had no word for her not even a greeting the look of her had stricken him it could have only one meaning  mornin lass said the hunter and he took her hand i couldnt tell you looked sleepy for all you said lets go into the cabin  so he led columbine in and moore followed the girl manifestly was in a high state of agitation but she was neither trembling nor frightened nor sorrowful nor did she betray any lack of an unflinching and indomitable spirit wade read the truth of what she imagined was her doom in the white glow of her in the matured lines of womanhood that had come since yesternight in the sustained passion of her look  ben wilson the worst has come she announced  moore could not speak wade held columbines hand in both of his  worst now collie thats a terrible word ive heard it many times an all my life the worsts been comin an it hasnt come yet youonly twenty years oldtalkin wildthe worst has come tell me your trouble now an ill tell you where youre wrong  jacks a thiefa cattlethief rang columbines voice high and clear  ahuh well go on said wade  jack has taken money from rustlersfor cattle stolen from his father  wade felt the lift of her passion and he vibrated to it  reckon thats no news to me he replied  then she quivered up to a strong and passionate delivery of the thing that had transformed her  im going to marry jack belllounds  wilson moore leaped toward her with a cry to be held back by wades hand  now collie he soothed tell us all about it  columbine still upheld by the strength of her spirit related how she had ridden out the day before early in the afternoon in the hope of meeting wade she rode over the sage hills along the edges of the aspen benches everywhere that she might expect to meet or see the hunter but as he did not appear and as she was greatly desirous of talking with him she went on up into the woods following the line of the buffalo park trail though keeping aside from it she rode very slowly and cautiously remembering wades instructions in this way she ascended the aspen benches and the sprucebordered ridges and then the first rise of the black forest finally she had gone farther than ever before and farther than was wise  when she was about to turn back she heard the thud of hoofs ahead of her pronto shot up his ears alarmed and anxious columbine swiftly gazed about her it would not do for her to be seen yet on the other hand the chances were that the approaching horse carried wade it was lucky that she was on pronto for he could be trusted to stand still and not neigh columbine rode into a thick clump of spruces that had long shelving branches reaching down here she hid holding pronto motionless  presently the sound of hoofs denoted the approach of several horses that augmented columbines anxiety peering out of her covert she espied three horsemen trotting along the trail and one of them was jack belllounds they appeared to be in strong argument judging from gestures and emphatic movements of their heads as chance would have it they halted their horses not half a dozen rods from columbines place of concealment the two men with belllounds were roughlooking one of them evidently a leader having a dark face disfigured by a horrible scar  naturally they did not talk loud and columbine had to strain her ears to catch anything but a word distinguished here and there and accompanying actions made transparent the meaning of their presence and argument the big man refused to ride any farther evidently he had come so far without realizing it his importunities were for more head of stock his scorn was for a measly little bunch not worth the risk his anger was for bellloundss foolhardiness in leavin a trail belllounds had little to say and most of that was spoken in a tone too low to be heard his manner seemed indifferent even reckless but he wanted money the scarfaced mans name was smith then columbine gathered from smiths dogged and forceful gestures and his words no money and bigger bunch that he was unwilling to pay what had been agreed upon unless belllounds promised to bring a larger number of cattle here belllounds roundly cursed the rustler and apparently argued that course next to impossible smith made a sweeping movement with his arm pointing south indicating some place afar and part of his speech was gore peak the little man companion of smith got into the argument and dismounting from his horse he made marks upon the smooth earth of the trail he was drawing a rude map showing direction and locality at length when belllounds nodded as if convinced or now informed this third member of the party remounted and seemed to have no more to say belllounds pondered sullenly he snatched a switch from off a bough overhead and flicked his boot and stirrup with it an action that made his horse restive smith leered and spoke derisively of which speech columbine heard aw hell and yellow streak and no oned ever and son of bill belllounds and rustlin stock then this scarfaced man drew out a buckskin bag either the contempt or the gold or both overbalanced vacillation in the weak mind of jack belllounds for he lifted his head showing his face pale and malignant and without trace of shame or compunction he snatched the bag of gold shouted a hoarse all right damn you and wheeling the white mustang he spurred away quickly disappearing  the rustlers sat their horses gazing down the trail and smith wagged his dark head doubtfully then he spoke quite distinctly i aint atrustin thet belllounds pup and his comrade replied boss we aint stealin the stock so what th hell then they turned their horses and trotted out of sight and hearing up the timbered slope  columbine was so stunned and so frightened and horrified that she remained hidden there for a long time before she ventured forth then heading homeward she skirted the trail and kept to the edge of the forest making a wide detour over the hills finally reaching the ranch at sunset jack did not appear at the evening meal his father had one of his spells of depression and seemed not to have noticed her absence she lay awake all night thinking and praying  columbine concluded her narrative there and panting from her agitation and hurry she gazed at the bowed figure of moore and then at wade  i had to tell you this shameful secret she began again im forced if you do not help me if something is not done therell be a horribleend to all  well help you but how asked moore raising a white face  i dont know yet i only feeli only feel what may happen if i dont prevent it wilson you must go homeat least for a while  itll not look right for wils to leave white slides now interposed wade positively  but why oh i fear  never mind now lass its a good reason an you mustnt fear anythin i agree with youweve got to prevent thisthis thats goin to happen  oh ben my dear friend we must prevent ityou must  ahuh so i was figurin  ben you must go to jack an tell himshow him the perilfrighten him terriblyso that he will not dodo this shameful thing again  lass i reckon i could scare jack out of his skin but what good would that do  itll stop thisthis madness then ill marry himand keep him safeafter that  collie do you think marryin buster jack will stop his bustin out  oh i know it will he had conquered over the evil in him i saw that i felt it he conquered over his baser nature for love of me thenwhen he heardfrom my own lipsthat i loved wilsonwhy then he fell he didnt care he drank again he let go he sank and now hell ruin us all oh it looks as if he meant it that way but i can change him i will marry him i will love himor i will live a lie i will make him think i love him  wilson moore deadly pale faced her with flaming eyes  collie why for gods sake explain why you will shame your womanhood and ruin meall for that cowardthat thief  columbine broke from wade and ran to wilson as if to clasp him but something halted her and she stood before him  because dad will kill him she cried  my god what are you saying exclaimed moore incredulously old bill would roar and rage but hurt that boy of hisnever  wils i reckon collie is right you havent got old bill figured i know interposed wade with one of his forceful gestures  wilson listen and dont set your heart against me for i must do this thing pleaded columbine i heard dad swear hed kill jack oh ill never forget he was terrible if he ever finds out that jack stole from his own fatherstole cattle like a common rustler and sold them for gold to gamble and drink withhe will kill him thats as true as fate think how horrible that would be for me because im to blame here mostly i fell in love with you wilson moore otherwise i could have saved jack already  but its not that i think of myself dad has loved me he has been as a father to me you know hes not my real father oh if i only had a real one and i owe him so much but then its not because i owe him or because i love him its because of his own soul that splendid noble old man who has been so good to every onewho had only one fault and that love of his sonmust he be let go in blinded and insane rage at the failure of his life the ruin of his sonmust he be allowed to kill his own flesh and blood it would be murder it would damn dads soul to everlasting torment no no ill not let that be  colliehow aboutyour own soul whispered moore lifting himself as if about to expend a tremendous breath  that doesnt matter she replied  colliecollie he stammered but could not go on  then it seemed to wade that they both turned to him unconscious of the inevitableness of his relation to this catastrophe yet looking to him for the spirit the guidance that became habitual to them it brought the warm blood back to wades cold heart it was his great reward how intensely and implacably did his soul mount to that crisis  collie ill never fail you he said and his gentle voice was deep and full if jack can be scared into haltin in his mad ride to hellthen ill do it im not promisin so much for him but ill swear to you that old bellloundss hands will never be stained with his sons blood  oh ben ben she cried in passionate gratitude ill love youbless you all my life  hush lass im not one to bless an now you must do as i say go home an tell them youll marry jack in august say august thirteenth  so long oh why put it off wouldnt it be bettersafer to settle it allonce and forever  no man can tell everythin but thats my judgment  why august thirteenth she queried with strange curiosity an unlucky date  well it just happened to come to my mindthat date replied wade in his slow soft voice of reminiscence i was married on august thirteenthtwentyone years ago an collie my wife looked somethin like you isnt that strange now its a little world an shes been gone eighteen years  ben i never dreamed you ever had a wife said columbine softly with her hands going to his shoulder you must tell me of her some day but nowif you want timeif you think it bestill not marry jack till august thirteenth  thatll give me time replied wade im thinkin jack ought to bereformed lets call itbefore you marry him if all you say is truewhy we can turn him round your promise will do most so then its settled  yesdearfriends faltered the girl tremulously on the verge of a breakdown now that the ordeal was past  wilson moore stood gazing out of the door his eyes far away on the gray slopes  queer how things turn out he said dreamily august thirteenth thats about the time the columbines blow on the hills and i always meant columbinetime  here he sharply interrupted himself and the dreamy musing gave way to passion but i mean it yet illill die before i give up hope of you    chapter xvi  wade watching columbine ride down the slope on her homeward way did some of the hardest thinking he had yet been called upon to do it was not necessary to acquaint wilson moore with the deeper and more subtle motives that had begun to actuate him it would not utterly break the cowboys spirit to live in suspense columbine was safe for the present he had insured her against fatality time was all he needed possibility of an actual consummation of her marriage to jack belllounds did not lodge for an instant in wades consciousness in moores case however the present moment seemed critical what should he tell moorewhat should he conceal from him  son come in here he called to the cowboy  pard it looksbad said moore brokenly  wade looked at the tragic face and cursed under his breath  buck up its never as bad as it looks anyway we know now what to expect an thats well  moore shook his head couldnt you see how like steel collie was but im on to you wade you think by persuading collie to put that marriage off that well gain time youre gambling with time you swear buster jack will hang himself you wont quit fighting this deal  buster jack has slung the noose over a tree an hes about ready to slip his head into it replied wade  bah you drive me wild cried moore passionately how can you wheres all that feeling you seemed to have for me you nursed meyou saved my legand my life you must have cared about me but nowyou talk about that doltthat spoiled old mans petthat damned cur as if you believed hed ruin himself no such luck no such hope every day things grow worse yet the worse they grow the stronger you seem its all out of proportion its dreams wade i hate to say it but im sure youre not alwaysjust right in your mind  wils now aint that queer replied wade sadly im agreein with you  aw moore shook himself savagely and laid an affectionate and appealing arm on his friends shoulder forgive me pard its me whos out of his head but my hearts broken  thats what you think rejoined wade stoutly but a mans heart cant break in a day i know an the gods truth is buster jack will hang himself  moore raised his head sharply flinging himself back from his friend so as to scrutinize his face wade felt the piercing power of that gaze  wade what do you mean  collie told us some interestin news about jack didnt she well she didnt know what i know jack belllounds had laid a cunnin an devilish trap to prove you guilty of rustlin his fathers cattle  absurd ejaculated moore with white lips  id never given him credit for brains to hatch such a plot went on wade now listen not long ago buster jack made a remark in front of the whole outfit includin his father that the homesteaders on the range were rustlin cattle it fell sort of flat that remark but no one could calculate on his infernal cunnin i quit workin for belllounds that night an ive put my time in spyin on the boy in my day ive done a good deal of spyin but ive never run across any one slicker than buster jack to cut it shorthe got himself a whitespeckled mustang thats a dead ringer for spottie he measured the tracks of your horses left front footthe bad hoof you know an he made a shoe exactly the same as spottie wears also he made some kind of a contraption thats like the end of your crutch these he packs with him i saw him ride across the pasture to hide his tracks climb up the sage for the same reason an then hide in that grove of aspens over there near the trail you use here you can bet he changed shoes on the left front foot of his horse then he took to the trail an he left tracks for a while an then he was careful to hide them again he stole his fathers stock an drove it up over the grassy benches where even you or i couldnt track him next day but up on top when it suited him he left some horse tracks an in the mud near a springhole he gets off his horse steppin with one footan makin little circles with dots like those made by the end of your crutch then way over in the woods theres a cabin where he meets his accomplices here he leaves the same horse tracks an crutch tracks simple as a b c wils when you see how he did it but ill tell you straightif i hadnt been suspicious of buster jackthat trick of his would have made you a rustler  damn him hissed the cowboy in utter consternation and fury  ahuh thats my sentiment exactly  i swore to collie id never kill him  sure you did son an youve got to keep that oath i pin you down to it you cant break faith with collie an you dont want his bad blood on your hands  no no he replied violently of course i dont i wont but god how sweet it would be to tear out his lying tongueto  i reckon it would only dont talk about that interrupted wade bluntly you see now dont you how hes about hanged himself  no pard i dont we cant squeal that on him any more than we can squeal what collie told us  son youre young in dealin with crooked men you dont get the drift of motives buster jack is not only robbin his father an hatchin a dirty trap for you but hes doublecrossin the rustlers hes sellin the cattle to hes riskin their necks hes goin to find your tracks showin you dealt with them sure he wont give them away an hes figurin on their gettin out of it maybe by leavin the range or a shootinfray or some way the big thing with jack is that hes goin to accuse you of rustlin an show your tracks to his father well thats a risk hes given the rustlers it happens that i know this scarface smith weve met before now its easy to see from what collie heard that smith is not trustin buster jack so all underneath this jack bellloundss game theres forces workin unbeknown to him beyond his control an sure to ruin him  i see i see by heaven wade nothing else but ruin seems possible but suppose it works out his way what then what of collie  son ive not got that far along in my reckonin replied wade  but for my sakethink if buster jack gets away with his trickif he doesnt hang himself by some blunder or fit of temper or spreewhat then of collie  wade could not answer this natural and inevitable query for the reason that he had found it impossible of consideration  sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof he replied  wade youve said that before it helped me but now i need more than a few words from the bible my faith is low i  oh i tried to pray because collie told me she had prayed but what are prayers were dealing with a stubborn ironwilled old man who idolizes his son were dealing with a crazy boy absolutely selfcentered crafty and vicious wholl stop at nothing and lastly were dealing with a girl whos so noble and highsouled that shell sacrifice her allher life to pay her debt if she were really bill bellloundss daughter shed never marry jack saying of course that he was not her brother do you know that it will kill her if she marries him  ahuh i reckon it would replied wade with his head bowed moore roused his gloomy forebodings he did not care to show this feeling or the effect the cowboys pleading had upon him  ah so you admit it well then what of collie  if she marries himshell have to die i suppose replied wade  then wilson moore leaped at his friend and with ungentle hands lifted him pushed him erect  damn you wade youre not square with me you dont tell me all he cried hoarsely  now wils youre set up ive told you all i know i swear that  but you couldnt stand the thought of collie dying for that brute you couldnt oh i know i can feel some things that are hard to tell so youre either out of your head or youve something up your sleeve its hard to explain how you affect me one minute im ready to choke you for that damned strangenesswhatever it is the next minute i feel iti trust it myself wade youre notyou cant be infallible  im only a man wils an your friend i reckon you do find me queer but thats no matter now lets look at this dealeach from his own side of the fence an each actin up to his own lights you do what your conscience dictates always thinkin of collienot of yourself an ill live up to my principles can we do more  no indeed wade we cant replied moore eloquently  well then heres my hand ive talked too much i reckon an the time for talkin is past  in silence moore gripped the hand held out to him trying to read wades mind apparently once more uplifted and strengthened by that which he could not divine                                       wades observations during the following week brought forth the fact that jack belllounds was not letting any grass grow under his feet he endeavored to fulfil his agreement with smith and drove a number of cattle by moonlight these were part of the stock that the rancher had sold to buyers at kremmling and which had been collected and held in the big fenced pasture down the valley next to the andrews ranch the loss was not discovered until the cattle had been counted at kremmling then they were credited to loss by straying in driving a considerable herd of halfwild steers with an inadequate force of cowboys it was no unusual thing to lose a number  wade however was in possession of the facts not later than the day after this midnight steal in the moonlight he was forced to acknowledge that no one would have believed it possible for jack belllounds to perform a feat which might well have been difficult for the best of cowboys but jack accomplished it and got back home before daylight and wade was bound to admit that circumstantial evidence against wilson moore which of course jack belllounds would soon present would be damning and apparently irrefutable  waiting for further developments wade closely watched the ranchhouse which duty interfered with his attention to the outlying trails what he did not want to miss was being present when jack belllounds accused wilson moore of rustling cattle  so it chanced that wade was chatting with the cowboys one sunday afternoon when jack accompanied by three strangers all mounted on dusty tired horses rode up to the porch and dismounted  lem billings manifested unusual excitement  montana aint thet sheriff burley from kremmlin he queried  shore looks like him yep thets him now whats doin  the cowboys exchanged curious glances and then turned to wade  bent what do you make of thet asked lem as he waved his hand toward the house buster jack ridin up with sheriff burley  the rancher belllounds who was on the porch greeted the visitors and then they all went into the house  boys its what ive been lookin for replied wade  shore reckon we all have idees an if my idee is correct im agoin to git pretty damn sore pronto declared lem  they were all silent for a few moments meditating over this singular occurrence and watching the house presently old bill belllounds strode out upon the porch and walking out into the court he peered around as if looking for some one then he espied the little group of cowboys  hey he yelled one of you boys ride up an fetch wils moore down hyar  all right boss called lem in reply as he got up and gave a hitch to his belt  the rancher hurried back head down as if burdened  wade i reckon you want to go fetch wils queried lem  if its all the same to you id rather not replied wade  by golly i dont blame you boys shoren hell burleys after wils  wal supposn he is said montana you can gamble wils aint agoin to run id jest like to see him face thet outfit burleys a pretty square fellar an hes no fool  its as plain as your nose montana an thets shore big enough returned lem with a hard light in his eyes buster jacks busted out an hes figgered wils in some deal thets rung in the sheriff wal ill fetch wils and growling to himself the cowboy slouched off after his horse  wade got up deliberate and thoughtful and started away  say bent youre shore goin to see whats up asked montana in surprise  ill be around jim replied wade and he strolled off to be alone he wanted to think over this startling procedure of jack bellloundss wade was astonished he had expected that an accusation would be made against moore by jack and an exploitation of such proofs as had been craftily prepared but he had never imagined jack would be bold enough to carry matters so far sheriff burley was a man of wide experience keen practical shrewd he was also one of the countless men wade had rubbed elbows with in the eventful past it had been wades idea that jack would be satisfied to face his father with the accusation of moore and thus cover his tracks whatever old belllounds might have felt over the loss of a few cattle he would never have hounded and arrested a cowboy who had done well by him burley however was a sheriff and a conscientious one and he happened to be particularly set against rustlers  here was a complication of circumstances what would jack belllounds insist upon how would columbine take this plot against the honor and liberty of wilson moore how would moore himself react to it wade confessed that he was helpless to solve these queries and there seemed to be a further one insistent and gatheringwhat was to be his own attitude here that could not be answered either because only a future moment over which he had no control and which must decide events held that secret worry beset wade but he still found himself proof against the insidious gloom ever hovering near like his shadow  he waited near the trail to intercept billings and moore on their way to the ranchhouse and to his surprise they appeared sooner than it would have been reasonable to expect them wade stepped out of the willows and held up his hand he did not see anything unusual in moores appearance  wils i reckon wed do well to talk this over said wade  talk what over queried the cowboy sharply  illustration jack belllounds she cried you put the sheriff on that trail  why old bills sendin for you an the fact of sheriff burley bein here  talk nothing lets see what they want and then talk pard you remember the agreement we made not long ago  sure but im sort of worried an maybe  you neednt worry about me come on interrupted moore id like you to be there and lem fetch the boys  i shore will an if you need any backin youll git it  when they reached the open lem turned off toward the corrals and wade walked beside moores horse up to the house  belllounds appeared at the door evidently having heard the sound of hoofs  hello moore get down an come in he said gruffly  belllounds if its all the same to you ill take mine in the open replied the cowboy coolly  the rancher looked troubled he did not have the ease and force habitual to him in big moments  come out hyar you men he called in the door  voices heavy footsteps the clinking of spurs preceded the appearance of the three strangers followed by jack belllounds the foremost was a tall man in black sandyhaired and freckled with clear gray eyes and a drooping mustache that did not hide stern lips and rugged chin he wore a silver star on his vest packed a gun in a greasy holster worn low down on his right side and under his left arm he carried a package  it suited wade then to step forward and if he expected surprise and pleasure to break across the sheriffs stern face he certainly had not reckoned in vain  wal im a sonofagun ejaculated burley bending low with quick movement to peer at wade  howdy jim hows tricks said wade extending his hand and the smile that came so seldom illumined his sallow face  hellbent wade as im a born sinner shouted the sheriff and his hand leaped out to grasp wades and grip it and wring it his face worked my gawd im glad to see you oldtimer wal you havent changed at all ten years how time flies an its shore you  same jim an powerful glad to meet you replied wade  shake hands with bridges an lindsay said burley indicating his two comrades stockmen from grand lake boys youve heerd me talk about him wade an i was both in the old fight at blairs ranch on the gunnison an ive shore reason to recollect him wade whatre you doin up in these diggins  drifted over last fall jim an have been huntin varmints for belllounds replied wade cleaned the range up fair to middlin an since i quit belllounds ive been hangin round with my young pard here wils moore an interestin myself in lookin up cattle tracks  burleys back was toward belllounds and his son so it was impossible for them to see the sudden little curious light that gleamed in his eyes as he looked hard at wade and then at moore  wils moore how dye do i reckon i remember you though i dont ride up this way much of late years  the cowboy returned the greeting civilly enough but with brevity  belllounds cleared his throat and stepped forward his manner showed he had a distasteful business at hand  moore i sent for you on a serious matter im sorry to say  well here i am what is it returned the cowboy with clear hazel eyes full of fire steady on the old ranchers  jack you know is foreman of white slides now an hes made a charge against you  then let him face me with it snapped moore  jack belllounds came forward hands in his pockets selfpossessed even a little swaggering and his pale face and bold eyes showed the gravity of the situation and his mastery over it  wade watched this meeting of the rivals and enemies with an attention powerfully stimulated by the penetrating scrutiny burley laid upon them jack did not speak quickly he looked hard into the tense face of moore wade detected a vibration of jacks frame and a gleam of eye that showed him not wholly in control of exultation and revenge fear had not struck him yet  well buster jack whats the charge demanded moore impatiently  the old name sharply flung at jack by this cowboy seemed to sting and reveal and inflame but he restrained himself as with roving glance he searched moores person for sight of a weapon the cowboy was unarmed  i accuse you of stealing my fathers cattle declared jack in low husky accents after he got the speech out he swallowed hard  moores face turned a dead white for a fleeting instant a red and savage gleam flamed in his steady glance then it vanished  the cowboys who had come up moved restlessly lem billings dropped his head muttering montana jim froze in his tracks  moores dark eyes scornful and piercing never moved from jacks face it seemed as if the cowboy would never speak again  you call me thief you at length he exclaimed  yes i do replied belllounds loudly  before this sheriff and your father you accuse me of stealing cattle  yes  and you accuse me before this man who saved my life who knows mebefore hellbent wade demanded moore as he pointed to the hunter  mention of wade in that significant tone of passion and wonder was not without effect upon jack belllounds  what in hell do i care for wade he burst out with the old intolerance yes i accuse you thief rustler and for all i know your precious hellbent wade may be  he was interrupted by burleys quick and authoritative interference  hyar young man im allowin for your natural feelins he said dryly but i advise you to bite your tongue i aint acquainted with mister moore but i happen to know wade do you savvy wal then if youve any more to say to moore get it over  ive had my say replied belllounds sullenly  on what grounds do you accuse me demanded moore  i trailed you ive got my proofs  burley stepped off the porch and carefully laid down his package  moore will you get off your hoss he asked and when the cowboy had dismounted and limped aside the sheriff continued is this the hoss you ride most  hes the only one i have  burley sat down upon the edge of the porch and carefully unwrapping the package he disclosed some pieces of hardbaked yellow mud the smaller ones bore the imprint of a circle with a dot in the center very clearly defined the larger piece bore the imperfect but reasonably clear track of a curiously shaped horseshoe somewhat triangular the sheriff placed these pieces upon the ground then he laid hold of moores crutch which was carried like a rifle in a sheath hanging from the saddle and drawing it forth he carefully studied the round cap on the end next he inserted this end into both the little circles on the pieces of mud they fitted perfectly the cowboys bent over to get a closer view and billings was wagging his head old belllounds had an earnest eye for them also burleys next move was to lift the left front foot of moores horse and expose the bottom to view evidently the white mustang did not like these proceedings but he behaved himself the iron shoe on this hoof was somewhat triangular in shape when burley held the larger piece of mud with its imprint close to the hoof it was not possible to believe that this iron shoe had not made the triangularshaped track  burley let go of the hoof and laid the pieces of mud down slowly the other men straightened up some one breathed hard  moore what do them tracks look like to you asked the sheriff  they look like mine replied the cowboy  they are yours  im not denying that  i cut them pieces of mud from beside a waterhole over hyar under gore peak wed trailed the cattle belllounds lost an then we kept on trailin them clear to the road that goes over the ridge to elgeria now bridges an lindsay hyar bought stock lately from strange cattlemen who didnt give no clear idee of their range jest buyin an sellin they claimed i reckon the extra hoss tracks we run across at gore peak connects up them buyers an sellers with whoever drove bellloundss cattle up thar have you anythin more to say  no not here replied moore quietly  then ill have to arrest you an take you to kremmlin fer trial  all right ill go  the old rancher seemed genuinely shocked red tinged his cheek and a flame flared in his eyes  wils you done me dirt he said wrathfully an i always swore by you make a clean breast of the whole damn bizness if you want me to treat you white you must have been locoed or drunk to doublecross me thet way come on out with it  ive nothing to say replied moore  you act amazin strange fer a cowboy ive knowed to lean toward fightin at the drop of a hat i tell you speak out an ill do right by you i aint forgettin thet white slides gave you a hard knock an i was young once an had hot blood  the old ranchers wrathful pathos stirred the cowboy to a strainingpoint of his unnatural almost haughty composure he seemed about to break into violent utterance grief and horror and anger seemed at the back of his trembling lips the look he gave belllounds was assuredly a strange one to come from a cowboy who was supposed to have stolen his former employers cattle whatever he might have replied was cut off by the sudden appearance of columbine  dad i heard you she cried as she swept upon them fearful and wideeyed what has wilson moore donethat youll do right by him  collie go back in the house he ordered  no theres something wrong here she said with mounting dread in the swift glance she shot from man to man oh youresheriff burley she gasped  i reckon i am miss an if young moores a friend of yours im sorry i came replied burley  wade himself reacted subtly and thrillingly to the presence of the girl she was alive keen strung growing white with darkening eyes of blue fire beginning to grasp intuitively the meaning here  my friend he was more than thatnot long ago what has he done why are you here  miss im arrestin him  oh for what  rustlin your fathers cattle  for a moment columbine was speechless then she burst out oh theres a terrible mistake  miss columbine i shore hope so replied burley much embarrassed and distressed like most men of his kind he could not bear to hurt a woman but it looks bad fer moore see hyar there look at the tracks of his hossleft front footshoe all crooked thets his hosss he acknowledges thet an see hyar look at the little circles an dots i found these way over at gore peak with the tracks of the stolen cattle an no other tracks miss columbine  who put you on that trail she asked piercingly  jack hyar he found it fust an rode to kremmlin fer me  jack jack belllounds she cried bursting into wild and furious laughter like a tigress she leaped at jack as if to tear him to pieces you put the sheriff on that trail you accuse wilson moore of stealing dads cattle  yes and i proved it replied jack hoarsely  you you proved it so thats your revenge but youre to reckon with me jack belllounds you villain you devil you suddenly she shrank back with a strong shudder she gasped her face grew ghastly white oh my god  horribleunspeakable she covered her face with her hands and every muscle of her seemed to contract until she was stiff then her hands shot out to moore  wilson moore what have you to sayto this sheriffto jack bellloundsto me  moore bent upon her a gaze that must have pierced her soul so like it was to a lightning flash of love and meaning and eloquence  collie theyve got the proof ill take my medicine your dad is good hell be easy on me  you lie she whispered and i will tell why you lie  moore did not show the shame and guilt that should have been natural with his confession but he showed an agony of distress his hand sought wade and dragged at him  it did not need this mute appeal to tell wade that in another moment columbine would have flung the shameful truth into the face of jack belllounds she was rising to that she was terrible and beautiful to see  collie said wade with that voice he knew had strange power over her with a clasp of her outflung hand no more this is a mans game its not for a woman to judge not here its wilss gamean its mine im his friend whatever his trouble or guilt i take it on my shoulders an it will be as if it were not  moaning and wringing her hands columbine staggered with the burden of the struggle in her  im quitequite mador dreaming oh ben she cried  brace up collie its sure hard wils your friend and playmate so many yearsits hard to believe we all understand collie now you go in an dont listen to any more or look any more  he led her down the porch to the door of her room and as he pushed it open he whispered i will save you collie an wils an the old man you call dad  then he returned to the silent group in the yard  jim if i answer fer wils moore bein in kremmlin the day you say will you leave him with me  wal i shore will wade replied burley heartily  i object to that interposed jack belllounds stridently he confessed hes got to go to jail  wal my hottempered young fellar thar aint any jail nearer n denver did you know that returned burley with his dry grim humor moores under arrest an hell be as well off hyar with wade as with me in kremmlin an a damn sight happier  the cowboy had mounted and wade walked beside him as he started homeward they had not progressed far when wades keen ears caught the words say belllounds i got it figgered thet you an your son dont savvy this fellar wade  wal i reckon not replied the old rancher  and his son let out a peal of laughter bitter and scornful and unsatisfied    chapter xvii  gore peak was the highest point of the black range that extended for miles westward from buffalo park it was a rounded dome covered with timber and visible as a landmark from the surrounding country all along the eastern slope of that range an unbroken forest of spruce and pine spread down to the edge of the valley this valley narrowed toward its source which was buffalo park a few wellbeaten trails crossed that country one following red brook down to kremmling another crossing from the park to white slides and another going over the divide down to elgeria the only wellknown trail leading to gore peak was a branchoff from the valley and it went round to the south and more accessible side of the mountain  all that immense slope of timbered ridges benches ravines and swales west of buffalo park was exceedingly wild and rough country here the buffalo took to cover from hunters and were safe until they ventured forth into the parks again elk and deer and bear made this forest their home  bent wade hunter now for bigger game than wild beasts of the range left his horse at lewiss cabin and penetrated the dense forest alone like a deerstalker or an indian in his movements lewis had acted as scout for wade and had ridden furiously down to sage valley with news of the rustlers wade had accompanied him back to buffalo park that night riding in the dark there were urgent reasons for speed jack belllounds had ridden to kremmling and the hunter did not believe he would return by the road he had taken  fox wades favorite dog much to his disgust was left behind with lewis the bloodhound kane accompanied wade kane had been illtreated and then beaten by jack belllounds and he had left white slides to take up his home at moores cabin and at last he had seemed to reconcile himself to the hunter not with love but without distrust kane never forgave but he recognized his friend and master wade carried his rifle and a buckskin pouch containing meat and bread his belt heavily studded with shells contained two guns both now worn in plain sight with the one on the right side hanging low wades character seemed to have undergone some remarkable change yet what he represented then was not unfamiliar  he headed for the concealed cabin on the edge of the high valley under the black brow of gore peak it was early morning of a july day with summer fresh and new to the forest along the park edges the birds and squirrels were holding carnival the grass was crisp and bediamonded with sparkling frost tracks of game showed sharp in the white patches wade paused once listening ah that most beautiful of forest melodies for himthe bugle of an elk clear resonant penetrating with these qualities held and blended by a note of wildness it rang thrillingly through all wades being the hound listened but was not interested he kept close beside the hunter or at his heels a stealthily stepping warily glancing hound not scenting the fourfooted denizens of the forest he expected his master to put him on the trail of men  the distance from the park to gore peak as a crow would have flown was not great but wade progressed slowly he kept to the dense parts of the forest he avoided the open aisles the swales the glades the high ridges the rocky ground when he came to the elgeria trail he was not disappointed to find it smooth untrodden by any recent travel half a mile farther on through the forest however he encountered tracks of three horses made early the day before still farther on he found cattle and horse tracks now growing old and dim these tracks pointed toward elgeria were like words of a printed page to wade  about noon he climbed a rocky eminence that jutted out from a slowdescending ridge and from this vantagepoint he saw down the wavering black and green bosom of the mountain slope a narrow valley almost hidden gleamed yellow in the sunlight at the edge of this valley a faint column of blue smoke curled upward  ahuh muttered the hunter as he looked the hound whined and pushed a cool nose into wades hand  then wade resumed his noiseless and stealthy course through the woods he began a descent leading off somewhat to the right of the point where the smoke had arisen the presence of the rustlers in the cabin was of importance yet not so paramount as another possibility he expected jack belllounds to be with them or meet them there and that was the thing he wanted to ascertain when he got down below the little valley he swung around to the left to cross the trail that came up from the main valley some miles still farther down he found it and was not surprised to see fresh horse tracks made that morning he recognized those tracks jack belllounds was with the rustlers come no doubt to receive his pay  then the change in wade and the actions of a trailer of men became more singularly manifest he reverted to some former habit of mind and body he was as slow as a shadow absolutely silent and the gaze that roved ahead and all around must have taken note of every living thing of every moving leaf or fern or bough the hound with hair curling up stiff on his back stayed close to wade watching listening and stepping with him certainly wade expected the rustlers to have some one of their number doing duty as an outlook so he kept uphill above the cabin and made his careful way through the thicket coverts which at that place were dense and matted clumps of jackpine and spruce at last he could see the cabin and the narrow grassy valley just beyond to his relief the horses were unsaddled and grazing no man was in sight but there might be a dog the hunter in his slow advance used keen and unrelaxing vigilance and at length he decided that if there had been a dog he would have been tied outside to give an alarm  wade had now reached his objective point he was some eighty paces from the cabin in line with an open aisle down which he could see into the cleared space before the door on his left were thick small spruces with lowspreading branches and they extended all the way to the cabin on that side and in fact screened two walls of it wade knew exactly what he was going to do no longer did he hesitate laying down his rifle he tied the hound to a little spruce patting him and whispering for him to stay there and be still  then wades action in looking to his beltguns was that of a man who expected to have recourse to them speedily and by whom the necessity was neither regretted nor feared stooping low he entered the thicket of spruces the soft sprucematted ground devoid of brush or twig did not give forth the slightest sound of step nor did the brushing of the branches against his body in some cases he had to bend the boughs thus swiftly and silently with the gliding steps of an indian he approached the cabin till the brownbarked logs loomed before him shutting off the clearer light  he smelled a mingling of wood and tobacco smoke he heard low deep voices of men the shuffling and patting of cards the musical click of gold resting on his knees a moment the hunter deliberated all was exactly as he had expected luck favored him these gamblers would be absorbed in their game the door of the cabin was just around the corner and he could glide noiselessly to it or gain it in a few leaps either method would serve but which he must try depended upon the position of the men inside and that of their weapons  rising silently wade stepped up to the wall and peeped through a chink between the logs the sunshine streamed through windows and door jack belllounds sat on the ground full in its light back to the wall he was in his shirtsleeves the gambling fever and the grievous soreness of a loser shone upon his pale face smith sat with back to wade opposite belllounds the other men completed the square all were close enough together to reach comfortably for the cards and gold before them wades keen eyes took this in at a single glance and then steadied searchingly for smaller features of the scene belllounds had no weapon smiths belt and gun lay in the sunlight on the hard clay floor out of reach except by violent effort the other two rustlers both wore their weapons wade gave a long scrutiny to the faces of these comrades of smith and evidently satisfied himself as to what he had to expect from them  wade hesitated then stooping low he softly swept aside the intervening boughs of spruce glided out of the thicket into the open two noiseless bounds another and he was inside the door  howdy rustlers dont move he called  the surprise of his appearance or his voice or both stunned the four men belllounds dropped his cards and his jaw dropped at the same instant these were absolutely the only visible movements  im in talkin humor an the longer you listen the longer youll have to live said wade but dont move  we aint movin burst out smith whore you an what dye want  it was singular that the rustler leader had not had a look at wade whose movements had been swift and who now stood directly behind him also it was obvious that smith was sitting very stiffnecked and straight not improbably he had encountered such situations before  whore you he shouted hoarsely  you ought to know me the voice was wades gentle cold with depth and ring in it  ive heerd your voice somewharsill gamble on thet  sure you ought to recognize my voice cap returned wade  the rustler gave a violent starta start that he controlled instantly  cap you callin me thet  sure were old friendscap folsom  in the silence then the rustlers hard breathing could be heard his neck bulged red only the eyes of his two comrades moved belllounds began to recover somewhat from his consternation fear had clamped him also but not fear of personal harm or peril his mind had not yet awakened to that  youve got me pat but whore you said folsom huskily  wade kept silent  whon hell is thet man yelled the rustler it was not a query to his comrades any more than to the four winds it was a furious questioning of a memory that stirred and haunted and as well a passionate and fearful denial  his names wade put in belllounds harshly hes the friend of wils moore hes the hunter i told you aboutworked for my father last winter  wade what wade you never told me his name it aintit aint  yes it is cap interrupted wade its the old boy that spoiled your handsome muglong ago  hellbent wade gasped folsom in terrible accents he shook all over an ashen paleness crept into his face instinctively his right hand jerked toward his gun then as in his former motion froze in the very act  careful cap warned wade itd be a shame not to hear me talk a little turn around now an greet an old pard of the gunnison days  folsom turned as if a resistless heavy force was revolving his head  by gawd wade he ejaculated the tone of his voice the light in his eyes must have been a spiritual acceptance of a dreadful and irrefutable factperhaps the proximity of death but he was no coward despite the hunters order given as he stood there gun drawn and ready folsom wheeled back again savagely to throw the deck of cards in bellloundss face he cursed horribly you spoiled brat of a rich rancher whyn hell didnt you tell me thet varminthunter was wade  i did tell you shouted belllounds flaming of face  youre a liar you never said wadewade right out so id hear it an id never passed by hellbent wade  aw that name made me tired replied belllounds contemptuously  haw haw haw bawled the rustler made you tired hey think youre funny wal if you knowed how many men thet names made tiredan

some interestin stuff about this buster jack now will you be quiet an listenan answer for your pards  wade i answer fer no man but so far as ive noticed my pards aint hankerin to make any loud noise folsom replied indicating his comrades with sarcasm  the redbearded one a man of large frame and gaunt face wicked and wildlooking spoke out say smith or whatever the hells yore right handleis this hyar a game were playin  i reckon an if you turn a trick youll be damn lucky growled folsom  the other rustler did not speak he was small swarthyfaced with sloeblack eyes and matted hair evidently a white man with mexican blood keen strung furtive he kept motionless awaiting events  buster jack these new pards of yours are lowdown rustlers an one of thems worse as i could prove said wade but compared with you theyre all gentlemen  belllounds leered but he was losing his bravado something began to dawn upon his obtuse consciousness  what do i care for you or your gabby talk he flashed sullenly  youll care when i tell these rustlers how you doublecrossed them  belllounds made a spring like that of a wolf in a trap but when halfway up he slipped the rustler on his right kicked him and he sprawled down again back to the wall  buster look into this called wade and he leveled the gun that quivered momentarily like a compass needle and then crashed fire and smoke the bullet spat into a log but it had cut the lobe of bellloundss ear bringing blood his face turned a ghastly livid hue all in a second terror possessed himshuddering primitive terror of death  folsom hawhawed derisively and in crude delight say buster jack dont get any idee thet my ole pard wade was shootin at your head aw no  the other rustlers understood then if belllounds had not that the situation was in control of a man not in any sense ordinary  cap did you know buster jack accused my friend wils moore of stealin these cattle youre sellin asked wade deliberately  what cattle did you say asked the rustler as if he had not heard aright  the cattle buster jack stole from his father an sold to you  wal now bent wade at his old tricks i might have knowed it once i seen you naw id no idee belllounds

love of a girl that jack wants  ho ho quite romantic i declare say thars some damn queer notions im gettin about you buster jack  belllounds lay propped against the wall sagging there laboring of chest sweating of face the boldness of brow held because it was fixed but that of his eyes had gone and his mouth and chin showed craven weakness he stared in dread suspense at wade  listen an all of you sit tight went on wade swiftly jack stole the cattle from his father hes a thief at heart but he had a double motive he left a trailhe left tracks behind he made a crooked horseshoe like that wils moores horse wears an he put that on his own horse an he made a contraptiona little iron ring with a dot in it an he left the crooked shoe tracks an he left the little ring tracks  by gawd i seen them

belllounds wade put a gun in my handa gun with two shellsor only one you can stand with your gun at my head let me kill this skunk  for all belllounds could tell death was indeed close no trace of a belllounds was apparent about him then and his face was a horrid spectacle for a man to be forced to see a froth foamed over his hanging lower lip  cap i aint trustin you with a gun just this particular minute said wade  folsom then bawled his curses to his comrades   kill him throw your guns an bore himright in them bulgin eyes im tellin youweve gotta fight anyhow were agoin to cash right hyar but kill him first  neither of folsoms lieutenants yielded to the fierce exhortation of their leader or to their own evilly expressed passions it was wade who dominated them then ensued a silence fraught with suspense growing more charged every long instant the balance here seemed about to be struck  wade ive been a gambler all my life an a damn smart one if i do say it myself declared the rustler leader his voice inharmonious with the facetiousness of his words an ill make a last bet  go ahead cap whatll you bet answered the cold voice still gentle but different now in its inflection  by gawd ill bet all the gold hyar that hellbent wade wouldnt shoot any man in the back  you win  slowly and stiffly the rustler rose to his feet when he reached his height he deliberately swung his leg to kick belllounds in the face  thar id like to have a reckonin with you buster jack he said i aint dealin the cards hyar but somethin tells me thet shaky as i am in my boots id liefer be in mine than yours  with that and expelling a heavy breath he wrestled around to confront the hunter  wade ive no hunch to your game but its slowern i recollect you  why cap i was in a talkin humor replied wade  hell youre up to some dodge whatd you care fer my learnin thet pup had doublecrossed me you wont let me kill him  i reckon i wanted him to learn what real men thought of him  ahuh wal an now ive onlightened him whats the next deal  youll all go to kremmlin with me an ill turn you over to sheriff burley  that was the gauntlet thrown down by wade it was not unexpected and acceptance seemed a relief folsoms eyeballs became living fire with the desperate gleam of the reckless chances of life cutthroat he might have been but he was brave and he proved the significance of wades attitude  pards hyars to luck he rang out hoarsely and with pantherish quickness he leaped for his gun  a tense surcharged instantthen all four men as if released by some galvanized current of rapidity flashed into action guns boomed in unison spurts of red clouds of smoke ringing reports and hoarse cries filled the cabin wade had fired as he leaped there was a thudding patter of lead upon the walls the hunter flung himself prostrate behind the bough framework that had served as bedstead it was made of spruce boughs thick and substantial wade had not calculated falsely in estimating it as a bulwark of defense pulling his second gun he peeped from behind the covert  smoke was lifting and drifting out of door and windows the atmosphere cleared belllounds sagged against the wall pallid with protruding eyes of horror on the scene before him the darkskinned little man lay writhing all at once a tremor stilled his convulsions his body relaxed limply as if by magic his hand loosened on the smoking gun folsom was on his knees reeling and swaying waving his gun peering like a drunken man for some lost object his temple appeared half shot away a bloody and horrible sight  pards i got him he said in strange halfstrangled whisper i got him hellbent wade my respects ill meet youthar  his reeling motion brought his gaze in line with belllounds the violence of his start sent drops of blood flying from his gory temple  ahuh the cards runmy way belllounds hyars to yourlyin eyes  the gun wavered and trembled and circled folsom strained in last terrible effort of will to aim it straight he fired the bullet tore hair from bellloundss head but missed him again the rustler aimed and the gun wavered and shook he pulled trigger the hammer clicked upon an empty chamber with low and gurgling cry of baffled rage folsom dropped the gun and sank face forward slowly stretching out  the redbearded rustler had leaped behind the stone chimney that all but hid his body the position made it difficult for him to shoot because his gunhand was on the inside and he had to press his body tight to squeeze it behind the corner of ragged stone wade had the advantage he was lying prone with his right hand round the corner of the framework an overhang of the boughends above protected his head when he peeped out while he watched for a chance to shoot he loaded his empty gun with his left hand the rustler strained and writhed his body twisting his neck and suddenly darting out his head and arm he shot his bullet tore the overhang of boughs above wades face and wades answering shot just a second too late chipped the stone corner where the rustlers face had flashed out the bullet glancing hummed out of the window it was a close shave the rustler let out a hissing inarticulate cry he was trapped in his effort to press in closer he projected his left elbow beyond the corner of the chimney wades quick shot shattered his arm  there was no asking or offering of quarter here this was the old feud of the westof the vicious and the righteous in strifeboth reared in the same stern school the rustler gave his body such contortion that he was twisted almost clear around with his right hand over his left shoulder he punched the muzzle of his gun into a crack between two stones and he pried to open them the dry clay cement crumbled the crack widened sighting along the barrel he aimed it with the narrow strip of wades shoulder that was visible above the framework then he shot and hit wade shrank flatter and closer hiding himself to better advantage the rustler made his great blunder then for in that moment he might have rushed out and killed his adversary but instead he shot againanother timea third and his heavy bullets tore and splintered the boughs dangerously close to the hunters head then came an awkward almost hopeless task for the rustler in maintaining his position while reloading his gun he did it and his panting attested to the labor and pain it cost him  so much in fact that he let his knee protrude wade fired breaking that knee the rustler sagged in his tracks his hip stuck out to afford a target for the remorseless wade still the doomed man did not cry out though it was evident that he could not now keep his body from sagging into sight of the hunter then with a desperate courage worthy of a better cause and with a spirit great in its defeat the rustler plunged out from his hidingplace gun extended his red beard his gaunt face fierce and baleful his wabbling plunge that was really a fall made a sight which was terrible he hopped out of that fall his gun began to blaze but it only matched the blazes of wades and the rustler pitched headlong over the framework falling heavily against the wall beyond  then there was silence for a long moment wade stirred as if to look around belllounds also stirred and gulped as if to breathe the three prostrate rustlers lay inert their positions singularly tragic and settled the smoke again began to lift to float out of the door and windows in another moment the big room seemed less hazy  wade rose not without effort and he had a gun in each hand those hands were bloody there was blood on his face and his left shoulder was red he approached belllounds  wade was terrible thenterrible with a ruthlessness that was no pretense to belllounds it must have represented deatha bloody death which he was not prepared to meet  come out of your trance you pup rustler yelled wade  for gods sake dont kill me implored belllounds stricken with terror  why not look around my busy day buster an for that cap folsom its been ten years comin im goin to shoot you in the belly an watch you get sick to your stomach  belllounds with whisper and hands and face begged for his life in an abjectness of sheer panic  what roared the hunter didnt you know i come to kill you  yesyes ive seenthat its awful i never harmed you dont kill me let me live wade i swear to god illill never do it again for dads sakefor collies sakedont kill me  im hellbent wade you wouldnt listen to themwhen they wanted to tell you who i am  every word of wades drove home to this boy the primal meaning of sudden death it inspired him with an unutterable fear that was what clamped his brow in a sweaty band and upreared his hair and rolled his eyeballs his magnified intelligence almost ghastly grasped a hope in wades apparent vacillation and in the utterance of the name of columbine intuition a subtle sense inspired him to beg in that name  swear youll give up collie demanded wade brandishing his guns with bloody hands  yesyes my god ill do anything moaned belllounds  swear youll tell your father youd had a change of heart youll give collie up let moore have her  i swear but if you tell dadi stole his cattlehell do for me  we wont squeal that ill save you if you give up the girl once more buster jacktry an make me believe youll square the deal  belllounds had lost his voice but his mute fluttering lips were infinite proof of the vow he could not speak the boyishness the stunted moral force replaced the manhood in him then he was only a factor in the lives of others protected even from this nemesis by the greatness of his fathers love  get up an take my scarf said wade an bandage these bulletholes i got    chapter xviii  wades wounds were not in any way serious and with bellloundss assistance he got to the cabin of lewis where weakness from loss of blood made it necessary that he remain belllounds went home  the next day wade sent lewis with packhorse down to the rustlers cabin to bury the dead men and fetch back their effects lewis returned that night accompanied by sheriff burley and two deputies who had been busy on their own account they had followed horse tracks from the waterhole under gore peak to the scene of the fight and had arrived to find lewis there burley had appropriated the considerable amount of gold which he said could be identified by cattlemen who had bought the stolen cattle  when opportunity afforded burley took advantage of it to speak to wade when the others were out of earshot  thar was another man in thet cabin when the fight come off announced the sheriff an he come up hyar with you  jim youre locoed replied wade  the sheriff laughed and his shrewd eyes had a kindly curious gleam  next youll be givin me a hunch thet youre in a fever an out of your head  jim im not as clearheaded as i might be  wal tell me or not jest as you like i seen his tracksfollered them an wade old pard ive reckoned long ago thars a nigger in the woodpile  sure an you know me id take it friendly of you to put moores trial off fer a whiletill im able to ride to krernmlin maybe then i can tell you a story  burley threw up his hands in genuine apprehension not much you aint agoin to tell me no story but ill wait on you an welcome reckon i owe you a good deal on this rustler roundup wade thet must have been a mansized fight even fer you i picked up twentysix empty shells an the little halfbreed had one empty shell an five loaded ones in his gun you must have got him quick hey  jim im observin youre a heap more curious than ever an you always was an inquisitive cuss complained wade i dont recollect what happened  wal wal have it your own way replied burley with good nature now wade ill pitch camp hyar in the park tonight an tomorrer ill ride down to white slides on my way to kremmlin whatre you wantin me to tell belllounds  the hunter pondered a moment  reckon its just as well that you tell him somethin you can say the rustlers are done for an that hell get his stock back id like you to tell him that the rustlers were more to blame than wils moore just say that an nothin else about wils dont mention about your suspectin there was another man around when the fight come off tell the cowboys that ill be down in a few days an if you happen to get a chance for a word alone with miss collie just say im not bad hurt an that all will be well  ahuh burley grunted out the familiar exclamation he did not say any more then but he gazed thoughtfully down upon the pale hunter as if that strange individual was one infinitely to respect but never to comprehend                                       wades wounds healed quickly nevertheless it was more than several days before he felt spirit enough to undertake the ride he had to return to white slides but he was reluctant to do so memory of jack belllounds dragged at him and when he drove it away it continually returned this feeling was almost equivalent to an augmentation of his gloomy foreboding which ever hovered on the fringe of his consciousness but one morning he started early and riding very slowly with many rests he reached the sage valley cabin before sunset moore saw him coming yelled his delight and concern and almost lifted him off the horse wade was too tired to talk much but he allowed himself to be fed and put to bed and worked over  boots on the other foot now pard said moore with delight at the prospect of returning service say youre all shot up and its i wholl be nurse  wils ill be around tomorrow replied the hunter have you heard any news from down below  sure ive met lem every night  then he related burleys version of wades fight with the rustlers in the cabin from the sheriffs lips the story gained much old bill belllounds had received the news in a singular mood he offered no encomiums to the victor contrary to his usual custom of lauding every achievement of labor or endurance he now seemed almost to regret the affray jack belllounds had returned from kremmling and he was present when burley brought news of the rustlers what he thought none of the cowboys vouchsafed to say but he was drunk the next day and he lost a handful of gold to them never had he gambled so recklessly indeed it was as if he hated the gold he lost little had been seen of columbine but little was sufficient to make the cowboys feel concern  wade made scarcely any comment upon this news from the ranch next day however he was up and caring for himself and he told moore about the fight and how he had terrorized belllounds and exhorted the promises from him  never in gods world will buster jack live up to those promises cried moore with absolute conviction i know him ben he meant them when he made them hed swear his soul awaythen next day hed lie or forget or betray  im not believin that till i know replied the hunter gloomily but im afraid of him ive known bad men to change theres a grain of good in all mensomethin divine an it comes out now an then men rise on steppinstones of their dead selves to higher things this is bellloundss chance for the good in him if its not there he will do as you say if it isthat scare he had will be the turninpoint in his life im hopin but im afraid  ben you wait and see said moore earnestly heaven knows im not one to lose hope for my fellowmenhope for the higher things youve taught me but human nature is human nature jack cant give collie up just the same as i cant thats selfpreservation as well as love                                       the day came when wade walked down to white slides there seemed to be a fever in his blood which he tried to convince himself was a result of his wounds instead of the condition of his mind it was sunday a day of sunshine and squall of azureblue sky and great sailing purple clouds the sage of the hills glistened and there was a sweetness in the air  the cowboys made much of wade but the old rancher seeing him from the porch abruptly went into the house no one but wade noticed this omission of courtesy directly columbine appeared waving her hand and running to meet him  dad saw you he told me to come out and excuse him oh ben im so happy to see you you dont look hurt at all what a fight you had oh i was sick but let me forget that how are you and hows wils  thus she babbled until out of breath  collie its sure good to see you said wade feeling the old rich thrill at her presence im comin on tolerable well i wasnt bad hurt but i bled a lot an i reckon im older n i was when packin gunshot holes was nothin every year tells only a man doesnt know till after an how are you collie  her blue eyes clouded and a tremor changed the expression of her sweet lips  i am unhappy ben she said but what could we expect it might be worse for instance you might have been killed ive much to be thankful for  i reckon so we all have i fetched a message from wils but i oughtnt tell it  please do she begged wistfully  well wils says tell collie i love her every day more an more an that my love keeps up my courage an my belief in god an if she ever marries jack belllounds she can come up to visit my grave among the columbines on the hill  strange how wade experienced comfort in thus torturing her she was rosy at the beginning of his speech and white at its close oh its true its true she whispered itll kill him as it will me  cheer up columbine said wade its a long time till august thirteenth an now tell me why did old bill run when he saw me comin  ben i suspect dad has the queerest notion you want to tell him some awful bloody story about the rustlers  ahuh well not yet an hows jack belllounds actin these days  wade felt the momentousness of that query but it seemed her face had been telltale enough without confirmation of words  my friend somehow i hate to tell you youre always so hopeful so ready to think good instead of evil but jack has been rough with me almost brutal he was drunk once every day he drinks sometimes a little sometimes more but drink changes him and its dragging dad down dad doesnt say so yet i feel hes afraid of what will come next jack has nagged me to marry him right off he wanted to the day he came back from kremmling hes eager to leave white slides dad knows that also and it worries him but of course i refused  the presence of columbine so vivid and sweet and stirring and all about her the sunlight the golden gleams on the sage hills and wades heart and brain and spirit sustained a subtle transformation it was as if what had been beautiful with light had suddenly strangely darkened then wade imagined he stood alone in a gloomy house which was his own heart and he was listening to the arrival of a tragic messenger whose foot sounded heavy on the stairs whose hand turned slowly upon the knob whose gray presence opened the door and crossed the threshold  buster jack didnt break off with you collie asked the hunter  break off with me no indeed whatever possessed you to say that  an he didnt offer to give you up to wils moore  ben are you crazy cried columbine  collie listen ill tell you the old urge knocked at wades mind buster jack was in the cabin gamblin with the rustlers when i cornered them you remember i meant to scare buster jack within an inch of his life well i made use of my opportunity i worked up the rustlers then i told jack id give away his secret he made to jump an run i reckon but he hadnt the nerve i shot a piece out of his ear just to begin the fun an then i told the rustlers how jack had doublecrossed them folsom the boss rustler roared like a mad steer he was wild to kill jack he begged for a gun to shoot out jacks eyes an so were the other rustlers burnin to kill him bad outfit there was a fight which im bound to confess was not short an sweet there was a lot of shootin an in a cabin gunshots almost lift the roof folsom was on his knees dyin wavin his gun whisperin in fiendish glee that he had done for me when he saw jack an remembered he shook so with fury that he scattered blood all over an he took long aim at jack tryin to steady his gun he couldnt an he missed an then fell over dead with his head on jacks knees that left the redbearded rustler who had hid behind the chimney jack watched the rest of that fight an for a youngster it must have been nerverackin i broke the rustlers arm an then his knee an then i got him in the hip two more times before he hobbled out to his finish hed shot me up considerable so that when i braced jack i must have been a hairraisin sight i made jack believe i meant to murder him he begged an cried an he got to prayin for his life for your sake it was sickenin but it was what i wanted so then i made him swear hed free you an give you up to moore  oh oh ben how awful whispered columbine shuddering how could you tell me such a horrible story  reckon i wanted you to know how jack come to make the promises an what they were  promises what are promises or oaths to jack belllounds she cried in passionate contempt you wasted your breath cowardliar that he is  ahuh wade looked straight ahead of him as if he saw some expected and unpleasant thing far in the distance then with irresistible steps neither swift nor slow but ponderous he strode to the porch and mounted the steps  why ben where are you going called columbine in surprise as she followed him  he did not answer he approached the closed door of the livingroom  ben cried columbine in alarm  but he had no reply for herindeed no thought of her without knocking he opened the door with rude and powerful hand and striding in closed it after him  bill belllounds was standing back against the great stone chimney arms folded a stolid and grim figure apparently fortified against an intrusion he had expected  wal what do you want he asked gruffly he had sensed catastrophe in the first sight of the hunter  belllounds i reckon i want a hell of a lot replied wade an im askin you to see were not disturbed  bar the door  wade dropped the bar in place and then removing his sombrero he wiped his moist brow  do you see an enemy in me he asked curiously  speakin out fair wade there aint any reason i can see that youre an enemy to me replied belllounds but i feel somethin it aint because im takin my sons side its more than that a queer feelin an one i never had before i got it first when you told the story of the gunnison feud  belllounds we cant escape our fates an it was written long ago i was to tell you a worse an harder story than that  wal mebbe ill listen an mebbe i wont i aint promisin these days  are you goin to make collie marry jack demanded the hunter  shes willin  you know thats not true collies willin to sacrifice love honor an life itself to square her debt to you  the old rancher flushed a burning red and in his eyes flared a spirit of earlier years  wade you can go too far he warned im appreciatin your goodheartedness it sort of warms me toward you but this is my business youve no call to interfere youve done that too much already an im reckonin collie would be married to jack now if it hadnt been for you  ahuh thats why im thankin god i happened along to

talk wade but ill make allowances  you neednt ill back my talk but first im askin youan if this talk hurts im sorrywhy dont you give some of your love for your nogood buster jack to collie  belllounds clenched his huge fists and glared anger leaped within him he recognized in wade an outspoken bitter adversary to his cherished hopes for his son and his stubborn precious pride  by heaven wade ill  belllounds i can make you swallow that kind of talk interrupted wade its man to man now an im a match for you any day savvy do you think im damn fool enough to come here an brace you unless i knew that talk to me as youd talk about some other mans son  it aint possible rejoined the rancher stridently  then listen to me first your son jack to say the least will ruin collie do you see that  by gawd im afraid so groaned belllounds big in his humiliation but its my one last bet an im goin to play it  do you know marryin him will kill her  what youre overdoin your fears wade women dont die so easy  some of them die an collies one that will if she ever marries jack  if wal shes goin to  we dont agree said wade curtly  are you runnin my family  no but im runnin a largesized if in this game youll admit that presently belllounds you make me mad you dont meet me man to man youre not the bill belllounds of old why all over this state of colorado youre known as the whitest of the white your names a byword for all thats square an big an splendid but youre so blinded by your worship of that wild boy that youre another man in all pertainin to him i dont want to harp on his shortcomms im for the girl she doesnt love him she cant she will only drag herself down an die of a broken heart now im askin you before its too lategive up this marriage  wade ive shot men for less than youve said thundered the rancher beside himself with rage and shame  ahuh i reckon you have but not men like me i tell you straight to your face its a fool deal youre workina damn selfish onea dirty job to put on an innocent sweet girlan as sure as you stand there if you do it youll ruin four lives  four exclaimed belllounds but any word would have expressed his humiliation  i should have said three leavin jack out i meant collies an yours an wils moores  moores is about ruined already ive a hunch  you can get hunches you never dreamed of belllounds old as you are an ill give you one presently but we drift off cant you keep cool  cool with you rantin hellbent for election haw raw wade youre locoed you always struck me queer an if youll excuse me im gettin tired of this talk were as far apart as the poles an to save what good feelins we both have lets quit  you dont love collie then queried wade imperturbably  yes i do thats a fool idee of yours it puts me out of patience  belllounds youre not her real father  the rancher gave a start and he stared as he had stared before fixedly and perplexedly at wade  no im not  if she were your real daughteryour own flesh an bloodan jack belllounds was my son would you let her marry him  wal wade i reckon i wouldnt  then how can you expect my consent to her marriage with your son  what belllounds lunged over to wade leaned down shaken by overwhelming amaze  collie is my daughter  a loud expulsion of breath escaped belllounds lower he leaned and looked with piercing gaze into the face and eyes that in this moment bore strange resemblance to columbine  so help me gawd thats the secret hellbent wade an youve been on my trail  he staggered to his big chair and fell into it no trace of doubt showed in his face the revelation had struck home because of its very greatness  wade took the chair opposite his likeness to columbine had faded now it had been love a spirit a radiance a glory it was gone and wades face became the emblem of tragedy  listen belllounds ill tell you the ways of god are inscrutable ive been twenty years tryin to atone for the wrong i did collies mother ive been a prospector for the trouble of others ive been a bearer of their burdens an if i can save collies happiness an her soul i reckon i wont be denied the peace of meetin her mother in the other world i recognized collie the moment i laid eyes on her she favors her mother in looks an she has her mothers sensitiveness her fire an pride an she even has her voice its low an sweetalto they used to call it but id recognized collie as my own if id been blind an deaf its over eighteen years ago that we had the trouble i was no boy but i was terribly in love with lucy an she loved me with a passion i never learned till too late we came west from missouri she was born in texas i had a rovin disposition an didnt stick long at any kind of work but i was lookin for a ranch my wife had some money an i had high hopes we spent our first year of married life travelin through kansas at dodge i got tied up for a while you know in them days dodge was about the wildest camp on the plains my wifes brother run a place there he wasnt much good but she thought he was perfect strange how bloodrelations cant see the truth about their own people anyway her brother spencer had no use for me because i could tell how slick he was with the cards an beat him at his own game spencer had a gamblin pard a cowboy run out of texas one cap folbut no matter about his name one night they were fleecin a stranger an i broke into the game winnin all they had the game ended in a fight with bloodshed but nobody killed that set spencer an his pard cap against me the stranger was a planter from louisiana hed been an officer in the rebel army a highstrung handsome southerner fond of wine an cards an women well he got to payin my wife a good deal of attention when i was away which happened to be often she never told me i was jealous those days  my little girl you call columbine was born there durin a long absence of mine when i got home lucy an the baby were gone also the southerner spencer an his pard cap an others they had in the deal proved to me so it seemed that the little girl was not really mine an so i set out on a hunt for my wife an her lover i found them an i killed him before her eyes but she was innocent an so was he as came out too late hed been indeed her friend she scorned me she told me how her brother spencer an his friends had established guilt of mine that had driven her from me  i went back to dodge to have a little quiet smoke with these men who had ruined me they were gone the trail led to colorado nearly a year later i rounded them all up in a big wagontrain post north of denver another brother of my wifes an her father had come west an by accident or fate we all met there we had a family quarrel my wife would not forgive mewould not speak to me an her people backed her up i made the great mistake to take her father an other brothers to belong to the same brand as spencer in this i wronged them an her  what i did to them belllounds is one story ill never tell to any man who might live to repeat it but it drove my wife near crazy an it made me hellbent wade she ran off from me there an i trailed her all over colorado an the end of that trail was not a hundred miles from where we stand now the last trace i had was of the burnin of a prairieschooner by arapahoes as they were goin home from a foray on the utes the little girl might have toddled off the trail but i reckon she was hidden or dropped by her mother or some one fleein for life your men found her in the columbines  belllounds drew a long deep breath  what a man never expects always comes true wade the lass is yours i can see it in the way you look at me i can feel it shes been like my own ive done my best accordin to my conscience an ive loved her for all they say i couldnt see aught but jack youll take her away from me  no never was the melancholy reply  what why not  because she loves you i could never reveal myself to collie i couldnt win her love with a lie an id have to lie to be false as hell false to her mother an to collie an to all i hold high id have to tell collie the truththe wrong i did her motherthe hell i visited upon her mothers people shed fear me  ahuh an youll never changei reckon that exclaimed belllounds  no i changed once eighteen years ago i cant go back i cant undo all i hoped was good  you think collied fear you  shed never love me as she does you or as she loves me even now that is my rock of refuge  shed hate you wade  i reckon an so she must never know  ahuh wal wal life is a hell of a deal wade if you could live yours over again knowin what you know now an that youd love an suffer the samewould you want to do it  yes i love life with all it brings i wouldnt have the joy without the pain but i reckon only men whove come to our years would want it over again  wal im with you thar id take what came rain an sun but all this you tell an the hell you hint at aint changin this hyar deal of jacks an collies not one jot if she remains my adopted daughter she marries my son wade im haltered like the north star in that  belllounds will you take a day to think it over appealed wade  ahuh but that wont change me  wont it change you to know that if you force this marriage youll lose all  all aint that more queer talk  i mean lose allyour son your adopted daughterhis chance of reformin her hope of happiness these ought to be all in life left to you  wal they are but i cant see your argument youre beyond me wade youre holdin back like you did with your hellbent story  ponderously as if the burden and the doom of the world weighed him down the hunter got up and fronted belllounds  when im driven to tell ill come but once more old man choose between generosity an selfishness between blood tie an noble loyalty to your good deed in its beginnin will you give up this marriage for your sonso that collie can have the man she loves  you mean your young pard an twobit of a rustlerwils moore  wils moore yes my friend an a man belllounds such as you or i never was  no thundered the rancher purple in the face  with bowed head and dragging step wade left the room                                       by slow degrees of plodding steps and periods of abstracted lagging the hunter made his way back to moores cabin at his entrance the cowboy leaped up with a startled cry  oh wade is collie dead he cried  such was the extent of calamity he imagined from the somber face of wade  no collies well  then man what on earths happened  nothin yet but somethin is goin on in my mind moore id like you to let me alone  at sunset wade was pacing the aspen grove on the hill there was sunlight and shade under the trees a rosy gold on the sage slopes a purpleandviolet veil between the black ranges and the sinking sun  twilight fell the stars came out white and clear night cloaked the valley with dark shadows and the hills with its obscurity the blue vault overhead deepened and darkened the hunter patrolled his beat and hours were moments to him he heard the low hum of the insects the murmur of running water the rustle of the wind a coyote cut the keen air with highkeyed staccato cry the owls hooted with dismal and weird plaint one to the other then a wolf mourned but these sounds only accentuated the loneliness and wildness of the silent night  wade listened to them to the silence he felt the wildness and loneliness of the place the breathing of nature he peered aloft at the velvet blue of the mysterious sky with its deceiving stars all that had been of help to him through days of trial was now as if it had never been when he lifted his eyes to the great dark peak so bold and clearcut against the sky it was not to receive strength again nature in its cruelty mocked him his struggle had to do with the most perfect of natures worksman  wade was now in passionate strife with the encroaching mood that was a mocker of his idealism many times during the strange long martyrdom of his penance had he faced this crisis only to go down to defeat before elemental instincts his soul was steeped in gloom but his intelligence had not yet succumbed to passion the beauty of columbines character and the nobility of moores were not illusions to wade they were true these two were of the finest fiber of human nature they loved they represented youth and hopea progress through the ages toward a better race wade believed in the good to be in the future of men nevertheless all that was fine and worthy in columbine and moore was to go unrewarded unfulfilled because of the selfish pride of an old man and the evil passion of the son it was a conflict as old as life of what avail were columbines high sense of duty moores fine manhood the many victories they had won over the headlong and imperious desires of love what avail were wades good offices his spiritual teaching his eternal hope in the order of circumstances working out to good these beautiful characteristics of virtue were not so strong as the unchangeable passion of old belllounds and the vicious depravity of his son wade could not imagine himself a god proving that the wages of sin was death yet in his life he had often been an impassive destiny meting out terrible consequences here he was incalculably involved this was the cumulative end of years of mounting plots tangled and woven into the web of his pain and his remorse and his ideal but hope was dying that was his striferealization against the morbid clairvoyance of his mind he could not help jack belllounds to be a better man he could not inspire the old rancher to a forgetfulness of selfish and blinded aims he could not prove to moore the truth of the reward that came from unflagging hope and unassailable virtue he could not save columbine with his ideals  the night wore on and wade plodded under the rustling aspens the insects ceased to hum the owls to hoot the wolves to mourn the shadows of the long spruces gradually merged into the darkness of night above infinitely high burned the pale stars wise and cold aloof and indifferent eyes of other worlds of mystery  in those night hours something in wade died but his idealism unquenchable and inexplicable the very soul of the man saw its justification and fulfilment in the distant future  the gray of the dawn stole over the eastern range and before its opaque gloom the blackness of night retreated until valley and slope and grove were shrouded in spectral light where all seemed unreal  and with it the graygloomed giant of wades mind the morbid and brooding spell had gained its longencroaching ascendancy he had again found the man to whom he must tell his story tragic and irrevocable decree it was his life that forced him his crime his remorse his agony his endless striving how true had been his steps they had led by devious and tortuous paths to the home of his daughter  wade crouched under the aspens accepting this burden as a man being physically loaded with tremendous weights his shoulders bent to them his breast was sunken and labored all his muscles were cramped his blood flowed sluggishly his heart beat with slow muffled throbs in his ears there was a creeping cold in his veins ice in his marrow and death in his soul the giant that had been shrouded in gray threw off his cloak to stand revealed black and terrible and it was he who spoke to wade in dreadful tones like knells bent wademan of miserywho could find no peace on earthwhose presence unknit the tranquil lives of people and poisoned their blood and marked them for doom wherever he wandered there followed the curse always this had been so he was the harbinger of catastrophe he who preached wisdom and claimed to be taught by the flowers who loved life and hated injustice who mingled with his kind ever searching for that one who needed him he must become the woe and the bane and curse of those he would only serve insupportable and pitiful fate the fiends of the past mocked him like wicked ghouls voiceless and dim the faces of the men he had killed were around him in the gray gloom pale drifting visages of distortion accusing him claiming him likewise these gleams of faces were specters of his mind a procession eternal mournful and silent wending their way on and on through the regions of his thought all were united all drove him all put him on the trail of catastrophe they foreshadowed the future they inclosed events they lured him with his endless illusions he was in the vortex of a vast whirlpool not of water or of wind but of life alas he seemed indeed the very current of that whirlpool a monstrous force around which evil circled and lurked and conquered wadewho had the illomened croak of the ravenwadewho bent his driven steps toward hell                                       in the brilliant sunlight of the summer morning wade bent his resistless steps down toward white slides ranch the pendulum had swung the hours were propitious seemingly events that already cast their shadows waited for him he saw jack belllounds going out on the fast and furious ride which had become his morning habit  columbine intercepted wade the shade of woe and tragedy in her face were the same as he had pictured there in his gloomy vigil of the night  my friend i was coming to you oh i can bear no more  her hair was disheveled her dress disordered the hands she tremblingly held out bore discolored marks wade led her into the seclusion of the willow trail  oh ben he fought melikea beast she panted  collie you neednt tell me more said

go  she turned away actuated by more than her will  collie came the call piercingly and strangely after her bewildered startled by the wildness of that cry she wheeled but wade was gone the shaking of the willows attested to his hurry                                       old belllounds braced his huge shoulders against the wall in the attitude of a man driven to his last stand  ahuh he rolled sonorously so hyar you are again wal tell your worst hellbent wade an lets have an end to your croakin  belllounds had fortified himself not with convictions or with illusions but with the last desperate courage of a man true to himself  ill tell you began the hunter  and the rancher threw up his hands in a mockery that was furious yet with outward shrinking  just now when buster jack fought with collie he meant bad by her  aw no he was jest rudetryin to be masterful an the lasss like a wild filly she needs a tamin down  wade stretched forth a lean and quivering hand that seemed the symbol of presaged and tragic truth  listen belllounds an ill tell you no use tryin to hatch a rotten egg theres no good in your son his good intentions he paraded for virtues believin himself that hed changed but a flip of the wind made him buster jack again collie would sacrifice her life for duty to youwhom she loves as her father wils moore sacrificed his honor for collierather than let you learn the truth but they call me hellbent wade an i will tell you  the straining hulk of belllounds crouched lower as if to gather impetus for a leap both huge hands were outspread as if to ward off attack from an unseen but longdreaded foe the great eyes rolled and underneath the terror and certainty and tragedy of his appearance seemed to surge the resistless and rising swell of a dammedup terrible rage  ill tell you  went on the remorseless voice i watched your buster jack i watched him gamble an drink i trailed him i found the little circles an the crooked horse tracksmade to trap wils moore a damned cunnin trick burley suspects a nigger in the woodpile wils moore knows the truth he lied for collies sake an yours hed have stood the trialan gone to jail to save collie from what

an he comes back to bully her an worse buster jack hes the thorn in your heart belllounds hes the rustler who stole your cattle your pet sona sneakin thief    chapter xix  jack belllounds came riding down the valley trail his horse was in a lather of sweat both hair and blood showed on the long spurs this son of a great pioneer used in his pleasure rides he had never loved a horse  at a point where the trail met the brook there were thick willow patches with open grassy spots between as belllounds reached this place a man stepped out of the willows and laid hold of the bridle the horse shied and tried to plunge but an iron arm held him  get down buster ordered the man  it was wade  belllounds had given as sharp a start as his horse he was sober though the heated red tinge of his face gave indication of a recent use of the bottle that color quickly receded events of the last month had left traces of the hardening and lowering of jack bellloundss nature  whaat let go of that bridle he ejaculated  wade held it fast while he gazed up into the prominent eyes where fear shone and struggled with intolerance and arrogance and quickening gleams of thought  you an i have somethin to talk over said the hunter  belllounds shrank from the low cold even voice that evidently reminded him of the last time he had heard it  no we havent he declared quickly he seemed to gather assurance with his spoken thought and conscious fear left him wade you took advantage of me that daywhen you made me swear things ive changed my mind and as for that deal with the rustlers ive got my story its as good as yours ive been waiting for you to tell my father youve got some reason for not telling him ive a hunch its collie im on to you and ive got my nerve back you can gamble i  he had grown excited when wade interrupted him  will you get off that horse  no i wont replied belllounds bluntly  with swift and powerful lunge wade pulled belllounds down sliding him shoulders first into the grass the released horse shied again and moved away buster jack raised himself upon his elbow pale with rage and alarm wade kicked him not with any particular violence  get up he ordered  the kick had brought out the rage in belllounds at the expense of the amaze and alarm  did you kick me he shouted  buster i was only handin you a bunch of flowerssome columbines as your taste runs replied wade contemptuously  illill returned buster jack wildly bursting for expression his hand went to his gun  go ahead buster throw your gun on me thatll save maybe a hell of a lot of talk  it was then jack bellloundss face turned livid comprehension had dawned upon him  youyou want me to fight you he queried in hoarse accents  i reckon thats what i meant  no affront no insult no blow could have affected buster jack as that sudden knowledge  whywhyyoure crazy me fight youa gunman he stammered nono it wouldnt be fair not an even break no id have no chance on earth  ill give you first shot went on wade

play square with your rustler pard he was a lifelong enemy of mine an a gunfighter to boot pull your gun an let drive ill take my chances  buster jacks eyes dilated he gasped huskily he pulled his gun but actually did not have strength or courage enough to raise it his arm shook so that the gun rattled against his chaps  no nerve hey not half a man buster jack why dont you finish game make up for your lowdown tricks at the last try to be worthy of your dad in his day he was a real man let him have the consolation that you faced hellbent wade an died in your boots  icantfight you panted

fully at last  heres where you pay for your dirty work the time comes to every man youve a choice not to livefor youll never get away from hellbent wadebut to rise above yourself at last  but what for why do you want to kill me i never harmed you  columbine is my daughter replied the hunter  ah breathed belllounds  she loves wils moore whos as white a man as you are black  across the pallid convulsed face of belllounds spread a slow dull crimson  aha buster jack i struck home there flashed wade his voice rising that gives your eyes the ugly look i hate them lyin bulgin eyes of yours an when my time comes to shoot im goin to put them both out  by heaven wade youll have to kill me if you ever expect that clubfoot moore to get collie  hell get her replied wade triumphantly collies with him now i sent her i told her to tell wils how you tried to force her  belllounds began to shake all over a torture of jealous hate and deadly terror convulsed him  buster did you ever think youd get

never had any use for you an now she hates you  it was you who made her yelled belllounds foaming at the mouth  sure went on the deliberate voice ringing with scorn an only a little while ago she called you a dog i reckon she meant a different kind of a dog than the hounds over there for to say they were like you would be an insult to them sure she hates you an ill gamble right now shes got her arms around wilss neck   hissed belllounds  well youve got a gun in your hand went on the taunting voice ahuh have it your way im warmin up now an id like to tell you   shut up interrupted the other frantically the blood in him was rising to a fever heat but fear still clamped him he could not raise the gun and he seemed in agony  your father knows youre a thief declared wade with remorseless deliberate intent i told him how i watched youtrailed youan learned the plot you hatched against wils moore buster jack busted himself at last stealin his own fathers cattle ive seen some

shriek but this was not the temper that always produced heedless action in him it was hate he could not raise the gun his intelligence still dominated his will yet fury had mitigated his terror  youll be doin me a service buster but youre mighty slow at startin i reckon ill have to play my last trump to make you fight oh by god i can tell you belllounds therere dead men callin me now callin me not

youll save me that buster no man with a gun in his hands could face what he knew but save me more save me the tellin  no no i wont listen  maybe i wont have to replied wade mournfully he paused breathing heavily the sober calm was gone  belllounds lowered the halfraised gun instantly answering to the strange break in wades strained dominance  dont tell meany more ill not listen i wont fight wade youre crazy let me off an i swear  buster i told collie you were three years in jail suddenly interrupted wade  a mortal blow dealt belllounds would not have caused such a shock of amaze of torture the secret of the punishment meted out to him by his father the hideous thing which instead of reforming had ruined him all of hell was expressed in his burning eyes  ahuh ive known it long cried wade tragically buster jack youre the man who must hear my story ill tell you                                       in the aspen grove up the slope of sage valley columbine and wilson were sitting on a log whatever had been their discourse it had left moore with head bowed in his hands and with columbine staring with sad eyes that did not see what they looked at columbines mind then seemed a dull blank suddenly she started  wils she cried did you hearanything  no he replied wearily raising his head  i thought i heard a shot said columbine itit sort of made me jump im nervous  scarcely had she finished speaking when two clear deep detonations rang out gunshots  there oh wils did you hear  hear whispered moore he grew singularly white yesyes collie  wils she interrupted wildly as she began to shake just a little bit agoi saw jack riding down the trail  collie those two shots came from wades guns id know it among a thousand are you sure you heard a shot before  oh something dreadful has happened yes im sure perfectly sure a shot not so loud or heavy  my god exclaimed moore staring aghast at columbine  maybe thats what wade meant i never saw through him  tell me oh i dont understand wailed columbine wringing her hands  moore did not explain what he meant for a crippled man he made quick time in getting to his horse and mounting  collie ill ride down there im afraid something has happened i never understood him i forgot he was hellbent wade if theres been aa fight or any troubleill ride back and meet you  then he rode down the trail  columbine had come without her horse and she started homeward on foot her steps dragged she knew something dreadful had happened her heart beat slowly and painfully there was an oppression upon her breast her brain whirled with contending tides of thought she remembered wades face how blind she had been it exhausted her to walk though she went so slowly there seemed to be a chill and a darkening in the atmosphere an unreality in the familiar slopes and groves a strangeness and shadow upon white slides valley  moore did not return to meet her his white horse grazed in the pasture opposite the first clump of willows where sage valley merged into the larger valley then she saw other horses among them lem billingss bay mustang columbine faltered on when suddenly she recognized the horse jack had riddena sorrel spent and foamcovered standing saddled with bridle down and riderlessthen certainty of something awful clamped her with horror mens husky voices reached her throbbing ears some one was running footsteps thudded and died away then she saw lem billings come out of the willows look her way and hurry toward her his awkward cowboy gait seemed too slow for his earnestness columbine felt the piercing gaze of his eyes as her own became dim  miss collie thars beenturrible fight he panted  oh lem i know it was benand jack she cried  shore your hunchs correct an it couldnt be no wuss  columbine tried to see his face the meaning that must have accompanied his hoarse voice but she seemed going blind  thenthen she whispered reaching out for lem  hyar miss collie he said in great concern as he took kind and gentle hold of her reckon youd better wait let me take you home  yes but telltell me first she cried frantically she could not bear suspense and she felt her senses slipping away from her  my gawd whod ever have thought such hell would come to white slides exclaimed lem with strong emotion miss collie im powerful sorry fer you but mebbe its best so theyre both dead wade just died with his head on wilss lap but jack never knowed what hit him he was shot plumb centerboth his eyes shot out wade was shot low down montana an me agreed thet jack throwed his gun first an wade killed him after bein mortal shot himself                                       late that afternoon as columbine lay upon her bed the strange stillness of the house was disturbed by a heavy tread it passed out of the livingroom and came down the porch toward her door then followed a knock  dad she called swiftly rising  belllounds entered leaving the door ajar the sunlight streamed in  wal collie i see youre bracin up he said  oh yes dad imim all right she replied eager to help or comfort him  the old rancher seemed different from the man of the past months the pallor of a great shock the havoc of spent passion the agony of terrible hours showed in his face but old bill belllounds had come into his own againback to the calm iron pioneer who had lived all events over whom storm of years had broken whose great spirit had accepted this crowning catastrophe as it had all the others who saw his own life clearly now that its bitterest lesson was told  are you strong enough to bear another shock my lass an bear it nowso to make an endso tomorrer we can begin anew he asked with the voice she had not heard for many a day it was the voice that told of consideration for her  yes dad she replied going to him  wal come with me i want you to see wade  he led her out upon the porch and thence into the livingroom and from there into the room where lay the two dead men one on each side blankets covered the prone quiet forms  columbine had meant to beg to see wade once before he was laid away forever she dreaded the ordeal yet strangely longed for it and here she was selfcontained ready for some nameless shock and uplift which she divined was coming as she had divined the change in belllounds  then he stripped back the blanket disclosing wades face columbine thrilled to the core of her heart death was there white and cold and merciless but as it had released the tragic soul the instant of deliverance had been stamped on the rugged cadaverous visage by a beautiful light not of peace nor of joy nor of grief but of hope hope had been the last emotion of hellbent wade  collie listen said the old rancher in deep and trembling tones when a mans dead what hes been comes to us with startlin truth wade was the whitest man i ever knew he had a queer ideea twist in his mindan it was thet his steps were bent toward hell he imagined thet everywhere he traveled there he fetched hell but he was wrong his own trouble led him to the trouble of others he saw through life an he was as big in his hope fer the good as he was terrible in his dealin with the bad i never saw his like he loved you collie better than you ever knew better than jack or wils or me you know what the bible says about him who gives his life fer his friend wal wade was my friend an jacks only we never could see an he was wilss friend an to you he must have been more than words can tell we all know what childs play it would have been fer wade to kill jack without bein hurt himself but he wouldnt do it so he spared me an jack an i reckon himself somehow he made jack fight an die like a man god only knows how he did that but it saved me fromfrom hellan you an wils from misery wade could have taken you from me an jack he had only to tell you his secret an he wouldnt he saw how you loved me as if you were my real child but collie lass it was he who was your father  with bursting heart columbine fell upon her knees beside that cold still form  belllounds softly left the room and closed the door behind him    chapter xx  nature was prodigal with her colors that autumn the frosts came late so that the leaves did not gradually change their green one day as if by magic there was gold among the green and in another there was purple and red then the hilltops blazed with their crowns of aspen groves and the slopes of sage shone mellow gray in the sunlight and the vines on the stone fences straggled away in lines of bronze and the patches of ferns under the cliffs faded fast and the great rock slides and blacktimbered reaches stood out in their somber shades  columbines bloomed in all the dells among the spruces beautiful stalks with heavy blossoms the sweetest and palest of bluewhite flowers motionless they lifted their faces to the light out in the aspen groves where the grass was turning gold the columbines blew gracefully in the wind nodding and swaying the most exquisite and finest of these columbines hid in the shaded nooks starsweet in the silent gloom of the woods  wades last few whispered words to moore had been interpreted that the hunter desired to be buried among the columbines in the aspen grove on the slope above sage valley here then had been made his grave                                       one day belllounds sent columbine to fetch moore down to white slides it was a warm indiansummer afternoon and the old rancher sat out on the porch in his shirtsleeves his hair was white now but no other change was visible in him no restraint attended his greeting to the cowboy  wils i reckon id be glad if youd take your old job as foreman of white slides he said  are you asking me queried moore eagerly  wal i reckon so  yes ill come replied the cowboy  whatll your dad say  i dont know that worries me hes coming to visit me i heard from him again lately and he means to take stage for kremmling soon  wal thats fine ill be glad to see him wils youre goin to be a big cattleman before you know it hey collie  if you say so dad itll come true replied columbine with her hand on his shoulder  wils youll be runnin white slides ranch before long unless collie runs you haw haw  collie could not reply to this startling announcement from the old rancher and moore appeared distressed with embarrassment  wal i reckon you young folks had better ride down to kremmlin an get married  this kindly matteroffact suggestion completely stunned the cowboy and all columbine could do was to gaze at the rancher  say i hope i aint intrudin my wishes on a young couple thats got over dyin fer each other dryly continued belllounds with his huge smile  dad cried columbine and then she threw her arms around him and buried her head on his shoulder  wal wal i reckon that answers that he said holding her close moore shes yours with my blessin an all i have an you must understand im glad things have worked out to your good an to collies happiness lifes not over fer me yet but i reckon the storms are past thank god we learn as we live id hold it onworthy not to look forward an to hope im wantin peace an quiet now with grandchildren around me in my old age so ride along to kremmlin an hurry home                                       the evening of the day columbine came home to white slides the bride of wilson moore she slipped away from the simple festivities in her honor and climbed to the aspen grove on the hill to spend a little while beside the grave of her father  the afterglow of sunset burned dull gold and rose in the western sky rendering glorious the veil of purple over the ranges down in the lowlands twilight had come softly gray the owls were hooting a coyote barked from far away floated the mourn of a wolf  under the aspens it was silent and lonely and sad the leaves quivered without any sound of rustling columbines heart was full of a happiness that she longed to express somehow there beside this lonely grave it was what she owed the strange man who slept here in the shadows grief abided with her and always there would be an eternal remorse and regret yet she had loved him she had been his all unconsciously his life had been terrible but it had been great as the hours of quiet thinking had multiplied columbine had grown in her divination of wades meaning his had been the spirit of man lighting the dark places his had been the ruthless hand against all evil terrible to destroy  her father after all how closely was she linked to the past how closely protected even in the hours of most helpless despair thus she understood him love was the food of life and hope was its spirituality and beauty was its reward to the seeing eye wade had lived these great virtues even while he had earned a tragic name  i will live them i will have faith and hope and love for i am his daughter she said a faint cool breeze strayed through the aspens rustling the leaves whisperingly and the slender columbines gleaming pale in the twilight lifted their sweet faces   the end
