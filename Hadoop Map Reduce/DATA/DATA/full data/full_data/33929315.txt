33929315	the border legion  by zane grey     1  joan randle reined in her horse on the crest of the cedar ridge and with remorse and dread beginning to knock at her heart she gazed before her at the wild and looming mountain range  jim wasnt fooling me she said he meant it hes going straight for the border oh why did i taunt him  it was indeed a wild place that southern border of idaho and that year was to see the ushering in of the wildest time probably ever known in the west the rush for gold had peopled california with a horde of lawless men of every kind and class and the vigilantes and then the rich strikes in idaho had caused a reflux of that dark tide of humanity strange tales of blood and gold drifted into the camps and prospectors and hunters met with many unknown men  joan had quarreled with jim cleve and she was bitterly regretting it joan was twenty years old tall strong dark she had been born in missouri where her father had been welltodo and prominent until like many another man of his day he had impeded the passage of a bullet then joan had become the protegee of an uncle who had responded to the call of gold and the latter part of her life had been spent in the wilds  she had followed jims trail for miles out toward the range and now she dismounted to see if his tracks were as fresh as she had believed he had left the little village camp about sunrise someone had seen him riding away and had told joan then he had tarried on the way for it was now midday joan pondered she had become used to his idle threats and disgusted with his vacillations that had been the troublejim was amiable lovable but since meeting joan he had not exhibited any strength of character joan stood beside her horse and looked away toward the dark mountains she was daring resourceful used to horses and trails and taking care of herself and she did not need anyone to tell her that she had gone far enough it had been her hope to come up with jim always he had been repentant but this time was different she recalled his lean pale faceso pale that freckles she did not know he had showed throughand his eyes usually so soft and mild had glinted like steel yes it had been a bitter reckless face what had she said to him she tried to recall it  the night before at twilight joan had waited for him she had given him precedence over the few other young men of the village a fact she resentfully believed he did not appreciate jim was unsatisfactory in every way except in the way he cared for her and that alsofor he cared too much  when joan thought how jim loved her all the details of that night became vivid she sat alone under the sprucetrees near the cabin the shadows thickened and then lightened under a rising moon she heard the low hum of insects a distant laugh of some woman of the village and the murmur of the brook jim was later than usual very likely as her uncle had hinted jim had tarried at the saloon that had lately disrupted the peace of the village the village was growing and joan did not like the change there were too many strangers rough loudvoiced drinking men once it had been a pleasure to go to the village store now it was an ordeal somehow jim had seemed to be unfavorably influenced by these new conditions still he had never amounted to much her resentment or some feeling she had was reaching a climax she got up from her seat she would not wait any longer for him and when she did see him it would be to tell him a few blunt facts  just then there was a slight rustle behind her before she could turn someone seized her in powerful arms she was bent backward in a bearish embrace so that she could neither struggle nor cry out a dark face loomed over herscame closer swift kisses closed her eyes burned her cheeks and ended passionately on her lips they had some strange power over her then she was released  joan staggered back frightened outraged she was so dazed she did not recognize the man if indeed she knew him but a laugh betrayed him it was jim  you thought i had no nerve he said what do you think of that  suddenly joan was blindly furious she could have killed him she had never given him any right never made him any promise never let him believe she cared and he had dared the hot blood boiled in her cheeks she was furious with him but intolerably so with herself because somehow those kisses she had resented gave her unknown pain and shame they had sent a shock through all her being she thought she hated him  youyou she broke out jim cleve that ends you with me  reckon i never had a beginning with you he replied bitterly it was worth a good deal im not sorry by heavenivekissed you  he breathed heavily she could see how pale he had grown in the shadowy moonlight she sensed a difference in hima cool reckless defiance  youll be sorry she said ill have nothing to do with you any more  all right but im not and i wont be sorry  she wondered whether he had fallen under the influence of drink jim had never cared for liquor which virtue was about the only one he possessed remembering his kisses she knew he had not been drinking there was a strangeness about him though that she could not fathom had he guessed his kisses would have that power if he dared again she trembled and it was not only rage but she would teach him a lesson  joan i kissed you because i cant be a hangdog any longer he said i love you and im no good without you you must care a little for me lets marry ill  never she replied like flint youre no good at all  but i am he protested with passion i used to do things but sincesince ive met you ive lost my nerve im crazy for you you let the other men run after you some of them arent fit totooh im sick all the time now its longing and then its jealousy give me a chance joan  why she queried coldly why should i youre shiftless you wont work when you do find a little gold you squander it you have nothing but a gun you cant do anything but shoot  maybe thatll come in handy he said lightly  jim cleve you havent it in you even to be bad she went on stingingly  at that he made a violent gesture then he loomed over her joan handle do you mean that he asked  i surely do she responded at last she had struck fire from him the fact was interesting it lessened her anger  then im so low so worthless so spineless that i cant even be bad  yes you are  thats what you think of meafter ive ruined myself for love of you  she laughed tauntingly how strange and hot a glee she felt in hurting him  by god ill show you he cried hoarsely  what will you do jim she asked mockingly  ill shake this camp ill rustle for the border ill get in with kells and gulden youll hear of me joan randle  these were names of strange unknown and wild men of a growing and terrible legion on the border out there somewhere lived desperados robbers roadagents murderers more and more rumor had brought tidings of them into the once quiet village joan felt a slight cold sinking sensation at her heart but this was only a magnificent threat of jims he could not do such a thing she would never let him even if he could but after the incomprehensible manner of woman she did not tell him that  bah you havent the nerve she retorted with another mocking laugh  haggard and fierce he glared down at her a moment and then without another word he strode away joan was amazed and a little sick a little uncertain still she did not call him back  and now at noon of the next day she had tracked him miles toward the mountains it was a broad trail he had taken one used by prospectors and hunters there was no danger of her getting lost what risk she ran was of meeting some of these border ruffians that had of late been frequent visitors in the village presently she mounted again and rode down the ridge she would go a mile or so farther  behind every rock and cedar she expected to find jim surely he had only threatened her but she had taunted him in a way no man could stand and if there were any strength of character in him he would show it now her remorse and dread increased after all he was only a boyonly a couple of years older than she was under stress of feeling he might go to any extreme had she misjudged him if she had not she had at least been brutal but he had dared to kiss her every time she thought of that a tingling a confusion a hot shame went over her and at length joan marveled to find that out of the affront to her pride and the quarrel and the fact of his going and of her following and especially out of this increasing remorseful dread there had flourished up a strange and reluctant respect for jim cleve  she climbed another ridge and halted again this time she saw a horse and rider down in the green her heart leaped it must be jim returning after all then he had only threatened she felt relieved and glad yet vaguely sorry she had been right in her conviction  she had not watched long however before she saw that this was not the horse jim usually rode she took the precaution then to hide behind some bushes and watched from there when the horseman approached closer she discerned that instead of jim it was harvey roberts a man of the village and a good friend of her uncles therefore she rode out of her covert and hailed him it was a significant thing that at the sound of her voice roberts started suddenly and reached for his gun then he recognized her  hello joan he exclaimed turning her way reckon you give me a scare you aint alone way out here  yes i was trailing jim when i saw you she replied thought you were jim  trailin jim whats up  we quarreled he swore he was going to the devil over on the border i was mad and told him to go but im sorry nowand have been trying to catch up with him  ahuh so thats jims trail i sure was wonderin joan it turns off a few miles back an takes the trail for the border i know ive been in there  joan glanced up sharply at roberts his scarred and grizzled face seemed grave and he avoided her gaze  you dont believejimll really go she asked hurriedly  reckon i do joan he replied after a pause jim is just fool enough he had been gettrn recklessler lately an joan the times aint provocatin a young feller to be good jim had a bad fight the other night he about half killed young bradley but i reckon you know  ive heard nothing she replied tell me why did they fight  report was that bradley talked oncomplementary about you  joan experienced a sweet warm rush of bloodanother new and strange emotion she did not like bradley he had been persistent and offensive  why didnt jim tell me she queried half to herself  reckon he wasnt proud of the shape he left bradley in replied roberts with a laugh come on joan an make back tracks for home  joan was silent a moment while she looked over the undulating green ridges toward the great gray and black walls something stirred deep within her her father in his youth had been an adventurer she felt the thrill and the call of her blood and she had been unjust to a man who loved her  im going after him she said  roberts did not show any surprise he looked at the position of the sun reckon we might overtake him an get home before sundown he said laconically as he turned his horse well make a short cut across here a few miles an strike his trail cant miss it  then he set off at a brisk trot and joan fell in behind she had a busy mind and it was a sign of her preoccupation that she forgot to thank roberts presently they struck into a valley a narrow depression between the foothills and the ridges and here they made faster time the valley appeared miles long toward the middle of it roberts called out to joan and looking down she saw they had come up with jims trail here roberts put his mount to a canter and at that gait they trailed jim out of the valley and up a slope which appeared to be a pass into the mountains time flew by for joan because she was always peering ahead in the hope and expectation of seeing jim off in the distance but she had no glimpse of him now and then roberts would glance around at the westering sun the afternoon had far advanced joan began to worry about home she had been so sure of coming up with jim and returning early in the day that she had left no word as to her intentions probably by this time somebody was out looking for her  the country grew rougher rockstrewn covered with cedars and patches of pine deer crashed out of the thickets and grouse whirred up from under the horses the warmth of the summer afternoon chilled  reckon wed better give it up called roberts back to her  nono go on replied joan  and they urged their horses faster finally they reached the summit of the slope from that height they saw down into a round shallow valley which led on like all the deceptive reaches to the ranges there was water down there it glinted like red ribbon in the sunlight not a living thing was in sight joan grew more discouraged it seemed there was scarcely any hope of overtaking jim that day his trail led off round to the left and grew difficult to follow finally to make matters worse robertss horse slipped in a rocky wash and lamed himself he did not want to go on and when urged could hardly walk  roberts got off to examine the injury wal he didnt break his leg he said which was his manner of telling how bad the injury was joan i reckon therell be some worryin back home tonight for your horse cant carry double an i cant walk  joan dismounted there was water in the wash and she helped roberts bathe the sprained and swelling joint in the interest and sympathy of the moment she forgot her own trouble  reckon well have to make camp right here said roberts looking around lucky ive a pack on that saddle i can make you comfortable but wed better be careful about a fire an not have one after dark  theres no help for it replied joan tomorrow well go on after jim he cant be far ahead now she was glad that it was impossible to return home until the next day  roberts took the pack off his horse and then the saddle and he was bending over in the act of loosening the cinches of joans saddle when suddenly he straightened up with a jerk  whats that  joan heard soft dull thumps on the turf and then the sharp crack of an unshod hoof upon stone wheeling she saw three horsemen they were just across the wash and coming toward her one rider pointed in her direction silhouetted against the red of the sunset they made dark and sinister figures joan glanced apprehensively at roberts he was staring with a look of recognition in his eyes under his breath he muttered a curse and although joan was not certain she believed that his face had shaded gray  the three horsemen halted on the rim of the wash one of them was leading a mule that carried a pack and a deer carcass joan had seen many riders apparently just like these but none had ever so subtly and powerfully affected her  howdy greeted one of the men  and then joan was positive that the face of roberts had turned ashen gray     2  it aint youkells  robertss query was a confirmation of his own recognition and the others laugh was an answer if one were needed  the three horsemen crossed the wash and again halted leisurely as if time was no object they were all young under thirty the two who had not spoken were roughgarbed coarsefeatured and resembled in general a dozen men joan saw every day kells was of a different stamp until he looked at her he reminded her of someone she had known back in missouri after he looked at her she was aware in a curious sickening way that no such person as he had ever before seen her he was pale grayeyed intelligent amiable he appeared to be a man who had been a gentleman but there was something strange intangible immense about him was that the effect of his presence or of his name kells it was only a word to joan but it carried a nameless and terrible suggestion during the last year many dark tales had gone from camp to camp in idahosome too strange too horrible for credenceand with every rumor the fame of kells had grown and also a fearful certainty of the rapid growth of a legion of evil men out on the border but no one in the village or from any of the camps ever admitted having seen this kells had fear kept them silent joan was amazed that roberts evidently knew this man  kells dismounted and offered his hand roberts took it and shook it constrainedly  where did we meet last asked kells  reckon it was out of fresno replied roberts and it was evident that he tried to hide the effect of a memory  then kells touched his hat to joan giving her the fleetest kind of a glance rather off the track arent you he asked roberts  reckon we are replied roberts and he began to lose some of his restraint his voice sounded clearer and did not halt been trailin miss randles favorite hoss hes lost an we got farther n we had any idee then my hoss went lame fraid we cant start home tonight  where are you from  hoadley bill hoadleys town back thirty miles or so  well roberts if youve no objection well camp here with you continued kells weve got some fresh meat  with that he addressed a word to his comrades and they repaired to a cedartree nearby where they began to unsaddle and unpack  then roberts bending nearer joan as if intent on his own pack began to whisper hoarsely thats jack kells the california roadagent hes a gun fightera hellbent rattlesnake when i saw him last he had a rope round his neck an was bein led away to be hanged i heerd afterward he was rescued by pals joan if the idee comes into his head hell kill me i dont know what to do for gods sake think of somethin use your womans wits we couldnt be in a wuss fix  joan felt rather unsteady on her feet so that it was a relief to sit down she was cold and sick inwardly almost stunned some great peril menaced her men like roberts did not talk that way without cause she was brave she was not unused to danger but this must be a different kind compared with which all she had experienced was but insignificant she could not grasp robertss intimation why should he be killed they had no gold no valuables even their horses were nothing to inspire robbery it must be that there was peril to roberts and to her because she was a girl caught out in the wilds easy prey for beasts of evil men she had heard of such things happening still she could not believe it possible for her roberts could protect her then this amiable wellspoken kells he was no western roughhe spoke like an educated man surely he would not harm her so her mind revolved round fears conjectures possibilities she could not find her wits she could not think how to meet the situation even had she divined what the situation was to be  while she sat there in the shade of a cedar the men busied themselves with camp duties none of them appeared to pay any attention to joan they talked while they worked as any other group of campers might have talked and jested and laughed kells made a fire and carried water then broke cedar boughs for later campfire use one of the strangers whom they called bill hobbled the horses the other unrolled the pack spread a tarpaulin and emptied the greasy sacks roberts made biscuit dough for the oven  the sun sank red and a ruddy twilight fell it soon passed darkness had about set in when roberts came over to joan carrying bread coffee and venison  heres your supper joan he called quite loud and cheerily and then he whispered mebbe it aint so bad theyall seem friendly but im scared joan if you jest wasnt so dam handsome or if only he hadnt seen you  cant we slip off in the dark she whispered in return  we might try but itd be no use if they mean bad i cant make up my mind yet whats comin off its all right for you to pretend youre bashful but dont lose your nerve  then he returned to the campfire joan was hungry she ate and drank what had been given her and that helped her to realize reality and although dread abided with her she grew curious almost she imagined she was fascinated by her predicament she had always been an emotional girl of strong will and selfrestraint she had always longed for she knew not whatperhaps freedom certain places had haunted her she had felt that something should have happened to her there yet nothing ever had happened certain books had obsessed her even when a child and often to her mothers dismay for these books had been of wild places and life on the sea adventure and bloodshed it had always been said of her that she should have been a boy  night settled down black a pale narrow cloud marked by a train of stars extended across the dense blue sky the wind moaned in the cedars and roared in the replenished campfire sparks flew away into the shadows and on the puffs of smoke that blew toward her came the sweet pungent odor of burning cedar coyotes barked off under the brush and from away on the ridge drifted the dismal defiance of a wolf  camplife was no new thing to joan she had crossed the plains in a wagontrain that more than once had known the longdrawn yell of hostile indians she had prospected and hunted in the mountains with her uncle weeks at a time but never before this night had the wildness the loneliness been so vivid to her  roberts was on his knees scouring his oven with wet sand his big shaggy head nodded in the firelight he seemed pondering and thick and slow there was a burden upon him the man bill and his companion lay back against stones and conversed low kells stood up in the light of the blaze he had a pipe at which he took long pulls and then sent up clouds of smoke there was nothing imposing in his build or striking in his face at that distance but it took no second look to see here was a man remarkably out of the ordinary some kind of power and intensity emanated from him from time to time he appeared to glance in joans direction still she could not be sure for his eyes were but shadows he had cast aside his coat he wore a vest open all the way and a checked soft shirt with a black tie hanging untidily a broad belt swung below his hip and in the holster was a heavy gun that was a strange place to carry a gun joan thought it looked awkward to her when he walked it might swing round and bump against his leg and he certainly would have to put it some other place when he rode  say have you got a blanket for that girl asked kells removing his pipe from his lips to address roberts  i got saddleblankets responded roberts you see we didnt expect to be caught out  ill let you have one said kells walking away from the fire it will be cold he returned with a blanket which he threw to roberts  much obliged muttered roberts  ill bunk by the fire went on the other and with that he sat down and appeared to become absorbed in thought  roberts brought the borrowed blanket and several saddleblankets over to where joan was and laying them down he began to kick and scrape stones and brush aside  pretty rocky place this here is he said reckon youll sleep some though  then he began arranging the blankets into a bed presently joan felt a tug at her ridingskirt she looked down  ill be right by you he whispered with his big hand to his mouth an i aint agoin to sleep none  whereupon he returned to the campfire presently joan not because she was tired or sleepy but because she wanted to act naturally lay down on the bed and pulled a blanket up over her there was no more talking among the men once she heard the jingle of spurs and the rustle of cedar brush by and by roberts came back to her dragging his saddle and lay down near her joan raised up a little to see kells motionless and absorbed by the fire he had a strained and tense position she sank back softly and looked up at the cold bright stars what was going to happen to her something terrible the very night shadows the silence the presence of strange men all told her and a shudder that was a thrill ran over and over her  she would lie awake it would be impossible to sleep and suddenly into her full mind flashed an idea to slip away in the darkness find her horse and so escape from any possible menace this plan occupied her thoughts for a long while if she had not been used to western ways she would have tried just that thing but she rejected it she was not sure that she could slip away or find her horse or elude pursuit and certainly not sure of her way home it would be best to stay with roberts  when that was settled her mind ceased to race she grew languid and sleepy the warmth of the blankets stole over her she had no idea of sleeping yet she found sleep more and more difficult to resist time that must have been hours passed the fire died down and then brightened the shadows darkened and then lightened someone now and then got up to throw on wood the thump of hobbled hoofs sounded out in the darkness the wind was still and the coyotes were gone she could no longer open her eyes they seemed glued shut and then gradually all sense of the night and the wild of the drowsy warmth faded  when she awoke the air was nipping cold her eyes snapped open clear and bright the tips of the cedars were ruddy in the sunrise a campfire crackled blue smoke curled upward joan sat up with a rush of memory roberts and kells were bustling round the fire the man bill was carrying water the other fellow had brought in the horses and was taking off the hobbles no one apparently paid any attention to joan she got up and smoothed out her tangled hair which she always wore in a braid down her back when she rode she had slept then and in her boots that was the first time she had ever done that when she went down to the brook to bathe her face and wash her hands the men still apparently took no notice of her she began to hope that roberts had exaggerated their danger her horse was rather skittish and did not care for strange hands he broke away from the bunch joan went after him even lost sight of camp presently after she caught him she led him back to camp and tied him up and then she was so far emboldened as to approach the fire and to greet the men  good morning she said brightly  kells had his back turned at the moment he did not move or speak or give any sign he had heard the man bill stared boldly at her but without a word roberts returned her greeting and as she glanced quickly at him drawn by his voice he turned away but she had seen that his face was dark haggard worn  joans cheer and hope sustained a sudden and violent check there was something wrong in this group and she could not guess what it was she seemed to have a queer dragging weight at her limbs she was glad to move over to a stone and sink down upon it roberts brought her breakfast but he did not speak or look at her his hands shook and this frightened joan what was going to happen roberts went back to the campfire joan had to force herself to eat there was one thing of which she was surethat she would need all the strength and fortitude she could summon  joan became aware presently that kells was conversing with roberts but too low for her to hear what was said she saw roberts make a gesture of fierce protest about the other man there was an air cool persuading dominant he ceased speaking as if the incident were closed roberts hurried and blundered through his task with his pack and went for his horse the animal limped slightly but evidently was not in bad shape roberts saddled him tied on the pack then he saddled joans horse that done he squared around with the front of a man who had to face something he dreaded  come on joan were ready he called his voice was loud but not natural  joan started to cross to him when kells strode between them she might not have been there for all the sign this ominous man gave of her presence he confronted roberts in the middle of the campcircle and halted perhaps a rod distant  roberts get on your horse and clear out he said  roberts dropped his halter and straightened up it was a bolder action than any he had heretofore given perhaps the mask was off now he was wholly sure of what he had only feared subterfuge and blindness were in vain and now he could be a man some change worked in his facea blanching a setting  no i wont go without the girl he said  but you cant take her  joan vibrated to a sudden start so this was what was going to happen her heart almost stood still breathless and quivering she watched these two men about whom now all was strangely magnified  reckon ill go along with you then replied roberts  your companys not wanted  wal ill go anyway  this was only play at words joan thought she divined in roberts a cold and grim acceptance of something he had expected and the voice of kellswhat did that convey still the man seemed slow easy kind amiable  havent you got any sense roberts he asked  roberts made no reply to that  go on home say nothing or anythingwhatever you like continued kells you did me a favor once over in california i like to remember favors use your head now hit the trail  not without her ill fight first declared roberts and his hands began to twitch and jerk  joan did not miss the wonderful intentness of the palegray eyes that watched robertshis face his glance his hands  what good will it do to fight asked kells he laughed coolly that wont help her you ought to know what youll get  kellsill die before i leave that girl in your clutches flashed roberts an i aint agoin to stand here an argue with you let her comeor  you dont strike me as a fool interrupted kells his voice was suave smooth persuasive cool what strengthwhat certainty appeared behind it its not my habit to argue with fools take the chance i offer you hit the trail life is precious man youve no chance here and whats one girl more or less to you  kells i may be a fool but im a man passionately rejoined roberts why youre somethin inhuman i knew that out in the goldfields but to think you can stand therean talk sweet an pleasantwith no idee of manhood let her come noworor im agoin for my gun  roberts havent you a wifechildren  yes i have shouted roberts huskily an that wife would disown me if i left joan randle to you an ive got a grown girl mebbe some day she might need a man to stand between her an such as you jack kells  all roberts pathos and passion had no effect unless to bring out by contrast the singular and ruthless nature of jack kells  will you hit the trail  no thundered roberts  until then joan randle had been fascinated held by the swift interchange between her friend and enemy but now she had a convulsion of fear she had seen men fight but never to the death roberts crouched like a wolf at bay there was a madness upon him he shook like a rippling leaf suddenly his shoulder lurchedhis arm swung  joan wheeled away in horror shutting her eyes covering her ears running blindly then upon her muffled hearing burst the boom of a gun     3  joan ran on stumbling over rocks and brush with a darkness before her eyes the terror in her soul she was out in the cedars when someone grasped her from behind she felt the hands as the coils of a snake then she was ready to faint but she must not faint she struggled away stood free it was the man bill who had caught her he said something that was unintelligible she reached for the snag of a dead cedar and leaning there fought her weakness that cold black horror which seemed a physical thing in her mind her blood her muscles  when she recovered enough for the thickness to leave her sight she saw kells coming leading her horse and his own at sight of him a strange swift heat shot through her then she was confounded with the thought of roberts  roroberts she faltered  kells gave her a piercing glance miss randle i had to take the fight out of your friend he said  youyouis hedead  i just crippled his gun arm if i hadnt he would have hurt somebody hell ride back to hoadley and tell your folks about it so theyll know youre safe  safe she whispered  thats what i said miss randle if youre going to ride out into the borderif its possible to be safe out there youll be so with me  but i want to go home oh please let me go  i couldnt think of it  thenwhat will youdo with me  again that gray glance pierced her his eyes were clear flawless like crystal without coldness warmth expression ill get a barrel of gold out of you  how she asked wonderingly  ill hold you for ransom sooner or later those prospectors over there are going to strike gold strike it rich i know that ive got to make a living some way  kells was tightening the cinch on her saddle while he spoke his voice his manner the amiable smile on his intelligent face they all appeared to come from sincerity but for those strange eyes joan would have wholly believed him as it was a half doubt troubled her she remembered the character roberts had given this man still she was recovering her nerve it had been the certainty of disaster to roberts that had made her weaken as he was only slightly wounded and free to ride home safely she had not the horror of his death upon her indeed she was now so immensely uplifted that she faced the situation unflinchingly  bill called kells to the man standing there with a grin on his coarse red face you go back and help halloway pack then take my trail  bill nodded and was walking away when kells called after him and say bill dont say anything to roberts hes easily riled  haw haw haw laughed bill  his harsh laughter somehow rang jarringly in joans ears but she was used to violent men who expressed mirth over mirthless jokes  get up miss randle said kells as he mounted weve a long ride youll need all your strength so i advise you to come quietly with me and not try to get away it wont be any use trying  joan climbed into her saddle and rode after him once she looked back in hope of seeing roberts of waving a hand to him she saw his horse standing saddled and she saw bill struggling under a pack but there was no sign of roberts then more cedars intervened and the camp site was lost to view when she glanced ahead her first thought was to take in the points of kellss horse she had been used to horses all her life kells rode a big rangy baya horse that appeared to snort speed and endurance her pony could never run away from that big brute still joan had the temper to make an attempt to escape if a favorable way presented  the morning was rosy clear cool there was a sweet dry tang in the air whitetailed deer bounded out of the open spaces and the graydomed glistening mountains with their bold blackfringed slopes overshadowed the close foothills  joan was a victim to swift vagaries of thought and conflicting emotions she was riding away with a freebooter a roadagent to be held for ransom the fact was scarcely credible she could not shake the dread of nameless peril she tried not to recall robertss words yet they haunted her if she had not been so handsome he had said joan knew she possessed good looks but they had never caused her any particular concern that kells had let that influence himas roberts had imaginedwas more than absurd kells had scarcely looked at her it was gold such men wanted she wondered what her ransom would be where her uncle would get it and if there really was a likelihood of that rich strike then she remembered her mother who had died when she was a little girl and a strange sweet sadness abided with her it passed she saw her unclethat great robust hearty splendid old man with his laugh and his kindness and his love for her and his everlasting unquenchable belief that soon he would make a rich goldstrike what a roar and a stampede he would raise at her loss the village camp might be divided on that score she thought because the few young women in that little settlement hated her and the young men would have more peace without her suddenly her thought shifted to jim cleve the cause of her present misfortune she had forgotten jim in the interval somehow he had grown sweet to remember how he had fought for her and kept it secret after all she had misjudged him she had hated him because she liked him maybe she did more that gave her a shock she recalled his kisses and then flamed all over if she did not hate him she ought to he had been so useless he ran after her so he was the laughingstock of the village his actions made her other admirers and friends believe she cared for him was playing fastandloose with him still there was a difference now he had terribly transgressed he had frightened her with threats of dire ruin to himself and because of that she had trailed him to fall herself upon a hazardous experience where was jim cleve now like a flash then occurred to her the singular possibility jim had ridden for the border with the avowed and desperate intention of finding kells and gulden and the bad men of that trackless region he would do what he had sworn he would and here she was the cause of it all a captive of this notorious kells she was being led into that wild border country somewhere out there kells and jim cleve would meet jim would find her in kellss hands then there would be hell joan thought the possibility the certainty seemed to strike deep into her reviving that dread and terror yet she thrilled again a ripple that was not all cold coursed through her something had a birth in her then and the part of it she understood was that she welcomed the adventure with a throbbing heart yet looked with awe and shame and distrust at this new strange side of her nature  and while her mind was thus thronged the morning hours passed swiftly the miles of foothills were climbed and descended a green gap of canon wild and yellowwalled yawned before her opening into the mountain  kells halted on the grassy bank of a shallow brook get down well noon here and rest the horses he said to joan i cant say that youre anything but game weve done perhaps twentyfive miles this morning  the mouth of this canon was a wild greenflowered beautiful place there were willows and alders and aspens along the brook the green bench was like a grassy meadow joan caught a glimpse of a brown object a deer or bear stealing away through sprucetrees on the slope she dismounted aware now that her legs ached and it was comfortable to stretch them looking backward across the valley toward the last foothill she saw the other men with horses and packs coming she had a habit of close observation and she thought that either the men with the packs had now one more horse than she remembered or else she had not seen the extra one her attention shifted then she watched kells unsaddle the horses he was wiry muscular quick with his hands the big bluecylindered gun swung in front of him that gun had a queer kind of attraction for her the curved black butt made her think of a sharp grip of hand upon it kells did not hobble the horses he slapped his bay on the haunch and drove him down toward the brook joans pony followed they drank cracked the stones climbed the other bank and began to roll in the grass then the other men with the packs trotted up joan was glad she had not thought of it before but now she felt she would rather not be alone with kells she remarked then that there was no extra horse in the bunch it seemed strange her thinking that and she imagined she was not clearheaded  throw the packs bill said kells  another fire was kindled and preparations made toward a noonday meal bill and halloway appeared loquacious and inclined to steal glances at joan when kells could not notice halloway whistled a dixie tune then bill took advantage of the absence of kells who went down to the brook and he began to leer at joan and make bold eyes at her joan appeared not to notice him and thereafter averted her gaze the men chuckled  shes the proud hussy but she aint foolin me ive knowed a heap of wimmen whereupon halloway guffawed and between them in lower tones they exchanged mysterious remarks kells returned with a bucket of water  whats got into you men he queried  both of them looked around blusteringily innocent  reckon its the same thats ailin you replied bill he showed that among wild unhampered men how little could inflame and change  boss its the onaccustomed company added halloway with a conciliatory smile bill sort of warms up he jest cant help it an seein what a thunderin crab he always is why im glad an welcome  kells vouchsafed no reply to this and turning away continued his tasks joan had a close look at his eyes and again she was startled they were not like eyes but just gray spaces opaque openings with nothing visible behind yet with something terrible there  the preparations for the meal went on somewhat constrainedly on the part of bill and halloway and presently were ended then the men attended to it with appetites born of the open and of action joan sat apart from them on the bank of the brook and after she had appeased her own hunger she rested leaning back in the shade of an alderbush a sailing shadow crossed near her and looking up she saw an eagle flying above the ramparts of the canon then she had a drowsy spell but she succumbed to it only to the extent of closing her eyes time dragged on she would rather have been in the saddle these men were leisurely and kells was provokingly slow they had nothing to do with time but waste it she tried to combat the desire for hurry for action she could not gain anything by worry nevertheless resignation would not come to her and her hope began to flag something portended evilsomething hung in the balance  the snort and tramp of horses roused her and upon sitting up she saw the men about to pack and saddle again kells had spoken to her only twice so far that day she was grateful for his silence but could not understand it he seemed to have a preoccupied air that somehow did not fit the amiableness of his face he looked gentle goodnatured he was softspoken he gave an impression of kindness but joan began to realize that he was not what he seemed he had something on his mind it was not conscience nor a burden it might be a projection a plan an absorbing scheme a something that gained food with thought joan wondered doubtfully if it were the ransom of gold he expected to get  presently when all was about in readiness for a fresh start she rose to her feet kellss bay was not tractable at the moment bill held out joans bridle to her and their hands touched the contact was an accident but it resulted in bills grasping back at her hand she jerked it away scarcely comprehending then all under the brown of his face she saw creep a dark ruddy tide he reached for her thenput his hand on her breast it was an instinctive animal action he meant nothing she divined that he could not help it she had lived with rough men long enough to know he had no motiveno thought at all but at the profanation of such a touch she shrank back uttering a cry  at her elbow she heard a quick step and a sharpdrawn breath or hiss  aw jack cried bill  then kells in lithe and savage swiftness came between them he swung his gun hitting bill full in the face the man fell limp and heavy and he lay there with a bloody gash across his brow kells stood over him a moment slowly lowering the gun joan feared he meant to shoot  oh dontdont she cried hehe didnt hurt me  kells pushed her back when he touched her she seemed to feel the shock of an electric current his face had not changed but his eyes were terrible on the background of gray were strange leaping red flecks  take your horse he ordered no walk across the brook theres a trail go up the canon ill come presently dont run and dont hide itll be the worse for you if you do hurry  joan obeyed she flashed past the openjawed halloway and running down to the brook stepped across from stone to stone she found the trail and hurriedly followed it she did not look back it never occurred to her to hide to try to get away she only obeyed conscious of some force that dominated her once she heard loud voices then the shrill neigh of a horse the trail swung under the left wall of the canon and ran along the noisy brook she thought she heard shots and was startled but she could not be sure she stopped to listen only the babble of swift water and the sough of wind in the spruces greeted her ears she went on beginning to collect her thoughts to conjecture on the significance of kellss behavior  but had that been the spring of his motive she doubted itshe doubted all about him save that subtle essence of violence of ruthless force and intensity of terrible capacity which hung round him  a halloo caused her to stop and turn two packhorses were jogging up the trail kells was driving them and leading her pony nothing could be seen of the other men kells rapidly overhauled her and she had to get out of the trail to let the packanimals pass he threw her bridle to her  get up he said  she complied and then she bravely faced him where arethe other men  we parted company he replied curtly  why she persisted  well if youre anxious to know it was because you were winning theirregardtoo much to suit me  winning their regard joan exclaimed blankly  here those gray piercing eyes went through her then swiftly shifted she was quick to divine from that the inference in his wordshe suspected her of flirting with those ruffians perhaps to escape him through them that had only been his suspiciongroundless after his swift glance at her perhaps unconsciousness of his meaning a simulated innocence and ignorance might serve her with this strange man she resolved to try it to use all her womans intuition and wit and cunning here was an educated man who was a criminalan outcast deep within him might be memories of a different life they might be stirred joan decided in that swift instant that if she could understand him learn his real intentions toward her she could cope with him  bill and his pard were thinking too much ofof the ransom im after went on kells with a short laugh come on now ride close to me  joan turned into the trail with his laugh ringing in her ears did she only imagine a mockery in it was there any reason to believe a word this man said she appeared as helpless to see through him as she was in her predicament  they had entered a canon such as was typical of that mountain range and the winding trail which ran beneath the yellow walls was one unused to travel joan could not make out any old tracks except those of deer and cougar the crashing of wild animals into the chaparral and the scarcely frightened flight of rabbits and grouse attested to the wildness of the place they passed an old tumbledown log cabin once used no doubt by prospectors and hunters here the trail ended yet kells kept on up the canon and for all joan could tell the walls grew only the higher and the timber heavier and the space wilder  at a turn when the second packhorse that appeared unused to his task came fully into joans sight she was struck with his resemblance to some horse with which she was familiar it was scarcely an impression which she might have received from seeing kellss horse or bills or any ones a few times therefore she watched this animal studying his gait and behavior it did not take long for her to discover that he was not a packhorse he resented that burden he did not know how to swing it this made her deeply thoughtful and she watched closer than ever all at once there dawned on her the fact that the resemblance here was to robertss horse she caught her breath and felt again that cold gnawing of fear within her then she closed her eyes the better to remember significant points about robertss sorrela white left front foot an old diamond brand a ragged forelock and an unusual marking a light bar across his face when joan had recalled these she felt so certain that she would find them on this packhorse that she was afraid to open her eyes she forced herself to look and it seemed that in one glance she saw three of them still she clung to hope then the horse picking his way partially turning toward her disclosed the bar across his face  joan recognized it roberts was not on his way home kells had lied kells had killed him how plain and fearful the proof it verified robertss gloomy prophecy joan suddenly grew sick and dizzy she reeled in her saddle it was only by dint of the last effort of strength and selfcontrol that she kept her seat she fought the horror as if it were a beast hanging over the pommel with shut eyes letting her pony find the way she sustained this shock of discovery and did not let it utterly overwhelm her and as she conquered the sickening weakness her mind quickened to the changed aspect of her situation she understood kells and the appalling nature of her peril she did not know how she understood him now but doubt had utterly fled all was clear real grim present like a child she had been deceived for no reason she could see that talk of ransom was false likewise kellss assertion that he had parted company with halloway and bill because he would not share the ransomthat too was false the idea of a ransom in this light was now ridiculous from that first moment kells had wanted her he had tried to persuade roberts to leave her and failing had killed him he had rid himself of the other two menand now joan knew she had heard shots back there kellss intention loomed out of all his dark brooding and it stood clear now to her dastardly worse than captivity or torture or deaththe worst fate that could befall a woman  the reality of it now was so astounding trueas true as those stories she had deemed impossible because she and her people and friends had appeared secure in their mountain camp and happy in their work and trustful of good they had scarcely credited the rumors of just such things as had happened to her the stage held up by roadagents a lonely prospector murdered and robbed fights in the saloons and on the trails and useless pursuit of hardriding men out there on the border elusive as arabs swift as apachesthese facts had been terrible enough without the dread of worse the truth of her capture the meaning of it were raw shocking spurs to joan randles intelligence and courage since she still lived which was strange indeed in the illuminating light of her later insight into kells and his kind she had to meet him with all that was catlike and subtle and devilish at the command of a woman she had to win him foil him kill himor go to her death she was no girl to be dragged into the mountain fastness by a desperado and made a plaything her horror and terror had worked its way deep into the depths of her and uncovered powers never suspected never before required in her scheme of life she had no longer any fear she matched herself against this man she anticipated him and she felt like a woman who had lately been a thoughtless girl who in turn had dreamed of vague old happenings of a past before she was born of impossible adventures in her own future hate and wrath and outraged womanhood were not wholly the secret of joan randles flaming spirit     4  joan randle rode on and on through the canon out at its head and over a pass into another canon and never did she let it be possible for kells to see her eyes until she knew beyond peradventure of a doubt that they hid the strength and spirit and secret of her soul  the time came when traveling was so steep and rough that she must think first of her horse and her own safety kells led up over a rockjumbled spur of range where she had sometimes to follow on foot it seemed miles across that wilderness of stone foxes and wolves trotted over open places watching stealthily all around dark mountain peaks stood up the afternoon was far advanced when kells started to descend again and he rode a zigzag course on weathered slopes and over brushy benches down and down into the canons again  a lonely peak was visible sunsetflushed against the blue from the point where kells finally halted that ended the longest ride joan had ever made in one day for miles and miles they had climbed and descended and wound into the mountains joan had scarcely any idea of direction she was completely turned around and lost this spot was the wildest and most beautiful she had ever seen a canon headed here it was narrow lowwalled and luxuriant with grass and wild roses and willow and spruce and balsam there were deer standing with long ears erect motionless curious tame as cattle there were moving streaks through the long grass showing the course of smaller animals slipping away  then under a giant balsam that reached aloft to the rimwall joan saw a little log cabin open in front it had not been built very long some of the log ends still showed yellow it did not resemble the hunters and prospectors cabins she had seen on her trips with her uncle  in a sweeping glance joan had taken in these features kells had dismounted and approached her she looked frankly but not directly at him  im tiredalmost too tired to get off she said  fifty miles of rock and brush up and down without a kick he exclaimed admiringly youve got sand girl  where are we  this is lost canon only a few men know of it and they areattached to me i intend to keep you here  how long she felt the intensity of his gaze  whyas long as he replied slowly till i get my ransom  what amount will you ask  youre worth a hundred thousand in gold right now maybe later i might let you go for less  joans keenwrought perception registered his covert scarcely veiled implication he was studying her  oh poor uncle hell never never get so much  sure he will replied kells bluntly  then he helped her out of the saddle she was stiff and awkward and she let herself slide kells handled her gently and like a gentleman and for joan the first agonizing moment of her ordeal was past her intuition had guided her correctly kells might have been and probably was the most depraved of outcast men but the presence of a girl like her however it affected him must also have brought up associations of a time when by family and breeding and habit he had been infinitely different his action here just like the ruffian bills was instinctive beyond his control just this slight thing this frail link that joined kells to his past and better life immeasurably inspirited joan and outlined the difficult game she had to play  youre a very gallant robber she said  he appeared not to hear that or to note it he was eying her up and down and he moved closer perhaps to estimate her height compared to his own  i didnt know you were so tall youre above my shoulder  yes im very lanky  lanky why youre not that youve a splendid figuretall supple strong youre like a nez perce girl i knew once youre a beautiful thing didnt you know that  not particularly my friends dont dare flatter me i suppose ill have to stand it from you but i didnt expect compliments from jack kells of the border legion  border legion whered you hear that name  i didnt hear it i made it upthought of it myself  well youve invented something ill use and whats your nameyour first name i heard roberts use it  joan felt a cold contraction of all her internal being but outwardly she never so much as nicked an eyelash my names joan  joan he placed heavy compelling hands on her shoulders and turned her squarely toward him  again she felt his gaze strangely like the reflection of sunlight from ice she had to look at him this was her supreme test for hours she had prepared for it steeled herself wrought upon all that was sensitive in her and now she prayed and swiftly looked up into his eyes they were windows of a gray hell and she gazed into that naked abyss at that dark uncovered soul with only the timid anxiety and fear and the unconsciousness of an innocent ignorant girl  joan you know why i brought you here  yes of course you told me she replied steadily you want to ransom me for gold and im afraid youll have to take me home without getting any  you know what i mean to do to you he went on thickly  do to me she echoed and she never quivered a muscle youyou didnt say i havent thought but you wont hurt me will you its not my fault if theres no gold to ransom me  he shook her his face changed grew darker you know what i mean  i dont with some show of spirit she essayed to slip out of his grasp he held her the tighter  how old are you  it was only in her height and development that joan looked anywhere near her age often she had been taken for a very young girl  im seventeen she replied this was not the truth it was a lie that did not falter on lips which had scorned falsehood  seventeen he ejaculated in amaze honestly now  she lifted her chin scornfully and remained silent  well i thought you were a woman i took you to be twentyfiveat least twentytwo seventeen with that shape youre only a girla kid you dont know anything  then he released her almost with violence as if angered at her or himself and he turned away to the horses joan walked toward the little cabin the strain of that encounter left her weak but once from under his eyes certain that she had carried her point she quickly regained her poise there might be probably would be infinitely more trying ordeals for her to meet than this one had been she realized however that never again would she be so near betrayal of terror and knowledge and self  the scene of her isolation had a curious fascination for her somethingand she shudderedwas to happen to her here in this lonely silent gorge there were some flat stones made into a rude seat under the balsamtree and a swift yardwide stream of clear water ran by observing something white against the tree joan went closer a card the ace of hearts had been pinned to the bark by a small cluster of bulletholes every one of which touched the red heart and one of them had obliterated it below the circle of bulletholes scrawled in rude letters with a leadpencil was the name gulden how little a few nights back when jim cleve had menaced joan with the names of kells and gulden had she imagined they were actual men she was to meet and fear and here she was the prisoner of one of them she would ask kells who and what this gulden was the log cabin was merely a shed without fireplace or window and the floor was a covering of balsam boughs long dried out and withered a dim trail led away from it down the canon if joan was any judge of trails this one had not seen the imprint of a horse track for many months kells had indeed brought her to a hiding place one of those perhaps that camp gossip said was inaccessible to any save a border hawk joan knew that only an indian could follow the tortuous and rocky trail by which kells had brought her in she would never be tracked there by her own people  the long ride had left her hot dusty scratched with tangled hair and torn habit she went over to her saddle which kells had removed from her pony and opening the saddlebag she took inventory of her possessions they were few enough but now in view of an unexpected and enforced sojourn in the wilds beyond all calculation of value and they included towel soap toothbrush mirror and comb and brush a red scarf and gloves it occurred to her how seldom she carried that bag on her saddle and thinking back referred the fact to accident and then with honest amusement owned that the motive might have been also a little vanity taking the bag she went to a flat stone by the brook and rolling up her sleeves proceeded to improve her appearance with deft fingers she rebraided her hair and arranged it as she had worn it when only sixteen then resolutely she got up and crossed over to where kells was unpacking  ill help you get supper she said  he was on his knees in the midst of a jumble of camp duffle that had been hastily thrown together he looked up at herfrom her shapely strong brown arms to the face she had rubbed rosy  say but youre a pretty girl  he said it enthusiastically in unstinted admiration without the slightest subtlety or suggestion and if he had been the devil himself it would have been no less a compliment given spontaneously to youth and beauty  im glad if its so but please dont tell me she rejoined simply  then with swift and businesslike movements she set to helping him with the mess the inexperienced packhorse had made of that particular pack and when that was straightened out she began with the biscuit dough while he lighted a fire it appeared to be her skill rather than her willingness that he yielded to he said very little but he looked at her often and he had little periods of abstraction the situation was novel strange to him sometimes joan read his mind and sometimes he was an enigma but she divined when he was thinking what a picture she looked there on her knees before the breadpan with flour on her arms of the difference a girl brought into any place of how strange it seemed that this girl instead of lying a limp and disheveled rag under a tree weeping and praying for home made the best of a bad situation and unproved it wonderfully by being a thoroughbred  presently they sat down crosslegged one on each side of the tarpaulin and began the meal that was the strangest supper joan ever sat down to it was like a dream where there was danger that tortured her but she knew she was dreaming and would soon wake up kells was almost imperceptibly changing the amiability of his face seemed to have stiffened the only time he addressed her was when he offered to help her to more meat or bread or coffee after the meal was finished he would not let her wash the pans and pots and attended to that himself  joan went to the seat by the tree near the campfire a purple twilight was shadowing the canon far above on the bold peak the last warmth of the afterglow was fading there was no wind no sound no movement joan wondered where jim cleve was then they had often sat in the twilight she felt an unreasonable resentment toward him knowing she was to blame but blaming him for her plight then suddenly she thought of her uncle of home of her kindly old aunt who always worried so about her indeed there was cause to worry she felt sorrier for them than for herself and that broke her spirit momentarily forlorn and with a wave of sudden sorrow and dread and hopelessness she dropped her head upon her knees and covered her face tears were a relief she forgot kells and the part she must play but she remembered swiftlyat the rude touch of his hand  here are you crying he asked roughly  do you think im laughing joan retorted her wet eyes as she raised them were proof enough  stop it  i cant helpbut crya little i was ththinking of homeof those whove been father and mother to mesince i was a baby i wasnt cryingfor myself but theytheyll be so miserable they loved me so  it wont help matters to cry  joan stood up then no longer sincere and forgetful but the girl with her deep and cunning game she leaned close to him in the twilight  did you ever love any one did you ever have a sistera girl like me  kells stalked away into the gloom  joan was left alone she did not know whether to interpret his abstraction his temper and his action as favorable or not still she hoped and prayed they meant that he had some good in him if she could only hide her terror her abhorrence her knowledge of him and his motive she built up a bright campfire there was an abundance of wood she dreaded the darkness and the night besides the air was growing chilly so arranging her saddle and blankets near the fire she composed herself in a comfortable seat to await kellss return and developments it struck her forcibly that she had lost some of her fear of kells and she did not know why she ought to fear him more every hourevery minute presently she heard his step brushing the grass and then he emerged out of the gloom he had a load of firewood on his shoulder  did you get over your grief he asked glancing down upon her  yes she replied  kells stooped for a red ember with which he lighted his pipe and then he seated himself a little back from the fire the blaze threw a bright glare over him and in it he looked neither formidable nor vicious nor ruthless he asked her where she was born and upon receiving an answer he followed that up with another question and he kept this up until joan divined that he was not so much interested in what he apparently wished to learn as he was in her presence her voice her personality she sensed in him loneliness hunger for the sound of a voice she had heard her uncle speak of the loneliness of lonely campfires and how all men working or hiding or lost in the wilderness would see sweet faces in the embers and be haunted by soft voices after all kells was human and she talked as never before in her life brightly willingly eloquently telling the facts of her eventful youth and girlhoodthe sorrow and the joy and some of the dreamsup to the time she had come to camp hoadley  did you leave any sweethearts over there at hoadley he asked after a silence  yes  how many  a whole campful she replied with a laugh but admirers is a better name for them  then theres no one fellow  hardlyyet  how would you like being kept here in this lonesome place forwell say for ever  i wouldnt like that replied joan id like thiscamping out like this nowif my folks only knew i am alive and well and safe i love lonely dreamy places ive dreamed of being in just such a one as this it seems so far away hereso shut in by the walls and the blackness so silent and sweet i love the stars they speak to me and the wind in the spruces hear it very low mournful that whispers to metomorrow id like it here if i had no worry ive never grown up yet i explore and climb trees and hunt for little birds and rabbitsyoung things just born all fuzzy and sweet frightened piping or squealing for their mothers but i wont touch one for worlds i simply cant hurt anything i cant spur my horse or beat him oh i hate pain  youre a strange girl to live out here on this border he said  im no different from other girls you dont know girls  i knew one pretty well she put a rope round my neck he replied grimly  a rope  yes i mean a halter a hangmans noose but i balked her  oh a good girl  bad bad to the core of her black heartbad as i am he exclaimed with fierce low passion  joan trembled the man in an instant seemed transformed somber as death she could not look at him but she must keep on talking  bad you dont seem bad to meonly violent perhaps or wild tell me about yourself  she had stirred him his neglected pipe fell from his hand in the gloom of the campfire he must have seen faces or ghosts of his past  why not he queried strangely why not do whats been impossible for yearsopen my lips itll not matterto a girl who can never tell have i forgotten godi have not listen so that youll know im bad my names not kells i was born in the east and went to school there till i ran away i was young ambitious wild i stole i ran awaycame west in fiftyone to the goldfields in california there i became a prospector miner gambler robberand roadagent i had evil in me as all men have and those wild years brought it out i had no chance evil and gold and bloodthey are one and the same thing i committed every crime till no place bad as it might be was safe for me driven and hunted and shot and starvedalmost hanged and now imkells of that outcast crew you named the border legion every black crime but onethe blackestand that haunting me itching my hands tonight  oh you speak soso dreadfully cried joan what can i say im sorry for you i dont believe it all whatwhat black crime haunts you oh what could be possible tonighthere in this lonely canonwith only me  dark and terrible the man arose  girl he said hoarsely tonighttonightill what have you done to me one more dayand ill be mad to do right by youinstead of wrong do you understand that  joan leaned forward in the campfire light with outstretched hands and quivering lips as overcome by his halting confession of one last remnant of honor as she was by the dark hint of his passion  nonoi dont understandnor believe she cried but you frighten meso i am allall alone with you here you said id be safe dontdont  her voice broke then and she sank back exhausted in her seat probably kells had heard only the first words of her appeal for he took to striding back and forth in the circle of the campfire light the scabbard with the big gun swung against his leg it grew to be a dark and monstrous thing in joans sight a marvelous intuition born of that hour warned her of kellss subjection to the beast in him even while with all the manhood left to him he still battled against it her girlish sweetness and innocence had availed nothing except mock him with the ghost of dead memories he could not be won or foiled she must get her hands on that gunkill himor the alternative was death for herself and she leaned there slowly gathering all the unconquerable and unquenchable forces of a womans nature waiting to make one desperate supreme and final effort     5  kells strode there a black silent shadow plodding with bent head as if all about and above him were demons and furies  joans perceptions of him of the night of the inanimate and imponderable black walls and of herself were exquisitely and abnormally keen she saw him there bowed under his burden gloomy and wroth and sick with himself because the man in him despised the coward men of his stamp were seldom or never cowards their lives did not breed cowardice or baseness joan knew the burning in her breastthat thing which inflamed and swept through her like a wind of firewas hate yet her heart held a grain of pity for him she measured his forbearance his struggle against the monstrous cruelty and passion engendered by a wild life among wild men at a wild time and considering his opportunities of the long hours and lonely miles she was grateful and did not in the least underestimate what it cost him how different from bill or halloway he had been but all this was nothing and her thinking of it useless unless he conquered himself she only waited holding on to that steellike control of her nerves motionless and silent  she leaned back against her saddle a blanket covering her with wideopen eyes and despite the presence of that stalking figure and the fact of her mind being locked round one terrible and inevitable thought she saw the changing beautiful glow of the firelogs and the cold pitiless stars and the mustering shadows under the walls she heard too the low rising sigh of the wind in the balsam and the silvery tinkle of the brook and sounds only imagined or nameless yet a stern and insupportable silence weighed her down this dark canon seemed at the ends of the earth she felt encompassed by illimitable and stupendous upflung mountains insulated in a vast dark silent tomb  kells suddenly came to her treading noiselessly and he leaned over her his visage was a dark blur but the posture of him was that of a wolf about to spring lower he leanedslowlyand yet lower joan saw the heavy gun swing away from his leg she saw it black and clear against the blaze a cold blue light glinted from its handle and then kells was near enough for her to see his face and his eyes that were but shadows of flames she gazed up at him steadily openeyed with no fear or shrinking his breathing was quick and loud he looked down at her for an endless moment then straightening his bent form he resumed his walk to and fro  after that for joan time might have consisted of moments or hours each of which was marked by kells looming over her he appeared to approach her from all sides he round her wideeyed sleepless his shadowy glance gloated over her lithe slender shape and then he strode away into the gloom sometimes she could no longer hear his steps and then she was quiveringly alert listening fearful that he might creep upon her like a panther at times he kept the campfire blazing brightly at others he let it die down and these dark intervals were frightful for her the night seemed treacherous in league with her foe it was endless she prayed for dawnyet with a blank hopelessness for what the day might bring could she hold out through more interminable hours would she not break from sheer strain there were moments when she wavered and shook like a leaf in the wind when the beating of her heart was audible when a child could have seen her distress there were other moments when all was ugly unreal impossible like things in a nightmare but when kells was near or approached to look at her like a cat returned to watch a captive mouse she was again strong waiting with ever a strange and cold sense of the nearness of that swinging gun late in the night she missed him for how long she had no idea she had less trust in his absence than his presence the nearer he came to her the stronger she grew and the clearer of purpose at last the black void of canon lost its blackness and turned to gray dawn was at hand the horrible endless night in which she had aged from girl to woman had passed joan had never closed her eyes a single instant  when day broke she got up the long hours in which she had rested motionlessly had left her muscles cramped and dead she began to walk off the feeling kells had just stirred from his blanket under the balsamtree his face was dark haggard lined she saw him go down to the brook and plunge his hands into the water and bathe his face with a kind of fury then he went up to the smoldering fire there was a gloom a somberness a hardness about him that had not been noticeable the day before  joan found the water cold as ice soothing to the burn beneath her skin she walked away then aware that kells did not appear to care and went up to where the brook brawled from under the cliff this was a hundred paces from camp though in plain sight joan looked round for her horse but he was not to be seen she decided to slip away the first opportunity that offered and on foot or horseback any way to get out of kellss clutches if she had to wander lost in the mountains till she starved possibly the day might be endurable but another night would drive her crazy she sat on a ledge planning and brooding till she was startled by a call from kells then slowly she retraced her steps  dont you want to eat he asked  im not hungry she replied  well eat anyhowif it chokes you he ordered  joan seated herself while he placed food and drink before her she did not look at him and did not feel his gaze upon her far asunder as they had been yesterday the distance between them today was incalculably greater she ate as much as she could swallow and pushed the rest away leaving the campfire she began walking again here and there aimlessly scarcely seeing what she looked at there was a shadow over her an impending portent of catastrophe a moment standing dark and sharp out of the agelong hour she leaned against the balsam and then she rested in the stone seat and then she had to walk again it might have been long that time she never knew how long or short there came a strange flagging sinking of her spirit accompanied by vibrating restless uncontrollable muscular activity her nerves were on the verge of collapse  it was then that a call from kells clear and ringing thrilled all the weakness from her in a flash and left her limp and cold she saw him coming his face looked amiable again bright against what seemed a vague and veiled background like a mountaineer he strode and she looked into his strange gray glance to see unmasked the ruthless power the leaping devil the ungovernable passion she had sensed in him  he grasped her arm and with a single pull swung her to him youve got to pay that ransom  he handled her as if he thought she resisted but she was unresisting she hung her head to hide her eyes then he placed an arm round her shoulders and half led half dragged her toward the cabin    joan saw with startling distinctness the bits of balsam and pine at her feet and pale pink daisies in the grass and then the dry withered boughs she was in the cabin  girl im hungryfor you he breathed hoarsely and turning her toward him he embraced her as if his nature was savage and he had to use a savage force  if joan struggled at all it was only slightly when she writhed and slipped like a snake to get her arm under his as it clasped her neck then she let herself go he crushed her to him he bent her backwardtilted her face with hard and eager hand like a madman with hot working lips he kissed her she felt blindedscorched but her purpose was as swift and sure and wonderful as his passion was wild the first reach of her groping hand found his gunbelt swift as light her hand slipped down her fingers touched the cold gungrasped with thrill on thrillslipped farther down strong and sure to raise the hammer then with a leaping strung intensity that matched his own she drew the gun she raised it while her eyes were shut she lay passive under his kissesthe devouring kisses of one whose manhood had been denied the sweetness the glory the fire the life of womans lips it was a moment in which she met his primitive fury of possession with a womans primitive fury of profanation she pressed the gun against his side and pulled the trigger  a thundering muffled hollow boom the odor of burned powder stung her nostrils kellss hold on her tightened convulsively loosened with strange lessening power she swayed back free of him still with tightshut eyes a horrible cry escaped hima cry of mortal agony it wrenched her and she looked to see him staggering amazed stricken at bay like a wolf caught in cruel steel jaws his hands came away from both sides dripping with blood they shook till the crimson drops spattered on the wall on the boughs then he seemed to realize and he clutched at her with these bloody hands  god almighty he panted you shot me youyou girl you shecat you knewall the time you shecat give methat gun  kells get back ill kill you she cried the big gun outstretched between them began to waver  kells did not see the gun in his madness he tried to move to reach her but he could not he was sinking his legs sagged under him let him down to his knees and but for the wall he would have fallen then a change transformed him the black turgid convulsed face grew white and ghastly with beads of clammy sweat and lines of torture his strange eyes showed swiftly passing thoughtwonder fear scorneven admiration  joan youve donefor me he gasped youve broken my back itll kill me oh the painthe pain and i cant stand pain youyou girl you innocent seventeenyearold girl you that couldnt hurt any creature you so tenderso gentle bah you fooled me the cunning of a woman i oughtto know a good womansmore terrible than abad woman but i deserved this once i usedto be only the torture why didnt youkill me outright joanrandlewatch medie since i hadto dieby rope or bulletim glad youyoudid for me man or beasti believei loved you  joan dropped the gun and sank beside him helpless horrorstricken wringing her hands she wanted to tell him she was sorry that he drove her to it that he must let her pray for him but she could not speak her tongue clove to the roof of her mouth and she seemed strangling  another change slower and more subtle passed over kells he did not see joan he forgot her the white shaded out of his face leaving a gray like that of his somber eyes spirit sense life were fading from him the quivering of a racked body ceased and all that seemed left was a lonely soul groping on the verge of the dim borderland between life and death presently his shoulders slipped along the wall and he fell to lie limp and motionless before joan then she fainted     6  when joan returned to consciousness she was lying half outside the opening of the cabin and above her was a drift of blue gunsmoke slowly floating upward almost as swiftly as perception of that smoke came a shuddering memory she lay still listening she did not hear a sound except the tinkle and babble and gentle rush of the brook kells was dead then and overmastering the horror of her act was a relief a freedom a lifting of her soul out of the dark dread a something that whispered justification of the fatal deed  she got up and avoiding to look within the cabin walked away the sun was almost at the zenith where had the morning hours gone  i must get away she said suddenly the thought quickened her down the canon the horses were grazing she hurried along the trail trying to decide whether to follow this dim old trail or endeavor to get out the way she had been brought in she decided upon the latter if she traveled slowly and watched for familiar landmarks things she had seen once and hunted carefully for the tracks she believed she might be successful she had the courage to try then she caught her pony and led him back to camp  what shall i take she pondered she decided upon very littlea blanket a sack of bread and meat and a canteen of water she might need a weapon also there was only one the gun with which she had killed kells it seemed utterly impossible to touch that hateful thing but now that she had liberated herself and at such cost she must not yield to sentiment resolutely she started for the cabin but when she reached it her steps were dragging the long dullblue gun lay where she had dropped it and out of the tail of averted eyes she saw a huddled shape along the wall it was a sickening moment when she reached a shaking hand for the gun and at that instant a low moan transfixed her  she seemed frozen rigid was the place already haunted her heart swelled in her throat and a dimness came before her eyes but another moan brought a swift realizationkells was alive and the cold clamping sickness the strangle in her throat all the feelings of terror changed and were lost in a flood of instinctive joy he was not dead she had not killed him she did not have blood on her hands she was not a murderer  she whirled to look at him there he lay ghastly as a corpse and all her womans gladness fled but there was compassion left to her and forgetting all else she knelt beside him he was as cold as stone she felt no stir no beat of pulse in temple or wrist then she placed her ear against his breast his heart beat weakly  hes alive she whispered buthes dying what shall i do  many thoughts flashed across her mind she could not help him now he would be dead soon she did not need to wait there beside him there was a risk of some of his comrades riding into that rendezvous suppose his back was not broken after all suppose she stopped the flow of blood tended him nursed him saved his life for if there were one chance of his living which she doubted it must be through her would he not be the same savage the hour he was well and strong again what difference could she make in such a nature the man was evil he could not conquer evil she had been witness to that he had driven roberts to draw and had killed him no doubt he had deliberately and coldly murdered the two ruffians bill and halloway just so he could be free of their glances at her and be alone with her he deserved to die there like a dog  what joan randle did was surely a womans choice carefully she rolled kells over the back of his vest and shirt was wet with blood she got up to find a knife towel and water as she returned to the cabin he moaned again  joan had dressed many a wound she was not afraid of blood the difference was that she had shed it she felt sick but her hands were firm as she cut open the vest and shirt rolled them aside and bathed his back the big bullet had made a gaping wound having apparently gone through the small of his back the blood still flowed she could not tell whether or not kells spine was broken but she believed that the bullet had gone between bone and muscle or had glanced there was a blue welt just over his spine in line with the course of the wound she tore her scarf into strips and used it for compresses and bandages then she laid him back upon a saddleblanket she had done all that was possible for the present and it gave her a strange sense of comfort she even prayed for his life and if that must go for his soul then she got up he was unconscious white deathlike it seemed that his torture his near approach to death had robbed his face of ferocity of ruthlessness and of that strange amiable expression but then his eyes those furnacewindows were closed  joan waited for the end to come the afternoon passed and she did not leave the cabin it was possible that he might come to and want water she had once administered to a miner who had been fatally crushed in an avalanche and never could forget his husky call for water and the gratitude in his eyes  sunset twilight and night fell upon the canon and she began to feel solitude as something tangible bringing saddle and blankets into the cabin she made a bed just inside and facing the opening and the stars she lay down to rest if not to sleep the darkness did not keep her from seeing the prostrate figure of kells he lay there as silent as if he were already dead she was exhausted weary for sleep and unstrung in the night her courage fled and she was frightened at shadows the murmuring of insects seemed augmented into a roar the mourn of wolf and scream of cougar made her start the rising wind moaned like a lost spirit dark fancies beset her troop on troop of specters moved out of the black night assembling there waiting for kells to join them she thought she was riding homeward over the back trail sure of her way remembering every rod of that rough travel until she got out of the mountains only to be turned back by dead men then fancy and dream and all the haunted gloom of canon and cabin seemed slowly to merge into one immense blackness  the sun rimming the east wall shining into joans face awakened her she had slept hours she felt rested stronger like the night something dark had passed away from her it did not seem strange to her that she should feel that kells still lived she knew it and examination proved her right in him there had been no change except that he had ceased to bleed there was just a flickering of life in him manifest only in his slow faint heartbeats  joan spent most of that day in sitting beside kells the whole day seemed only an hour sometimes she would look down the canon trail half expecting to see horsemen riding up if any of kellss comrades happened to come what could she tell them they would be as bad as he without that one trait which had kept him human for a day joan pondered upon this it would never do to let them suspect she had shot kells so carefully cleaning the gun she reloaded it if any men came she would tell them that bill had done the shooting  kells lingered joan began to feel that he would live though everything indicated the contrary her intelligence told her he would die and her feeling said he would not at times she lifted his head and got water into his mouth with a spoon when she did this he would moan that night during the hours she lay awake she gathered courage out of the very solitude and loneliness she had nothing to fear unless someone came to the canon the next day in no wise differed from the preceding and then there came the third day with no change in kells till near evening when she thought he was returning to consciousness but she must have been mistaken for hours she watched patiently he might return to consciousness just before the end and want to speak to send a message to ask a prayer to feel a human hand at the last  that night the crescent moon hung over the canon in the faint light joan could see the blanched face of kells strange and sad no longer seeming evil the time came when his lips stirred he tried to talk she moistened his lips and gave him a drink he murmured incoherently sank again into a stupor to rouse once more and babble tike a madman then he lay quietly for longso long that sleep was claiming joan suddenly he startled her by calling very faintly but distinctly water water  joan bent over him lifting his head helping him to drink she could see his eyes like dark holes in something white  isthatyoumother he whispered  yes replied joan  he sank immediately into another stupor or sleep from which he did not rouse that whisper of hismothertouched joan bad men had mothers just the same as any other kind of men even this kells had a mother he was still a young man he had been youth boy child baby some mother had loved him cradled him kissed his rosy baby hands watched him grow with pride and glory built castles in her dreams of his manhood and perhaps prayed for him still trusting he was strong and honored among men and here he lay a shattered wreck dying for a wicked act the last of many crimes it was a tragedy it made joan think of the hard lot of mothers and then of this unsettled western wild where men flocked in packs like wolves and spilled blood like water and held life nothing  joan sought her rest and soon slept in the morning she did not at once go to kells somehow she dreaded finding him conscious almost as much as she dreaded the thought of finding him dead when she did bend over him he was awake and at sight of her he showed a faint amaze  joan he whispered  yes she replied  are youwith me still  of course i couldnt leave you  the pale eyes shadowed strangely darkly im alive yet and you stayed was it yesterdayyou threw my gunon me  no four days ago  four is my back broken  i dont know i dont think so its a terrible wound ii did all i could  you tried to kill methen tried to save me  she was silent to that  youre goodand youve been noble he said but i wishyoud only been bad then id curse youand strangle youpresently  perhaps you had best be quiet replied joan  no ive been shot before ill get over thisif my backs not broken how can we tell  ive no idea  lift me up  but you might open your wound protested joan  lift me up the force of the man spoke even in his low whisper  but whywhy asked joan  i want to seeif i can sit up if i cantgive me my gun  i wont let you have it replied joan then she slipped her arms under his and carefully raising him to a sitting posture released her hold  imarank cowardabout pain he gasped with thick drops standing out on his white face i cantstand it  but tortured or not he sat up alone and even had the will to bend his back then with a groan he fainted and fell into joans arms she laid him down and worked over him for some time before she could bring him to then he was wan suffering speechless but she believed he would live and told him so he received that with a strange smile later when she came to him with broth he drank it gratefully  ill beat this out he said weakly ill recover my backs not broken ill get well now you bring water and food in herethen go  go she echoed  yes dont go down the canon youd be worse off take the back trail youve got a chance to get out go  leave you here so weak you cant lift a cup i wont  id rather you did  why  because in a few days ill begin to mend then ill grow likemyself i thinkim afraid i loved you it could only be hell for you go now before its too late if you staytill im wellill never let you go  kells i believe it would be cowardly for me to leave you here alone she replied earnestly you cant help yourself youd die  all the better but i wont die im hard to kill go i tell you  she shook her head this is bad for youarguing youre excited please be quiet  joan randle if you stayill halter youkeep you naked in a cavecurse youbeat youmurder you oh its in me go i tell you  youre out of your head once for allno she replied firmly  youyou his voice failed in a terrible whisper  in the succeeding days kells did not often speak his recovery was slowa matter of doubt nothing was any plainer than the fact that if joan had left him he would not have lived long she knew it and he knew it when he was awake and she came to him a mournful and beautiful smile lit his eyes the sight of her apparently hurt him and uplifted him but he slept twenty hours out of every day and while he slept he did not need joan  she came to know the meaning of solitude there were days when she did not hear the sound of her own voice a habit of silence one of the significant forces of solitude had grown upon her daily she thought less and felt more for hours she did nothing when she roused herself compelled herself to think of these encompassing peaks of the lonely canon walls the stately trees all those eternally silent and changless features of her solitude she hated them with a blind and unreasoning passion she hated them because she was losing her love for them because they were becoming a part of her because they were fixed and content and passionless she liked to sit in the sun feel its warmth see its brightness and sometimes she almost forgot to go back to her patient she fought at times against an insidious changea growing oldera going backward at other times she drifted through hours that seemed quiet and golden in which nothing happened and by and by when she realized that the drifting hours were gradually swallowing up the restless and active hours then strangely she remembered jim cleve memory of him came to save her she dreamed of him during the long lonely solemn days and in the dark silent climax of unbearable solitudethe night she remembered his kisses forgot her anger and shame accepted the sweetness of their meaning and so in the interminable hours of her solitude she dreamed herself into love for him  joan kept some record of days until three weeks or thereabout passed and then she lost track of time it dragged along yet looked at as the past it seemed to have sped swiftly the change in her the growing old the revelation and responsibility of serf as a woman made this experience appear to have extended over months  kells slowly became convalescent and then he had a relapse something happened the nature of which joan could not tell and he almost died there were days when his life hung in the balance when he could not talk and then came a perceptible turn for the better  the store of provisions grew low and joan began to face another serious situation deer and rabbit were plentiful in the canon but she could not kill one with a revolver she thought she would be forced to sacrifice one of the horses the fact that kells suddenly showed a craving for meat brought this aspect of the situation to a climax and that very morning while joan was pondering the matter she saw a number of horsemen riding up the canon toward the cabin at the moment she was relieved and experienced nothing of the dread she had formerly felt while anticipating this very event  kells she said quickly there are men riding up the trail  good he exclaimed weakly with a light on his drawn face theyve been long ingetting here how many  joan counted themfive riders and several packanimals  yes its gulden  gulden cried joan with a start  her exclamation and tone made kells regard her attentively  youve heard of him hes the toughest nuton this border i never saw his like you wont be safe im so helpless what to sayto tell him joan if i should happen to croakyou want to get away quick or shoot yourself  how strange to hear this bandit warn her of peril the like of which she had encountered through him joan secured the gun and hid it in a niche between the logs then she looked out again  the riders were close at hand now the foremost one a man of herculean build jumped his mount across the brook and leaped off while he hauled the horse to a stop the second rider came close behind him the others approached leisurely with the gait of the packanimals  ho kells called the big man his voice had a loud bold sonorous kind of ring  reckon hes here somewheres said the other man presently  sure i seen his hoss jack aint goin to be far from thet hoss  then both of them approached the cabin joan had never before seen two such striking viciouslooking awesome men the one was hugeso wide and heavy and deepset that he looked shortand he resembled a gorilla the other was tall slim with a face as red as flame and an expression of fierce keenness he was stoop shouldered yet he held his head erect in a manner that suggested a wolf scenting blood  someone here pearce boomed the big man  why gul if it aint a girl  joan moved out of the shadow of the wall of the cabin and she pointed to the prostrate figure on the blankets  howdy boys said kells wanly  gulden cursed in amaze while pearce dropped to his knee with an exclamation of concern then both began to talk at once kells interrupted them by lifting a weak hand  no im not goingto cash he said im only starvedand in need of stimulants had my back half shot off  who plugged you jack  gulden it was your sidepartner bill  bill guldens voice held a queer coarse constraint then he added gruffly thought you and him pulled together  well we didnt  andwheres bill now this time joan heard a slow curious cold note in the heavy voice and she interpreted it as either doubt or deceit  bills dead and halloway too replied kells  gulden turned his massive shaggy head in the direction of joan she had not the courage to meet the gaze upon her the other man spoke  split over the girl jack  no replied kells sharply they tried to get familiar withmy wifeand i shot them both  joan felt a swift leap of hot blood all over her and then a coldness a sickening a hateful weakness  wife ejaculated gulden  your real wife jack queried pearce  well i guess ill introduce you joan here are two of my friendssam gulden and red pearce  gulden grunted something  mrs kells im glad to meet you said pearce  just then the other three men entered the cabin and joan took advantage of the commotion they made to get out into the air she felt sick frightened and yet terribly enraged she staggered a little as she went out and she knew she was as pale as death these visitors thrust reality upon her with a cruel suddenness there was something terrible in the mere presence of this gulden she had not yet dared to take a good look at him but what she felt was overwhelming she wanted to run yet escape now was infinitely more of a menace than before if she slipped away it would be these new enemies who would pursue her track her like hounds she understood why kells had introduced her as his wife she hated the idea with a shameful and burning hate but a moments reflection taught her that kells had answered once more to a good instinct at the moment he had meant that to protect her and further reflection persuaded joan that she would be wise to act naturally and to carry out the deception as far as it was possible for her it was her only hope her position had again grown perilous she thought of the gun she had secreted and it gave her strength to control her agitation and to return to the cabin outwardly calm  the men had kells half turned over with the flesh of his back exposed  aw gul its whisky he needs said one  if you let out any more blood hell croak sure protested another  look how weak he is said red pearce  its a hell of a lot you know roared gulden i served my timebut thats none of your business look here see that blue spot gulden pressed a huge finger down upon the blue welt on kellss back the bandit moaned thats leadthats the bullet declared gulden  wall if you aint correct exclaimed pearce  kells turned his head when you punched that placeit made me numb all over gul if youve located the bullet cut it out  joan did not watch the operation as she went away to the seat under the balsam she heard a sharp cry and then cheers evidently the grim gulden had been both swift and successful  presently the men came out of the cabin and began to attend to their horses and the packtrain  pearce looked for joan and upon seeing her called out kells wants you  joan found the bandit half propped up against a saddle with a damp and pallid face but an altogether different look  joan that bullet was pressing on my spine he said now its out all that deadness is gone i feel alive ill get well soon gulden was curious over the bullet its a fortyfour caliber and neither bill bailey nor halloway used that caliber of gun gulden remembered hes cunning bill was as near being a friend to this gulden as any man i know of i cant trust any of these men particularly gulden you stay pretty close by me  kells youll let me go soonhelp me to get home implored joan in a low voice  girl itd never be safe now he replied  then latersoonwhen it is safe  well see but youre my wife now  with the latter words the man subtly changed something of the power she had felt in him before his illness began again to be manifested joan divined that these comrades had caused the difference in him  you wont dare joan was unable to conclude her meaning a tight band compressed her breast and throat and she trembled  will you dare go out there and tell them youre not my wife he queried his voice had grown stronger and his eyes were blending shadows of thought  joan knew that she dared not she must choose the lesser of two evils no mancould be such a beast to a womanafter shed saved his life she whispered  i could be anything you had your chance i told you to go i said if i ever got well id be as i wasbefore  but youd have died  that would have been better for you joan ill do this marry you honestly and leave the country ive gold im young i love you i intend to have you and ill begin life over again what do you say  say id die beforeid marry you she panted  all right joan randle he replied bitterly for a moment i saw a ghost my old dead better self its gone and you stay with me     7  after dark kells had his men build a fire before the open side of the cabin he lay propped up on blankets and his saddle while the others lounged or sat in a halfcircle in the light facing him  joan drew her blankets into a corner where the shadows were thick and she could see without being seen she wondered how she would ever sleep near all these wild menif she could ever sleep again yet she seemed more curious and wakeful than frightened she had no way to explain it but she felt the fact that her presence in the camp had a subtle influence at once restraining and exciting so she looked out upon the scene with wideopen eyes  and she received more strongly than ever an impression of wildness even the campfire seemed to burn wildly it did not glow and sputter and pale and brighten and sing like an honest campfire it blazed in red fierce hurried flames wild to consume the logs it cast a baleful and sinister color upon the hard faces there then the blackness of the enveloping night was pitchy without any bold outline of canon wall or companionship of stars the coyotes were out in force and from all around came their wild sharp barks the wind rose and mourned weirdly through the balsams  but it was in the men that joan felt mostly that element of wildness kells lay with his ghastly face clear in the play of the moving flare of light it was an intelligent keen strong face but evil evil power stood out in the lines in the strange eyes stranger then ever now in shadow and it seemed once more the face of an alert listening implacable man with wild projects in mind driving him to the doom he meant for others pearces red face shone redder in that ruddy light it was hard lean almost fleshless a red mask stretched over a grinning skull the one they called frenchy was little dark smallfeatured with piercing gimletlike eyes and a mouth ready to gush forth hate and violence the next two were not particularly individualized by any striking aspect merely looking border ruffians after the type of bill and halloway but gulden who sat at the end of the halfcircle was an object that joan could scarcely bring her gaze to study somehow her first glance at him put into her mind a strange ideathat she was a woman and therefore of all creatures or things in the world the farthest removed from him she looked away and found her gaze returning fascinated as if she were a bird and he a snake the man was of huge frame a giant whose every move suggested the acme of physical power he was an animala gorilla with a shock of light instead of black hair of pale instead of black skin his features might have been hewn and hammered out with coarse dull broken chisels and upon his face in the lines and cords in the huge caverns where his eyes hid and in the huge gash that held strong white fangs had been stamped by nature and by life a terrible ferocity here was a man or a monster in whose presence joan felt that she would rather be dead he did not smoke he did not indulge in the coarse goodnatured raillery he sat there like a huge engine of destruction that needed no rest but was forced to rest because of weaker attachments on the other hand he was not sullen or brooding it was that he did not seem to think  kells had been rapidly gaining strength since the extraction of the bullet and it was evident that his interest was growing proportionately he asked questions and received most of his replies from red pearce joan did not listen attentively at first but presently she regretted that she had not she gathered that kellss fame as the master bandit of the whole gold region of idaho nevada and northeastern california was a fame that he loved as much as the gold he stole joan sensed through the replies of these men and their attitude toward kells that his power was supreme he ruled the robbers and ruffians in his bands and evidently they were scattered from bannack to lewiston and all along the border he had power likewise over the border hawks not directly under his leadership during the weeks of his enforced stay in the canon there had been a cessation of operationsthe nature of which joan merely guessedand a gradual accumulation of idle wailing men in the main camp also she gathered but vaguely that though kells had supreme power the organization he desired was yet far from being consummated he showed thoughtfulness and irritation by turns and it was the subject of gold that drew his intensest interest  reckon you figgered right jack said red pearce and paused as if before a long talk while he refilled his pipe sooner or later therell be the biggest gold strike ever made in the west wagontrains are met every day comin across from salt lake prospectors are workin in hordes down from bannack all the gulches an valleys in the bear mountains have their camps surface gold everywhere an easy to get where theres water but theres diggins all over no big strike yet its bound to come sooner or later an then when the news hits the maintraveled roads an reaches back into the mountains theres goin to be a rush thatll make 49 an 51 look sick what do you say bate  shore will replied a grizzled individual whom kells had called bate wood he was not so young as his companions more sober less wild and slower of speech i saw both 49 and 51 them was days but im agreein with red there shore will be hell on this idaho border sooner or later ive been a prospector though i never hankered after the hard work of diggin gold gold is hard to dig easy to lose an easy to get from some other feller i see the signs of a comin strike somewhere in this region mebbe its on now theres thousands of prospectors in twos an threes an groups out in the hills all over they aint agoin to tell when they do make a strike but the gold must be brought out an gold is heavy it aint easy hid thets how strikes are discovered i shore reckon thet this year will beat 49 an 51 an fer two reasons theres a steady stream of broken an disappointed goldseekers backtrailin from california theres a bigger stream of hopeful an crazy fortune hunters travelin in from the east then theres the wimmen an gamblers an such thet hang on an last the men thet the war is drivin out here whenever an wherever these streams meet if theres a big gold strike therell be the hellishest time the world ever saw  boys said kells with a ring in his weak voice itll be a harvest for my border legion  fer what queried bate wood curiously  all the others except gulden turned inquiring and interested faces toward the bandit  the border legion replied kells  an whats that asked red pearce bluntly  well if the times ripe for the great gold fever you say is coming then its ripe for the greatest band ever organized ill organize ill call it the border legion  count me in as righthand pard replied red with enthusiasm  an shore me boss added bate wood  the idea was received vociferously at which demonstration the giant gulden raised his massive head and asked or rather growled in a heavy voice what the fuss was about his query his roused presence seemed to act upon the others even kells with a strange disquieting or halting force as if here was a character or an obstacle to be considered after a moment of silence red pearce explained the project  huh nothing new in that replied gulden i belonged to one once it was in algiers they called it the royal legion  algiers whats thet asked bate wood  africa replied gulden  say gul youve been around some said red pearce admiringly what was the royal legion  nothing but a lot of devils from all over the border there was the last place every criminal was safe from pursuit  whatd you do  fought among ourselves wasnt many in the legion when i left  shore thet aint strange exclaimed wood significantly but his inference was lost upon gulden  i wont allow fighting in my legion said kells coolly ill pick this band myself  thets the secret rejoined wood the right fellers ive been in all kinds of bands why i even was a vigilante in 51  this elicited a laugh from his fellows except the woodenfaced gulden  how many do we want asked red pearce  the number doesnt matter but they must be men i can trust and control then as lieutenants ill need a few young fellows like you red nervy daring cool quick of wits  red pearce enjoyed the praise bestowed upon him and gave his shoulders a swagger speakin of that boss he said reminds me of a chap who rode into cabin gulch a few weeks ago braced right into beards place where we was all playin faro an he asks for jack kells right off we all thought he was a guy who had a grievance an some of us was for pluggin him but i kinda liked him an i cooled the gang down glad i did that he wasnt wantin to throw a gun his intentions were friendly of course i didnt show curious about who or what he was reckoned he was a young feller whod gone bad suddenlike an was huntin friends an im here to say boss that he was wild  whats his name asked kells  jim cleve he said replied pearce  joan randle hidden back in the shadows forgotten or ignored by this bandit group heard the name jim cleve with pain and fear but not amaze from the moment pearce began his speech she had been prepared for the revelation of her runaway lovers name she trembled and grew a little sick jim had made no idle threat what would she have given to live over again the moment that had alienated him  jim cleve mused kells never heard of him and i never forget a name or a face whats he like  clean rangy chap big but not too big replied pearce all muscle not moren twenty three hard rider hard fighter hard gambler an drinkerreckless as hell if only you can steady him boss ask bate what he thinks  well exclaimed kells in surprise strangers are everyday occurrences on this border but i never knew one to impress you fellows as this

cabin gulch one day as usual we was drinkin an playin but young cleve wasnt doin neither he had a strange moody spell thet day as i recollect luce sprung a job on us we never worked with him or his outfit but mebbeyou cant tell whatd come off if it hadnt been for cleve luce had a job put up to ride down where ole brander was washin fer gold take what he hadan the girl fact was the gold was only incidental when somebody cornered luce he couldnt swear there was gold worth goin after an about then jim cleve woke up he cussed luce somethin fearful an when luce went for his gun naturallike why this jim cleve took it away from him an then he jumped luce he knocked an threw him around an he near beat him to death before we could interfere luce was shore near dead all battered upbroken bonesan whatall i cant say we put him to bed an hes there yet an hell never be the same man he was  a significant silence fell upon the group at the conclusion of woods narrative wood had liked the telling and it made his listeners thoughtful all at once the pale face of kells turned slightly toward gulden  gulden did you hear that asked kells  yes replied the man  what do you think about this jim cleveand the job he prevented  never saw cleve ill look him up when we get back to camp then ill go after the brander girl  how strangely his brutal assurance marked a line between him and his companions there was something wrong something perverse in this gulden had kells meant to bring that point out or to get an impression of cleve  joan could not decide she divined that there was antagonism between gulden and all the others and there was something else vague and intangible that might have been fear apparently gulden was a criminal for the sake of crime joan regarded him with a growing terroraugmented the more because he alone kept eyes upon the corner where she was hiddenand she felt that compared with him the others even kells of whose cold villainy she was assured were but insignificant men of evil she covered her head with a blanket to shut out sight of that shaggy massive head and the great dark caves of eyes  thereupon joan did not see or hear any more of the bandits evidently the conversation died down or she in the absorption of new thoughts no longer heard she relaxed and suddenly seemed to quiver all over with the name she whispered to herself jim jim oh jim and the last whisper was an inward sob what he had done was terrible it tortured her she had not believed it in him yet now she thought how like him all for herin despair and spitehe had ruined himself he would be killed out there in some drunken brawl or still worse he would become a member of this bandit crew and drift into crime that was a great blow to joanthat the curse she had put upon him how silly false and vain had been her coquetry her indifference she loved jim cleve she had not known that when she started out to trail him to fetch him back but she knew it now she ought to have known before  the situation she had foreseen loomed dark and monstrous and terrible in prospect just to think of it made her body creep and shudder with cold terror yet there was that strange inward thrilling burn round her heart somewhere and soon she was coming face to face with this changed jim clevethis boy who had become a reckless devil what would he do what could she do might he not despise her scorn her curse her taking her at kellss word the wife of a bandit but no he would divine the truth in the flash of an eye and then she could not think what might happen but it must mean blooddeath if he escaped kells how could he ever escape this guldenthis huge vulture of prey  still with the horror thick upon her joan could not wholly give up the moment jim cleves name and his ruin burst upon her ears in the gossip of these bandits she had become another girla girl wholly become a woman and one with a driving passion to save if it cost her life she lost her fear of kells of the others of all except gulden he was not human and instinctively she knew she could do nothing with him she might influence the others but never gulden  the torment in her brain eased then and gradually she quieted down with only a pang and a weight in her breast the past seemed far away the present was nothing only the future that contained jim cleve mattered to her she would not have left the clutches of kells if at that moment she could have walked forth free and safe she was going on to cabin gulch and that thought was the last one in her weary mind as she dropped to sleep     8  in three daysduring which time joan attended kells as faithfully as if she were indeed his wifehe thought that he had gained sufficiently to undertake the journey to the main camp cabin gulch he was eager to get back there and imperious in his overruling of any opposition the men could take turns at propping him in a saddle so on the morning of the fourth day they packed for the ride  during these few days joan had verified her suspicion that kells had two sides to his character or it seemed rather that her presence developed a latent or a longdead side when she was with him thereby distracting his attention he was entirely different from what he was when his men surrounded him apparently he had no knowledge of this he showed surprise and gratitude at joans kindness though never pity or compassion for her that he had become infatuated with her joan could no longer doubt his strange eyes followed her there was a dreamy light in them he was mostly silent with her  before those few days had come to an end he had developed two thingsa reluctance to let joan leave his sight and an intolerance of the presence of the other men particularly gulden always joan felt the eyes of these men upon her mostly in unobtrusive glances except guldens the giant studied her with slow cavernous stare without curiosity or speculation or admiration evidently a woman was a new and strange creature to him and he was experiencing unfamiliar sensations whenever joan accidentally met his gazefor she avoided it as much as possibleshe shuddered with sick memory of a story she had heardhow a huge and ferocious gorilla had stolen into an african village and run off with a white woman she could not shake the memory and it was this that made her kinder to kells than otherwise would have been possible  all joans faculties sharpened in this period she felt her own developmentthe beginning of a bitter and hard educationan instinctive assimilation of all that nature taught its wild people and creatures the first thing in elemental lifeselfpreservation parallel in her heart and mind ran a hopeless despair and a driving unquenchable spirit the former was fear the latter love she believed beyond a doubt that she had doomed herself along with jim cleve she felt that she had the courage the power the love to save him if not herself and the reason that she did not falter and fail in this terrible situation was because her despair great as it was did not equal her love  that morning before being lifted upon his horse kells buckled on his gunbelt the sheath and full round of shells and the gun made this belt a burden for a weak man and so red pearce insisted but kells laughed in his face the men always excepting gulden were unfailing in kindness and care apparently they would have fought for kells to the death they were simple and direct in their rough feelings but in kells joan thought was a character who was a product of this border wildness yet one who could stand aloof from himself and see the possibilities the unexpected the meaning of that life kells knew that a man and yet another might show kindness and faithfulness one moment but the very next out of a manhood retrograded to the savage out of the circumstance or chance might respond to a primitive force far sundered from thought or reason and rise to unbridled action joan divined that kells buckled on his gun to be ready to protect her but his men never dreamed his motive kells was a strong bad man set among men like him yet he was infinitely different because he had brains  on the start of the journey joan was instructed to ride before kells and pearce who supported the leader in his saddle the packdrivers and bate wood and frenchy rode ahead gulden held to the rear and this order was preserved till noon when the cavalcade halted for a rest in a shady grassy and wellwatered nook kells was haggard and his brow wet with clammy dew and lined with pain yet he was cheerful and patient still he hurried the men through their tasks  in an hour the afternoon travel was begun the canon and its surroundings grew more rugged and of larger dimensions yet the trail appeared to get broader and better all the time joan noticed intersecting trails running down from side canons and gulches the descent was gradual and scarcely evident in any way except in the running water and warmer air  kells tired before the middle of the afternoon and he would have fallen from his saddle but for the support of his fellows one by one they held him up and it was not easy work to ride alongside holding him up joan observed that gulden did not offer his services he seemed a part of this gang yet not of it joan never lost a feeling of his presence behind her and from time to time when he rode closer the feeling grew stronger toward the close of that afternoon she became aware of guldens strange attention and when a halt was made for camp she dreaded something nameless  this halt occurred early before sunset and had been necessitated by the fact that kells was fainting they laid him out on blankets with his head in his saddle joan tended him and he recovered somewhat though he lacked the usual keenness  it was a busy hour with saddles packs horses with wood to cut and fire to build and meal to cook kells drank thirstily but refused food  joan he whispered at an opportune moment im only tireddead for sleep you stay beside me wake me quickif you want to  he closed his eyes wearily without explaining and soon slumbered joan did not choose to allow these men to see that she feared them or distrusted them or disliked them she ate with them beside the fire and this was their first opportunity to be close to her the fact had an immediate and singular influence joan had no vanity though she knew she was handsome she forced herself to be pleasant agreeable even sweet their response was instant and growing at first they were bold then familiar and coarse for years she had been used to rough men of the camps these however were different and their jokes and suggestions had no effect because they were beyond her and when this became manifest to them that aspect of their relation to her changed she grasped the fact intuitively and then she verified it by proof her heart beat strong and high if she could hide her hate her fear her abhorrence she could influence these wild men but it all depended upon her charm her strangeness her femininity insensibly they had been influenced and it proved that in the worst of men there yet survived some good gulden alone presented a contrast and a problem he appeared aware of her presence while he sat there eating like a wolf but it was as if she were only an object the man watched as might have an animal  her experience at the campfire meal inclined her to the belief that if there were such a possibility as her being safe at all it would be owing to an unconscious and friendly attitude toward the companions she had been forced to accept those men were pleased stirred at being in her vicinity joan came to a melancholy and fearful cognizance of her attraction while at home she seldom had borne upon her a realitythat she was a woman her place her person were merely natural here it was all different to these wild men developed by loneliness fierceblooded with pulses like whips a woman was something that thrilled charmed soothed that incited a strange insatiable inexplicable hunger for the very sight of her they did not realize it but joan did  presently joan finished her supper and said ill go hobble my horse he strays sometimes  shore ill go miss said bate wood he had never called her mrs kells but joan believed he had not thought of the significance hardened old ruffian that he was joan regarded him as the best of a bad lot he had lived long and some of his life had not been bad  let me go added pearce  no thanks ill go myself she replied  she took the rope hobble off her saddle and boldly swung down the trail suddenly she heard two or more of the men speak at once and then low and clear gulden wheren hell are you goin this was red pearces voice  joan glanced back gulden had started down the trail after her her heart quaked her knees shook and she was ready to run back gulden halted then turned away growling he acted as if caught in something surprising to himself  were on to you gulden continued pearce deliberately be careful or well put kells on  a booming angry curse was the response the men grouped closer and a loud altercation followed joan almost ran down the trail and heard no more if any one of them had started her way now she would have plunged into the thickets like a frightened deer evidently however they meant to let her alone joan found her horse and before hobbling him she was assailed by a temptation to mount him and ride away this she did not want to do and would not do under any circumstances still she could not prevent the natural instinctive impulse of a woman  she crossed to the other side of the brook and returned toward camp under the spruce and balsam trees she did not hurry it was good to be alone out of sight of those violent men away from that constant wearing physical proof of catastrophe nevertheless she did not feel free or safe for a moment she peered fearfully into the shadows of the rocks and trees and presently it was a relief to get back to the side of the sleeping kells he lay in a deep slumber of exhaustion she arranged her own saddle and blankets near him and prepared to meet the night as best she could instinctively she took a position where in one swift snatch she could get possession of kellss gun  it was about time of sunset warm and still in the canon with rosy lights fading upon the peaks the men were all busy with one thing and another strange it was to see that gulden who joan thought might be a shirker did twice the work of any man especially the heavy work he seemed to enjoy carrying a log that would have overweighted two ordinary men he was so huge so active so powerful that it was fascinating to watch him they built the campfire for the night uncomfortably near joans position however remembering how cold the air would become later she made no objection twilight set in and the men through for the day gathered near the fire  then joan was not long in discovering that the situation had begun to impinge upon the feelings of each of these men they looked at her differently some of them invented pretexts to approach her to ask something to offer serviceanything to get near her a personal and individual note had been injected into the attitude of each intuitively joan guessed that guldens arising to follow her had turned their eyes inward gulden remained silent and inactive at the edge of the campfire circle of light which flickered fitfully around him making him seem a huge gloomy ape of a man so far as joan could tell gulden never cast his eyes in her direction that was a difference which left cause for reflection had that hulk of brawn and bone begun to think bate woods overtures to joan were rough but inexplicable to her because she dared not wholly trust him  an shore miss he had concluded in a hoarse whisper weall know you aint kellss wife thet bandit wouldnt marry no woman hes a womanhater he was famous fer thet over in california hes run off with youkidnapped you thets shore an gulden swears he shot his own men an was in turn shot by you thet bullethole in his back was full of powder theres liable to be a mussup any time shore miss youd better sneak off with me tonight when theyre all asleep ill git grub an hosses an take you off to some prospectors camp then you can git home  joan only shook her head even if she could have felt trust in woodand she was of half a mind to believe himit was too late whatever befell her mattered little if in suffering it she could save jim cleve from the ruin she had wrought  since this wild experience of joans had begun she had been sick so many times with raw and naked emotions hitherto unknown to her that she believed she could not feel another new fear or torture but these strange sensations grew by what they had been fed upon  the man called frenchy was audacious persistent smiling amorouseyed and rudely gallant he cared no more for his companions than if they had not been there he vied with pearce in his attention and the two of them discomfited the others the situation might have been amusing had it not been so terrible always the portent was a shadow behind their interest and amiability and jealousy except for that one abrupt and sinister move of guldensthat of a natural man beyond deceitthere was no word no look no act at which joan could have been offended they were joking sarcastic ironical and sullen in their relation to each other but to joan each one presented what was naturally or what he considered his kindest and most friendly front a young and attractive woman had dropped into the camp of lonely wild men and in their wild hearts was a rebirth of egotism vanity hunger for notice they seemed as foolish as a lot of cock grouse preening themselves and parading before a single female surely in some heart was born real brotherhood for a helpless girl in peril inevitably in some of them would burst a flame of passion as it had in kells  between this amiable contest for joans glances and replies with its possibility of latent good to her and the dark lurking unspoken meaning such as lay in guldens brooding joan found another new and sickening torture  say frenchy youre no ladys man declared red pearce an you bate youre too old movepass bysashay pearce goodnaturedly but deliberately pushed the two men back  shore shes kellss lady aint she drawled wood aint you all forgettin thet  kells is asleep or dead replied pearce and he succeeded in getting the field to himself  whered you meet kells anyway he asked joan with his red face bending near hers  joan had her part to play it was difficult because she divined pearces curiosity held a trap to catch her in a falsehood he knewthey all knew she was not kellss wife but if she were a prisoner she seemed a willing and contented one the query that breathed in pearces presence was how was he to reconcile the fact of her submission with what he and his comrades had potently felt as her goodness  that doesnt concern anybody replied joan  reckon not said pearce then he leaned nearer with intense face what i want to knowis gulden right did you shoot kells  in the dusk joan reached back and clasped kells hand  for a man as weak and weary as he had been it was remarkable how quickly a touch awakened him he lifted his head  hello whos that he called out sharply  pearce rose guardedly startled but not confused its only me boss he replied i was about to turn in an i wanted to know how you areif i could do anythin  im all right red replied kells coolly clear out and let me alone all of you  pearce moved away with an amiable goodnight and joined the others at the campfire presently they sought their blankets leaving gulden hunching there silent in the gloom  joan why did you wake me whispered kells  pearce asked me if i shot you replied joan i woke you instead of answering him  he did exclaimed kells under his breath then he laughed cant fool that gang i guess it doesnt matter maybe itd be well if they knew you shot me  he appeared thoughtful and lay there with the fading flare of the fire on his pale face but he did not speak again presently he fell asleep  joan leaned back within reach of him with her head in her saddle and pulling a blanket up over her relaxed her limbs to rest sleep seemed the furthest thing from her she wondered that she dared to think of it the night had grown chilly the wind was sweeping with low roar through the balsams the fire burned dull and red joan watched the black shapeless hulk that she knew to be gulden for a long time he remained motionless by and by he moved approached the fire stood one moment in the dying ruddy glow his great breadth and bulk magnified with all about him vague and shadowy but the more sinister for that the cavernous eyes were only black spaces in that vast face yet joan saw them upon her he lay down then among the other men and soon his deep and heavy breathing denoted the tranquil slumber of an ox  for hours through changing shadows and starlight joan lay awake while a thousand thoughts besieged her all centering round that vital and compelling one of jim cleve  only upon awakening with the sun in her face did joan realize that she had actually slept  the camp was bustling with activity the horses were in fresh and quarrelsome with ears laid back kells was sitting upon a rock near the fire with a cup of coffee in his hand he was looking better when he greeted joan his voice sounded stronger she walked by pearce and frenchy and gulden on her way to the brook but they took no notice of her bate wood however touched his sombrero and said mornin miss joan wondered if her memory of the preceding night were only a bad dream there was a different atmosphere by daylight and it was dominated by kells presently she returned to camp refreshed and hungry gulden was throwing a pack which action he performed with ease and dexterity pearce was cinching her saddle kells was talking more like his old self than at any time since his injury  soon they were on the trail for joan time always passed swiftly on horseback movement and changing scene were pleasurable to her the passing of time now held a strange expectancy a mingled fear and hope and pain for at the end of this trail was jim cleve in other days she had flouted him made fun of him dominated him everything except loved and feared him and now she was assured of her love and almost convinced of her fear the reputation these wild bandits gave jim was astounding and inexplicable to joan she rode the miles thinking of jim dreading to meet him longing to see him and praying and planning for him  about noon the cavalcade rode out of the mouth of a canon into a wide valley surrounded by high rounded foothills horses and cattle were grazing on the green levels a wide shallow noisy stream split the valley joan could tell from the tracks at the crossing that this place whatever and wherever it was saw considerable travel and she concluded the main rendezvous of the bandits was close at hand  the pack drivers led across the stream and the valley to enter an intersecting ravine it was narrow roughsided and floored but the trail was good presently it opened out into a beautiful vshaped gulch very different from the highwalled shutin canons it had a level floor through which a brook flowed and clumps of spruce and pine with here and there a giant balsam huge patches of wild flowers gave rosy color to the grassy slopes at the upper end of this gulch joan saw a number of widely separated cabins this place then was cabin gulch  upon reaching the first cabin the cavalcade split up there were men here who hallooed a welcome gulden halted with his packhorse some of the others rode on wood drove other packanimals off to the right up the gentle slope and red pearce who was beside kells instructed joan to follow them they rode up to a bench of straggling sprucetrees in the midst of which stood a large log cabin it was new as in fact all the structures in the gulch appeared to be and none of them had seen a winter the chinks between the logs were yet open this cabin was of the rudest make of notched logs one upon another and roof of brush and earth it was low and flat but very long and extending before the whole of it was a porch roof supported by posts at one end was a corral there were doors and windows with nothing in them upon the front wall outside hung saddles and bridles  joan had a swift sharp gaze for the men who rose from their lounging to greet the travelers jim cleve was not among them her heart left her throat then and she breathed easier how could she meet him  kells was in better shape than at noon of the preceding day still he had to be lifted off his horse joan heard all the men talking at once they crowded round pearce each lending a hand however kells appeared able to walk into the cabin it was bate wood who led joan inside  there was a long room with stone fireplace rude benches and a table skins and blankets on the floor and lanterns and weapons on the wall at one end joan saw a litter of cooking utensils and shelves of supplies  suddenly kellss impatient voice silenced the clamor of questions im not hurt he said im all rightonly weak and tired fellows this girl is my wife joan youll find a room thereat the back of the cabin make yourself comfortable  joan was only too glad to act upon his suggestion a door had been cut through the back wall it was covered with a blanket when she swept this aside she came upon several steep steps that led up to a smaller lighter cabin of two rooms separated by a partition of boughs she dropped the blanket behind her and went up the steps then she saw that the new cabin had been built against an old one it had no door or opening except the one by which she had entered it was light because the chinks between the logs were open the furnishings were a wide bench of boughs covered with blankets a shelf with a blurred and cracked mirror hanging above it a table made of boxes and a lantern this room was four feet higher than the floor of the other cabin and at the bottom of the steps leaned a halfdozen slender trimmed poles she gathered presently that these poles were intended to be slipped under crosspieces above and fastened by a bar below which means effectually barricaded the opening joan could stand at the head of the steps and peep under an edge of the swinging blanket into the large room but that was the only place she could see through for the openings between the logs of each wall were not level these quarters were comfortable private and could be shut off from intruders joan had not expected so much consideration from kells and she was grateful  she lay down to rest and think it was really very pleasant here there were birds nesting in the chinks a ground squirrel ran along one of the logs and chirped at her through an opening near her face she saw a wild rosebush and the green slope of the gulch a soft warm fragrant breeze blew in stirring her hair how strange that there could be beautiful and pleasant things here in this robber den that time was the same here as elsewhere that the sun shone and the sky gleamed blue presently she discovered that a lassitude weighted upon her and she could not keep her eyes open she ceased trying but intended to remain awaketo think to listen to wait nevertheless she did fall asleep and did not awaken till disturbed by some noise the color of the western sky told her that the afternoon was far spent she had slept hours someone was knocking she got up and drew aside the blanket bate wood was standing near the door  now miss ive supper ready he said an i was reckonin youd like me to fetch yours  yes thank you i would replied joan  in a few moments wood returned carrying the top of a box upon which were steaming pans and cups he handed this rude tray up to joan  shore im a firstrate cook miss when ive somethin to cook he said with a smile that changed his hard face  she returned the smile with her thanks evidently kells had a wellfilled larder and as joan had fared on coarse and hard food for long this supper was a luxury and exceedingly appetizing while she was eating the blanket curtain moved aside and kells appeared he dropped it behind him but did not step up into the room he was in his shirtsleeves had been clean shaven and looked a different man  how do you like yourhome he inquired with a hint of his former mockery  im grateful for the privacy she replied  you think you could be worse off then  i know it  suppose gulden kills meand rules the gangand takes you theres a story about him the worst ive heard on this border ill tell you some day when i want to scare you bad  gulden joan shivered as she pronounced the name are you and he enemies  no man can have a friend on this border we flock together like buzzards theres safety in numbers but we fight together like buzzards over carrion  kells you hate this life  ive always hated my life everywhere the only life i ever loved was adventure im willing to try a new one if youll go with me  joan shook her head  why not ill marry you he went on speaking lower ive got gold ill get more  where did you get the gold she asked  ive relieved a good many overburdened travelers and prospectors he replied  kells youre aa villain exclaimed joan unable to contain her sudden heat you must be utterly madto ask me to marry you  no im not mad he rejoined with a laugh guldens the mad one hes crazy hes got a twist in his brain im no fool ive only lost my head over you but compare marrying me living and traveling among decent people and comfort to camps like this if i dont get drunk ill be half decent to you but ill get shot sooner or later then youll be left to gulden  why do you say him she queried in a shudder of curiosity  well gulden haunts me  he does me too he makes me lose my sense of proportion beside him you and the others seem good but you are wicked  then you wont marry me and go away somewhere your choice is strange because i tell you the truth  kells im a woman something deep in me says you wont keep me hereyou cant be so base not now after i saved your life it would be horribleinhuman i cant believe any man born of a woman could do it  but i want youi love you he said low and hard  love thats not love she replied in scorn god only knows what it is  call it what you like he went on bitterly youre a young beautiful sweet woman its wonderful to be near you my life has been hell ive had nothing theres only hell to look forward toand hell at the end why shouldnt i keep you here  but kells listen she whispered earnestly suppose i am young and beautiful and sweetas you said im utterly in your power im compelled to seek your protection from even worse men youre different from these others youre educated you must have hadaa good mother now youre bitter desperate terrible you hate life you seem to think this charm you see in me will bring you something maybe a glimpse of joy but how can it you know better how can it unless ii love you  kells stared at her the evil and hardness of his passion corded in his face and the shadows of comprehending thought in his strange eyes showed the other side of the man he was still staring at her while he reached to put aside the curtains then he dropped his head and went out  joan sat motionless watching the door where he had disappeared listening to the mounting beats of her heart she had only been frank and earnest with kells but he had taken a meaning from her last few words that she had not intended to convey all that was woman in hermounting righting hatingleaped to the power she sensed in herself if she could be deceitful cunning shameless in holding out to kells a possible return of his love she could do anything with him she knew it she did not need to marry him or sacrifice herself joan was amazed that the idea remained an instant before her consciousness but something had told her this was another kind of life than she had known and all that was precious to her hung in the balance any falsity was justifiable even righteous under the circumstances could she formulate a plan that this keen bandit would not see through the remotest possibility of her even caring for kellsthat was as much as she dared hint but that together with all the charm and seductiveness she could summon might be enough dared she try it if she tried and failed kells would despise her and then she was utterly lost she was caught between doubt and hope all that was natural and true in her shrank from such unwomanly deception all that had been born of her wild experience inflamed her to play the game to match kellss villainy with a womans unfathomable duplicity  and while joan was absorbed in thought the sun set the light failed twilight stole into the cabin and then darkness all this hour there had been a continual sound of mens voices in the large cabin sometimes low and at other times loud it was only when joan distinctly heard the name jim cleve that she was startled out of her absorption thrilling and flushing in her eagerness she nearly fell as she stepped and gropped through the darkness to the door and as she drew aside the blanket her hand shook  the large room was lighted by a fire and half a dozen lanterns through a faint tinge of blue smoke joan saw men standing and sitting and lounging around kells who had a seat where the light fell full upon him evidently a lull had intervened in the talk the dark faces joan could see were all turned toward the door expectantly  bring him in bate and lets look him over said kells  then bate wood appeared elbowing his way in and he had his hand on the arm of a tall lithe fellow when they got into the light joan quivered as if she had been stabbed that stranger with wood was jim clevejim cleve in frame and feature yet not the same she knew  cleve glad to meet you greeted kells extending his hand  thanks same to you replied cleve and he met the proffered hand his voice was cold and colorless unfamiliar to joan was this man really jim cleve  the meeting of kells and cleve was significant because of kellss interest and the silent attention of the men of his clan it did not seem to mean anything to the whitefaced tragiceyed cleve joan gazed at him with utter amazement she remembered a heavily built florid jim cleve an overgrown boy with a goodnatured lazy smile on his full face and sleepy eyes she all but failed to recognize him in the man who stood there now lithe and powerful with muscles bulging in his coarse white shirt joans gaze swept over him up and down shivering at the two heavy guns he packed till it was transfixed on his face the old or the other jim cleve had been homely with too much flesh on his face to show force or fire this man seemed beautiful but it was a beauty of tragedy he was as white as kells but smoothly purely white without shadow or sunburn his lips seemed to have set with a bitter indifferent laugh his eyes looked straight out piercing intent haunted and as dark as night great blue circles lay under them lending still further depth and mystery it was a sad reckless face that wrung joans very heartstrings she had come too late to save his happiness but she prayed that it was not too late to save his honor and his soul  while she gazed there had been further exchange of speech between kells and cleve and she had heard though not distinguished what was said kells was unmistakably friendly as were the other men within range of joans sight cleve was surrounded there were jesting and laughter and then he was led to the long table where several men were already gambling  joan dropped the curtain and in the darkness of her cabin she saw that white haunting face and when she covered her eyes she still saw it the pain the reckless violence the hopeless indifference the wreck and ruin in that face had been her doing why how had jim cleve wronged her he had loved her at her displeasure and had kissed her against her will she had furiously upbraided him and when he had finally turned upon her threatening to prove he was no coward she had scorned him with a girls merciless injustice all her strength and resolve left her momentarily after seeing jim there like a woman she weakened she lay on the bed and writhed doubt hopelessness despair again seized upon her and some strange yearning maddening emotion what had she sacrificed his happiness and her ownand both their lives  the clamor in the other cabin grew so boisterous that suddenly when it stilled joan was brought sharply to the significance of it again she drew aside the curtain and peered out  gulden huge stolid gloomy was entering the cabin the man fell into the circle and faced kell with the firelight dancing in his cavernous eyes  hello gulden said kells coolly what ails you  anybody tell you about bill bailey asked gulden heavily  kells did not show the least concern tell me what  that he died in a cabin down in the valley  kells gave a slight start and his eyes narrowed and shot steely glints no its news to me  kells you left bailey for dead but he lived he was shot through but he got there somehownobody knows he was far gone when beady jones happened along before he died he sent word to me by beady are you curious to know what it was  not the least replied kells bailey waswell offensive to my wife i shot him  he swore you drew on him in cold blood thundered gulden he swore it was for nothingjust so you could be alone with that girl  kells rose in wonderful calmness with only his pallor and a slight shaking of his hands to betray excitement an uneasy stir and murmur ran through the room red pearce nearest at hand stepped to kellss side all in a moment there was a deadly surcharged atmosphere there  well he swore right now whats it to you  apparently the fact and its confession were nothing particular to gulden or else he was deep where all considered him only dense and shallow  its done bills dead continued gulden but why do you doublecross the gang whats the game you never did it before that girl isnt your  shut up hissed kells like a flash his hand flew out with his gun and all about him was dark menace  gulden made no attempt to draw he did not show surprise nor fear nor any emotion he appeared plodding in mind red pearce stepped between kells and gulden there was a realization in the crowd loud breaths scraping of feet gulden turned away then kells resumed his seat and his pipe as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred     9  joan turned away from the door in a cold clamp of relief the shadow of death hovered over these men she must fortify herself to live under that shadow to be prepared for any sudden violence to stand a succession of shocks that inevitably would come she listened the men were talking and laughing now there came a click of chips the spat of a thrown card the thump of a little sack of gold ahead of her lay the long hours of night in which these men would hold revel only a faint ray of light penetrated her cabin but it was sufficient for her to distinguish objects she set about putting the poles in place to barricade the opening when she had finished she knew she was safe at least from intrusion who had constructed that rude door and for what purpose then she yielded to the temptation to peep once more under the edge of the curtain  the room was cloudy and blue with smoke she saw jim cleve at a table gambling with several ruffians his back was turned yet joan felt the contrast of his attitude toward the game compared with that of the others they were tense fierce and intent upon every throw of a card cleves very poise of head and movement of arm betrayed his indifference one of the gamblers howled his disgust slammed down his cards and got up  hes cleaned out said one in devilish glee  naw he aint voiced another hes got two fruitcans full of dust i saw em hes just lay downlike a poisoned coyote  shore im glad cleves got the luck fer mebbe hell give my gold back spoke up another gamester with a laugh  wal he certainlee is the chilvalus card sharp rejoined the last player jim was you allus as lucky in love as in cards  lucky in love sure answered jim cleve with a mocking reckless ring in his voice  funny aint thet boys now theres the boss kells can sure win the gurls but hes a pore gambler kells heard this speech and he laughed with the others hey you greaser you never won any of my money he said  come an set in boss come an see your gold fade away you cant stop this jim cleve luckbull luck straddles his neck hell win your goldyour hosses an saddles an spurs an gunsan your shirt if youve nerve enough to bet it  the speaker slapped his cards upon the table while he gazed at cleve in grieved admiration kells walked over to the group and he put his hand on cleves shoulder  say youngster he said genially you said you were just as lucky in love now i had a hunch some bad luck with a girl drove you out here to the border  kells spoke jestingly in a way that could give no offense even to the wildest of boys yet there was curiosity keenness penetration in his speech it had not the slightest effect upon jim cleve  bad luck and a girl to hell with both he said  shore youre talkin religion thets where both luck an gurls come from replied the unlucky gamester will one of you hawgs pass the whiskey  the increased interest with which kells looked down upon jim cleve was not lost upon joan but she had seen enough and turning away she stumbled to the bed and lay there with an ache in her heart  oh she whispered to herself he is ruinedruinedruined god forgive me she saw bright cold stars shining between the logs the night wind swept in cold and pure with the dew of the mountain in it she heard the mourn of wolves the hoot of an owl the distant cry of a panther weird and wild yet outside there was a thick and lonely silence in that other cabin from which she was mercifully shut out there were different sounds hideous by contrast by and by she covered her ears and at length weary from thought and sorrow she drifted into slumber  next morning long after she had awakened the cabin remained quiet with no one stirring morning had half gone before wood knocked and gave her a bucket of water a basin and towels later he came with her breakfast after that she had nothing to do but pace the floor of her two rooms one appeared to be only an empty shed long in disuse her view from both rooms was restricted to the green slope of the gulch up to yellow crags and the sky but she would rather have had this to watch than an outlook upon the cabins and the doings of these bandits  about noon she heard the voice of kells in low and earnest conversation with someone she could not however understand what was said that ceased and then she heard kells moving around there came a clatter of hoofs as a horse galloped away from the cabin after which a knock sounded on the wall  joan called kells then the curtain was swept aside and kells appearing pale and troubled stepped into her room  whats the matter asked joan hurriedly  gulden shot two men this morning ones dead the others in bad shape so red tells me i havent seen him  whowho are they faltered joan she could not think of any man except jim cleve  dan smalls the ones dead the other they call dick never heard his last name  was it a fight  of course and gulden picked it hes a quarrelsome man nobody can go against him hes all the time like some men when theyre drunk im sorry i didnt bore him last night i would have done it if it hadnt been for red pearce  kells seemed gloomy and concentrated on his situation and he talked naturally to joan as if she were one to sympathize a bandit then in the details of his life the schemes troubles friendships relations was no different from any other kind of a man he was human and things that might constitute black evil for observers were dear to him a part of him joan feigned the sympathy she could not feel  i thought gulden was your enemy  kells sat down on one of the box seats and his heavy gunsheath rested upon the floor he looked at joan now forgetting she was a woman and his prisoner  i never thought of that till now he said we always got along because i understood him i managed him the man hasnt changed in the least hes always what he is but theres a difference i noticed that first over in lost canon and joan i believe its because gulden saw you  oh no cried joan trembling  maybe im wrong anyway somethings wrong gulden never had a friend or a partner i dont misunderstand his position regarding bailey what did he care for that soak guldens crossgrained he opposes anything or anybody hes got a twist in his mind that makes him dangerous i wanted to get rid of him i decided toafter last night but now it seems thats no easy job  why asked joan curiously  pearce and wood and beard all men i rely on said it wont do they hint gulden is strong with my gang here and all through the border i was wild i dont believe it but as im not surewhat can i do theyre all afraid of gulden thats it and i believe i am too  you exclaimed joan  kells actually looked ashamed i believe i am joan he replied that gulden is not a man i never was afraid of a real man heshes an animal  he made me think of a gorrilla said joan  theres only one man i know whos not afraid of gulden hes a newcomer here on the border jim cleve he calls himself a youngster i cant figure but hed slap the devil himself in the face cleve wont last long out here yet you can never tell men like him who laugh at death sometimes avert it for long i was that way once cleve heard me talking to pearce about gulden and he said kells ill pick a fight with this gulden and drive him out of the camp or kill him  what did you say queried joan trying to steady her voice as she averted her eyes  i said jim that wins me but i dont want you killed it certainly was nervy of the youngster said it just the same asas hed offer to cinch my saddle gulden can whip a roomful of men hes done it and as for a killerive heard of no man with his record  and thats why you fear him  its not replied kells passionately as if his manhood had been affronted its because hes gulden theres something uncanny about him guldens a cannibal  joan looked as if she had not heard aright  its a cold fact known all over the border guldens no braggart but hes been known to talk he was a sailora pirate once he was shipwrecked starvation forced him to be a cannibal he told this in california and in nevada camps but no one believed him a few years ago he got snowedup in the mountains back of lewiston he had two companions with him they all began to starve it was absolutely necessary to try to get out they started out in the snow travel was desperately hard gulden told that his companions dropped but he murdered themand again saved his life by being a cannibal after this became known his sailor yarns were no longer doubted theres another story about him once he got hold of a girl and took her into the mountains after a winter he returned alone he told that hed kept her tied in a cave without any clothes and she froze to death  oh horrible moaned joan  i dont know how true it is but i believe it gulden is not a man the worst of us have a conscience we can tell right from wrong but gulden cant hes beneath morals he has no conception of manhood such as ive seen in the lowest of outcasts that cave story with the girlthat betrays him he belongs back in the stone age hes a thing and here on the border if he wants he can have all the more power because of what he is  kells dont let him see me entreated joan  the bandit appeared not to catch the fear in joans tone and look she had been only a listener presently with preoccupied and gloomy mien he left her alone  joan did not see him again except for glimpses under the curtain for three days she kept the door barred and saw no one except bate wood who brought her meals she paced her cabin like a caged creature during this period few men visited kellss cabin and these few did not remain long joan was aware that kells was not always at home evidently he was able to go out upon the fourth day he called to her and knocked for admittance joan let him in and saw that he was now almost well again once more cool easy cheerful with his strange forceful air  good day joan you dont seem to be pining for yournegligent husband  he laughed as if he mocked himself but there was gladness in the very sight of her and some indefinable tone in his voice that suggested respect  i didnt miss you replied joan yet it was a relief to see him  no i imagine not he said dryly well ive been busy with menwith plans things are working out to my satisfaction red pearce got around gulden theres been no split besides gulden rode off someone said he went after a little girl named brander i hope he gets shot joan well be leaving cabin gulch soon im expecting news thatll change things i wont leave you here youll have to ride the roughest trails and your clothes are in tatters now youve got to have something to wear  i should think so replied joan fingering the thin worn ragged habit that had gone to pieces the first brush i ride through will tear this off  thats annoying said kells with exasperation at himself where on earth can i get you a dress were two hundred miles from everywhere the wildest kind of country say did you ever wear a mans outfit  yees when i went prospecting and hunting with my uncle she replied reluctantly  suddenly he had a daring and brilliant smile that changed his face completely he rubbed his palms together he laughed as if at a huge joke he cast a measuring glance up and down her slender form  just wait till i come back he said  he left her and she heard him rummaging around in the pile of trappings she had noted in a corner of the other cabin presently he returned carrying a bundle this he unrolled on the bed and spread out the articles  dandy dales outfit he said with animation dandy was a wouldbe knight of the road he dressed the part but he tried to hold up a stage over here and an unappreciative passenger shot him he wasnt killed outright he crawled away and died some of my men found him and they fetched his clothes that outfit cost a fortune but not a man among us could get into it  there was a black sombrero with heavy silver band a darkblue blouse and an embroidered buckskin vest a belt full of cartridges and a pearlhandled gun trousers of corduroy hightop leather boots and gold mounted spurs all of the finest material and workmanship  joan ill make you a black mask out of the rim of a felt hat and then youll be grand he spoke with the impulse and enthusiasm of a boy  kells you dont mean me to wear these asked joan incredulously  certainly why not just the thing a little fancy but then youre a girl we cant hide that i dont want to hide it  i wont wear them declared joan  excuse mebut you will he replied coolly and pleasantly  i wont cried joan she could not keep cool  joan youve got to take long rides with me at night sometimes wild rides to elude pursuers sometimes youll go into camps with me youll have to wear strong easy free clothes youll have to be masked here the outfit isas if made for you why youre dead lucky for this stuff is good and strong itll stand the wear yet its fit for a girl you put the outfit on right now  i said i wouldnt joan snapped  but what do you care if it belonged to a fellow whos dead there see that hole in the shirt thats a bullethole dont be squeamish itll only make your part harder  mr kells you seem to have forgotten entirely that im aa girl  he looked blank astonishment maybe i have ill remember but you said youd worn a mans things  i wore my brothers coat and overalls and was lost in them replied joan  his face began to work then he laughed uproariously iunderstand thisll fityoulike a glove fine im dying to see you  you never will  at that he grew sober and his eyes glinted you cant take a little fun ill leave you now for a while when i come back youll have that suit on  there was that in his voice then which she had heard when he ordered men  joan looked her defiance  if you dont have it on when i come illill tear your rags off i can do that youre a strong little devil and maybe im not well enough yet to put this outfit on you but i can get help if you anger me i might wait forgulden  joans legs grew weak under her so that she had to sink on the bed kells would do absolutely and literally what he threatened she understood now the changing secret in his eyes one moment he was a certain kind of a man and the very next he was incalculably different she instinctively recognized this latter personality as her enemy she must use all the strength and wit and cunning and charm to keep his other personality in the ascendancy else all was futile  since you force me sothen i must she said  kells left her without another word  joan removed her stained and torn dress and her wornout boots then hurriedly for fear kells might return she put on the dead boybandits outfit dandy dale assuredly must have been her counterpart for his things fitted her perfectly joan felt so strange that she scarcely had courage enough to look into the mirror when she did look she gave a start that was of both amaze and shame but for her face she never could have recognized herself what had become of her height her slenderness she looked like an audacious girl in a dashing boy masquerade her shame was singular inasmuch as it consisted of a burning hateful consciousness that she had not been able to repress a thrill of delight at her appearance and that this costume strangely magnified every curve and swell of her body betraying her feminity as nothing had ever done  and just at that moment kells knocked on the door and called joan are you dressed  yes she replied but the word seemed involuntary  then kells came in  it was an instinctive and frantic impulse that made joan snatch up a blanket and half envelop herself in it she stood with scarlet face and dilating eyes trembling in every limb kells had entered with an expectant smile and that mocking light in his gaze both faded he stared at the blanketthen at her face then he seemed to comprehend this ordeal and he looked sorry for her  why youyou littlefool he exclaimed with emotion and that emotion seemed to exasperate him turning away from her he gazed out between the logs again as so many times before he appeared to be remembering something that was hard to recall and vague  joan agitated as she was could not help but see the effect of her unexpected and unconscious girlishness she comprehended that with the mind of the woman which had matured in her like kells she too had different personalities  im trying to be decent to you went on kells without turning i want to give you a chance to make the best of a bad situation but youre a kida girl and im a bandit a man lost to all good who means to have you  but youre not lost to all good replied joan earnestly i cant understand what i do feel but i knowif it had been gulden instead of youthat i wouldnt have tried to hide mymyself behind this blanket im no longerafraid of you thats why i actedsojust like a girl caught oh cant you see  no i cant see he replied i wish i hadnt fetched you here i wish the thing hadnt happened now its too late  its never too late youyou havent harmed me yet  but i love you he burst out not like i have oh i see thisthat i never really loved any woman before somethings gripped me it feels like that rope at my throatwhen they were going to hang me  then joan trembled in the realization that a tremendous passion had seized upon this strange strong man in the face of it she did not know how to answer him yet somehow she gathered courage in the knowledge  kells stood silent a long moment looking out at the green slope and then as if speaking to himself he said i stacked the deck and dealt myself a handa losing handand now ive got to play it  with that he turned to joan it was the piercing gaze he bent upon her that hastened her decision to resume the part she had to play and she dropped the blanket kellss gloom and that iron hardness vanished he smiled as she had never seen him smile in that and his speechless delight she read his estimate of her appearance and notwithstanding the unwomanliness of her costume and the fact of his notorious character she knew she had never received so great a compliment finally he found his voice  joan if youre not the prettiest thing i ever saw in my life  i cant get used to this outfit said joan i canti wont go away from this room in it  sure you will see here thisll make a difference maybe youre so shy  he held out a wide piece of black felt that evidently he had cut from a sombrero this he measured over her forehead and eyes and then taking his knife he cut it to a desired shape next he cut eyeholes in it and fastened to it a loop made of a short strip of buckskin  try that pull it downeven with your eyes theretake a look at yourself  joan faced the mirror and saw merely a masked stranger she was no longer joan randle her identity had been absolutely lost  no onewho ever knew mecould recognize me now she murmured and the relieving thought centered round jim cleve  i hadnt figured on that replied kells but youre right joan if i dont miss my guess it wont be long till youll be the talk of miningtowns and campfires  this remark of kellss brought to joan proof of his singular pride in the name he bore and proof of many strange stories about bandits and wild women of the border she had never believed any of these stories they had seemed merely a part of the life of this unsettled wild country a prospector would spend a night at a campfire and tell a weird story and pass on never to be seen there again could there have been a stranger story than her life seemed destined to be her mind whirled with vague circling thoughtkells and his gang the wild trails the camps and towns gold and stagecoaches robbery fights murder mad rides in the dark and back to jim cleve and his ruin  suddenly kells stepped to her from behind and put his arms around her joan grew stiff she had been taken off her guard she was in his arms and could not face him  joan kiss me he whispered with a softness a richer deeper note in his voice  no cried joan violently  there was a moment of silence in which she felt his grasp slowly tightenthe heave of his breast  then ill make you he said so different was the voice now that another man might have spoken then he bent her backward and freeing one hand brought it under her chin and tried to lift her face  but joan broke into fierce violent resistance she believed she was doomed but that only made her the fiercer the stronger and with her head down her arms straining her body hard and rigidly unyielding she fought him all over the room knocking over the table and seats wrestling from wall to wall till at last they fell across the bed and she broke his hold then she sprang up panting disheveled and backed away from him it had been a sharp desperate struggle on her part and she was stronger than he he was not a well man he raised himself and put one hand to his breast his face was haggard wet working with passion gray with pain in the struggle she had hurt him perhaps reopened his wound  did youknife methat it hurts so he panted raising a hand that shook  i hadnothing i justfought cried joan breathlessly  you hurt meagaindamn you im never freefrom pain but thiss worse and im a coward and im a dog too not half a manyou slip of a girland i couldnthold you  his pain and shame were dreadful for joan to see because she felt sorry for him and divined that behind them would rise the darker grimmer force of the man and she was right for suddenly he changed that which had seemed almost to make him abject gave way to a pale and bitter dignity he took up dandy dales belt which joan had left on the bed and drawing the gun from its sheath he opened the cylinder to see if it was loaded and then threw the gun at joans feet  there take itand make a better job this time he said  the power in his voice seemed to force joan to pick up the gun  what doyou mean she queried haltingly  shoot me again put me out of my painmy misery im sick of it all id be glad to have you kill me  kells exclaimed joan weakly  take your chancenowwhen ive no strengthto force you throw the gun on me kill me  he spoke with a terrible impelling earnestness and the strength of his will almost hypnotized joan into execution of his demand  you are mad she said i dont want to kill you i couldnt i just want you toto bedecent to me  i have beenfor me i was only in fun this timewhen i grabbed you but the feel of you i cant be decent any more i see things clear now joan randle its my life or your soul  he rose now dark shaken stripped of all save the truth  joan dropped the gun from nerveless grasp  is that your choice he asked hoarsely  i cant murder you  are you afraid of the other menof gulden is that why you cant kill me youre afraid to be leftto try to get away  i never thought of them  thenmy life or your soul  he stalked toward her loomed over her so that she put out trembling hands after the struggle a reaction was coming to her she was weakening she had forgotten her plan  if youre mercilessthen it must bemy soul she whispered for i cant murder you could you take that gun nowand press it hereand murder me  no for i love you  you dont love me its a blacker crime to murder the soul than the body  something in his strange eyes inspired joan with a flashing reviving divination back upon her flooded all that tide of womans subtle incalculable power to allure to charge to hold swiftly she went close to kells she stretched out her hands one was bleeding from rough contract with the log wall during the struggle her wrists were red swollen bruised from his fierce grasp  look see what youve done you were a beast you made me fight like a beast my hands were clawsmy whole body one hard knot of muscle you couldnt hold meyou couldnt kiss me suppose you are able to hold melater ill only be the husk of a woman ill just be a cold shell doubledup unrelaxed a callous thing never to yield all thats me the girl the woman you say you lovewill be inside shrinking loathing hating sickened to death you will only kissembracea thing youve degraded the warmth the sweetness the quiver the thrill the response the lifeall that is the soul of a woman and makes her lovable will be murdered  then she drew still closer to kells and with all the wondrous subtlety of a woman in a supreme moment where a life and a soul hang in the balance she made of herself an absolute contrast to the fierce wild unyielding creature who had fought him off  let me showyou the difference she whispered leaning to him glowing soft eager terrible with her womans charm something tells megives me strength what might be only barely possibleif in my awful plightyou turned out to be a man good instead of bad andif it were possiblesee the differencesin the woman i show youto save my soul  she gave the fascinated kells her hands slipped into his arms to press against his breast and leaned against him an instant all one quivering surrendered body and then lifting a white face true in its radiance to her honest and supreme purpose to give him one fleeting glimpse of the beauty and tenderness and soul of love she put warm and tremulous lips to his  then she fell away from him shrinking and terrified but he stood there as if something beyond belief had happened to him and the evil of his face the hard lines the brute softened and vanished in a light of transformation  my god he breathed softly then he awakened as if from a trance and leaping down the steps he violently swept aside the curtain and disappeared  joan threw herself upon the bed and spent the last of her strength in the relief of blinding tears she had won she believed she need never fear kells again in that one moment of abandon she had exalted him but at what cost     10  next day when kells called joan out into the other cabin she verified her hope and belief not so much in the almost indefinable aging and sadness of the man as in the strong intuitive sense that her attraction had magnified for him and had uplifted him  you mustnt stay shut up in there any longer he said youve lost weight and youre pale go out in the air and sun you might as well get used to the gang bate wood came to me this morning and said he thought you were the ghost of dandy dale that name will stick to you i dont care how you treat my men but if youre friendly youll fare better dont go far from the cabin and if any man says or does a thing you dont likeflash your gun dont yell for me you can bluff this gang to a standstill  that was a trial for joan when she walked out into the light in dandy dales clothes she did not step very straight and she could feel the cold prick of her face under the mask it was not shame but fear that gripped her she would rather die than have jim cleve recognize her in that bold disguise a line of dusty saddled horses stood heads and bridles down before the cabin and a number of lounging men ceased talking when she appeared it was a crowd that smelled of dust and horses and leather and whisky and tobacco joan did not recognize any one there which fact aided her in a quick recovery of her composure then she found amusement in the absolute sensation she made upon these loungers they stared openmouthed and motionless one old fellow dropped his pipe from bearded lips and did not seem to note the loss a dark young man dissipated and wildlooking with years of lawlessness stamped upon his face was the first to move and he with awkward gallantry but with amiable disposition joan wanted to run yet she forced herself to stand there apparently unconcerned before this battery of bold and curious eyes that once done made the rest easier she was grateful for the mask and with her first low almost incoherent words in reply joan entered upon the second phase of her experience with these bandits naturalness did not come soon but it did come and with it her wit and courage  used as she had become to the villainous countenances of the border ruffians she yet upon closer study discovered wilder and more abandoned ones yet despite that and a brazen unconcealed admiration there was not lacking kindliness and sympathy and good nature presently joan sauntered away and she went among the tired shaggy horses and made friends with them an occasional rider swung up the trail to dismount before kellss cabin and once two riders rode in both staringall eyesat her the meaning of her intent alertness dawned upon her then always whatever she was doing or thinking or saying behind it all hid the driving watchfulness for jim cleve and the consciousness of this fixed her mind upon him where was he what was he doing was he drunk or gambling or fighting or sleeping was he still honest when she did meet him what would happen how could she make herself and circumstances known to him before he killed somebody a new fear had birth and grewcleve would recognize her in that disguise mask and all  she walked up and down for a while absorbed with this new idea then an unusual commotion among the loungers drew her attention to a group of men on foot surrounding and evidently escorting several horsemen joan recognized red pearce and frenchy and then with a start jim cleve they were riding up the trail joans heart began to pound she could not meet jim she dared not trust this disguise all her plans were as if they had never been she forgot kells she even forgot her fear of what cleve might do the meetingthe inevitable recognitionthe pain jim cleve must suffer when the fact and apparent significance of her presence there burst upon him these drove all else from joans mind mask or no mask she could not face his piercing eyes and like a little coward she turned to enter the cabin  before she got in however it was forced upon her that something unusual had roused the loungers they had arisen and were interested in the approaching group loud talk dinned in joans ears then she went in the door as kells stalked by eyes agleam without even noticing her once inside her cabin with the curtain drawn joans fear gave place to anxiety and curiosity  there was no one in the large cabin through the outer door she caught sight of a part of the crowd close together heads up all noisy then she heard kellss authoritative voice but she could understand nothing the babel of hoarse voices grew louder kells appeared entering the door with pearce jim cleve came next and once the three were inside the crowd spilled itself after them like angry bees kells was talking pearce was talking but their voices were lost suddenly kells vented his temper  shut upthe lot of you he yelled and his power and position might have been measured by the menace he showed  the gang became suddenly quiet  nowwhats up demanded kells  keep your shirt on boss replied pearce with good humor there aint much wrong cleve here throwed a gun on gulden thats all  kells gave a slight start barely perceptible but the intensity of it and a fleeting tigerish gleam across his face impressed joan with the idea that he felt a fiendish joy her own heart clamped in a cold amaze  gulden kellss exclamation was likewise a passionate query  no he aint cashed replied pearce you cant kill that bull so easy but hes shot up some hes layin over at beards reckon youd better go over an dress them shots  he can rot before i doctor him replied kells wheres bate wood bate you can take my kit and go fix gulden up and now red what was all the roar about  reckon that was guldens particular pards tryin to mix it with cleve an cleve tryin to mix it with theman me in between im here to say boss that i had a time stavin off a scrap  during this rapid exchange between kells and his lieutenant jim cleve sat on the edge of the table one dusty boot swinging so that his spur jangled a wisp of a cigarette in his lips his face was white except where there seemed to be bruises under his eyes joan had never seen him look like this she guessed that he had been drunkperhaps was still drunk that utterly abandoned face joan was so keen to read made her bite her tongue to keep from crying out yes jim was lost  whatd they fight about queried kells  ask cleve replied pearce reckon id just as lief not talk any more about him  then kells turned to cleve and stepped before him somehow these two men face to face thrilled joan to her depths they presented such contrasts kells was keen imperious vital strong and complex with an unmistakable friendly regard for this young outcast cleve seemed aloof detached indifferent to everything with a white weary reckless scorn both men were far above the gaping ruffians around them  cleve whyd you draw on gulden asked kells sharply  thats my business replied cleve slowly and with his piercing eyes on kells he blew a long thin blue stream of smoke upward  sure but i remember what you asked me the other dayabout gulden was that why  nope replied cleve this was my affair  all right but id like to know pearce says youre in bad with guldens friends if i cant make peace between you ill have to take sides  kells i dont need any one on my side said cleve and he flung the cigarette away  yes you do replied kells persuasively every man on this border needs that and hes lucky when he gets it  well i dont ask for it i dont want it  thats your own business too im not insisting or advising  kellss force and ability to control men manifested itself in his speech and attitude nothing could have been easier than to rouse the antagonism of jim cleve abnormally responding as he was to the wild conditions of this border environment  then youre not calling my hand queried cleve with his dark piercing glance on kells  i pass jim replied the bandit easily  cleve began to roll another cigarette joan saw his strong brown hands tremble and she realized that this came from his nervous condition not from agitation her heart ached for him what a white somber face so terribly expressive of the overthrow of his soul he had fled to the border in reckless fury at herat himself there in its wildness he had perhaps lost thought of himself and memory of her he had plunged into the unrestrained border life its changing raw and fateful excitement might have made him forget but behind all was the terrible seeking to destroy and be destroyed joan shuddered when she remembered how she had mocked this boys wounded vanityhow scathingly she had said he did not possess manhood and nerve enough even to be bad  see here red said kells to pearce tell me what happenedwhat you saw jim cant object to that  sure replied pearce thus admonished we was all over at beards an several games was on gulden rode into camp last night hes always sore but last night it seemed moren usual but he didnt say much an nothin happened we all reckoned his trip fell through today he was restless he walked an walked just like a cougar in a pen you know how gulden has

he saved the whisky wed been drinkin an cleve most of all beard was white at the gills with rage an texas was soffocatin but we all was afraid of gulden except cleve as it turned out but he didnt move or look mean an gulden pounded on the table an addressed himself to cleve  ive a job youll like come on  job say man you couldnt have a job id like replied cleve slow an cool  you know how gulden gets

 cleve he said i located the brander golddigginsan the girl was there  some kind of a white flash went over cleve an we all rememberin luce began to bend low ready to duck gulden didnt look no

fellers were dodgin low an as i ducked i seen gulden flat on his back draggin at his gun he stopped short an his hand flopped the side of his face went all bloody i made sure hed cashed so i leaped up an grabbed cleve  itd been all right if gulden had only cashed but he hadnt he came to an bellered fer his gun an fer his pards why you could have heard him for a mile then as i told you i had trouble in holdin back a general mixup an while he was hollerin about it i led them all over to you gulden is layin back there with his ear shot off an thats all  kells with thoughtful mien turned from pearce to the group of darkfaced men this fight settles one thing he said to them weve got to have organization if youre not all a lot of fools youll see that you need a head most of you swear by me but some of you are for gulden just because hes a bloody devil these times are the wildest the west ever knew and theyre growing wilder gulden is a great machine for execution he has no sense of fear hes a giant he loves to fightto kill but guldens all but crazy this last deal proves that i leave it to your common sense he rides around hunting for some lone camp to rob or some girl to make off with he does not plan with me or the men whose judgment i have confidence in hes always without gold and so are most of his followers i dont know who they are and i dont care but here we splitunless they and gulden take advice and orders from me im not so much siding with cleve any of you ought to admit that guldens kind of work will disorganize a gang hes been with us for long and he approaches cleve with a job cleve is a stranger he may belong here but hes not yet one of us gulden oughtnt have approached him it was no straight deal we cant figure what gulden meant exactly but it isnt likely he wanted cleve to go it was a bluff he got called you men think this overwhether youll stick to gulden or to me clear out now  his strong direct talk evidently impressed them and in silence they crowded out of the cabin leaving pearce and cleve behind  jim are you just hellbent on fighting or do you mean to make yourself the champion of every poor girl in these wilds  cleve puffed a cloud of smoke that enveloped his head i dont pick quarrels he replied  then you get redheaded at the very mention of a girl  a savage gesture of cleves suggested that kells was right  here dont get redheaded at me called kells with piercing sharpness ill be your friend if you let me but declare yourself like a manif you want me for a friend  kells im much obliged replied cleve with a semblance of earnestness im no good or i wouldnt be out here but i cant stand for thesethese deals with girls  youll change rejoined kells bitterly wait till you live a few lonely years out here you dont understand the border youre young ive seen the goldfields of california and nevada men go crazy with the gold fever its gold that makes men wild if you dont get killed youll change if you live youll see life on this border war debases the moral force of a man but nothing like what youll experience here the next few years men with their wives and daughters are pouring into this range theyre all over theyre finding gold theyve tasted blood wait till the great gold strike comes then youll see men and women go back ten thousand years and then whatll one girl more or less matter  well you see kells i was loved so devotedly by one and made such a hero ofthat i just cant bear to see any girl mistreated  he almost drawled the words and he was suave and cool and his face was inscrutable but a bitterness in his tone gave the lie to all he said and looked  pearce caught the broader inference and laughed as if at a great joke kells shook his head doubtfully as if cleves transparent speech only added to the complexity and cleve turned away as if in an instant he had forgotten his comrades  afterward in the silence and darkness of night joan randle lay upon her bed sleepless haunted by jims white face amazed at the magnificent madness of him thrilled to her soul by the meaning of his attack on gulden and tortured by a love that had grown immeasurably full of the strength of these hours of suspense and the passion of this wild border  even in her dreams joan seemed to be bending all her will toward that inevitable and fateful moment when she must stand before jim cleve it had to be therefore she would absolutely compel herself to meet it regardless of the tumult that must rise within her when all had been said her experience so far among the bandits in spite of the shocks and suspense that had made her a different girl had been infinitely more fortunate than might have been expected she prayed for this luck to continue and forced herself into a belief that it would  that night she had slept in dandy dales clothes except for the boots and sometimes while turning in restless slumber she had been awakened by rolling on the heavy gun which she had not removed from the belt and at such moments she had to ponder in the darkness to realize that she joan randle lay a captive in a bandits camp dressed in a dead bandits garb and packing his guneven while she slept it was such an improbable impossible thing yet the cold feel of the polished gun sent a thrill of certainty through her  in the morning she at least did not have to suffer the shame of getting into dandy dales clothes for she was already in them she found a grain of comfort even in that when she had put on the mask and sombrero she studied the effect in her little mirror and she again decided that no one not even jim cleve could recognize her in that disguise likewise she gathered courage from the fact that even her best girl friend would have found her figure unfamiliar and striking where once it had been merely tall and slender and strong ordinarily dressed then how would jim cleve ever recognize her she remembered her voice that had been called a contralto low and deep and how she used to sing the simple songs she knew she could not disguise that voice but she need not let jim hear it then there was a return of the idea that he would instinctively recognize herthat no disguise could be proof to a lover who had ruined himself for her suddenly she realized how futile all her worry and shame sooner or later she must reveal her identity to jim cleve out of all this complexity of emotion joan divined that what she yearned most for was to spare cleve the shame consequent upon recognition of her and then the agony he must suffer at a false conception of her presence there it was a weakness in her when death menaced her lover and the most inconceivably horrible situation yawned for her still she could only think of her passionate yearning to have him know all in a flash that she loved him that she had followed him in remorse that she was true to him and would die before being anything else  and when she left her cabin she was in a mood to force an issue  kells was sitting at the table and being served by bate wood  hello dandy he greeted her in surprise and pleasure thiss early for you  joan returned his greeting and said that she could not sleep all the time  youre coming round ill bet you hold up a stage before a month is out  hold up a stage echoed joan  sure itll be great fun replied kells with a laugh heresit down and eat with me bate come along lively with breakfast its fine to see you there that mask changes you though no one can see how pretty you are joan your admirer gulden has been incapacitated for the present  then in evident satisfaction kells repeated the story that joan had heard red pearce tell the night before and in the telling kells enlarged somewhat upon jim cleve  ive taken a liking to cleve said kells hes a strange youngster but hes more man than boy i think hes brokenhearted over some rotten girl whos been faithless or something most women are no good joan a while ago id have said all women were that but since ive known you i thinki know different still one girl out of a million doesnt change a world  what will this jjim ccleve dowhen he seesme asked joan and she choked over the name  dont eat so fast girl said kells youre only seventeen years old and youve plenty of time well ive thought some about cleve hes not crazy like gulden but hes just as dangerous hes dangerous because he doesnt know what hes doinghas absolutely no fear of deathand then hes swift with a gun thats a bad combination cleve will kill a man presently hes shot three already and in guldens case he meant to kill if once he kills a manthatll make him a gunfighter ive worried a little about his seeing you but i can manage him i guess he cant be scared or driven but he may be led ive had red pearce tell him you are my wife i hope he believes it for none of the other fellows believe it anyway youll meet this cleve soon maybe today and i want you to be friendly if i can steady himstop his drinkinghell be the best man for me on this border  im to help persuade him to join your band asked joan and she could not yet control her voice  is that so black a thing queried kells evidently nettled and he glared at her  ii dont know faltered joan is thisthis boy a criminal yet  no hes only a fine decent young chap gone wildgone bad for some girl i told you that you dont seem to grasp the point if i can control him hell be of value to mehell be a bold and clever and dangerous manhell last out here if i cant win him why he wont last a week longer hell be shot or knifed in a brawl without my control clevell go straight to the hell hes headed for  joan pushed back her plate and looking up steadily eyed the bandit  kells id rather he ended hishis career quickand went totothan live to be a bandit and murderer at your command  kells laughed mockingly yet the savage action with which he threw his cup against the wall attested to the fact that joan had strange power to hurt him  thats your sympathy because i told you some girl drove him out here said the bandit hes done for youll know that the moment you see him i really think he or any man out here would be the better for my interest now i want to know if youll stand by meput in a word to help influence this wild boy  illill have to see him first replied joan  well you take it sort of hard growled kells then presently he brightened i seem always to forget that youre only a kid listen now you do as you like but i want to warn you that youve got to get back the same kind of nervehere he lowered his voice and glanced at bate woodthat you showed when you shot me youre going to see some sights a great gold strike men grown goldmad woman of no more account than a puff of cottonseed hunger toil pain disease starvation robbery blood murder hanging deathall nothing nothing there will be only gold sleepless nightsdays of hellrush and rushall strangers with greedy eyes the things that made life will be forgotten and life itself will be cheap there will be only that yellow stuffgoldover which men go mad and women sell their souls  after breakfast kells had joans horse brought out of the corral and saddled  you must ride some every day you must keep in condition he said pretty soon we may have a chase and i dont want it to tear you to pieces  where shall i ride asked joan  anywhere you like up and down the gulch  are you going to have me watched  not if you say you wont run off  you trust me  yes  all right i promise and if i change my mind ill tell you  lord dont do it joan iiwell youve come to mean a good deal to me i dont know what id do if i lost you as she mounted the horse kells added dont stand any raw talk from any of the gang  joan rode away pondering in mind the strange fact that though she hated this bandit yet she had softened toward him his eyes lit when he saw her his voice mellowed his manner changed he had meant to tell her again that he loved her yet he controlled it was he ashamed had he seen into the depths of himself and despised what he had imagined love there were antagonistic forces at war within him  it was early morning and a rosy light tinged the fresh green she let the eager horse break into a canter and then a gallop and she rode up the gulch till the trail started into rough ground then turning she went back down under the pines and by the cabins to where the gulch narrowed its outlet into the wide valley here she met several dusty horsemen driving a packtrain one a jovial ruffian threw up his hands in mock surrender  hands up pards he exclaimed reckon weve run agin dandy dale come to life  his companions made haste to comply and then the three regarded her with bold and roguish eyes joan had run square into them round a corner of slope and as there was no room to pass she had halted  shore its the dandy dale we heerd of vouchsafed another  thets dandys outfit with a girl inside added the third  joan wheeled her horse and rode back up the trail the glances of these ruffians seemed to scorch her with the reality of her appearance she wore a disguise but her womanhood was more manifest in it than in her feminine garb it attracted the bold glances of these men if there were any possible decency among them this outrageous bandit costume rendered it null how could she ever continue to wear it would not something good and sacred within her be sullied by a constant exposure to the effect she had upon these vile border men she did not think it could while she loved jim cleve and with thought of him came a mighty throb of her heart to assure her that nothing mattered if only she could save him  upon the return trip up the gulch joan found men in sight leading horses chopping wood stretching arms in cabin doors joan avoided riding near them yet even at a distance she was aware of their gaze one rowdy half hidden by a window curved hands round his mouth and called softly hullo sweetheart  joan was ashamed that she could feel insulted she was amazed at the temper which seemed roused in her this border had caused her feelings she had never dreamed possible to her avoiding the trail she headed for the other side of the gulch there were clumps of willows along the brook through which she threaded a way looking for a good place to cross the horse snorted for water apparently she was not going to find any better crossing so she turned the horse into a narrow lane through the willows and dismounting on a mossy bank she slipped the bridle so the horse could drink  suddenly she became aware that she was not alone but she saw no one in front of her or on the other side of her horse then she turned jim cleve was in the act of rising from his knees he had a towel in his hand his face was wet he stood no more than ten steps from her  joan could not have repressed a little cry to save her life the surprise was tremendous she could not move a finger she expected to hear him call her name  cleve stared at her his face in the morning light was as drawn and white as that of a corpse only his eyes seemed alive and they were flames a lightning flash of scorn leaped to them he only recognized in her a woman and his scorn was for the creature that bandit garb proclaimed her to be a sad and bitter smile crossed his face and then it was followed by an expression that was a lash upon joans bleeding spirit he looked at her shapely person with something of the brazen and evil glance that had been so revolting to her in the eyes of those ruffians that was the unexpectedthe impossiblein connection with jim cleve how could she stand there under itand live  she jerked at the bridle and wading blindly across the brook she mounted somehow and rode with blurred sight back to the cabin kells appeared busy with men outside and did not accost her she fled to her cabin and barricaded the door  then she hid her face on her bed covered herself to shut out the light and lay there brokenhearted what had been that other thing she had imagined was shamethat shrinking and burning she had suffered through kells and his men what was that compared to this awful thing a brand of redhot pitch blacker and bitterer than death had been struck brutally across her soul by the man she lovedwhom she would have died to save jim cleve had seen in her only an abandoned creature of the camps his sad and bitter smile had been for the thought that he could have loved anything of her sex his scorn had been for the betrayed youth and womanhood suggested by her appearance and then the thing that struck into joans heart was the fact that her grace and charm of person revealed by this costume forced upon her had aroused jim cleves first response to the evil surrounding him the first call to that baseness he must be assimilating from these border ruffians that he could look at her so the girl he had loved joans agony lay not in the circumstance of his being as mistaken in her character as he had been in her identity but that she of all women had to be the one who made him answer like kells and gulden and all those ruffians to the instincts of a beast  oh hed been drunkhe was drunk whispered joan he isnt to be blamed hes not my old jim hes sufferinghes changedhe doesnt care what could i expectstanding there like a hussy before himin thisthis indecent rig i must see him i must tell him if he recognized me nowand i had no chance to tell him why im herewhy i look like thisthat i love himam still goodand true to himif i couldnt tell him idid shoot myself  joan sobbed out the final words and then broke down and when the spell had exercised its sway leaving her limp and shaken and weak she was the better for it slowly calmness returned so that she could look at her wild and furious rush from the spot where she had faced jim cleve at the storm of shame ending in her collapse she realized that if she had met jim cleve here in the dress in which she had left home there would have been the same shock of surprise and fear and love she owed part of that breakdown to the suspense she had been under and then the suddenness of the meeting looking back at her agitation she felt that it had been naturalthat if she could only tell the truth to jim cleve the situation was not impossible but the meeting and all following it bore tremendous revelation of how through all this wild experience she had learned to love jim cleve but for his reckless flight and her blind pursuit and then the anxiety fear pain toil and despair she would never have known her womans heart and its capacity for love     11  following that meeting with all its power to change and strengthen joan there were uneventful days in which she rode the gulch trails and grew able to stand the jests and glances of the bandits gang she thought she saw and heard everything yet insulated her true self in a callous and unreceptive aloofness from all that affronted her  the days were uneventful because while always looking for jim cleve she never once saw him several times she heard his name mentioned he was here and thereat beards off in the mountains but he did not come to kellss cabin which fact joan gathered had made kells anxious he did not want to lose cleve joan peered from her covert in the evenings and watched for jim and grew weary of the loud talk and laughter the gambling and smoking and drinking when there seemed no more chance of cleves coming then joan went to bed  on these occasions joan learned that kells was passionately keen to gamble that he was a weak hand at cards an honest gambler and strangely enough a poor loser moreover when he lost he drank heavily and under the influence of drink he was dangerous there were quarrels when curses rang throughout the cabin when guns were drawn but whatever kellss weaknesses might be he was strong and implacable in the governing of these men  that night when gulden strode into the cabin was certainly not uneventful for joan sight of him sent a chill to her marrow while a strange thrill of fire inflamed her was that great hulk of a gorilla prowling about to meet jim cleve joan thought that it might be the worse for him if he were then she shuddered a little to think that she had already been influenced by the wildness around her  gulden appeared well and strong and but for the bandage on his head would have been as she remembered him he manifested interest in the gambling of the players by surly grunts presently he said something to kells  what queried the bandit sharply wheeling the better to see gulden  the noise subsided one gamester laughed knowingly  lend me a sack of dust asked gulden  kellss face showed amaze and then a sudden brightness  what you want gold from me  yes ill pay it back  gulden i wasnt doubting that but does your asking mean youve taken kindly to my proposition  you can take it that way growled gulden i want gold im mighty glad gulden replied kells and he looked as if he meant it i need you we ought to get along here  he handed a small buckskin sack to gulden someone made room for him on the other side of the table and the game was resumed it was interesting to watch them gamble red pearce had a scale at his end of the table and he was always measuring and weighing out golddust the value of the gold appeared to be fifteen dollars to the ounce but the real value of money did not actuate the gamblers they spilled the dust on the table and ground as if it were as common as sand still there did not seem to be any great quantity of gold in sight evidently these were not profitable times for the bandits more than once joan heard them speak of a gold strike as honest people spoke of good fortune and these robbers could only have meant that in case of a rich strike there would be gold to steal gulden gambled as he did everything else at first he won and then he lost and then he borrowed more from kells to win again he paid back as he had borrowed and lost and wonwithout feeling he had no excitement joans intuition convinced her that if gulden had any motive at all in gambling it was only an antagonism to men of his breed gambling was a contest a kind of fight  most of the men except gulden drank heavily that night there had been fresh liquor come with the last packtrain many of them were drunk when the game broke up red pearce and wood remained behind with kells after the others had gone and pearce was clever enough to cheat kells before he left  bossthet there red doublecrossed you said bate wood  kells had lost heavily and he was under the influence of drink he drove wood out of the cabin cursing him sullenly then he put in place the several bars that served as a door of his cabin after that he walked unsteadily around and all about his action and manner that was not aimless seemed to be dark and intermittent staring toward joans cabin she felt sickened again with this new aspect of her situation but she was not in the least afraid of kells she watched him till he approached her door and then she drew back a little he paused before the blanket as if he had been impelled to halt from fear he seemed to be groping in thought then he cautiously and gradually by degrees drew aside the blanket he could not see joan in the darkness but she saw him plainly he fumbled at the poles and finding that he could not budge them he ceased trying there was nothing forceful or strong about him such as was manifest when he was sober he stood there a moment breathing heavily in a kind of forlorn undecided way and then he turned back joan heard him snap the lanterns the lights went out and all grew dark and silent  next morning at breakfast he was himself again and if he had any knowledge whatever of his actions while he was drunk he effectually concealed it from joan  later when joan went outside to take her usual morning exercise she was interested to see a rider tearing up the slope on a foamflecked horse men shouted at him from the cabins and then followed without hats or coats bate wood dropped joans saddle and called to kells the bandit came hurriedly out  blicky he exclaimed and then he swore under his breath in elation  shore is blicky said wood and his unusually mild eyes snapped with a glint unpleasant for joan to see  the arrival of this blicky appeared to be occasion for excitement and joan recalled the name as belonging to one of kellss trusted men he swung his leg and leaped from his saddle as the horse plunged to a halt blicky was a lean bronzed young man scarcely out of his teens but there were years of hard life in his face he slapped the dust in little puffs from his gloves at sight of kells he threw the gloves aloft and took no note of them when they fell strike he called piercingly  no ejaculated kells intensely  bate wood let out a whoop which was answered by the men hurrying up the slope  been onfor weeks panted blicky its big cant tell how big me an jesse smith an handy oliver hit a new roadover here fifty miles as a crow fliesa hundred by trail we was plumb surprised an when we met packtrains an riders an prairieschooners an a stagecoach we knew there was doins over in the bear mountain range when we came to the edge of the diggins an seen a whalin big camplike a beehivejesse an handy went on to get the lay of the land an i hit the trail back to you ive been acomin on an off since before sundown yesterday jesse gave one look an then hollered he said tell jack its big an he wants to plan big well be back there in a day or so with all details  joan watched kells intently while he listened to this breathless narrative of a gold strike and she was repelled by the singular flash of brightnessa radiancethat seemed to be in his eyes and on his face he did not say a word but his men shouted hoarsely around blicky he walked a few paces to and fro with hands strongly clenched his lips slightly parted showing teeth closeshut like those of a mastiff he looked eager passionate cunning hard as steel and that strange brightness of elation slowly shaded to a dark brooding menace suddenly he wheeled to silence the noisy men  wherere pearce and gulden do they know he demanded  reckon no one knows but whos right here replied blicky  red an gul are sleepin off last nights luck said bate wood  have any of you seen young cleve kells went on his voice rang quick and sharp  no one spoke and presently kells cracked his fist into his open hand  come on get the gang together at beards boys the time weve been gambling on has come jesse smith saw 49 and 51 he wouldnt send me word like thisunless there was hell to pay come on  he strode off down the slope with the men close around him and they met other men on the way all of whom crowded into the group jostling eager gesticulating  joan was left alone she felt considerably perturbed especially at kellss sharp inquiry for jim cleve kells might persuade him to join that bandit legion these men made joan think of wolves with kells the keen and savage leader no one had given a thought to blickys horse and that neglect in border men was a sign of unusual preoccupation the horse was in bad shape joan took off his saddle and bridle and rubbed the dustcaked lather from his flanks and led him into the corral then she fetched a bucket of water and let him drink sparingly a little at a time  joan did not take her ride that morning anxious and curious she waited for the return of kells but he did not come all afternoon joan waited and watched and saw no sign of him or any of the other men she knew kells was forging with redhot iron and blood that organization which she undesignedly had given a namethe border legion it would be a terrible legion of that she was assured kells was the evil genius to create an unparalleled scheme of crime this wild and remote border with its inaccessible fastness for hidingplaces was the place all that was wanting was the time which evidently had arrived she remembered how her uncle had always claimed that the bear mountain range would see a gold strike which would disrupt the whole west and amaze the world and blicky had said a big strike had been on for weeks kellss prophecy of the wild life joan would see had not been without warrant she had already seen enough to whiten her hair she thought yet she divined her experience would shrink in comparison with what was to come always she lived in the future she spent sleeping and waking hours in dreams thoughts actions broodings over all of which hung an everpresent shadow of suspense when would she meet jim cleve again when would he recognize her what would he do what could she do would kells be a devil or a man at the end was there any justification of her haunting fear of guldenof her suspicion that she alone was the cause of his attitude toward kellsof her horror at the unshakable presentiment and fancy that he was a gorilla and meant to make off with her these and a thousand other fears some groundless but many real and present besieged joan and left her little peace what would happen next  toward sunset she grew tired of waiting and hungry besides so she went into the cabin and prepared her own meal about dark kells strode in and it took but a glance for joan to see that matters had not gone to his liking the man seemed to be burning inwardly sight of joan absolutely surprised him evidently in the fever of this momentous hour he had forgotten his prisoner then whatever his obsession he looked like a man whose eyes were gladdened at sight of her and who was sorry to behold her there he apologized that her supper had not been provided for her and explained that he had forgotten the men had been crazyhard to managethe issue was not yet settled he spoke gently suddenly he had that thoughtful mien which joan had become used to associating with weakness in him  i wish i hadnt dragged you here he said taking her hands its too late i cant lose you but theother wayisnt too late  what way what do you mean asked joan  girl will you ride off with me tonight he whispered hoarsely i swear ill marry youand become an honest man tomorrow will be too late will you  joan shook her head she was sorry for him when he talked like this he was not kells the bandit she could not resist a strange agitation at the intensity of his emotion one moment he had entereda bandit leader planning blood murder the next as his gaze found her he seemed weakened broken in the shaking grip of a hopeless love for her  speak joan he said with his hands tightening and his brow clouding  no kells she replied  why because im a redhanded bandit  no because ii dont love you  but wouldnt you rather be my wifeand have me honestthan become a slave here eventually abandoned toto gulden and his cave and his rope kellss voice rose as that other side of him gained dominance  yes i would but i know youll never harm meor abandon me toto that gulden  how do you know he cried with the blood thick at his temples  because youre no beast any more and youyou do love me  kells thrust her from him so fiercely that she nearly fell  ill get over it thenlook out he said with dark bitterness  with that he waved her back apparently ordering her to her cabin and turned to the door through which the deep voices of men sounded nearer and nearer  joan stumbled in the darkness up the rude steps to her room and softly placing the poles in readiness to close her door she composed herself to watch and wait the keen edge of her nerves almost amounting to pain told her that this night of such moment for kells would be one of singular strain and significance for her but why she could not fathom she felt herself caught by the changing tide of eventsa tide that must sweep her on to flood kells had gone outside the strong deep voices grew less distinct evidently the men were walking away in her suspense joan was disappointed presently however they returned they had been walking to and fro after a few moments kells entered alone the cabin was now so dark that joan could barely distinguish the bandit then he lighted the lanterns he hung up several on the wall and placed two upon the table from somewhere among his effects he produced a small book and a pencil these with a heavy goldmounted gun he laid on the table before the seat he manifestly meant to occupy that done he began a slow pacing up and down the room his hands behind his back his head bent in deep and absorbing thought what a dark sinister plotting figure joan had seen many men in different attitudes of thought but here was a man whose mind seemed to give forth intangible yet terrible manifestations of evil the inside of that gloomy cabin took on another aspect there was a meaning in the saddles and bridles and weapons on the wall that book and pencil and gun seemed to contain the dark deeds of wild men and all about the bandit hovered a power sinister in its menace to the unknown and distant toilers for gold  kells lifted his head as if listening and then the whole manner of the man changed the burden that weighed upon him was thrown aside like a general about to inspect a line of soldiers kells faced the door keen stern commanding the heavy tread of booted men the clink of spurs the low muffled sound of voices warned joan that the gang had arrived would jim cleve be among them  joan wanted a better position in which to watch and listen she thought a moment and then carefully felt her way around to the other side of the steps and here sitting down with her feet hanging over the drop she leaned against the wall and through a chink between the logs had a perfect view of the large cabin the men were filing in silent and intense joan counted twentyseven in all they appeared to fall into two groups and it was significant that the larger group lined up on the side nearest kells and the smaller back of gulden he had removed the bandage and with a raw red blotch where his right ear had been shot away he was hideous there was some kind of power emanating from him but it was not that which was so keenly vital and impelling in kells it was brute ferocity dominating by sheer physical force in any but muscular clash between kells and gulden the latter must lose the men back of gulden were a bearded checkshirted heavily armed group the worst of that bad lot all the younger cleanercut men like red pearce and frenchy and beady jones and williams and the scout blicky were on the other side there were two factions here yet scarcely an antagonism except possibly in the case of kells joan felt that the atmosphere was supercharged with suspense and fatality and possibilityand anything might happen to her great joy jim cleve was not present  wherere beard and wood queried kells  workin over beards sick hoss replied pearce theyll show up by an by anythin you say goes with them you know  did you find young cleve  no he camps up in the timber somewheres reckon hell be along too  kells sat down at the head of the table and taking up the little book he began to finger it while his pale eyes studied the men before him  we shuffled the deck pretty well over at beards he said now for the deal who wants cards ive organized my border legion ill have absolute control whether therere ten men or a hundred now whose names go down in my book  red pearce stepped up and labored over the writing of his name blicky jones williams and others followed suit they did not speak but each shook hands with the leader evidently kells exacted no oath but accepted each mans free action and his word of honor there was that about the bandit which made such action as binding as ties of blood he did not want men in his legion who had not loyalty to him he seemed the kind of leader to whom men would be true  kells say them conditions over again requested one of the men less eager to hurry with the matter  at this juncture joan was at once thrilled and frightened to see jim cleve enter the cabin he appeared whiter of face almost ghastly and his piercing eyes swept the room from kells to gulden from men to men then he leaned against the wall indistinct in the shadow kells gave no sign that he had noted the advent of cleve  im the leader replied kells deliberately ill make the plans ill issue orders no jobs without my knowledge equal shares in goldman to man your word to stand by me  a muttering of approval ran through the listening group  reckon ill join said the man who had wished the conditions repeated with that he advanced to the table and apparently not being able to write he made his mark in the book kells wrote the name below the other men of this contingent one by one complied with kellss requirements this action left gulden and his group to be dealt with  gulden are you still on the fence demanded kells coolly  the giant strode stolidly forward to the table as always before to joan he seemed to be a ponderous hulk slow heavy plodding with a mind to match  kells if we can agree ill join he said in his sonorous voice  you can bet you wont join unless we do agree snapped kells butsee here gulden lets be friendly the border is big enough for both of us i want you i need you still if we cant agree lets not split and be enemies how about it  another muttering among the men attested to the good sense and good will of kellss suggestion  tell me what youre going to dohow youll operate replied gulden  keils had difficulty in restraining his impatience and annoyance  whats that to you or any of you he queried you all know im the man to think of things thats been proved first it takes brains ill furnish them then it takes execution you and pearce and the gang will furnish that what more do you need to know  howre you going to operate persisted gulden  kells threw up both hands as if it was useless to argue or reason with this desperado  all right ill tell you he replied listen i cant say what definite plans ill make till jesse smith reports and then when i get on the diggings but heres a working basis now dont miss a word of this guldennor any of you men well pack our outfits down to this gold strike well build cabins on the outskirts of the town and we wont hang together the gang will be spread out most of you must make a bluff at digging gold be like other miners get in with cliques and clans dig drink gamble like the rest of them beard will start a gamblingplace red pearce will find some other kind of work ill buy up claimsemploy miners to work them ill disguise myself and get in with the influential men and have a voice in matters youll all be scouts youll come to my cabin at night to report well not tackle any little jobs miners going out with fifty or a hundred pounds of goldthe wagonsthe stagecoachthese well have timed to rights and whoever i detail on the job will hold them up you must all keep sober if thats possible you must all absolutely trust to my judgment you must all go masked while on a job you must never speak a word that might direct suspicion to you in this way we may work all summer without detection the border legion will become mysterious and famous it will appear to be a large number of men operating all over the more secretive we are the more powerful the effect on the diggings in goldcamps when theres a strike all men are mad they suspect each other they cant organize we shall have them helpless and in short if its as rich a strike as looks due here in these hills before winter we can pack out all the gold our horses can carry  kells had begun under restraint but the sound of his voice the liberation of his great idea roused him to a passion the man radiated with passion this then was his dreamthe empire he aspired to  he had a powerful effect upon his listeners except gulden and it was evident to joan that the keen bandit was conscious of his influence gulden however showed nothing that he had not already showed he was always a strange dominating figure he contested the relations of things kells watched himthe men watched himand jim cleves piercing eyes glittered in the shadow fixed upon that massive face manifestly gulden meant to speak but in his slowness there was no laboring no pause from emotion he had an idea and it moved like he moved  dead men tell no tales the words boomed deep from his cavernous chest a mutter that was a rumble with something almost solemn in its note and certainly menacing breathing murder as kells had propounded his ideas revealing his power to devise a remarkable scheme and his passion for gold so gulden struck out with the driving inhuman bloodlust that must have been the twist the knot the clot in his brain kells craved notoriety and gold gulden craved to kill in the silence that followed his speech these wild border ruffians judged him measured him understood him and though some of them grew farther aloof from him more of them sensed the safety that hid in his terrible implication  but kells rose against him  gulden you mean when we steal goldto leave only dead men behind he queried with a hiss in his voice  the giant nodded grimly  but only fools killunless in selfdefense declared kells passionately  wed last longer replied gulden imperturbably  nono wed never last so long killings rouse a miningcamp after a whilegold fever or no that means a vigilante band  we can belong to the vigilantes just as well as to your legion said gulden  the effect of this was to make gulden appear less of a fool than kells supposed him the ruffians nodded to one another they stirred restlessly they were animated by a strange and provocative influence even red pearce and the others caught its subtlety it was evil predominating in evil hearts blood and death loomed like a shadow here the keen kells saw the change working toward a transformation and he seemed craftily fighting something within him that opposed this cold ruthlessness of his men  gulden suppose i dont see it your way he asked  then i wont join your legion  what will you do  ill take the men who stand by me and go clean up that goldcamp  from the fleeting expression on kellss face joan read that he knew guldens project would defeat his own and render both enterprises fatal  gulden i dont want to lose you he said  you wont lose me if you see this thing right replied gulden youve got the brains to direct us but kells youre losing your nerve its this girl youve got here  gulden spoke without rancor or fear or feeling of any kind he merely spoke the truth and it shook kells with an almost ungovernable fury  joan saw the green glare of his eyeshis gray working facethe flutter of his hand she had an almost superhuman insight into the workings of his mind she knew that thenhe was fighting whether or not to kill gulden on the spot and she recognized that this was the time when kells must kill gulden or from that moment see a gradual diminishing of his power on the border but kells did not recognize that crucial height of his career his struggle with his fury and hate showed that the thing uppermost in his mind was the need of conciliating gulden and thus regaining a hold over the men  gulden suppose we waive the question till were on the grounds he suggested  waive nothing its one or the other with me declared gulden  do you want to be leader of this border legion went on kells deliberately  no  then what do you want  gulden appeared at a loss for an instant reply i want plenty to do he replied presently i want to be in on everything i want to be free to kill a man when i like  when you like retorted kells and added a curse then as if by magic his dark face cleared and there was infinite depth and craftiness in him his opposition and that hint of hate and loathing which detached him from gulden faded from his bearing gulden ill split the difference between us ill leave you free to do as you like but all the othersevery manmust take orders from me  gulden reached out a huge hand his instant acceptance evidently amazed kells and the others  let her rip gulden exclaimed he shook kellss hand and then laboriously wrote his name in the little book  in that moment gulden stood out alone in the midst of wild abandoned men what were kells and this legion to him what was the stealing of more or less gold  free to do as you like except fight my men said kells thats understood  if they dont pick a fight with me added the giant and he grinned  one by one his followers went through with the simple observances that kellss personality made a serious and binding compact  anybody else called kells glancing round the somberness was leaving his face  heres jim cleve said pearce pointing toward the wall  hello youngster come here im wanting you bad said kells  cleve sauntered out of the shadow and his glittering eyes were fixed on gulden there was an instant of waiting gulden looked at cleve then kells quickly strode between them  say i forgot you fellows had trouble he said he attended solely to gulden you cant renew your quarrel now gulden weve all fought together more or less and then been good friends i want cleve to join us but not against your ill will how about it  ive no ill will replied the giant and the strangeness of his remark lay in its evident truth but i wont stand to lose my other ear  then the ruffians guffawed in hoarse mirth gulden however did not seem to see any humor in his remark kells laughed with the rest even cleves white face relaxed into a semblance of a smile  thats good were getting together declared kells then he faced cleve all about him expressive of elation of assurance of power jim will you draw cards in this deal  whats the deal asked cleve  then in swift eloquent speech kells launched the idea of his border legion its advantages to any loosefooted young outcast and he ended his brief talk with much the same argument he had given joan back there in her covert joan listened and watched mindful of the great need of controlling her emotions the instant jim cleve had stalked into the light she had been seized by a spasm of trembling  kells i dont care two straws one way or another replied cleve  the bandit appeared nonplussed you dont care whether you join my legion or whether you dont  not a damn was the indifferent answer  then do me a favor went on kells join to please me well be good friends youre in bad out here on the border you might as well fall in with us  id rather go alone  but you wont last  its a lot i care  the bandit studied the reckless white face see here clevehavent you got the nerve to be badthoroughly bad  cleve gave a start as if he had been stung joan shut her eyes to blot out what she saw in his face kells had used part of the very speech with which she had driven jim cleve to his ruin and those words galvanized him the fatality of all this joan hated herself those very words of hers would drive this maddened and heartbroken boy to join kellss band she knew what to expect from jim even before she opened her eyes yet when she did open them it was to see him transformed and blazing  then kells either gave way to leaping passion or simulated it in the interest of his cunning  cleve youre going down for a woman he queried with that sharp mocking ring in his voice  if you dont shut up youll get there first replied cleve menacingly  bah why do you want to throw a gun on me im your friend youre sick youre like a poisoned pup i say if youve got nerve you wont quit youll take a run for your money youll see life youll fight youll win some gold there are other women once i thought i would quit for a woman but i didnt i never found the right one till i had gone to hellout here on this border if youve got nerve show me be a man instead of a crazy youngster spit out the poison tell it before us all some girl drove you to us  yesa girl replied cleve hoarsely as if goaded  its too late to go back  too late  theres nothing left but wild life that makes you forget  nothing only icant forget he panted  cleve was in a torture of memory of despair of weakness joan saw how kells worked upon jims feelings he was only a hopeless passionate boy in the hands of a strong implacable man he would be like wax to a sculptors touch jim would bend to this bandits will and through his very tenacity of love and memory be driven farther on the road to drink to gaming and to crime  joan got to her feet and with all her womans soul uplifting and inflaming her she stood ready to meet the moment that portended  kells made a gesture of savage violence show your nerve join with me youll make a name on this border that the west will never forget  that last hint of desperate fame was the crafty bandits best trump and it won cleve swept up a weak and nervous hand to brush the hair from his damp brow the keenness the fire the aloofness had departed from him he looked shaken as if by something that had been pointed out as his own cowardice  sure kells he said recklessly let me in the game andby godill playthe hand out he reached for the pencil and bent over the book  wait oh wait cried joan the passion of that moment the consciousness of its fateful portent and her situation as desperate as cleves gave her voice a singularly high and piercingly sweet intensity she glided from behind the blanketout of the shadowinto the glare of the lanternsto face kells and cleve  kells gave one astounded glance at her and then divining her purpose he laughed thrillingly and mockingly as if the sight of her was a spur as if her courage was a thing to admire to permit and to regret  cleve my wife dandy dale he said suave and cool let her persuade youone way or another  the presence of a woman however disguised following her singular appeal transformed cleve he stiffened erect and the flush died out of his face leaving it whiter than ever and the eyes that had grown dull quickened and began to burn joan felt her cheeks blanch she all but fainted under that gaze but he did not recognize her though he was strangely affected  wait she cried again and she held to that high voice so different from her natural tone ive been listening ive heard all thats been said dont join this border legion youre youngand still honest for gods sakedont go the way of these men kells will make you a bandit go homeboygo home  who are youto speak to me of honestyof home cleve demanded  im only aa woman but i can feel how wrong you are go back to that girlwhowho drove you to the border she must repent in a day youll be too late oh boy go home girls never know their mindstheir hearts maybe your girlloved you oh maybe her heart is breaking now  a strong muscular ripple went over cleve ending in a gesture of fierce protest was it pain her words caused or disgust that such as she dared mention the girl he had loved joan could not tell she only knew that cleve was drawn by her presence fascinated and repelled subtly responding to the spirit of her doubting what he heard and believing with his eyes  you beg me not to become a bandit he asked slowly as if revolving a strange idea  oh i implore you  why  i told you because youre still good at heart youve only been wild because  are you the wife of kells he flashed at her  a reply seemed slowly wrenched from joans reluctant lips no  the denial left a silence behind it the truth that all knew when spoken by her was a kind of shock the ruffians gaped in breathless attention kells looked on with a sardonic grin but he had grown pale and upon the face of cleve shone an immeasurable scorn  not his wife exclaimed cleve softly  his tone was unendurable to joan she began to shrink a flame curled within her how he must hate any creature of her sex  and you appeal to me he went on suddenly a weariness came over him the complexity of women was beyond him almost he turned his back upon her i reckon such as you cant keep me from kellsor bloodor hell  then youre a narrowsouled weaklingborn to crime she burst out in magnificent wrath for however appearances are against mei am a good woman  that stunned him just as it drew kells upright white and watchful cleve seemed long in grasping its significance his face was half averted then he turned slowly all strung and his hands clutched quiveringly at the air no man of coolness and judgment would have addressed him or moved a step in that strained moment all expected some such action as had marked his encounter with luce and gulden  then cleves gaze in unmistakable meaning swept over joans person how could her appearance and her appeal be reconciled one was a lie and his burning eyes robbed joan of spirit  he forced me toto wear these she faltered im his prisoner im helpless  with catlike agility cleve leaped backward so that he faced all the men and when his hands swept to a level they held gleaming guns his utter abandon of daring transfixed these bandits in surprise as much as fear kells appeared to take most to himself the menace  i crawl he said huskily she speaks the gods truth but you cant help matters by killing me maybe shed be worse off  he expected this wild boy to break loose yet his wit directed him to speak the one thing calculated to check cleve  oh dont shoot moaned joan  you go outside ordered cleve get on a horse and lead another near the door go ill take you away from this  both temptation and terror assailed joan surely that venture would mean only death to jim and worse for her she thrilled at the thoughtat the possibility of escapeat the strange front of this erstwhile nerveless boy but she had not the courage for what seemed only desperate folly  ill stay she whispered you go  hurry woman  no no  do you want to stay with this bandit  oh i must  then you love him  all the fire of joans heart flared up to deny the insult and all her womans cunning fought to keep back words that inevitably must lead to revelation she drooped unable to hold up under her shame yet strong to let him think vilely of her for his sake that way she had a barest chance  get out of my sight he ejaculated thickly id have fought for you  again that white weary scorn radiated from him joan bit her tongue to keep from screaming how could she live under this torment it was she joan randle that had earned that scorn whether he knew her or not she shrank back step by step almost dazed sick with a terrible inward coldness blinded by scalding tears she found her door and stumbled in  kells im what you called me she heard cleves voice strangely far off theres no excuse unless im not just right in my head about women overlook my break or dontas you like but if you want me im ready for your border legion     12  those bitter words of cleves as if he mocked himself were the last joan heard and they rang in her ears and seemed to reverberate through her dazed mind like a knell of doom she lay there all blackness about her weighed upon by an insupportable burden and she prayed that day might never dawn for her a nightmare of oblivion ended at last with her eyes opening to the morning light  she was cold and stiff she had lain uncovered all the long hours of night she had not moved a finger since she had fallen upon the bed crushed by those bitter words with which cleve had consented to join kellss legion since then joan felt that she had lived years she could not remember a single thought she might have had during those black hours nevertheless a decision had been formed in her mind and it was that today she would reveal herself to jim cleve if it cost both their lives death was infinitely better than the suspense and fear and agony she had endured and as for jim it would at least save him from crime  joan got up a little dizzy and unsteady upon her feet her hands appeared clumsy and shaky all the blood in her seemed to surge from heart to brain and it hurt her to breathe removing her mask she bathed her face and combed her hair at first she conceived an idea to go out without her face covered but she thought better of it cleves reckless defiance had communicated itself to her she could not now be stopped  kells was gay and excited that morning he paid her compliments he said they would soon be out of this lonely gulch and she would see the sight of her lifea gold strike she would see men wager a fortune on the turn of a card lose laugh and go back to the digging he said he would take her to sacramento and frisco and buy her everything any girl could desire he was wild voluble unreasoningobsessed by the anticipated fulfilment of his dream  it was rather late in the morning and there were a dozen or more men in and around the cabin all as excited as kells preparations were already under way for the expected journey to the goldfield packs were being laid out overhauled and repacked saddles and bridles and weapons were being worked over clothes were being awkwardly mended horses were being shod and the job was as hard and disagreeable for men as for horses whenever a rider swung up the slope and one came every now and then all the robbers would leave off their tasks and start eagerly for the newcomer the name jesse smith was on everybodys lips any hour he might be expected to arrive and corroborate blickys alluring tale  joan saw or imagined she saw that the glances in the eyes of these men were yellow like gold fire she had seen miners and prospectors whose eyes shone with a strange glory of light that gold inspired but never as those of kellss bandit legion presently joan discovered that despite the excitement her effect upon them was more marked then ever and by a difference that she was quick to feel but she could not tell what this difference washow their attitude had changed then she set herself the task of being useful first she helped bate wood he was roughly kind she had not realized that there was sadness about her until he whispered dont be downcast miss mebbe itll come out right yet that amazed joan then his mysterious winks and glances the sympathy she felt in him all attested to some kind of a change she grew keen to learn but she did not know how she felt the change in all the men then she went to pearce and with all a womans craft she exaggerated the silent sadness that had brought quick response from wood red pearce was even quicker he did not seem to regard her proximity as that of a feminine thing which roused the devil in him pearce could not be other than coarse and vulgar but there was pity in him joan sensed pity and some other quality still beyond her this lieutenant of the bandit kells was just as mysterious as wood joan mended a great jagged rent in his buckskin shirt pearce appeared proud of her work he tried to joke he said amiable things then as she finished he glanced furtively round he pressed her hand i had a sister once he whispered and then with a dark and baleful hate kellshell get his over in the goldcamp  joan turned away from pearce still more amazed some strange deep undercurrent was working here there had been unmistakable hate for kells in his dark look and a fierce implication in his portent of fatality what had caused this sudden impersonal interest in her situation what was the meaning of the subtle animosity toward the bandit leader was there no honor among evil men banded together for evil deeds were jealousy ferocity hate and faithlessness fostered by this wild and evil border life ready at an instants notice to break out joan divined the vain and futile and tragical nature of kells great enterprise it could not succeed it might bring a few days or weeks of fame of bloodstained gold of riotous gambling but by its very nature it was doomed it embraced failure and death  joan went from man to man keener now on the track of this inexplicable change sweetly and sadly friendly to each and it was not till she encountered the little frenchman that the secret was revealed frenchy was of a different race deep in the fiber of his being inculcated a sentiment a feeling long submerged in the darkness of a wicked life and now that something came fleeting out of the depthsand it was respect for a woman to joan it was a flash of light yesterday these ruffians despised her today they respected her so they had believed what she had so desperately flung at jim cleve they believed her good they pitied her they respected her they responded to her effort to turn a boy back from a bad career they were bandits desperados murderers lost but each remembered in her a mother or a sister what each might have felt or done had he possessed her as kells possessed her did not alter the case as it stood a strange inconsistency of character made them hate kells for what they might not have hated in themselves her appeal to cleve her outburst of truth her youth and misfortune had discovered to each a human quality as in kells something of nobility still lingered a ghost among his ruined ideals so in the others some goodness remained joan sustained an uplifting divinationno man was utterly bad then came the hideous image of the giant gulden the utter absence of soul in him and she shuddered then came the thought of jim cleve who had not believed her who had bitterly made the fatal step who might in the strange reversion of his character be beyond influence  and it was at the precise moment when this thought rose to counteract the hope revived by the changed attitude of the men that joan looked out to see jim cleve sauntering up careless untidy a cigarette between his lips blue blotches on his white face upon him the stamp of abandonment joan suffered a contraction of heart that benumbed her breast she stood a moment battling with herself she was brave enough desperate enough to walk straight up to cleve remove her mask and say i am joan but that must be a last resource she had no plan yet she might force an opportunity to see cleve alone  a shout rose above the hubbub of voices a tall man was pointing across the gulch where dustclouds showed above the willows men crowded round him all gazing in the direction of his hand all talking at once  jesse smiths hoss i swear shouted the tall man kells come out here  kells appeared dark and eager at the door and nimbly he leaped to the excited group pearce and wood and others followed  whats up called the bandit hello whos that riding bareback  hes shore cuttin the wind said wood  blicky exclaimed the tall man kells theres news i seen jesses hoss  kells let out a strange exultant cry the excited talk among the men gave place to a subdued murmur then subsided blicky was running a horse up the road hanging low over him like an indian he clattered to the bench scattered the men in all directions the fiery horse plunged and pounded blicky was gray of face and wild of aspect  jesses come he yelled hoarsely at kells he jest fell off his hossall in he wants youan all the gang hes seen a million dollars in golddust  absolute silence ensued after that last swift and startling speech it broke to a commingling of yells and shouts blicky wheeled his horse and kells started on a run and there was a stampede and rush after him  joan grasped her opportunity she had seen all this excitement but she had not lost sight of cleve he got up from a log and started after the others joan flew to him grasped him startled him with the suddenness of her onslaught but her tongue seemed cloven to the roof of her mouth her lips weak and mute twice she strove to speak  meet methereamong the pinesright away she whispered with breathless earnestness its lifeor deathfor me  as she released his arm he snatched at her mask but she eluded him  who are you he flashed  kells and his men were piling into the willows leaping the brook hurrying on they had no thought but to get to jesse smith to hear of the gold strike that news to them was as finding gold in the earth was to honest miners  come cried joan she hurried away toward the corner of the cabin then halted to see if he was following he was indeed she ran round behind the cabin out on the slope halting at the first trees cleve came striding after her she ran on beginning to pant and stumble the way he strode the white grimness of him frightened her what would he do again she went on but not running now there were straggling pines and spruces that soon hid the cabins beyond a few rods was a dense clump of pines and she made for that as she reached it she turned fearfully only cleve was in sight she uttered a sob of mingled relief joy and thankfulness she and cleve had not been observed they would be out of sight in this little pine grove at last she could reveal herself tell him why she was there that she loved him that she was as good as ever she had been why was she shaking like a leaf in the wind she saw cleve through a blur he was almost running now involuntarily she fled into the grove it was dark and cool it smelled sweetly of pine there were narrow aisles and little sunlit glades she hurried on till a fallen tree blocked her passage here she turnedshe would waitthe tree was good to lean against there came cleve a dark stalking shadow she did not remember him like that he entered the glade  speak again he said thickly either im drunk or crazy  but joan could not speak she held out hands that shookswept them to her facetore at the mask then with a gasp she stood revealed  if she had stabbed him straight through the heart he could not have been more ghastly joan saw him in all the terrible transfiguration that came over him but she had no conceptions no thought of what constituted that change after that check to her mind came a surge of joy  jim jim its joan she breathed with lips almost mute  joan he gasped and the sound of his voice seemed to be the passing from horrible doubt to certainty  like a panther he leaped at her fastened a powerful hand at the neck of her blouse jerked her to her knees and began to drag her joan fought his iron grasp the twisting and tightening of her blouse choked her utterance he did not look down upon her but she could see him the rigidity of his body set in violence the awful shade upon his face the upstanding hair on his head he dragged her as if she had been an empty sack like a beast he was seeking a dark placea hole to hide her she was strangling a distorted sight made objects dim and now she struggled instinctively suddenly the clutch at her neck loosened gaspingly came the intake of air to her lungs the darkred veil left her eyes she was still upon her knees cleve stood before her like a grayfaced demon holding his gun level ready to fire  pray for your souland mine  jim oh jim will you kill yourself too  yes but pray girlquick  then i pray to godnot for my soulbut just for one more moment of life to tell you jim  cleves face worked and the gun began to waver her reply had been a stroke of lightning into the dark abyss of his jealous agony  joan saw it and she raised her quivering face and she held up her arms to him to tellyoujim she entreated  what he rasped out  that im innocentthat im as gooda girlas ever ever let me tell you oh youre mistakenterribly mistaken  now i know im drunk you joan randle you in that rig you the companion of jack kells not even his wife the jest of these foulmouthed bandits and you say youre innocentgood when you refused to leave him  i was afraid to goafraid youd be killed she moaned beating her breast  it must have seemed madness to him a monstrous nightmare a delirium of drink that joan randle was there on her knees in a brazen male attire lifting her arms to him beseeching him not to spare her life but to believe in her innocence  joan burst into swift broken utterance only listen i trailed you outtwenty miles from hoadley i met roberts he came with me he lamed his horsewe had to camp kells rode down on us he had two men they camped there next morning hekilled robertsmade off with me then he killed his menjust to have mealone to himself we crossed a rangecamped in the canon there he attacked meand ii shot him but i couldnt leave himto die joan hurried on with her narrative gaining strength and eloquence as she saw the weakening of cleve first he said i was his wife to fool that guldenand the others she went on he meant to save me from them but they guessed or found out kells forced me into these bandit clothes hes depraved somehow and i had to wear something kells hasnt harmed meno one has ive influence over him he cant resist it hes tried to force me to marry him and hes tried to give up to his evil intentions but he cant theres good in him i can make him feel it oh he loves me and im not afraid of him any more it has been a terrible time for me jim but im stillthe same girl you knewyou used to  cleve dropped the gun and he waved his hand before his eyes as if to dispel a blindness  but whywhy he asked incredulously why did you leave hoadley thats forbidden you knew the risk  joan gazed steadily up at him to see the whiteness slowly fade out of his face she had imagined it would be an overcoming of pride to betray her love but she had been wrong the moment was so full so overpowering that she seemed dumb he had ruined himself for her and out of that ruin had come the glory of her love perhaps it was all too late but at least he would know that for love of him she had in turn sacrificed herself  jim she whispered and with the first word of that betrayal a thrill a tremble a rush went over her and all her blood seemed hot at her neck and face that night when you kissed me i was furious but the moment you had gone i repented i must havecared for you then but i didnt know remorse seized me and i set out on your trail to save you from yourself and with the pain and fear and terror there was sometimesthethe sweetness of your kisses then i knew i cared and with the added days of suspense and agonyall that told me of your throwing your life awaythere came love such love as otherwise id never have been big enough for i meant to find youto save youto send you home i have found you maybe too late to save your life but not your soul thank god thats why ive been strong enough to hold back kells i love you jim i love you i couldnt tell you enough my heart is bursting say you believe me say you know im goodtrue to youyour joan and kiss melike you did that night when we were such blind fools a boy and a girl who didnt knowand couldnt telloh the sadness of it kiss me jim before idropat your feet if only youbelieve  joan was blinded by tears and whispering she knew not what when cleve broke from his trance and caught her to his breast she was faintinghovering at the border of unconsciousness when his violence held her back from oblivion she seemed wrapped to him and held so tightly there was no breath in her body no motion no stir of pulse that vague dreamy moment passed she heard his husky broken accentsshe felt the pound of his heart against her breast and he began to kiss her as she had begged him to she quickened to thrilling revivifying life and she lifted her face and clung round his neck and kissed him blindly sweetly passionately with all her heart and soul in her lips wanting only one thing in the worldto give that which she had denied him  joan joan joan he murmured when their lips parted am i dreamingdrunkor crazy  oh jim im realyou have me in your arms she whispered dear jimkiss me againand say you believe me  believe you im out of my mind with joy you loved me you followed me andthat idea of mineonly an absurd vile suspicion i might have knownhad i been sane  there oh jim enough of madness weve got to plan remember where we are theres kells and this terrible situation to meet  he stared at her slowly realizing and then it was his turn to shake my god id forgotten ill have to kill you now  a reaction set in if he had any selfcontrol left he lost it and like a boy whose fling into manhood had exhausted his courage he sank beside her and buried his face against her and he cried in a low tense heartbroken way for joan it was terrible to hear him she held his hand to her breast and implored him not to weaken now but he was stricken with remorsehe had run off like a coward he had brought her to this calamityand he could not rise under it joan realized that he had long labored under stress of morbid emotion only a supreme effort could lift him out of it to strong and reasoning equilibrium and that must come from her  she pushed him away from her and held him back where he must see her and whitehot with passionate purpose she kissed him jim cleve if youve nerve enough to be bad youve nerve enough to save the girl who loves youwho belongs to you  he raised his face and it flashed from red to white he caught the subtlety of her antithesis with the very two words which had driven him away under the sting of cowardice she uplifted him and with all that was tender and faithful and passionate in her meaning of surrender she settled at once and forever the doubt of his manhood he arose trembling in every limb like a dog he shook himself his breast heaved the shades of scorn and bitterness and abandon might never have haunted his face in that moment he had passed from the reckless and wild sick rage of a weakling to the stern realizing courage of a man his suffering on this wild border had developed a different fiber of character and at the great moment the climax when his moral force hung balanced between elevation and destruction the woman had called to him and her unquenchable spirit passed into him  theres only one thingto get away he said  yes but thats a terrible risk she replied  weve a good chance now ill get horses we can slip away while theyre all excited  nono i darent risk so much kells would find out at once hed be like a hound on our trail but thats not all ive a horror of gulden i cant explain i feel it he would knowhe would take the trail id never try to escape with gulden in camp jim do you know what hes done  hes a cannibal i hate the sight of him i tried to kill him i wish i had killed him  im never safe while hes near  then i will kill him  hush youll not be desperate unless you have to be listen im safe with kells for the present and hes friendly to you let us wait ill keep trying to influence him i have won the friendship of some of his men well stay with himtravel with him surely wed have a better chance to excape after we reach that goldcamp you must play your part but do it without drinking and fighting i couldnt bear that well see each other somehow well plan then well take the first chance to get away  we might never have a better chance than weve got right now he remonstrated  it may seem so to you but i know i havent watched these ruffians for nothing i tell you gulden has split with kells because of me i dont know how i know and i think id die of terror out on the trail with two hundred miles to goand that gorilla after me  but joan if we once got away gulden would never take you alive said jim earnestly so you neednt fear that  ive uncanny horror of him its as if he were a gorillaand would take me off even if i were dead no jim let us wait let me select the time i can do it trust me oh jim now that ive saved you from being a bandit i can do anything i can fool kells or pearce or woodany of them except gulden  if kells had to choose now between trailing you and rushing for the goldcamp which would he do  hed trail me she said  but kells is crazy over gold he has two passions to steal gold and to gamble with it  that may be but hed go after me first so would gulden we cant ride these hills as they do we dont know the trailsthe water wed get lost wed be caught and somehow i know that gulden and his gang would find us first  youre probably right joan replied cleve but you condemn me to a living death to let you out of my sight with kells or any of them itll be worse almost than my life was before  but jim ill be safe she entreated its the better choice of two evils our lives depend on reason waiting planning and jim i want to live for you  my brave darling to hear you say that he exclaimed with deep emotion when i never expected to see you again but the past is past i begin over from this hour ill be what you wantdo what you want  joan seemed irresistibly drawn to him again and the supplication as she lifted her blushing face and the yielding were perilously sweet  jim kiss me and hold methe wayyou did that night  and it was not joan who first broke that embrace  find my mask she said  cleve picked up his gun and presently the piece of black felt he held it as if it were a deadly thing  put it on me  he slipped the cord over her head and adjusted the mask so the holes came right for her eyes  joan it hides thethe goodness of you he cried no one can see your eyes now no one will look at your face that rig shows yourshows you off so its not decent but o lord im bound to confess how pretty how devilish how seductive you are and i hate it  jim i hate it too but we must stand it try not to shame me any more and now goodby keep watch for meas i will for youall the time  joan broke from him and glided out of the grove away under the straggling pines along the slope she came upon her horse and she led him back to the corral many of the horses had strayed there was no one at the cabin but she saw men striding up the slope kells in the lead she had been fortunate her absence could hardly have been noted she had just strength left to get to her room where she fell upon the bed weak and trembling and dizzy and unutterably grateful at her deliverance from the hateful unbearable falsity of her situation     13  it was afternoon before joan could trust herself sufficiently to go out again and when she did she saw that she attracted very little attention from the bandits  kells had a springy step a bright eye a lifted head and he seemed to be listening perhaps he wasto the music of his sordid dreams joan watched him sometimes with wonder even a banditplotting gold robberies with violence and blood merely means to an endbuilt castles in the air and lived with joy  all that afternoon the bandits left camp in twos and threes each party with pack burros and horses packed as joan had not seen them before on the border shovels and picks and old sieves and pans these swinging or tied in prominent places were evidence that the bandits meant to assume the characters of miners and prospectors they whistled and sang it was a lark the excitement had subsided and the action begun only in kells under his radiance could be felt the dark and sinister plot he was the heart of the machine  by sundown kells pearce wood jim cleve and a robust grizzled bandit jesse smith were left in camp smith was lame from his ride and joan gathered that kells would have left camp but for the fact that smith needed rest he and kells were together all the time talking endlessly joan heard them argue a disputed pointwould the men abide by kellss plan and go by twos and threes into the goldcamp and hide their relations as a larger band kells contended they would and smith had his doubts  jack wait till you see alder creek ejaculated smith wagging his grizzled head three thousand men old an young of all kindsgone goldcrazy alder creek has got californias 49 and 51 cinched to the last hole and the bandit leader rubbed his palms in great glee  that evening they all had supper together in kells cabin bate wood grumbled because he had packed most of his outfit it so chanced that joan sat directly opposite jim cleve and while he ate he pressed her foot with his under the table the touch thrilled joan jim did not glance at her but there was such a change in him that she feared it might rouse kellss curiosity this night however the bandit could not have seen anything except a gleam of yellow he talked he sat at table but did not eat after supper he sent joan to her cabin saying they would be on the trail at daylight joan watched them awhile from her covert they had evidently talked themselves out and kells grew thoughtful smith and pearce went outside apparently to roll their beds on the ground under the porch roof wood who said he was never a good sleeper smoked his pipe and jim cleve spread blankets along the wall in the shadow and and lay down joan could see his eyes shining toward the door of course he was thinking of her but could he see her eyes watching her chance she slipped a hand from behind the curtain and she knew cleve saw it what a comfort that was joans heart swelled all might yet be well jim cleve would be near her while she slept she could sleep now without those dark dreamswithout dreading to awaken to the light again she saw kells pacing the room silent bent absorbed hands behind his back weighted with his burden it was impossible not to feel sorry for him with all his intelligence and cunning power his cause was hopeless joan knew that as she knew so many other things without understanding why she had not yet sounded jesse smith but not a man of all the others was true to kells they would be of his border legion do his bidding revel in their illgotten gains and then when he needed them most be false to him  when joan was awakened her room was shrouded in gray gloom a bustle sound from the big cabin and outside horses stamped and men talked  she sat alone at breakfast and ate by lanternlight it was necessary to take a lantern back to her cabin and she was so long in her preparations there that kells called again somehow she did not want to leave this cabin it seemed protective and private and she feared she might not find such quarters again besides upon the moment of leaving she discovered that she had grown attached to the place where she had suffered and thought and grown so much  kells had put out the lights joan hurried through the cabin and outside the gray obscurity had given way to dawn the air was cold sweet bracing with the touch of mountain purity in it the men except kells were all mounted and the packtrain was in motion kells dragged the rude door into position and then mounting he called to joan to follow she trotted her horse after him down the slope across the brook and through the wet willows and out upon the wide trail she glanced ahead discerning that the third man from her was jim cleve and that fact in the start for alder creek made all the difference in the world  when they rode out of the narrow defile into the valley the sun was rising red and bright in a notch of the mountains clouds hung over distant peaks and the patches of snow in the high canons shone blue and pink smith in the lead turned westward up the valley horses trooped after the cavalcade and had to be driven back there were also cattle in the valley and all these kells left behind like an honest rancher who had no fear for his stock deer stood off with long ears pointed forward watching the horses go by there were flocks of quail and whirring grouse and bounding jackrabbits and occasionally a brace of sneaking coyotes these and the wild flowers and the waving meadowgrass the yellowstemmed willows and the patches of alder all were pleasurable to joans eyes and restful to her mind  smith soon led away from this valley up out of the head of a ravine across a rough rockstrewn ridge down again into a hollow that grew to be a canon the trail was bad part of the time it was the bottom of a boulderstrewn brook where the horses slipped on the wet round stones progress was slow and time passed for joan however it was a relief and the slower they might travel the better she would like it at the end of that journey there were gulden and the others and the goldcamp with its illimitable possibilities for such men  at noon the party halted for a rest the camp site was pleasant and the men were all agreeable during the meal kells found occasion to remark to cleve  say youngster youve brightened up must be because of our prospects over here  not that so much replied cleve i quit the whisky to be honest kells i was almost seeing snakes  im glad you quit when youre drinking youre wild i never yet saw the man who could drink hard and keep his head i cant but i dont drink much  his last remark brought a response in laughter evidently his companions thought he was joking he laughed himself and actually winked at joan  it happened to be cleve whom kells told to saddle joans horse and as joan tried the cinches to see if they were too tight to suit her jims hand came in contact with hers that touch was like a message joan was thrilling all over as she looked at jim but he kept his face averted perhaps he did not trust his eyes  travel was resumed up the canon and continued steadily though leisurely but the trail was so rough and so winding that joan believed the progress did not exceed three miles an hour it was the kind of travel in which a horse could be helped and that entailed attention to the lay of the ground before joan realized the hours were flying the afternoon had waned smith kept on however until nearly dark before halting for camp  the evening camp was a scene of activity and all except joan had work to do she tried to lend a hand but wood told her to rest this she was glad to do when called to supper she had almost fallen asleep after a long days ride the business of eating precluded conversation later however the men began to talk between puffs on their pipes and from the talk no one could have guessed that here was a band of robbers on their way to a gold camp jesse smith had a sore foot and he was compared to a tenderfoot on his first ride smith retaliated in kind every consideration was shown joan and wood particularly appeared assiduous in his desire for her comfort all the men except cleve paid her some kind attention and he of course neglected her because he was afraid to go near her again she felt in red pearce a condemnation of the bandit leader who was dragging a girl over hard trails making her sleep in the open exposing her to danger and to men like himself and gulden in his own estimate pearce like every one of his kind was not so slow as the others  joan watched and listened from her blankets under a leafy tree some few yards from the campfire once kells turned to see how far distant she was and then lowering his voice he told a story the others laughed pearce followed with another and he too took care that joan could not hear they grew closer for the mirth and smith who evidently was a jolly fellow set them to roaring jim cleve laughed with them  say jim youre getting over it remarked kells  over what  kells paused rather embarrassed for a reply as evidently in the humor of the hour he had spoken a thought better left unsaid but there was no more forbidding atmosphere about cleve he appeared to have rounded to goodfellowship after a moody and quarrelsome drinking spell  why over what drove you out hereand gave me a lucky chance at you replied kells with a constrained laugh  oh you mean the girl sure im getting over that except when i drink  tell us jim said kells curiously  aw youll give me the laugh retorted cleve  no we wont unless your storys funny  you can gamble it wasnt funny put in red pearce  they all coaxed him yet none of them except kells was particularly curious it was just that hour when men of their ilk were lazy and comfortable and full fed and goodhumored round the warm blazing campfire  all right replied cleve and apparently for all his complaisance a call upon memory had its pain im from montana rangerider in winter and in summer i prospected saved quite a little money in spite of a fling now and then at faro and whisky yes there was a girl i guess yes she was pretty i had a bad case over her not long ago i left all i hadmoney and gold and thingsin her keeping and i went prospecting again we were to get married on my return i stayed out six months did well and got robbed of all my dust  cleve was telling this fabrication in a matteroffact way growing a little less frank as he proceeded and he paused while he lifted sand and let it drift through his fingers watching it curiously all the men were interested and kells hung on every word  when i got back went on cleve my girl had married another fellow shed given him all i left with her then i got drunk while i was drunk they put up a job on me it was her word that disgraced me and run me out of town so i struck west and drifted to the border  thats not all said kells bluntly  jim i reckon you aint tellin what you did to thet lyin girl an the feller howd you leave them added pearce  but cleve appeared to become gloomy and reticent  wimmen can hand the doublecross to a man hey kells queried smith with a broad grin  by gosh i thought youd been treated powerful mean exclaimed bate wood and he was full of wrath  a treacherous woman exclaimed kells passionately he had taken cleves story hard the man must have been betrayed by women and cleves story had irritated old wounds  directly kells left the fire and repaired to his blankets near where joan lay probably he believed her asleep for he neither looked nor spoke cleve sought his bed and likewise wood and smith pearce was the last to leave and as he stood up the light fell upon his red face lean and bold like an indians then he passed joan looking down upon her and then upon the recumbent figure of kells and if his glance was not baleful and malignant as it swept over the bandit joan believed her imagination must be vividly weird and running away with her judgment  the next morning began a day of toil they had to climb over the mountain divide a long flattopped range of broken rocks joan spared her horse to the limit of her own endurance if there were a trail smith alone knew it for none was in evidence to the others they climbed out of the notched head of the canon and up a long slope of weathered shale that let the horses slide back a foot for every yard gained and through a labyrinth of broken cliffs and over bench and ridge to the height of the divide from there joan had a magnificent view foothills rolled round heads below and miles away in a curve of the range glistened bear lake the rest here at this height was counteracted by the fact that the altitude affected joan she was glad to be on the move again and now the travel was downhill so that she could ride still it was difficult for horses were more easily lamed in a descent it took two hours to descend the distance that had consumed all the morning to ascend smith led through valley after valley between foothills and late in the afternoon halted by a spring in a timbered spot  joan ached in every muscle and she was too tired to care what happened round the campfire jim had been close to her all day and that had kept up her spirit it was not yet dark when she lay down for the night  sleep well dandy dale said kells cheerfully yet not without pathos alder creek tomorrow then youll never sleep again  at times she seemed to feel that he regretted her presence and always this fancy came to her with mocking or bantering suggestion that the costume and mask she wore made her a bandits consort and she could not escape the wildness of this goldseeking life the truth was that kells saw the insuperable barrier between them and in the bitterness of his love he lied to himself and hated himself for the lie  about the middle of the afternoon of the next day the tired cavalcade rode down out of the brush and rock into a new broad dusty road it was so new that the stems of the cut brush along the borders were still white but that road had been traveled by a multitude  out across the valley in the rear joan saw a canvastopped wagon and she had not ridden far on the road when she saw a bobbing packburros to the fore kells had called wood and smith and pearce and cleve together and now they went on in a bunch all driving the packtrain excitement again claimed kells pearce was alert and hawkeyed smith looked like a hound on a scent cleve showed genuine feeling only bate wood remained proof to the meaning of that broad road  all along on either side joan saw wrecks of wagons wheels harness boxes old rags of tents blown into the brush dead mules and burros it seemed almost as if an army had passed that way presently the road crossed a wide shallow brook of water half clear and half muddy and on the other side the road followed the course of the brook joan heard smith call the stream alder creek and he asked kells if he knew what muddied water meant the bandits eyes flashed fire joan thrilled for she too knew that upstream there were miners washing earth for gold  a couple of miles farther on creek and road entered the mouth of a wide sprucetimbered gulch these trees hid any view of the slopes or floor of the gulch and it was not till several more miles had been passed that the bandit rode out into what joan first thought was a hideous slash in the forest made by fire but it was only the devastation wrought by men as far as she could see the timber was down and everywhere began to be manifested signs that led her to expect habitations no cabins showed however in the next mile they passed out of the timbered part of the gulch into one of rugged bare and stony slopes with bunches of sparse alder here and there the gulch turned at right angles and a great gray slope shut out sight of what lay beyond but once round that obstruction kells halted his men with short tense exclamation  joan saw that she stood high up on the slope looking down upon the goldcamp it was an interesting scene but not beautiful to kells it must have been so but to joan it was even more hideous than the slash in the forest here and there everywhere were rude dugouts little huts of brush an occasional tent and an occasional log cabin and as she looked farther and farther these crude habitations of miners magnified in number and in dimensions till the white and black broken mass of the town choked the narrow gulch  wal boss what do you say to thet diggins demanded jesse smith  kells drew a deep breath old fortyniner this beats all i ever saw  shore ive seen sacramento look like thet added bate wood  pearce and cleve gazed with fixed eyes and however different their emotions they rivaled each other in attention  jesse whats the word queried kells with a sharp return to the business of the matter  ive picked a site on the other side of camp best fer us he replied  shall we keep to the road  certainlee he returned with his grin  kells hesitated and felt of his beard probably conjecturing the possibilities of recognition  whiskers make another man of you reckon you neednt expect to be known over here  that decided kells he pulled his sombrero well down shadowing his face then he remembered joan and made a slight significant gesture at her mask  kells the people in this here camp wouldnt look at an army ridin through responded smith its every man fer hisself an wimmen say theres all kinds i seen a dozen with veils an thems the same as masks nevertheless kells had joan remove the mask and pull her sombrero down and instructed her to ride in the midst of the group then they trotted on soon catching up with the jogging packtrain  what a strange ride that was for joan the slope resembled a magnified anthill with a horde of frantic ants in action as she drew closer she saw these ants were men digging for gold those near at hand could be plainly seenrough ragged bearded men and smoothfaced boys farther on and up the slope along the waterways and ravines were miners so close they seemed almost to interfere with one another the creek bottom was alive with busy silent violent men bending over the water washing and shaking and paddling all desperately intent upon something they had not time to look up they were ragged unkempt barearmed and barelegged every last one of them with back bent for a mile or more kellss party trotted through this part of the diggings and everywhere on rocky bench and gravel bar and gray slope were holes with men picking and shoveling in them some were deep and some were shallow some long trenches and others mere pits if all of these prospectors were finding gold then gold was everywhere and presently joan did not need to have kells tell her that all of these diggers were finding dust how silent they werehow tense they were not mechanical it was a soul that drove them joan had seen many men dig for gold and find a little now and then but she had never seen men dig when they knew they were going to strike gold that made the strange difference  joan calculated she must have seen a thousand miners in less than two miles of the gulch and then she could not see up the draws and washes that intersected the slope and she could not see beyond the camp  but it was not a camp which she was entering it was a tentwalled town a city of squat log cabins a long motley checkered jumble of structures thrown up and together in mad haste the wide road split it in the middle and seemed a stream of color and life joan rode between two lines of horses burros oxen mules packs and loads and canvasdomed wagons and gaudy vehicles resembling gipsy caravans the street was as busy as a beehive and as noisy as a bedlam the sidewalks were roughhewn planks and they rattled under the tread of booted men there were tents on the ground and tents on floors and tents on log walls and farther on began the lines of cabinsstores and shops and saloonsand then a great square flat structure with a flaring sign in crude gold letters last nugget from which came the creak of iddles and scrape of boots and hoarse mirth joan saw strange wildlooking creatureswomen that made her shrink and several others of her sex hurrying along carrying sacks or buckets worn and bewilderedlooking women the sight of whom gave her a pang she saw lounging indians and groups of lazy bearded men just like kellss band and gamblers in long black coats and frontiersmen in fringed buckskin and mexicans with swarthy faces under wide peaked sombreros and then in great majority dominating that stream of life the lean and stalwart miners of all ages in their check shirts and high boots all packing guns jostling along darkbrowed somber and intent these last were the workers of this vast beehive the others were the drones the parasites  kells party rode on through the town and smith halted them beyond the outskirts near a grove of sprucetrees where camp was to be made  joan pondered over her impression of alder creek it was confused she had seen too much but out of what she had seen and heard loomed two contrasting features a throng of toiling miners slaves to their lust for gold and actuated by ambitions hopes and aims honest rugged tireless workers but frenzied in that strange pursuit and a lesser crowd like leeches living for and off the gold they did not dig with blood of hand and sweat of brow  manifestly jesse smith had selected the spot for kellss permanent location at alder creek with an eye for the bandits peculiar needs it was out of sight of town yet within a hundred rods of the nearest huts and closer than that to a sawmill it could be approached by a shallow ravine that wound away toward the creek it was backed up against a rugged bluff in which there was a narrow gorge choked with pieces of weathered cliff and no doubt the bandits could go and come in that direction there was a spring near at hand and a grove of sprucetrees the ground was rocky and apparently unfit for the digging of gold  while bate wood began preparations for supper and cleve built the fire and smith looked after the horses kells and pearce stepped off the ground where the cabin was to be erected they selected a level bench down upon which a huge cracked rock as large as a house had rolled the cabin was to be backed up against this stone and in the rear under cover of it a secret exit could be made and hidden the bandit wanted two holes to his burrow  when the group sat down to the meal the gulch was full of sunset colors and strangely they were all some shade of gold beautiful golden veils misty ethereal shone in rays across the gulch from the broken ramparts and they seemed so brilliant so rich prophetic of the treasures of the hills but that golden sunset changed the sun went down red leaving a sinister shadow over the gulch growing darker and darker joan saw cleve thoughtfully watching this transformation and she wondered if he had caught the subtle mood of nature for whatever had been the hope and brightness the golden glory of this new eldorado this sudden uprising alder creek with its horde of brave and toiling miners the truth was that jack kells and gulden had ridden into the camp and the sun had gone down red joan knew that great miningcamps were always happy rich free lucky honest places till the fame of gold brought evil men and she had not the slightest doubt that the sun of alder creeks brief and glad day had set forever  twilight was stealing down from the hills when kells announced to his party bate you and jesse keep camp pearce you look out for any of the gang but meet in the dark cleve you can go with me then he turned to joan do you want to go with us to see the sights or would you rather stay here  id like to go if only i didnt look soso dreadful in this suit she replied  kells laughed and the campfire glare lighted the smiling faces of pearce and smith  why youll not be seen and you look far from dreadful  cant you give me aa longer coat faltered joan  cleve heard and without speaking he went to his saddle and unrolled his pack inside a slicker he had a gray coat joan had seen it many a time and it brought a pang with memories of hoadley had that been years ago cleve handed this coat to joan  thank you she said  kells held the coat for her and she slipped into it she seemed lost it was long coming way below her hips and for the first time in days she felt she was joan randle again  modesty is all very well in a woman but its not always becoming remarked kells turn up your collar pull down your hatfartherthere if you wont go as a youngster now ill eat dandy dales outfit and get you silk dresses haha  joan was not deceived by his humor he might like to look at her in that outrageous bandit costume it might have pleased certain vain and notorietyseeking proclivities of his habits of his california roadagent days but she felt that notwithstanding this once she had donned the long coat he was relieved and glad in spite of himself joan had a little rush of feeling sometimes she almost liked this bandit once he must have been something very different  they set out joan between kells and cleve how strange for her she had daring enough to feel for jims hand in the dark and to give it a squeeze then he nearly broke her fingers she felt the fire in him it was indeed a hard situation for him the walking was rough owing to the uneven road and the stones several times joan stumbled and her spurs jangled they passed ruddy campfires where steam and smoke arose with savory odors where redfaced men were eating and they passed other campfires burned out and smoldering some tents had dim lights throwing shadows on the canvas and others were dark there were men on the road all headed for town gay noisy and profane  then joan saw uneven rows of lights some dim and some bright and crossing before them were moving dark figures again kells bethought himself of his own disguise and buried his chin in his scarf and pulled his widebrimmed hat down so that hardly a glimpse of his face could be seen joan could not have recognized him at the distance of a yard  they walked down the middle of the road past the noisy saloons past the big flat structure with its sign last nugget and its open windows where shafts of light shone forth and all the way down to the end of town then kells turned back he scrutinized each group of men he met he was looking for members of his border legion several times he left cleve and joan standing in the road while he peered into saloons at these brief intervals joan looked at cleve with all her heart in her eyes he never spoke he seemed under a strain upon the return when they reached the last nugget kells said  jim hang on to her like grim death shes worth more than all the gold in alder creek  then they started for the door  joan clung to cleve on one side and on the other instinctively with a frightened girls action she let go kellss arm and slipped her hand in his he seemed startled he bent to her ear for the din made ordinary talk indistinguishable that involuntary hand in his evidently had pleased and touched him even hurt him for his whisper was husky  its all rightyoure perfectly safe  first joan made out a glare of smoky lamps a huge place full of smoke and men and sounds kells led the way slowly he had his own reason for observance there was a stench that sickened joana blended odor of tobacco and rum and wet sawdust and smoking oil there was a noise that appeared almost deafeningthe loud talk and vacant laughter of drinking men and a din of creaky fiddles and scraping boots and boisterous mirth this last and dominating sound came from an adjoining room which joan could see through a wide opening there was dancing but joan could not see the dancers because of the intervening crowd then her gaze came back to the features nearer at hand men and youths were lined up to a long bar nearly as high as her head then there were excited shouting groups round gambling games there were men in clusters sitting on upturned kegs round a box for a table and dirty bags of golddust were in evidence the gamblers at the cards were silent in strange contrast with the others and in each group was at least one darkgarbed hardeyed gambler who was not a miner joan saw boys not yet of age flushed and haggard wild with the frenzy of winning and cast down in defeat there were jovial grizzled old prospectors to whom this scene and company were pleasant reminders of bygone days there were desperados whose glittering eyes showed they had no gold with which to gamble  joan suddenly felt kells start and she believed she heard a low hissing exclamation and she looked for the cause then she saw familiar dark faces they belonged to men of kellss legion and with his broad back to her there sat the giant gulden already he and his allies had gotten together in defiance of or indifference to kellss orders some of them were already under the influence of drink but though they saw kells they gave no sign of recognition gulden did not see joan and for that she was thankful and whether or not his presence caused it the fact was that she suddenly felt as much of a captive as she had in cabin gulch and feared that here escape would be harder because in a community like this kells would watch her closely  kells led joan and cleve from one part of the smoky hall to another and they looked on at the games and the strange raw life manifested there the place was getting packed with men kellss party encountered blicky and beady jones together they passed by as strangers then joan saw beard and chick williams arm in arm strolling about like roystering miners williams telegraphed a keen fleeting glance at kells then went on to be lost in the crowd handy oliver brushed by kells jostled him apparently by accident and he said excuse me mister there were other familiar faces kellss gang were all in alder creek and the dark machinations of the bandit leader had been put into operation what struck joan forcibly was that though there were hilarity and comradeship they were not manifested in any general way these miners were strangers to one another the groups were strangers the gamblers were strangers the newcomers were strangers and over all hung an atmosphere of distrust good fellowship abided only in the many small companies of men who stuck together the miningcamps that joan had visited had been composed of an assortment of prospectors and hunters who made one big jolly family this was a gold strike and the difference was obvious the hunting for gold was one thing in its relation to the searchers after it had been found in a rich field the conditions of life and character changed gold had always seemed wonderful and beautiful to joan she absorbed here something that was the nucleus of hate why could not these miners young and old stay in their camps and keep their gold that was the fatality the pursuit was a dreama glittering allurement the possession incited a lust for more and that was madness joan felt that in these reckless honest miners there was a liberation of the same wild element which was the driving passion of kellss border legion gold then was a terrible thing  take me in there said joan conscious of her own excitement and she indicated the dancehall  kells laughed as if at her audacity but he appeared reluctant  please take meunless joan did not know what to add but she meant unless it was not right for her to see any more a strange curiosity had stirred in her after all this place where she now stood was not greatly different from the picture imagination had conjured up that dancehall however was beyond any creation of joans mind  let me have a look first said kells and he left joan with cleve  when he had gone joan spoke without looking at cleve though she held fast to his arm  jim it could be dreadful hereall in a minute she whispered  youve struck it exactly he replied all alder creek needed to make it hell was kells and his gang  thank heaven i turned you back in time jim youd havehave gone the pace here  he nodded grimly then kells returned and led them back through the room to another door where spectators were fewer joan saw perhaps a dozen couples of rough whirling jigging dancers in a halfcircle of watching men the hall was a wide platform of boards with posts holding a canvas roof the sides were open the lights were situated at each endhuge round circus tent lamps there were rude benches and tables where reeling men surrounded a woman joan saw a young miner in dusty boots and corduroys lying drunk or dead in the sawdust her eyes were drawn back to the dancers and to the dance that bore some semblance to a waltz in the din the music could scarcely be heard as far as the men were concerned this dance was a bold and violent expression of excitement on the part of some and for the rest a drunken mad fling sight of the women gave joans curiosity a blunt check she felt queer she had not seen women like these and their dancing their actions their looks were beyond her understanding nevertheless they shocked her disgusted her sickened her and suddenly when it dawned upon her in unbelievable vivid suggestion that they were the wildest and most terrible element of this dark stream of humanity lured by gold then she was appalled  take me out of here she besought kells and he led her out instantly they went through the gamblinghall and into the crowded street back toward camp  you saw enough said kells but nothing to what will break out by and by this camp is new its rich gold is the cheapest thing it passes from hand to hand ten dollars an ounce buyers dont look at the scales only the gamblers are crooked but all this will change  kells did not say what that change might be but the click of his teeth was expressive joan did not however gather from it and the dark meaning of his tone that the border legion would cause this change that was in the nature of events a great strike of gold might enrich the world but it was a catastrophe  long into the night joan lay awake and at times stirring the silence there was wafted to her on a breeze the low strange murmur of the goldcamps strife  joan slept late next morning and was awakened by the unloading of lumber teams were drawing planks from the sawmill already a skeleton framework for kellss cabin had been erected jim cleve was working with the others and they were sacrificing thoroughness to haste joan had to cook her own breakfast which task was welcome and after it had been finished she wished for something more to occupy her mind but nothing offered finding a comfortable seat among some rocks where she would be inconspicuous she looked on at the building of kellss cabin it seemed strange and somehow comforting to watch jim cleve work he had never been a great worker would this experience on the border make a man of him she felt assured of that  if ever a cabin sprang up like a mushroom that bandit rendezvous was the one kells worked himself and appeared no mean hand by noon the roof of clapboards was on and the siding of the same material had been started evidently there was not to a be a fireplace inside  then a teamster drove up with a wagonload of purchases kells had ordered kells helped unload this and evidently was in search of articles presently he found them and then approached joan to deposit before her an assortment of bundles little and big  there miss modestly he said make yourself some clothes you can shake dandy dales outfit except when were on the trail and say if you knew what i had to pay for this stuff youd think there was a bigger robber in alder creek than jack kells and come to think of it my names now blight youre my daughter if any one asks joan was so grateful to him for the goods and the permission to get out of dandy dales suit as soon as possible that she could only smile her thanks kells stared at her then turned abruptly away those little unconscious acts of hers seemed to affect him strangely joan remembered that he had intended to parade her in dandy dales costume to gratify some vain abnormal side of his bandits proclivities he had weakened here was another subtle indication of the deterioration of the evil of him how far would it go joan thought dreamily and with a swelling heart of her influence upon this hardened bandit upon that wild boy jim cleve  all that afternoon and part of the evening in the campfire light and all of the next day joan sewed so busy that she scarcely lifted her eyes from her work the following day she finished her dress and with no little pride for she had both taste and skill of the men bate wood had been most interested in her task and he would let things burn on the fire to watch her  that day the rude cabin was completed it contained one long room and at the back a small compartment partitioned off from the rest and built against and around a shallow cavern in the huge rock this compartment was for joan there were a rude board door with padlock and key a bench upon which blankets had been flung a small square hole cut in the wall to serve as a window what with her own few belongings and the articles of furniture that kells bought for her joan soon had a comfortable room even a luxury compared to what she had been used to for weeks certain it was that kells meant to keep her a prisoner or virtually so joan had no sooner spied the little window than she thought that it would be possible for jim cleve to talk to her there from the outside  kells verified joans suspicion by telling her that she was not to leave the cabin of her own accord as she had been permitted to do back in cabin gulch and joan retorted that there she had made him a promise not to run away which promise she now took back that promise had worried her she was glad to be honest with kells he gazed at her somberly  youll be worse off it you doand ill be better off he said and then as an afterthought he added gulden might not think youa white elephant on his hands remember his way the cave and the rope  so instinctively or cruelly he chose the right name to bring shuddering terror into joans soul     14  joans opportunity for watching kells and his men and overhearing their colloquies was as good as it had been back in cabin gulch but it developed that where kells had been open and frank he now became secret and cautious she was aware that men singly and in couples visited him during the early hours of the night and they had conferences in low earnest tones she could peer out of her little window and see dark silent forms come up from the ravine at the back of the cabin and leave the same way none of them went round to the front door where bate wood smoked and kept guard joan was able to hear only scraps of these earnest talks and from part of one she gathered that for some reason or other kells desired to bring himself into notice alder creek must be made to know that a man of importance had arrived it seemed to joan that this was the very last thing which kells ought to do what magnificent daring the bandit had famous years before in californiawith a price set upon his life in nevadaand now the noted if unknown leader of border robbers in idaho he sought to make himself prominent respected and powerful joan found that in spite of her horror at the sinister and deadly nature of the bandits enterprise she could not avoid an absorbing interest in his fortunes  next day joan watched for an opportunity to tell jim cleve that he might come to her little window any time after dark to talk and plan with her no chance presented itself joan wore the dress she had made to the evident pleasure of bate wood and pearce they had conceived as strong an interest in her fortunes as she had in kellss wood nodded his approval and pearce said she was a lady once more strange it was to joan that this villain pearce whom she could not have dared trust grew open in his insinuating hints of kellss blackguardism strange because pearce was absolutely sincere  when jim cleve did see joan in her dress the first time he appeared so glad and relieved and grateful that she feared he might betray himself so she got out of his sight  not long after that kells called her from her room he wore his somber and thoughtful cast of countenance red pearce and jesse smith were standing at attention cleve was sitting on the threshold of the door and wood leaned against the wall  is there anything in the pack of stuff i bought you that you could use for a veil asked kells of joan  yes she replied  get it he ordered and your hat too  joan went to her room and returned with the designated articles the hat being that which she had worn when she left hoadley  thatll do put it onover your faceand lets see how you look  joan complied with this request all the time wondering what kells meant  i want it to disguise you but not to hide your youthyour good looks he said and he arranged it differently about her face there youd sure make any man curious to see you now put on the hat  joan did so then kells appeared to become more forcible  youre to go down into the town walk slow as far as the last nugget cross the road and come back look at every man you meet or see standing by dont be in the least frightened pearce and smith will be right behind you theyd get to you before anything could happen do you understand  yes replied joan  red pearce stirred uneasily jack im thinkin some rough talkll come her way he said darkly  will you shut up replied kells in quick passion he resented some implication ive thought of that she wont hear whats said to her here and he turned again to joan take some cottonor anythingand stuff up your ears make a good job of it  joan went back to her room and looking about for something with which to execute kellss last order she stripped some soft woolly bits from a fleecelined piece of cloth with these she essayed to deaden her hearing then she returned kells spoke to her but though she seemed dully to hear his voice she could not distinguish what he said she shook her head with that kells waved her out upon her strange errand  joan brushed against cleve as she crossed the threshold what would he think of this she would not see his face when she reached the first tents she could not resist the desire to look back pearce was within twenty yards of her and smith about the same distance farther back joan was more curious than anything else she divined that kells wanted her to attract attention but for what reason she was at a loss to say it was significant that he did not intend to let her suffer any indignity while fulfilling this mysterious mission  not until joan got well down the road toward the last nugget did any one pay any attention to her a mexican jabbered at her showing his white teeth flashing his sloeblack eyes young miners eyed her curiously and some of them spoke she met all kinds of men along the plank walk most of whom passed by apparently unobserving she obeyed kells to the letter but for some reason she was unable to explain when she got to the row of saloons where lounging evileyed rowdies accosted her she found she had to disobey him at least in one particular she walked faster still that did not make her task much easier it began to be an ordeal the farther she got the bolder men grew could it have been that kells wanted this sort of thing to happen to her joan had no idea what these men meant but she believed that was because for the time being she was deaf assuredly their looks were not a compliment to any girl joan wanted to hurry now and she had to force herself to walk at a reasonable gait one persistent fellow walked beside her for several steps joan was not fool enough not to realize now that these wayfarers wanted to make her acquaintance and she decided she would have something to say to kells when she got back  below the last nugget she crossed the road and started upon the return trip in front of this gamblinghell there were scattered groups of men standing and going in a tall man in black detached himself and started out as if to intercept her he wore a long black coat a black bow tie and a black sombrero he had little hard piercing eyes as black as his dress he wore gloves and looked immaculate compared with the other men he too spoke to joan turned to walk with her she looked straight ahead now frightened and she wanted to run he kept beside her apparently talking joan heard only the low sound of his voice then he took her arm gently but with familiarity joan broke from him and quickened her pace  say there leave thet girl alone  this must have been yelled for joan certainly heard it she recognized red pearces voice and she wheeled to look pearce had overhauled the gambler and already men were approaching involuntarily joan halted what would happen the gambler spoke to pearce made what appeared deprecating gestures as if to explain but pearce looked angry  ill tell her daddy he shouted  joan waited for no more she almost ran there would surely be a fight could that have been kellss intention whatever it was she had been subjected to a mortifying and embarrassing affront she was angry and she thought it might be just as well to pretend to be furious kells must not use her for his nefarious schemes she hurried on and to her surprise when she got within sight of the cabin both pearce and smith had almost caught up with her jim cleve sat where she had last seen him also kells was outside the way he strode to and fro showed joan his anxiety there was more to this incident than she could fathom she took the padding from her ears to her intense relief and soon reaching the cabin she tore off the veil and confronted kells  wasnt that aa fine thing for you to do she demanded furiously and with the outburst she felt her face blazing if id any idea what you meantyou couldnthave driven me i trusted you and you sent me down there on someshameful errand of yours youre no gentleman  joan realized that her speech especially the latter part was absurd but it had a remarkable effect upon kells his face actually turned red he stammered something and halted seemingly at a loss for words how singularly the slightest hint of any act or word of hers that approached a possible respect or tolerance worked upon this bandit he started toward joan appealingly but she passed him in contempt and went to her room she heard him cursing pearce in a rage evidently blaming his lieutenant for whatever had angered her  but you wanted her insulted protested pearce hotly  you mullethead roared kells i wanted some manany manto get just near enough to her so i could swear shed been insulted you let her go through that camp to meet real insult why pearce ive a mind to shoot you  shoot retorted pearce i obeyed orders as i saw them an i want to say right here thet when it comes to anythin concernin this girl youre plumb off your nut thats what an you can like it or lump it i said before youd split over this girl an i say it now  through the door joan had a glimpse of cleve stepping between the angry men this seemed unnecessary however for pearces stinging assertion had brought kells to himself there were a few more words too low for joans ears and then accompanied by smith the three started off evidently for the camp joan left her room and watched them from the cabin door bate wood sat outside smoking  im declarin my hand he said to joan feelingly id never hev stood for thet scurvy trick now miss thiss the toughest camp i ever seen i mean tough as to wimmen for it aint begun to fan guns an steal gold yet  why did kells want me insulted asked joan  wal hes got to hev a reason for raisin an orful fuss replied wood  fuss  shore replied wood dryly  what for  jest so he can walk out on the stage rejoined wood evasively  its mighty strange said joan  i reckon all about mr kells is some strange these days red pearce had it correct kells is agoin to split on you  what do you mean by that  wal hell go one way an the gang another  why asked joan earnestly  miss theres some lot of reasons said wood deliberately fust he did for halloway an bailey not because they wanted to treat you as he meant to but just because he wanted to be alone were all wise thet you shot himan thet you wasnt his wife an since then weve seen him gradually lose his nerve he organized his legion an makes his plan to run this alder creek red he still hangs on to you hed kill any man thet batted an eye at you an through all this because hes not jack kells of old hes lost his pull with the gang sooner or later hell split  have i any real friends among you asked joan  wal i reckon  are you my friend bate wood she went on in sweet wistfulness  the grizzled old bandit removed his pipe and looked at her with a glint in his bloodshot eyes  i shore am ill sneak you off now if youll go ill stick a knife in kells if you say so  oh no im afraid to run offand you neednt harm kells after all hes good to me  good to you when he keeps you captive like an indian would when hes given me orders to watch youkeep you locked up  woods snort of disgust and wrath was thoroughly genuine still joan knew that she dared not trust him any more than pearce or the others their raw emotions would undergo a change if kellss possession of her were transferred to them it occurred to joan however that she might use woods friendliness to some advantage  so im to be locked up she asked  youre supposed to be  without any one to talk to  wal youll hev me when you want i reckon thet aint much to look forward to but i can tell you a heap of stories an when kells aint around if youre careful not to get me ketched you can do as you want  thank you bate im going to like you replied joan sincerely and then she went back to her room there was sewing to do and while she worked she thought so that the hours sped when the light got so poor that she could sew no longer she put the work aside and stood at her little window watching the sunset from the front of the cabin came the sound of subdued voices probably kells and his men had returned and she was sure of this when she heard the ring of bate woods ax  all at once an object darker than the stones arrested joans gaze there was a man sitting on the far side of the little ravine instantly she recognized jim cleve he was looking at the little windowat her joan believed he was there for just that purpose making sure that no one else was near to see she put out her hand and waved it jim gave a guarded perceptible sign that he had observed her action and almost directly got up and left joan needed no more than that to tell her how jims idea of communicating with her corresponded with her own that night she would talk with him and she was thrilled through the secrecy the peril somehow lent this prospect a sweetness a zest a delicious fear indeed she was not only responding to love but to daring to defiance to a wilder nameless element born of her environment and the needs of the hour  presently bate wood called her in to supper pearce smith and cleve were finding seats at the table but kells looked rather sick joan observed him then more closely his face was pale and damp strangely shaded as if there were something dark under the pale skin joan had never seen him appear like this and she shrank as from another and forbidding side of the man pearce and smith acted naturally ate with relish and talked about the golddiggings cleve however was not as usual and joan could not quite make out what constituted the dissimilarity she hurried through her own supper and back to her room  already it was dark outside joan lay down to listen and wait it seemed long but probably was not long before she heard the men go outside and the low thump of their footsteps as they went away then came the rattle and bang of bate woods attack on the pans and pots bate liked to cook but he hated to clean up afterward by and by he settled down outside for his evening smoke and there was absolute quiet then joan rose to stand at the window she could see the dark mass of rock overhanging the cabin the bluff beyond and the stars for the rest all was gloom  she did not have to wait long a soft step almost indistinguishable made her pulse beat quicker she put her face out of the window and on the instant a dark form seemed to loom up to meet her out of the shadow she could not recognize that shape yet she knew it belonged to cleve  joan he whispered  jim she replied just as low and gladly  he moved closer so that the hand she had gropingly put out touched him then seemed naturally to slip along his shoulder round his neck and his face grew clearer in the shadow his lips met hers and joan closed her eyes to that kiss what hope what strength for him and for her now in that meeting of lips  oh jim im so gladto have you nearto touch you she whispered  do you love me still he whispered back tensely  still moremore  say it then  jim i love you  and their lips met again and clung and it was he who drew back first  dearest why didnt you let me make a break to get away with youbefore we came to this camp  oh jim i told you i was afraid wed have been caught and gulden  well never have half the chance here kells means to keep you closely guarded i heard the order hes different now hes grown crafty and hard and the miners of this alder creek why im more afraid to trust them than men like wood or pearce theyve gone clean crazy goldmad if you shouted for your life they wouldnt hear you and if you could make them hear they wouldnt believe this camp has sprung up in a night its not like any place i ever heard of its not human its so strangesooh i dont know what to say i think i mean that men in a great gold strike become like coyotes at a carcass youve seen that no relation at all  im frightened too jim i wish id had the courage to run when we were back in cabin gulch but dont ever give up not for a second we can get away we must plan and wait find out where we arehow far from hoadleywhat we must expectwhether its safe to approach any one in this camp  safe i guess not after today he whispered grimly  why whats happened she asked quickly  joan have you guessed yet why kells sent you down into camp alone  no  listen i went with kells and smith and pearce they hurried straight to the last nugget there was a crowd of men in front of the place pearce walked straight up to onea gambler by his clothes and he said in a loud voice heres the man the gambler looked startled turned pale and went for his gun but kells shot him he fell dead without a word there was a big shout then silence kells stood there with his smoking gun i never saw the man so coolso masterful then he addressed the crowd this gambler insulted my daughter my men here saw him my names blight i came here to buy up gold claims and i want to say this your alder creek has got the gold but it needs some of your best citizens to run it right so a girl can be safe on the street  joan i tell you it was a magnificent bluff went on jim excitedly and it worked kells walked away amid cheers he meant to give an impression of character and importance he succeeded so far as i could tell there wasnt a man present who did not show admiration for him i saw that dead gambler kicked  jim breathed joan he killed himjust for that  just for thatthe bloody devil  but stillwhat for oh it was coldblooded murder  no an even break kells made the gambler go for his gun ill have to say that for kells  it doesnt change the thing id forgotten what a monster he is  joan his motive is plain this new goldcamp has not reached the bloodspilling stage yet it hadnt i should say the news of this killing will fly itll focus minds on this claimbuyer blight his deed rings truelike that of an honest man with a daughter to protect hell win sympathy then he talks as if he were prosperous soon hell be represented in this changing growing population as a man of importance hell play the card for all hes worth meanwhile secretly hell begin to rob the miners itll be hard to suspect him his plot is just like the mangreat  jim oughtnt we tell whispered joan trembling  ive thought of that somehow i seem to feel guilty but whom on earth could we tell we wouldnt dare speak here rememberyoure a prisoner im supposed to be a banditone of the border legion how to get away from here and save our livesthats what tortures me  something tells me well escape if only we can plan the right way jim ill have to be penned here with nothing to do but wait you must come every night wont you  for an answer he kissed her again  jim whatll you do meanwhile she asked anxiously  im going to work a claim dig for gold i told kells so today and he was delighted he said he was afraid his men wouldnt like the working part of his plan its hard to dig gold easy to steal it but ill dig a hole as big as a hill wouldnt it be funny if i struck it rich  jim youre getting the fever  joan if i did happen to run into a goldpockettherere lots of them foundwouldyoumarry me  the tenderness the timidity and the yearning in cleves voice told joan as never before how he had hoped and feared and despaired she patted his cheek with her hand and in the darkness with her heart swelling to make up for what she had done to him she felt a boldness and a recklessness sweet tumultuous irresistible  jim ill marry youwhether you strike gold or not she whispered  and there was another blind sweet moment then cleve tore himself away and joan leaned at the window watching the shadow with tears in her eyes and an ache in her breast  from that day joan lived a life of seclusion in the small room kells wanted it so and joan thought best for the time being not to take advantage of bate woods duplicity her meals were brought to her by wood who was supposed to unlock and lock her door but wood never turned the key in that padlock  prisoner though joan was the days and nights sped swiftly  kells was always up till late in the night and slept half of the next morning it was his wont to see joan every day about noon he had a care for his appearance when he came in he was dark forbidding weary and cold manifestly he came to her to get rid of the imponderable burden of the present he left it behind him he never spoke a word of alder creek of gold of the border legion always he began by inquiring for her welfare by asking what he could do for her what he could bring her joan had an abhorrence of keils in his absence that she never felt when he was with her and the reason must have been that she thought of him remembered him as the bandit and saw him as another and growing character always mindful of her influence she was as companionable as sympathetic as cheerful and sweet as it was possible for her to be slowly he would warm and change under her charm and the grim gloom the dark strain would pass from him when that left he was indeed another person frankly he told joan that the glimpse of real love she had simulated back there in cabin gulch was seldom out of his mind no woman had ever kissed him like she had that kiss had transfigured him it haunted him if he could not win kisses like that from joans lips of her own free will then he wanted none no other womans lips would ever touch his and he begged joan in the terrible earnestness of a stern and hungering outcast for her love and joan could only sadly shake her head and tell him she was sorry for him that the more she really believed he loved her the surer she was that he would give her up then always he passionately refused he must have her to keep to look at as his treasure to dream over and hope against hope that she would love him some day women sometimes learned to love their captors he said and if she only learned then he would take her away to australia to distant lands but most of all he begged her to show him again what it meant to be loved by a good woman and joan who knew that her power now lay in her unattainableness feigned a wavering reluctance when in truth any surrender was impossible he left her with a spirit that her presence gave him in a kind of trance radiant yet with mocking smile as if he foresaw the overthrow of his soul through her and in the light of that his waning power over his legion was as nothing  in the afternoon he went down into camp to strengthen the associations he had made to buy claims and to gamble upon his return joan peeping through a crack between the boards could always tell whether he had been gambling whether he had won or lost  most of the evenings he remained in his cabin which after dark became a place of mysterious and stealthy action the members of his legion visited him sometimes alone never more than two together joan could hear them slipping in at the hidden aperture in the back of the cabin she could hear the low voices but seldom what was said she could hear these night prowlers as they departed afterward kells would have the lights lit and then joan could see into the cabin was that dark haggard man kells she saw him take little buckskin sacks full of golddust and hide them under the floor then he would pace the room in his old familiar manner like a caged tiger later his mood usually changed with the advent of wood and pearce and smith and cleve who took turns at guard and going down into camp then kells would join them in a friendly game for small stakes gambler though he was he refused to allow any game there that might lead to heavy wagering from the talk sometimes joan learned that he played for exceedingly large stakes with gamblers and prosperous miners usually with the same resulta loss sometimes he won however and then he would crow over pearce and smith and delight in telling them how cunningly he had played  jim cleve had his bed up under the bulge of bluff in a sheltered nook kells had appeared to like this idea for some reason relative to his scout system which he did not explain and cleve was happy about it because this arrangement left him absolutely free to have his nightly rendezvous with joan at her window sometime between dark and midnight her bed was right under the window if awake she could rest on her knees and look out and if she was asleep he could thrust a slender stick between the boards to awaken her but the fact was that joan lived for these stolen meetings and unless he could not come until very late she waited wideeyed and listening for him then besides as long as kells was stirring in the cabin she spent her time spying upon him  jim cleve had gone to an unfrequented part of the gulch for no particular reason and here he had located his claim the very first day he struck gold and kells more for advertisement than for any other motive had his men stake out a number of claims near cleves and bought them then they had a little field of their own all found the rich paydirt but it was cleve to whom the goddess of fortune turned her bright face as he had been lucky at cards so he was lucky at digging his claim paid big returns kells spread the news and that part of the gulch saw a rush of miners  every night joan had her whispered hour with cleve and each succeeding one was the sweeter jim had become a victim of the gold fever but having joan to steady him he did not lose his head if he gambled it was to help out with his part he was generous to his comrades he pretended to drink but did not drink at all jim seemed to regard his good fortune as joans also he believed if he struck it rich he could buy his sweethearts freedom he claimed that kells was drunk for gold to gamble away joan let jim talk but she coaxed him and persuaded him to follow a certain line of behavior she planned for him she thought for him she influenced him to hide the greater part of his golddust and let it be known that he wore no goldbelt she had a growing fear that jims success was likely to develop a temper in him inimical to the cool waiting tolerant policy needed to outwit kells in the end it seemed the more gold jim acquired the more passionate he became the more he importuned joan the more he hated kells gold had gotten into his blood and it was joans task to keep him sane naturally she gained more by yielding herself to jims caresses than by any direct advice or admonishment it was her love that held jim in check  one night the instant their hands met joan knew that jim was greatly excited or perturbed  joan he whispered thrillingly with his lips at her ear ive made myself solid with kells oh the luck of it  tell me whispered joan and she leaned against those lips  it was early tonight at the nugget i dropped in as usual kells was playing faro again with that gambler they call flash hes won a lot of kellss golda crooked gambler i looked on and some of the gang were therepearce blicky handy oliver and of course gulden but all separated kells was losing and sore but he was game all at once he caught flash in a crooked trick and he yelled in a rage he sure had the gang and everybody else looking i expectedand so did all the gangto see kells pull his gun but strange how gambling affects him he only cursed flashcalled him right you know thats about as bad as death to a professional gambler in a place like alder creek flash threw a derringer on kells he had it up his sleeve he meant to kill kells and kells had no chance but flash having the drop took time to talk to make his bluff go strong with the crowd and thats where he made a mistake i jumped and knocked the gun out of his hand it went offburned my wrist then i slugged mr flash goodhe didnt get up kells called the crowd around and showing the cards as they lay coolly proved that flash was what everybody suspected then kells said to meill never forget how he looked youngster he meant to do for me i never thought of my gun you see ill kill him the next time we meet ive owed my life to men more than once i never forget you stood pat with me before and now youre ace high  was it fair of you asked joan  yes flash is a crooked gambler id rather be a bandit besides alls fair in love and i was thinking of you when i saved kells  flash will be looking for you said joan fearfully  likely and if he finds me he wants to be quick but kells will drive him out of camp or kill him i tell you kells is the biggest man in alder creek theres talk of officea mayor and all thatand if the miners can forget gold long enough theyll elect kells but the riffraff these bloodsuckers who live off the miners theyd rather not have any office in alder creek  and upon another night cleve in serious and somber mood talked about the border legion and its mysterious workings the name had found prominence no one knew how and alder creek knew no more peaceful sleep this legion was supposed to consist of a strange secret band of unknown bandits and roadagents drawing its members from all that wild and trackless region called the border rumor gave it a leader of cunning and ruthless nature it operated all over the country at the same time and must have been composed of numerous smaller bands impossible to detect because its victims never lived to tell how or by whom they had been robbed this legion worked slowly and in the dark it did not bother to rob for little gain it had strange and unerring information of large quantities of golddust two prospectors going out on the bannack road packing fifty pounds of gold were found shot to pieces a miner named black who would not trust his gold to the stageexpress and who left adler creek against advice was never seen or heard of again four other miners of the camp known to carry considerable gold were robbed and killed at night on their way to their cabins and another was found dead in his bed robbers had crept to his tent slashed the canvas murdered him while he slept and made off with his belt of gold  an evil day of blood had fallen upon alder creek there were terrible and implacable men in the midst of the miners by day at honest toil learning who had gold and murdering by night the camp had never been united but this dread fact disrupted any possible unity every man or every little group of men distrusted the other watched and spied and lay awake at night but the robberies continued one every few days and each one left no trace for dead men could not talk  thus was ushered in at alder creek a regime of wildness that had no parallel in the earlier days of 49 and 51 men frenzied by the possession of gold or greed for it responded to the wildness of that time and took their cue from this deadly and mysterious border legion the goldlust created its own bloodlust daily the population of alder creek grew in the new goldseekers and its dark records kept pace with distrust came suspicion and with suspicion came fear and with fear came hateand these in already distorted minds inflamed a hell so that the most primitive passions of mankind found outlet and held sway the operations of the border legion were lost in deeds done in the gambling dens in the saloons and on the street in broad day men fought for no other reason than that the incentive was in the charged air men were shot at gamingtablesand the game went on men were killed in the dancehalls dragged out marking a line of blood on the rude floorand the dance went on still the pursuit of gold went on more frenzied than ever and still the greater and richer claims were struck the price of gold soared and the commodities of life were almost beyond the dreams of avarice it was a tune in which the worst of mens natures stalked forth hydraheaded and deaf roaring for gold spitting fire and shedding blood it was a time when gold and fire and blood were one it was a tune when a horde of men from every class and nation of all ages and characters met on a field were motives and ambitions and faiths and traits merged into one mad instinct of gain it was worse than the time of the medieval crimes of religion it made war seem a brave and honorable thing it robbed manhood of that splendid and noble trait always seen in shipwrecked men or those hopelessly lost in the barren north the divine will not to retrograde to the savage it was a time for all it enriched the world with yellow treasure when might was right when men were hopeless when death stalked rampant the sun rose gold and it set red it was the hour of gold  one afternoon late while joan was half dreaming half dozing the hours away she was thoroughly aroused by the tramp of boots and loud voices of excited men joan slipped to the peephole in the partition bate wood had raised a warning hand to kells who stood up facing the door red pearce came bursting in wildeyed and violent joan imagined he was about to cry out that kells had been betrayed  kells have youheard he panted  not so loud you replied kells coolly my names blight whos with you  only jesse an some of the gang i couldnt steer them away but theres nothin to fear  whats happened what havent i heard  the camps gone plumb ravin crazy jim cleve found the biggest nugget ever dug in idaho thirty pounds  kells seemed suddenly to inflame to blaze with white passion good for jim he yelled ringingly he could scarcely have been more elated if he had made the strike himself  jesse smith came stamping in with a crowd elbowing their way behind him joan had a start of the old panic at sight of gulden for once the giant was not slow nor indifferent his big eyes glared he brought back to joan the sickening sense of the brute strength of his massive presence some of his cronies were with him for the rest there were blicky and handy oliver and chick williams the whole group bore resemblance to a pack of wolves about to leap upon its prey yet in each man excepting gulden there was that striking aspect of exultation  wheres jim demanded kells  hes comin along replied pearce hes sure been runnin a gantlet his strike stopped work in the diggins what do you think of that kells the news spread like smoke before wind every last miner in camp has jest got to see thet lump of gold  maybe i dont want to see it exclaimed kells a thirtypounder i heard of one once sixty pounds but i never saw it you cant believe till you see  jims comin up the road now said one of the men near the door thet crowd hangs on but i reckon hes shakin them  whatll cleve do with this nugget  guldens big voice so powerful yet feelingless caused a momentary silence the expression of many faces changed kells looked startled then annoyed  why gulden thats not my affairnor yours replied kells cleve dug it and it belongs to him  dug or stoleits all the same responded gulden  kells threw up his hands as if it were useless and impossible to reason with this man  then the crowd surged round the door with shuffling boots and hoarse mingled greetings to cleve who presently came plunging in out of the melee  his face wore a flush of radiance his eyes were like diamonds joan thrilled and thrilled at sight of him he was beautiful yet there was about him a more striking wildness he carried a gun in one hand and in the other an object wrapped in his scarf he flung this upon the table in front of kells it made a heavy solid thump the ends of the scarf flew aside and there lay a magnificent nugget of gold black and rusty in parts but with a dull yellow glitter in others  boss whatll you bet against that cried cleve with exulting laugh he was like a boy  kells reached for the nugget as if it were not an actual object and when his hands closed on it he fondled it and weighed it and dug his nails into it and tasted it  my god he ejaculated in wondering ecstasy then this and the excitement and the obsession all changed into sincere gladness jim youre born lucky you the youngster born unlucky in love why you could buy any woman with this  could i find me one responded cleve with swift boldness  kells laughed i dont know any worth so much  whatll i do with it queried cleve  why you fool youngster has it turned your head too whatd you do with the rest of your dust youve certainly been striking it rich  i spent itlost itlent itgave some away andsaved a little  probably youll do the same with this youre a good fellow jim  but this nugget means a lot of money between six and seven thousand dollars  you wont need advice how to spend it even if it was a million tell me jim howd you strike it  funny about that replied cleve things were poor for several days dug off branches into my claim one grew to be a deep hole in gravel hard to dig my claim was once the bed of a stream full of rocks that the water had rolled down once this hole sort of haunted me id leave it when my back got so sore i couldnt bend but always id return id say there wasnt a darned grain of gold in that gravel then like a fool id go back and dig for all i was worth no chance of finding blue dirt down there but i kept on and today when my pick hit what felt like a soft rocki looked and saw the gleam of gold you ought to have seen me claw out that nugget i whooped and brought everybody around the rest was a parade now im embarrassed by riches what to do with it  wal go back to montana an make thet fool girl sick suggested one of the men who had heard jims fictitious story of himself  dug or stole is all the same boomed the imperturbable gulden  kells turned white with rage and cleve swept a swift and shrewd glance at the giant  sure thats my idea declared cleve ill divide asas we planned  youll do nothing of the kind retorted kells you dug for that gold and its yours  well boss then say a quarter share to you and the same to meand divide the rest among the gang  no exclaimed kells violently  joan imagined he was actuated as much by justice to cleve as opposition to gulden  jim cleve youre a square pard if i ever seen one declared pearce admiringly an im here to say thet i wouldnt hev a share of your nugget  nor me spoke up jesse smith  i pass too said chick williams  jim if i was dyin fer a drink i wouldnt stand fer thet deal added blicky with a fine scorn  these men and others who spoke or signified their refusal attested to the living truth that there was honor even among robbers but there was not the slightest suggestion of change in guldens attitude or of those back of him  share and share alike for me he muttered grimly with those great eyes upon the nugget  kells with an agile bound reached the table and pounded it with his fist confronting the giant  so you say he hissed in dark passion youve gone too far gulden heres where i call you you dont get a gram of that gold nugget jims worked like a dog if he digs up a million ill see he gets it all maybe you loafers havent a hunch what jims done for you hes helped our big deal more than you or i his honest work has made it easy for me to look honest hes supposed to be engaged to marry my daughter that more than anything was a blind it made my stand and i tell you that stand is high in this camp go down there and swear blight is jack kells see what you get thats all im dealing the cards in this game  kells did not cow guldenfor it was likely the giant lacked the feeling of fearbut he overruled him by sheer strength of spirit  gulden backed away stolidly apparently dazed by his own movements then he plunged out the door and the ruffians who had given silent but sure expression of their loyalty tramped after him  reckon thet starts the split declared red pearce  suppose youd been in jims place flashed kells  jack i aint sayin a word you was square id want you to do the same by me but fetchin the girl into the deal  kellss passionate and menacing gesture shut pearces lips he lifted a hand resignedly and went out  jim said kells earnestly take my hunch hide your nugget dont send it out with the stage to bannack itd never get there and change the place where you sleep  thanks replied cleve brightly ill hide my nugget all right and ill take care of myself  later that night joan waited at her window for jim it was so quiet that she could hear the faint murmur of the shallow creek the sky was dusky blue the stars were white the night breeze sweet and cool her first flush of elation for jim having passed she experienced a sinking of courage were they not in peril enough without jims finding a fortune how dark and significant had been kellss hint there was something splendid in the bandit never had joan felt so grateful to him he was a villain yet he was a man what hatred he showed for gulden these rivals would surely meet in a terrible conflictfor powerfor gold and for hershe added involuntarily with a deep inward shudder once the thought had flashed through her mind it seemed like a word of revelation  then she started as a dark form rose out of the shadow under her and a hand clasped hers jim and she lifted her face  joan joan im rich rich he babbled wildly  ssssh whispered joan softly in his ear be careful youre wild tonight i saw you come in with the nugget i heard you oh you lucky jim ill tell you what to do with it  darling its all yours youll marry me now  sir do you take me for a fortunehunter i marry you for your gold never  joan  ive promised she said  i wont go away now ill work my claim he began excitedly and he went on so rapidly that joan could not keep track of his words he was not so cautious as formerly she remonstrated with him all to no purpose not only was he carried away by possession of gold and assurance of more but he had become masterful obstinate and illogical he was indeed hopeless tonightthe gold had gotten into his blood joan grew afraid he would betray their secret and realized there had come still greater need for a womans wit so she resorted to a neverfailing means of silencing him of controlling himher lips on his     15  for several nights these stolen interviews were apparently the safer because of joans tender blinding of her lover but it seemed that in jims condition of mind this yielding of her lips and her whispers of love had really been a mistake not only had she made the situation perilously sweet for herself but in jims case she had added the spark to the powder she realized her blunder when it was too late and the fact that she did not regret it very much and seemed to have lost herself in a defiant reckless spell warned her again that she too was answering to the wildness of the time and place joans intelligence had broadened wonderfully in this period of her life just as all her feelings had quickened if gold had developed and intensified and liberated the worst passions of men so the spirit of that atmosphere had its baneful effect upon her joan deplored this yet she had the keenness to understand that it was nature fitting her to survive  back upon her fell that weight of suspensewhat would happen next here in alder creek there did not at present appear to be the same peril which had menaced her before but she would suffer through fatality to cleve or kells and these two slept at night under a shadow that held death and by day they walked on a thin crust over a volcano joan grew more and more fearful of the disclosures made when kells met his men nightly in the cabin she feared to hear but she must hear and even if she had not felt it necessary to keep informed of events the fascination of the game would have impelled her to listen and gradually the suspense she suffered augmented into a magnified though vague assurance of catastrophe of impending doom she could not shake off the gloomy presentiment something terrible was going to happen an experience begun as tragically as hers could only end in a final and annihilating stroke yet hope was unquenchable and with her fear kept pace a driving and relentless spirit  one night at the end of a week of these interviews when joan attempted to resist jim to plead with him lest in his growing boldness he betray them she found him a madman  ill pull you right out of this window he said roughly and then with his hot face pressed against hers tried to accomplish the thing he threatened  go onpull me to pieces replied joan in despair and pain id be better off dead andyouhurt meso  hurt you he whispered hoarsely as if he had never dreamed of such possibility and then suddenly he was remorseful he begged her to forgive him his voice was broken husky pleading his remorse like every feeling of his these days was exaggerated wild with that raw tinge of goldblood in it he made so much noise that joan more fearful than ever of discovery quieted him with difficulty  does kells see you oftenthese days asked jim suddenly  joan had dreaded this question which she had known would inevitably come she wanted to lie she knew she ought to lie but it was impossible  every day she whispered pleasejimnever mind that kells is goodhes all right to me and you and i have so little time together  good exclaimed cleve joan felt the leap of his body under her touch why if id tell you what he sends that gang to doyoudyoud kill him in his sleep  tell me replied joan she had a morbid irresistible desire to learn  no and what does kells dowhen he sees you every day  he talks  what about  oh everything except about what holds him here he talks to me to forget himself  does he make love to you  joan maintained silence what would she do with this changed and hopeless jim cleve  tell me jims hands gripped her with a force that made her wince and now she grew as afraid of him as she had been for him but she had spirit enough to grow angry also  certainly he does  jim cleve echoed her first word and then through grinding teeth he cursed im going tostop it he panted and his eyes looked big and dark and wild in the starlight  you cant i belong to kells you at least ought to have sense enough to see that  belong to him for gods sake by what right  by the right of possession might is right here on the border havent you told me that a hundred times dont you hold your claimyour goldby the right of your strength its the law of this border to be sure kells stole me but just now i belong to him and lately i see his considerationhis kindness in the light of what he could do if he held to that border law and of all the men ive met out here kells is the least wild with this gold fever he sends his men out to do murder for gold hed sell his soul to gamble for gold but just the same hes more of a man than  joan he interrupted piercingly you love this bandit  youre a fool burst out joan  i guessiam he replied in terrible slow earnestness he raised himself and appeared to loom over her and released his hold  but joan fearfully retained her clasp on his arm and when he surged to get away she was hard put to it to hold him  jim where are you going  he stood there a moment a dark form against the night shadow like an outline of a man cut from black stone  ill just step aroundthere  oh what for whispered joan  im going to kill kells  joan got both arms round his neck and with her head against him she held him tightly trying praying to think how to meet this longdreaded moment after all what was the use to try this was the hour of gold sacrifice hope courage nobility fidelitythese had no place here now men were the embodiment of passionferocity they breathed only possession and the thing in the balance was death women were creatures to hunger and fight for but womanhood was nothing joan knew all this with a desperate hardening certainty and almost she gave in strangely thought of gulden flashed up to make her again strong then she raised her face and began the old pleading with jim but different this time when it seemed that absolutely all was at stake she begged him she importuned him to listen to reason to be guided by her to fight the wildness that had obsessed him to make sure that she would not be left alone all in vain he swore he would kill kells and any other bandit who stood in the way of his leading her free out of that cabin he was wild to fight he might never have felt fear of these robbers he would not listen to any possibility of defeat for himself or the possibility that in the event of kellss death she would be worse off he laughed at her strange morbid fears of gulden he was immovable  jim jim youll break my heart she whispered wailingly oh what can i do  then joan released her clasp and gave up to utter defeat cleve was silent he did not seem to hear the shuddering little sobs that shook her suddenly he bent close to her  theres one thing you can do if youll do it i wont kill kells ill obey your every word  what is it tell me  marry me he whispered and his voice trembled  marry you exclaimed joan she was confounded she began to fear jim was out of his head  i mean it marry me oh joan will youwill you itll make the difference thatll steady me dont you want to  jim id be the happiest girl in the world ifif i only could marry you she breathed passionately  but will youwill you say yes say yes  yes replied joan in her desperation i hope that pleases you but what on earth is the use to talk about it now  cleve seemed to expand to grow taller to thrill under her nervous hands and then he kissed her differently she sensed a shyness a happiness a something hitherto foreign to his attitude it was spiritual and somehow she received an uplift of hope  listen he whispered theres a preacher down in camp ive seen himtalked with him hes trying to do good in that hell down there i know i can trust him ill confide in himenough ill fetch him up here tomorrow nightabout this time oh ill be carefulvery careful and he can marry us right here by the window joan will you do it somehow whatever threatens you or methatll be my salvation ive suffered so its been burned in my heart that you would never marry me yet you say you love me prove it my wife now girl a word will make a man of me  yes and with the word she put her lips to his with all her heart in them she felt him tremble yet almost instantly he put her from him  look for me tomorrow about this time he whispered keep your nerve good night  that night joan dreamed strange weird unremembered dreams the next day passed like a slow unreal age she ate little of what was brought to her for the first time she denied kells admittance and she only vaguely sensed his solicitations she had no ear for the murmur of voices in kellss room even the loud and angry notes of a quarrel between kells and his men did not distract her  at sunset she leaned out of the little window and only then with the gold fading on the peaks and the shadow gathering under the bluff did she awaken to reality a broken mass of white cloud caught the glory of the sinking sun she had never seen a golden radiance like that it faded and dulled but a warm glow remained at twilight and then at dusk this glow lingered  then night fell joan was exceedingly sensitive to the sensations of light and shadow of sound and silence of dread and hope of sadness and joy  that pale ruddy glow lingered over the bold heave of the range in the west it was like a fire that would not go out that would live tomorrow and burn golden the sky shone with deep rich blue color fired with a thousand stars radiant speaking hopeful and there was a white track across the heavens the mountains flung down their shadows impenetrable like the gloomy minds of men and everywhere under the bluffs and slopes in the hollows and ravines lay an enveloping blackness hiding its depth and secret and mystery  joan listened was there sound or silence a faint and indescribably low roar so low that it might have been real or false came on the soft night breeze it was the roar of the camp down therethe strife the agony the wild life in ceaseless actionthe strange voice of gold roaring greed and battle and death over the souls of men but above that presently rose the murmur of the creek a hushed and dreamy flow of water over stones it was hurrying to get by this horde of wild men for it must bear the taint of gold and blood would it purge itself and clarify in the valleys below on its way to the sea there was in its murmur an imperishable and deathless note of nature of time and this was only a fleeting day of men and gold  only by straining her ears could joan hear these sounds and when she ceased that then she seemed to be weighed upon and claimed by silence it was not a silence like that of lost canon but a silence of solitude where her soul stood alone she was there on earth yet no one could hear her mortal cry the thunder of avalanches or the boom of the sea might have lessened her sense of utter loneliness  and that silence fitted the darkness and both were apostles of dread they spoke to her she breathed dread on that silent air and it filled her breast there was nothing stable in the night shadows the ravine seemed to send forth stealthy noiseless shapes specter and human man and phantom each on the others trail  if jim would only come and let her see that he was safe for the hour a hundred times she imagined she saw him looming darker than the shadows she had only to see him now to feel his hand and dread might be lost love was something beyond the grasp of mind love had confounded jim cleve it had brought up kindness and honor from the black depths of a bandits heart it had transformed her from a girl into a woman surely with all its greatness it could not be lost surely in the end it must triumph over evil  joan found that hope was fluctuating but eternal it took no stock of intelligence it was a matter of feeling and when she gave rein to it for a moment suddenly it plunged her into sadness to hope was to think poor jim it was his fools paradise just to let her be his wife that was the apex of his dream joan divined that he might yield to her wisdom he might become a man but his agony would be greater still he had been so intense so strange so different that she could not but feel joy in his joy  then at a soft footfall a rustle and a moving shadow joans mingled emotions merged into a poignant sense of the pain and suspense and tenderness of the actual moment  joanjoan came the soft whisper  she answered and there was a catch in her breath  the moving shadow split into two shadows that stole closer loomed before her she could not tell which belonged to jim till he touched her his touch was potent it seemed to electrify her  dearest were herethis is the parson said jim like a happy boy i  ssssh whispered joan not so loud listen  kells was holding a rendezvous with members of his legion joan even recognized his hard and somber tone and the sharp voice of red pearce and the drawl of handy oliver  all right ill be quiet responded cleve cautiously joan youre to answer a few questions  then a soft hand touched joan and a voice differently keyed from any she had heard on the border addressed her  what is your name asked the preacher  joan told him  can you tell anything about yourself this young man isis almost violent im not sure still i want to  i cant tell much replied joan hurriedly im an honest girl im free toto marry him ii love him oh i want to help him wewe are in trouble here i darent say how  are you over eighteen yes sir  do your parents object to this young man  i have no parents and my uncle with whom i lived before i was brought to this awful place he loves jim he always wanted me to marry him  take his hand then  joan felt the strong clasp of jims fingers and that was all which seemed real at the moment it seemed so dark and shadowy round these two black forms in front of her window she heard a mournful wail of a lone wolf and it intensified the weird dream that bound her she heard her shaking whispered voice repeating the preachers words she caught a phrase of a lowmurmured prayer then one dark form moved silently away she was alone with jim  dearest joan he whispered its over its done kiss me  she lifted her lips and jim seemed to kiss her more sweetly with less violence  oh joan that youd really have me i cant believe it your husband  that word dispelled the dream and the pain which had held joan leaving only the tenderness magnified now a hundredfold  and that instant when she was locked in cleves arms when the silence was so beautiful and full she heard the heavy pound of a gunbutt upon the table in kellss room  where is cleve that was the voice of kells stern demanding  joan felt a start a tremor run over jim then he stiffened  i cant locate him replied red pearce it was the same last night an the one before cleve jest disappears these nightsabout this time some womans got him  he goes to bed cant you find where he sleeps  no  this jobs got to go through and hes got to do it  bah taunted pearce gulden swears you cant make cleve do a job and so do i  go out and yell for cleve damn you all ill show you  then joan heard the tramp of heavy boots then a softer tramp on the ground outside the cabin joan waited holding her breath she felt jims heart beating he stood like a post he like joan was listening as if for a trumpet of doom  hallo jim rang out pearces stentorian call it murdered the silence it boomed under the bluff and clapped in echo and wound away mockingly it seemed to have shrieked to the whole wild borderland the breakingpoint of the bandits power  so momentous was the call that jim cleve seemed to forget joan and she let him go without a word indeed he was gone before she realized it and his dark form dissolved in the shadows joan waited listening with abated breathing on this side of the cabin there was absolute silence she believed that jim would slip around under cover of night and return by the road from camp then what would he do the question seemed to puzzle her  joan leaned there at her window for moments greatly differing from those vaguely happy ones just passed she had sustained a shock that had left her benumbed with a dull pain what a rude raw break the voice of kells had made in her brief forgetfulness she was returning now to reality presently she would peer through the crevice between the boards into the other room and she shrank from the ordeal kells and whoever was with him maintained silence occasionally she heard the shuffle of a boot and a creak of the loose floor boards she waited till anxiety and fear compelled her to look  the lamps were burning the door was wide open apparently kellss rule of secrecy had been abandoned one glance at kells was enough to show joan that he was sick and desperate handy oliver did not wear his usual lazy good humor red pearce sat silent and sullen a smoking unheeded pipe in his hand jesse smith was gloomy the only other present was bate wood and whatever had happened had in no wise affected him these bandits were all waiting presently quick footsteps on the path outside caused them all to look toward the door that tread was familiar to joan and suddenly her mouth was dry her tongue stiff what was jim cleve coming to meet how sharp and decided his walk then his dark form crossed the bar of light outside the door and he entered bold and cool and with a weariness that must have been simulated  howdy boys he said  only kells greeted him in response the bandit eyed him curiously the others added suspicion to their glances  did you hear reds yell queried kells presently  id have heard that roar if id been dead replied cleve bluntly and i didnt like it i was coming up the road and i heard pearce yell ill bet every man in camp heard it  howd you know pearce yelled for you  i recognized his voice  cleves manner recalled to joan her first sight of him over in cabin gulch he was not so white or haggard but his eyes were piercing and what had once been recklessness now seemed to be boldness he deliberately studied pearce joan trembled for she divined what none of these robbers knew and it was that pearce was perilously near death it was there for joan to read in jims dark glance  whereve you been all these nights queried the bandit leader  is that any of your businesswhen you havent had need of me returned cleve  yes its my business and ive sent for you you couldnt be found  ive been here for supper every night  i dont talk to any men in daylight you know my hours for meeting and youve not come  you should have told me how was i to know  i guess youre right but whereve you been  down in camp faro most of the time bad luck too  red pearces coarse face twisted into a scornful sneer it must have been a lash to kells  pearce says youre chasing a woman retorted the bandit leader  pearce lies flashed cleve his action was as swift and there he stood with a gun thrust hard against pearces side  jim dont kill him yelled kells rising  pearces red face turned white he stood still as a stone with his gaze fixed in fascinated fear upon cleves gun  a paralyzing surprise appeared to hold the group  can you prove what you said asked cleve low and hard  joan knew that if pearce did have the proof which would implicate her he would never live to tell it  clevei dontknow nothin choked out pearce i jest figgeredit was a woman  cleve slowly lowered the gun and stepped back evidently that satisfied him but joan had an intuitive feeling that pearce lied  you want to be careful how you talk about me said cleve  kells purled out a suspended breath and he flung the sweat from his brow there was about him perhaps more than the others a dark realization of how close the call had been for pearce  jim youre not drunk  no  but youre sore  sure im sore pearce put me in bad with you didnt he  no you misunderstood me red hasnt a thing against you and neither he nor anybody else could put you in bad with me  all right maybe i was hasty but im not wasting time these days replied cleve ive no hard feelings pearce do you want to shake handsor hold that against me  hell shake of course said kells  pearce extended his hand but with a bad grace he was dominated this affront of cleves would rankle in him  kells what do you want with me demanded cleve  a change passed over kells and joan could not tell just what it was but somehow it seemed to suggest a weaker man  jim youve been a great card for me began kells impressively youve helped my gameand twice you saved my life i think a lot of you if you stand by me now i swear ill return the trick some day will you stand by me  yes replied cleve steadily but he grew pale whats the trouble  by its bad enough exclaimed kells and as he spoke the shade deepened in his haggard face gulden has split my legion he has drawn away more than half my men they have been drunk and crazy ever since theyve taken things into their own hands you see the result as well as i that camp down there is fire and brimstone some one of that drunken gang has talked were none of us safe any more i see suspicion everywhere ive urged getting a big stake and then hitting the trail for the border but not a man sticks to me in that they all want the free easy wild life of this goldcamp so were anchored tilltill but maybe its not too late pearce oliver smithall the best of my legionprofess loyalty to me if we all pull together maybe we can win yet but theyve threatened to split too and its all on your account  mine ejaculated cleve  yes now its nothing to make you flash your gun remember you said youd stand by me jim the fact isall the gang to a man believe youre doublecrossing me  in what way queried cleve blanching  they think youre the one who has talked they blame you for the suspicion thats growing  well theyre absolutely wrong declared cleve in a ringing voice  i know they are mind you im not hinting i distrust you i dont i swear by you but pearce  so its pearce interrupted cleve darkly i thought you said he hadnt tried to put me in bad with you  he hasnt he simply spoke his convictions he has a right to them so have all the men and to come to the point they all think youre crooked because youre honest  i dont understand replied cleve slowly  jim you rode into cabin gulch and you raised some trouble but you were no bandit you joined my legion but youve never become a bandit here youve been an honest miner that suited my plan and it helped but its got so it doesnt suit my men you work every day hard youve struck it rich youre well thought of in alder creek youve never done a dishonest thing why you wouldnt turn a crooked trick in a card game for a sack full of gold this has hurt you with my men they cant see as i see that youre as square as you are game they see youre an honest miner they believe youve got into a cliquethat youve given us away i dont blame pearce or any of my men this is a time when mens intelligence if they have any doesnt operate their brains are on fire they see gold and whisky and blood and they feel gold and whisky and blood thats all im glad that the gang gives you the benefit of a doubt and a chance to stand by me  a chance  yes theyve worked out a job for you alone will you undertake it  ill have to replied cleve  you certainly will if you want the gang to justify my faith in you once you pull off a crooked deal theyll switch and swear by you then well get together all of us and plan what to do about gulden and his outfit theyll run our heads along with their own right into the noose  what is thisthis job labored cleve he was sweating now and his hair hung damp over his brow he lost that look which had made him a bold man and seemed a boy again weak driven bewildered  kells averted his gaze before speaking again he hated to force this task upon cleve joan felt in the throbbing pain of the moment that if she never had another reason to like this bandit she would like him for the pity he showed  do you know a miner named creede asked kells rapidly  a husky chap short broad something like gulden for shape only not so bigfellow with a fierce red beard asked cleve  i never saw him replied kells but pearce has how does cleves description fit creede  hes got his man spotted answered pearce  all right thats settled went on kells warming to his subject this fellow creede wears a heavy belt of gold blicky never makes a mistake creedes partner left on yesterdays stage for bannack hell be gone a few days creede is a hard workerone of the hardest sometimes he goes to sleep at his supper hes not the drinking kind hes slow thickheaded the best time for this job will be early in the eveningjust as soon as his lights are out locate the tent it stands at the head of a little wash and theres a bleached pinetree right by the tent tomorrow night as soon as it gets dark crawl up this washbe carefulwait till the right timethen finish the job quick  howfinishit asked cleve hoarsely  kells was scintillating now steely cold radiant he had forgotten the man before him in the prospect of the gold  creedes cot is on the side of the tent opposite the tree you wont have to go inside slit the canvas its a rotten old tent kill creede with your knife get his belt be bold cautious swift thats your job now what do you say  all right responded cleve somberly and with a heavy tread he left the room  after jim had gone joan still watched and listened she was in distress over his unfortunate situation but she had no fear that he meant to carry out kellss plan this was a critical time for jim and therefore for her she had no idea what jim could do all she thought was what he would not do  kells gazed triumphantly at pearce i told you the youngster would stand by me i never put him on a job before  reckon i figgered wrong boss replied pearce  he looked sick to me but game said handy oliver kells is right red an youve been soreheaded over nothin  mebbe but aint it good figgerin to make cleve do some kind of a job even if he is on the square  they all acquiesced to this even kells slowly nodding his head  jack ive thought of another an better job for young cleve spoke up jesse smith with his characteristic grin  youll all be setting him jobs now replied kells whats yours  you spoke of plannin to get together once morewhats left of us an theres thet bullhead gulden  youre sure right returned the leader grimly and he looked at smith as if he would welcome any suggestion  i never was afraid to speak my mind went on smith here he lost his grin and his coarse mouth grew hard gulden will have to be killed if were goin to last  wood what do you say queried kells with narrowing eyes  bate wood nodded as approvingly as if he had been asked about his bread  oliver what do you say  wal id love to wait an see gul hang but if you press me ill agree to stand pat with the cards jesses dealt replied handy oliver  then kells turned with a bright gleam upon his face and youpearce  id say yes in a minute if id not have to take a hand in thet job replied pearce with a hard laugh gulden wont be so easy to kill hell pack a gunful of lead ill gamble if the gang of us cornered him in this cabin hed do for most of us before we killed him  gul sleep alone no one knows where said handy oliver an he cant be surprised reds correct howre we goin to kill him  if you gents will listen youll find out rejoined jesse smith thets the job for young cleve he can do it sure gulden never was afraid of any man but somethin about cleve bluffed him i dont know what send cleve out after gulden hell call him face to face anywhere an beat him to a gun take my word for it  jesse thats the grandest idea you ever had said kells softly his eyes shone the old power came back to his face i split on gulden with him once out of the way  boss are you goin to make thet jim cleves second job inquired pearce curiously  i am replied kells with his jaw corded and stiff if he pulls thet off youll never hear a yap from me so long as i live an ill eat out of cleves hand  joan could bear to hear no more she staggered to her bed and fell there all cramped as if in a cold vise however jim might meet the situation planned for murdering creede she knew he would not shirk facing gulden with deadly intent he hated gulden because she had a horror of him would these hours of suspense never end must she pass from one torture to another until  sleep did not come for a long time and when it did she suffered with nightmares from which it seemed she could never awaken  the day when at last it arrived was no better than the night it wore on endlessly and she who listened so intently found it one of the silent days only bate wood remained at the cabin he appeared kinder than usual but joan did not want to talk she ate her meals and passed the hours watching from the window and lying on the bed dusk brought kells and pearce and smith but not jim cleve handy oliver and blicky arrived at suppertime  reckon jims appetite is pore remarked bate wood reflectively he aint been in today  some of the bandits laughed but kells had a twinge if joan ever saw a man have one the dark formidable stern look was on his face he alone of the men ate sparingly and after the meal he took to his bent posture and thoughtful pacing joan saw the added burden of another crime upon his shoulders conversation which had been desultory and such as any miners or campers might have indulged in gradually diminished to a word here and there and finally ceased kells always at this hour had a dampening effect upon his followers more and more he drew aloof from them yet he never realized that he might have been alone but often he glanced out of the door and appeared to listen of course he expected jim cleve to return but what did he expect of him joan had a blind faith that jim would be cunning enough to fool kells and pearce so much depended upon it  some of the bandits uttered an exclamation then silently like a shadow jim cleve entered  joans heart leaped and seemed to stand still jim could not have locked more terrible if he were really a murderer he opened his coat then he flung a black object upon the table and it fell with a soft heavy sodden thud it was a leather belt packed with gold  when kells saw that he looked no more at the pale cleve his clawlike hand swept out for the belt lifted and weighed it likewise the other bandits with gold in sight surged round kells forgetting cleve  twenty pounds exclaimed kells with a strange rapture in his voice  let me heft it asked pearce thrillingly  joan saw and heard so much then through a kind of dimness that she could not wipe away her eyes beheld jim what was the awful thing that she interpreted from his face his mien was this a part he was playing to deceive kells the slowgathering might of her horror came with the meaning of that goldbelt jim had brought back the goldbelt of the miner creede he had in his passion to remain near her to save her in the end kept his word to kells and done the ghastly deed  joan reeled and sank back upon the bed blindly with darkening sight and mind     16  joan returned to consciousness with a sense of vague and unlocalized pain which she thought was that old familiar pang of grief but once fully awakened as if by a sharp twinge she became aware that the pain was some kind of muscular throb in her shoulder the instant she was fully sure of this the strange feeling ceased then she lay wideeyed in the darkness waiting and wondering  suddenly the slight sharp twing was repeated it seemed to come from outside her flesh she shivered a little thinking it might be a centipede when she reached for her shoulder her hand came in contact with a slender stick that had been thrust through a crack between the boards jim was trying to rouse her this had been his method on several occasions when she had fallen asleep after waiting long for him  joan got up to the window dizzy and sick with the resurging memory of jims return to kells with that goldbelt  jim rose out of the shadow and felt for her clasped her close joan had none of the old thrill her hands slid loosely round his and every second the weight inwardly grew heavier  joan i had a time waking you whispered jim and then he kissed her why youre as cold as ice  jimii must have fainted she replied  what for i was peeping into kellss cabin when youyou  poor kid he interrupted tenderly youve had so much to bear joan i fooled kells oh i was slick he ordered me out on a jobto kill a miner fancy that and what do you think i know creede well hes a good fellow i traded my big nugget for his goldbelt  you tradedyoudidntkill him faltered joan  hear the child talk exclaimed cleve with a low laugh  joan suddenly clung to him with all her might quivering in a silent joy it had not occurred to jim what she might have thought  listen he went on i traded my nugget it was worth a great deal more than creedes goldbelt he knew this he didnt want to trade but i coaxed him i persuaded him to leave campto walk out on the road to bannack to meet the stage somewhere and go on to bannack and stay a few days he sure was curious but i kept my secret then i came back here gave the belt to kells told him i had followed creede in the dark had killed him and slid him into a deep hole in the creek kells and pearcenone of them paid any attention to my story i had the goldbelt that was enough gold talksfills the ears of these bandits i have my share of creedes golddust in my pocket isnt that funny alas for myyour big nugget but weve got to play the game besides ive sacks and cans of gold hidden away joan whatll we do with it all youre my wife now and oh if we can only get away with it youll be rich  joan could not share his happiness any more than she could understand his spirit she remembered  jimdeardid kells tell you what yournext job was to be she whispered haltingly  cleve swore under his breath but loud enough to make joan swiftly put her hand over his lips and caution him  joan did you hear that about gulden he asked  oh yes  im sorry i didnt mean to tell you yes ive got my second job and this one i cant shirk or twist around  joan held to him convulsively she could scarcely speak  girl dont lose your nerve he said sternly when you married me you made me a man ill play my end of the game dont fear for me you plan when we can risk escape ill obey you to the word  but jimoh jim she moaned youre as wild as these bandits you cant see your danger that terrible gulden you dont mean to meet himfight him say you wont  joan ill meet himand ill kill him whispered jim with a piercing intensity you never knew i was swift with a gun well i didnt either till i struck the border i know now kells is the only man ive seen who can throw a gun quicker than i gulden is a big bull hes slow ill get into a cardgame with himill quarrel over goldill smash him as i did once beforeand this time i wont shoot off his ear ive my nerve now kells swore hed do anything for me if i stand by him now i will you never can tell kells is losing his grip and my standing by him may save you  joan drew a deep breath jim cleve had indeed come into manhood she crushed down her womanish fears and rose dauntless to the occasion she would never weaken him by a lack of confidence  jim kellss plot draws on to a fatal close she said earnestly i feel it hes doomed he doesnt realize that yet he hopes and plots on when he falls then hell be greatterrible we must get away before that comes what you said about creede has given me an idea suppose we plan to slip out some night soon and stop the stage next day on its way to bannack  ive thought of that but we must have horses  lets go afoot wed be safer thered not be so much to plan  but if we go on foot we must pack guns and gruband theres my golddust fifty pounds or more its yours joan youll need it all you love pretty clothes and things and now ill get them for you oror die  hush thats foolish talk with our very lives at stake let me plan some more oh i think so hard and jim theres another thing red pearce was more than suspicious about your absence from the cabin at certain hours what he hinted to kells about a woman in the case im afraid he suspects or knows  he had me cold too replied cleve thoughtfully but he swore he knew nothing  jim trust a womans instinct pearce lied that gun at his side made him a liar he knew youd kill him if he betrayed himself by a word oh look out for him  cleve did not reply it struck joan that he was not listening at least to her his head was turned rigid and alert he had his ear to the soft wind suddenly joan heard a faint rustlethen another they appeared to come from the corner of the cabin silently cleve sank down into the shadow and vanished low stealthy footsteps followed but joan was not sure whether or not cleve made them they did not seem to come from the direction he usually took besides when he was careful he never made the slightest noise joan strained her ears only to catch the faint sounds of the night she lay back upon her bed worried and anxious again and soon the dread returned there were to be no waking or sleeping hours free from this portent of calamity  next morning joan awaited kells as was her custom but he did not appear this was the third time in a week that he had forgotten or avoided her or had been prevented from seeing her joan was glad yet the fact was not reassuring the issue for kells was growing from trouble to disaster  early in the afternoon she heard kells returning from camp he had men with him they conversed in low earnest tones joan was about to spy up on them when kellss step approached her door he rapped and spoke  put on dandy dales suit and mask and come out here he said  the tone of his voice as much as the content of his words startled joan so that she did not at once reply  do you hear he called sharply  yes replied joan  then he went back to his men and the low earnest conversation was renewed  reluctantly joan took down dandy dales things from the pegs and with a recurring shame she divested herself of part of her clothes and donned the suit and boots and mask and gun her spirit rose however at the thought that this would be a disguise calculated to aid her in the escape with cleve but why had kells ordered the change was he in danger and did he mean to flee from alder creek joan found the speculation a relief from that haunting persistent thought of jim cleve and gulden she was eager to learn still she hesitated at the door it was just as hard as ever to face those men  but it must be so with a wrench she stepped out boldly  kells looked worn and gray he had not slept but his face did not wear the shade she had come to associate with his gambling and drinking six other men were present and joan noted coats and gloves and weapons and spurs kells turned to address her his face lighted fleetingly  i want you to be ready to ride any minute he said  why asked joan  we may have to thats all he replied  his men usually so keen when they had a chance to ogle joan now scarcely gave her a glance they were a dark grim group with hard eyes and tight lips handy oliver was speaking  i tell you gulden swore he seen creedeon the roadin the lamplightlast night after jim cleve got here  gulden must have been mistaken declared kells impatiently  he aint the kind to make mistakes replied oliver  guls seen creedes ghost thets what suggested blicky uneasily ive seen a few in my time  some of the bandits nodded gloomily  aw burst out red pearce gulden never seen a ghost in his life if he seen creede hes seen him alive  shore youre right red agreed jesse smith  but mencleve brought in creedes beltand weve divided the gold said kells you all know creede would have to be dead before that belt could be unbuckled from him theres a mistake  boss its my idee thet gul is only makin more trouble put in bate wood i seen him less than an hour ago i was the first one gul talked to an he knew jim cleve did for creede howd he know thet was supposed to be a secret whats more gul told me cleve was on the job to kill him howd he ever find thet out sure as god made little apples cleve never told him  kellss face grew livid and his whole body vibrated maybe one of guldens gang was outside listening when we planned cleves job he suggested but his look belied his hope  naw theres a nigger in the woodpile you can gamble on thet blurted out the sixth bandit a lean faced boldeye blondmustached fellow whose name joan had never heard  i wont believe it replied kells doggedly and you budd youre accusing somebody present of treacheryor else cleve hes the only one not here who knew  wal i always said thet youngster was slick replied budd  will you accuse him to his face  i shore will glad of the chance  then youre drunk or just a fool  thet so  yes thats so flashed kells you dont know cleve hell kill you hes lightning with a gun do you suppose id set him on guldens trail if i wasnt sure why i wouldnt care to  here comes cleve interrupted pearce sharply  rapid footsteps sounded without then joan saw jim cleve darken the doorway he looked keen and bold upon sight of joan in her changed attire he gave a slight start  budd heres cleve called out red pearce mockingly now say it to his face  in the silence that ensued pearces spirit dominated the moment with its cunning hate and violence but kells savagely leaped in front of the men still master of the situation  red whats got into you he hissed youre crossgrained lately youre sore any more of this and ill swear youre a disorganizer now budd you keep your mouth shut and you cleve you pay no heed to budd if he does gab were in bad and all the men have chips on their shoulders weve got to stop fighting among ourselves  wal boss theres a power of sense in a good example dryly remarked bate wood his remark calmed kells and eased the situation  jim did you meet gulden queried kells eagerly  cant find him anywhere replied cleve ive loafed in the saloons and gamblinghells where he hangs out but he didnt show up hes in camp i know that for a fact hes laying low for some reason  guldens been tipped off jim said kells earnestly he told bate wood you were out to kill him  im glad it wasnt a fair hand you were going to deal him responded cleve but who gave my job away someone in this gang wants me done formore than gulden  cleves flashing gaze swept over the motionless men and fixed hardest upon red pearce pearce gave back hard look for hard look  gulden told oliver more continued kells and he pulled cleve around to face him gulden swore he saw creede alive last night late last night  thats funny replied cleve without the flicker of an eyelash  its not funny but its queer gulden hasnt the moral sense to lie bate says he wants to make trouble between you and me i doubt that i dont believe gulden could see a ghost either hes simply mistaken some miner for creede  he sure has unless creede came back to life im not sitting on his chest now holding him down  kells drew back manifestly convinced and relieved this action seemed to be a magnet for pearce he detached himself from the group and approaching kells tapped him significantly on the shoulder and whether by design or accident the fact was that he took a position where kells was between him and cleve  jack youre being doublecrossed herean by more n one he said deliberately but if you want me to talk youve got to guarantee no gunplay  speak up red replied kells with a glinting eye i swear there wont be a gun pulled  the other men shifted from one foot to another and there were deepdrawn breaths jim cleve alone seemed quiet and cool but his eyes were ablaze  fust off an for instance heres one whos doublecrossin you said pearce in slow tantalizing speech as if he wore out this suspense to torture kells and without ever glancing at joan he jerked a thumb in significant gesture at her  joan leaned back against the wall trembling and cold all over she read pearces mind he knew her secret and meant to betray her and jim he hated kells and wanted to torture him if only she could think quickly and speak but she seemed dumb and powerless  pearce what do you mean demanded kells  the girls doublecrossin you replied pearce with the uttered words he grew pale and agitated  suddenly kells appeared to become aware of joans presence and that the implication was directed toward her then many and remarkable as had been the changes joan had seen come over him now occurred one wholly greater it had all his old amiability his cool easy manner veiling a deep and hidden ruthlessness terrible in contrast  red i thought our talk concerned men and gold andthings he said with a cool slow softness that had a sting but since youve nerve enough or are crazy enough to speak ofherwhy explain your meaning  pearces jaw worked so that he could scarcely talk he had gone too farrealized it too late  she meets a manback thereat her window he panted they whisper in the dark for hours ive watched an heard them an id told you before but i wanted to make sure who he was i know him now an remember i seen him climb in an out  kellss whole frame leaped his gun was a flash of blue and red and white all together pearce swayed upright like a tree chopped at the roots and then fell face up eyes setdead the bandit leader stood over him with the smoking gun  my gawd jack gasped handy oliver you swore no one would pull a gunan here youve killed him yourself youve doublecrossed yourself an if i die for it ive got to tell you red wasnt lyin then  kellss radiance fled leaving him ghastly he stared at oliver  youve doublecrossed yourself an your pards went on oliver pathetically whats your word amount to do you expect the gang to stand for this there lays red pearce dead an for what jest oncerelyin on your oathhe speaks out what might have showed you an you kill him if i knowed what he knowed id tell you now with thet gun in your hand but i dont know only i know he wasnt lyin ask the girl an as for me i reckon im through with you an your legion youre done kellsyour heads goneyouve broke over thet slip of a woman  oliver spoke with a rude and impressive dignity when he ended he strode out into the sunlight  kells was shaken by this forceful speech yet he was not in any sense a broken man joanyou heard pearce said he passionately he lied about you i had to kill him he hintedoh the lowlived dog he could not know a good woman he liedand there he isdead i wouldnt fetch him back for a hundred legions  but itit wasntalla lie said joan and her words came haltingly because a force stronger than her cunning made her speak she had reached a point where she could not deceive kells to save her life  what he thundered  pearce told the truthexcept that no one ever climbed in my window thats false no one could climb in its too small but i did whisperto someone  kells had to moisten his lips to speak who  ill never tell you  who ill kill him  nono i wont tell i wont let you kill another man on my account  ill choke it out of you  you cant theres no use to threaten me or hurt me either  kells seemed dazed whisper for hours in the dark but joan what for why such a risk  joan shook her head  were you just unhappylonesome did some young miner happen to see you there in daylightthen come at night wasnt it only accident tell me  i wontand i wont because i dont want you to spill more blood  for my sake he queried with the old mocking tone then he grew dark with blood in his face fierce with action of hands and body as he bent nearer her maybe you like him too well to see him shot did youwhisper often to this stranger  joan felt herself weakening kells was so powerful in spirit and passion that she seemed unable to fight him she strove to withhold her reply but it burst forth involuntarily  yesoften  that roused more than anger and passion jealousy flamed from him and it transformed him into a devil  you held hands out of that windowand kissedin the dark he cried with working lips  joan had thought of this so fearfully and intenselyshe had battled so to fortify herself to keep it secretthat he had divined it had read her mind she could not control herself the murder of pearce had almost overwhelmed her she had not the strength to bite her tongue suggestion alone would have drawn her thenand kellss passionate force was hypnotic  yes she whispered  he appeared to control a developing paroxysm of rage  that settles you he declared darkly but ill do one more decent thing by you ill marry you then he wheeled to his men blicky theres a parson down in camp go on the run fetch him back if you have to push him with a gun  blicky darted through the door and his footsteps thudded out of hearing  you cant force me to marry you said joan ii wont open my lips  thats your affair ive no mind to coax you he replied bitterly but if you dont ill try guldens way with a woman you remember guldens way a cave and a rope  joans legs gave out under her and she sank upon a pile of blankets then beyond kells she saw jim cleve with all that was left of her spirit she flashed him a warninga meaninga prayer not to do the deed she divined was his deadly intent he caught it and obeyed and he flashed back a glance which meant that desperate as her case was it could never be what kells threatened  men see me through this said kells to the silent group then any deal you wantim on stay here orsack the camp hold up the stage express with gold for bannack anything for a big stake then the trail and the border  he began pacing the floor budd and smith strolled outside bate wood fumbled in his pockets for pipe and tobacco cleve sat down at the table and leaned on his hands no one took notice of the dead pearce here was somber and terrible sign of the wildness of the border clanthat kells could send out for a parson to marry him to a woman he hopelessly loved there in the presence of murder and death with pearces distorted face upturned in stark and ghastly significance  it might have been a quarter of an hour though to joan it seemed an endless time until footsteps and voices outside announced the return of blicky  he held by the arm a slight man whom he was urging along with no gentle force this strangers face presented as great a contrast to blickys as could have been imagined his apparel proclaimed his calling there were consternation and bewilderment in his expression but very little fear  he was preachin down there in a tent said blicky an i jest waltzed him up without explainin  sir i want to be married at once declared kells peremptorily  certainly im at your service replied the preacher but i deplore thethe manner in which ive been approached  youll excuse haste rejoined the bandit ill pay you well kells threw a small buckskin sack of golddust upon the table and then he turned to joan come joan he said in the tone that brooked neither resistance nor delay  it was at that moment that the preacher first noticed joan was her costume accountable for his start joan had remembered his voice and she wondered if he would remember hers certainly jim had called her joan more than once on the night of the marriage the preachers eyes grew keener he glanced from joan to kells and then at the other men who had come in jim cleve stood behind jesse smiths broad person and evidently the preacher did not see him that curious gaze however next discovered the dead man on the floor then to the curiosity and anxiety upon the preachers face was added horror  a minister of god is needed here but not in the capacity you name he said ill perform no marriage ceremony in the presence ofmurder  mr preacher youll marry me quick or youll go along with him replied kells deliberately  i cannot be forced the preacher still maintained some dignity but he had grown pale  i can force you get ready now joan come here  kells spoke sternly yet something of the old selfmocking spirit was in his tone his intelligence was deriding the flesh and blood of him the beast the fool it spoke that he would have his way and that the choice was fatal for him  joan shook her head in one stride kells reached her and swung her spinning before him the physical violence acted strangely upon joanroused her rage  i wouldnt marry you to save my lifeeven if i could she burst out  at her declaration the preacher gave a start that must have been suspicion or confirmation or both he bent low to peer into the face of the dead pearce when he arose he was shaking his head evidently he had decided that pearce was not the man to whom he had married joan  please remove your mask he said to joan  she did so swiftly without a tremor the preacher peered into her face again as he had upon the night he had married her to jim he faced kells again  i am beyond your threats he said now with calmness i cant marry you to a woman who already has a husband but i dont see that husband here  you dont see that husband here echoed the bewildered kells he stared with open mouth say have you got a screw loose  the preacher in his swift glance had apparently not observed the halfhidden cleve certainly it appeared now that he would have no attention for any other than kells the bandit was a study his astonishment was terrific and held him like a chain suddenly he lurched  what did you say he roared his face flaming  i cant marry you to a woman who already has a husband  swift as light the red flashed out of kellss face did you ever see her before he asked  yes replied the preacher  where and when  hereat the back of this cabina few nights ago  it hurt joan to look at kells now yet he seemed wonderful to behold she felt as guilty as if she had really been false to him her heart labored high in her breast this was the climaxthe moment of catastrophe another word and jim cleve would be facing kells the blood pressure in joans throat almost strangled her  at the back of this cabin at her window  yes  what were you there for  in my capacity as minister i was summoned to marry her  to marry her gasped kells  yes she is joan randle from hoadley idaho she is over eighteen i understood she was detained here against her will she loved an honest young miner of the camp he brought me up here one night and i married them  youmarriedthem  yes  kells was slow in assimilating the truth and his action corresponded with his mind slowly his hand moved toward his gun he drew it threw it aloft and then all the terrible evil in the man flamed forth but as he deliberately drew down on the preacher blicky leaped forward and knocked up the gun flash and report followed the discharge went into the roof blicky grasped kellss arm and threw his weight upon it to keep it down  i fetched thet parson here he yelled an you aint agoin to kill him help jesse hes crazy hell do it  jesse smith ran to blickys aid and tore the gun out of kellss hand jim cleve grasped the preacher by the shoulders and whirling him around sent him flying out of the door  run for your life he shouted  blicky and jesse smith were trying to hold the lunging kells  jim you block the door called jesse bate you grab any loose guns an knives now boss rant an be damned  they released kells and backed away leaving him the room joans limbs seemed unable to execute her will  joan its true he exclaimed with whistling breath  yes  who he bellowed  ill never tell  he reached for her with hands like claws as if he meant to tear her rend her joan was helpless weak terrified those shaking clutching hands reached for her throat and yet never closed round it kells wanted to kill her but he could not he loomed over her dark speechless locked in his paroxysm of rage perhaps then came a realization of ruin through her he hated her because he loved her he wanted to kill her because of that hate yet he could not harm her even hurt her and his soul seemed in conflict with two giantsthe evil in him that was hate and the love that was good suddenly he flung her aside she stumbled over pearces body almost falling and staggered back to the wall kells had the center of the room to himself like a mad steer in a corral he gazed about stupidly seeking some way to escape but the escape kells longed for was from himself then either he let himself go or was unable longer to control his rage he began to plunge around his actions were violent random half insane he seemed to want to destroy himself and everything but the weapons were guarded by his men and the room contained little he could smash there was something magnificent in his fury yet childish and absurd even under its influence and his abandonment he showed a consciousness of its futility in a few moments the inside of the cabin was in disorder and kells seemed a disheveled sweating panting wretch the rapidity and violence of his action coupled with his fury soon exhausted him he fell from plunging here and there to pacing the floor and even the dignity of passion passed from him he looked a hopeless beaten stricken man conscious of defeat  jesse smith approached the bandit leader jack heres your gun he said i only took it because you was out of your head an listen boss theres a few of us left  that was smiths expression of fidelity and kells received it with a pallid grateful smile  bate you an jim clean up this mess went on smith an blicky come here an help me with pearce well have to plant him  the stir begun by the men was broken by a sharp exclamation from cleve  kells here comes guldenbeady jones williams beard  the bandit raised his head and paced back to where he could look out  bate wood made a violent and significant gesture somethin wrong he said hurriedly an its moren to do with gul look down the road see thet gang all excited an wavin hands an runnin but theyre goin down into camp  jesse smith turned a gray face toward kells boss theres hell to pay ive seen thet kind of excitement before  kells thrust the men aside and looked out he seemed to draw upon a reserve strength for he grew composed even while he gazed jim get in the other room he ordered sharply joanyou go too keep still  joan hurried to comply jim entered after her and closed the door instinctively they clasped hands drew close together  jim what does it mean she whispered fearfully gulden  he must be looking for me replied jim but theres more doing did you see that crowd down the road  no i couldnt see out  listen  heavy tramp boots sounded without silently joan led jim to the crack between the boards through which she had spied upon the bandits jim peeped through and joan saw his hand go to his gun then she looked  gulden was being crowded into the cabin by fierce bulgingjawed men who meant some kind of dark business the strangest thing about that entrance was its silence in a moment they were inside confronting kells with his little group beard jones williams former faithful allies of kells showed a malignant opposition and the huge gulden resembled an enraged gorilla for an instant his great pale cavernous eyes glared he had one hand under his coat and his position had a sinister suggestion but kells stood cool and sure when gulden moved kellss gun was leaping forth but he withheld his fire for gulden had only a heavy round object wrapped in a handkerchief  look there he boomed and he threw the object on the table  the dull heavy sodden thump had a familiar ring joan heard jim gasp and his hand tightened spasmodically upon hers  slowly the ends of the red scarf slid down to reveal an irregularly round glinting lump when joan recognized it her heart seemed to burst  jim cleves nugget ejaculated kells whered you get that  gulden leaned across the table his massive jaw working i found it on the miner creede replied the giant stridently  then came a nervous shuffling of boots on the creaky boards in the silence a low dull murmur of distant voices could be heard strangely menacing kells stood transfixed white as a sheet  on creede  yes  where was hishis body  i left it out on the bannack trail  the bandit leader appeared mute  kells i followed creede out of camp last night fiercely declared gulden i killed him i found this nugget on him     17  apparently to kells that nugget did not accuse jim cleve of treachery not only did this possibility seem lost upon the bandit leader but also the sinister intent of gulden and his associates  then jim didnt kill creede cried kells  a strange light flashed across his face it fitted the note of gladness in his exclamation how strange that in his amaze there should be relief instead of suspicion joan thought she understood kells he was glad that he had not yet made a murderer out of cleve  gulden appeared slow in rejoining i told you i got creede he said and we want to know if this says to you what it says to us  his huge hairy hand tapped the nugget then kells caught the implication  what does it say to you he queried coolly and he eyed gulden and then the grim men behind him  somebody in the gang is crooked somebodys giving you the doublecross weve known that for long jim cleve goes out to kill creede he comes in with creedes goldbeltand a lie we think cleve is the crooked one  no youre way off gulden replied kells earnestly that boy is absolutely square hes lied to me about creede but i can excuse that he lost his nerve hes only a youngster to knife a man in his sleepthat was too much for jim and im glad i see it all now jims swapped his big nugget for creedes belt and in the bargain he exacted that creede hit the trail out of camp you happened to see creede and went after him yourself well i dont see where youve any kick coming for youve ten times the money in cleves nugget that there was in a share of creedes gold  thats not my kick declared gulden what you say about cleve may be true but i dont believe it and the gang is sore things have leaked out were watched were not welcome in the gamblingplaces any more last night i was not allowed to sit in the game at belchers  you think cleve has squealed queried kells  yes  ill bet you every ounce of dust ive got that youre wrong declared kells a straight square bet against anything you want to put up  kellss ringing voice was nothing if not convincing  appearances are against cleve growled gulden dubiously always he had been swayed by the stronger mind of the leader  sure they are agreed kells  then what do you base your confidence on  just my knowledge of men jim cleve wouldnt squeal gulden did anybody tell you that  yes replied gulden slowly red pearce  pearce was a liar said kells bitterly i shot him for lying to me  gulden stared his men muttered and gazed at one another and around the cabin  pearce told me you set cleve to kill me suddenly spoke up the giant  if he expected to surprise kells he utterly failed  thats another and bigger lie replied the bandit leader disgustedly gulden do you think my minds gone  not quite replied gulden and he seemed as near a laugh as was possible for him  well ive enough mind left not to set a boy to kill such a man as you  gulden might have been susceptible to flattery he turned to his men they too had felt kellss subtle influence they were ready to veer round like weathervanes  red pearce has cashed an he cant talk for himself said beady jones as if answering to the unspoken thought of all  men between you and me i had more queer notions about pearce than cleve announced gulden gruffly but i never said so because i had no proof  red shore was sore an strange lately added chick williams me an him were pretty thick oncebut not lately  the giant gulden scratched his head and swore probably he had no sense of justice and was merely puzzled  were wastin a lot of time put in beard anxiously dont fergit theres somethin comin off down in camp an we aint sure what  bah havent we heard whispers of vigilantes for a week queried gulden  then some one of the men looked out of the door and suddenly whistled  whos thet on a hoss  guldens gang crowded to the door  thets handy oliver  no  shore is i know him but it aint his hoss say hes hurryin  low exclamations of surprise and curiosity followed kells and his men looked attentively but no one spoke the clatter of hoofs on the stony road told of a horse swiftly approachingpounding to a halt before the cabin  handy air you chased whats wrong you shore look pale round the gills these and other remarks were flung out the door  wheres kells let me in replied oliver hoarsely  the crowd jostled and split to admit the long lean oliver he stalked straight toward kells till the table alone stood between them he was gray of face breathing hard resolute and stern  kells i throwedyoudown he said with outstretched hand it was a gesture of selfcondemnation and remorse  what of that demanded kells with his head leaping like the strike of an eagle  im takin it back  kells met the outstretched hand with his own and wrung it handy i never knew you to rightaboutface but im glad whats changed you so quickly  vigilantes  kellss animation and eagerness suddenly froze vigilantes he ground out  no rumor kells this time ive sure some news come close all you fellows you gulden come an listen heres where we git together closern ever  gulden surged forward with his group handy oliver was surrounded by pale tight faces darkbrowed and hardeyed  he gazed at them preparing them for a startling revelation men of all the whitelivered traitors as ever was red pearce was the worst he declared hoarsely  no one moved or spoke  an he was a vigilante  a low strange sound almost a roar breathed through the group  listen now an dont interrupt we aint got a lot of time so never mind how i happened to find out about pearce it was all accident an jest because i put two an two together pearce was approached by one of this secret vigilante band an he planned to sell the border legion outright there was to be a big stake in it for him he held off day after day only tippin off some of the gang theres dartt an singleton an frenchy an texas all caught redhanded at jobs pearce put the vigilantes to watchin them jest to prove his claim aw ive got the proofs jest wait listen to me you all never in your lives seen a snake like red pearce an the job he had put up on us was grand today he was to squeal on the whole gang you know how he began on kellsan how with his oily tongue he asked a guarantee of no gunplay but he figgered kells wrong for once he accused kellss girl an got killed for his pains mebbe it was part of his plan to git the girl himself anyway he had agreed to betray the border legion today an if he hadnt been killed by this time wed all be tied up ready for the noose mebbe thet wasnt a lucky shot of the bosss men i was the first to declare myself against kells an im here now to say thet i was a fool so youve all been fools whove bucked against him if this aint provin it what can  but i must hustle with my story they was havin a trial down at the big hall an thet place was sure packed no diggin gold today think of what thet means for alder creek i got inside where i could stand on a barrel an see dartt an singleton an frenchy an texas was bein tried by a masked court a man near me said two of them had been proved guilty it didnt take long to make out a case against texas an frenchy miners there recognized them an identified them they was convicted an sentenced to be hung then the offer was made to let them go free out of the border if theyd turn states evidence an give away the leader an men of the border legion thet was put up to each prisoner dartt he never answered at all an singleton told them to go to hell an texas he swore he was only a common an honest roadagent an never heard of the legion but the frenchman showed a yellow streak he might have taken the offer but texas cussed him tumble an made him ashamed to talk but if they git frenchy away from texas theyll make him blab hes like a greaser then there was a delay the big crowd of miners yelled for ropes but the vigilantes are waitin an its my hunch theyre waitin for pearce  so and where do we stand cried kells clear and cold  were not spotted yet thets certain replied oliver else them masked vigilantes would have been on the job before now but its not sense to figger we can risk another day i reckon its hit the trail back to cabin gulch  gulden what do you say queried kells sharply  ill go or staywhatever you want replied the giant in this crisis he seemed to be glad to have kells decide the issue and his followers resembled sheep ready to plunge after the leader  but though kells by a strange stroke had been made wholly master of the legion he did not show the old elation or radiance perhaps he saw more clearly than ever before still he was quick decisive strong equal to the occasion  listenall of you he said our horses and outfits are hidden in a gulch several miles below camp weve got to go that way we cant pack any grub or stuff from here well risk going through camp now leave here two or three at a time and wait down there on the edge of the crowd for me when i come well stick together then all do as i do  gulden put the nugget under his coat and strode out accompanied by budd and jones they hurried away the others went in couples soon only bate wood and handy oliver were left with kells  now you fellows go said kells be sure to round up the gang down there and wait for me  when they had gone he called for jim and joan to come out  all this time joans hand had been gripped in jims and joan had been so absorbed that she had forgotten the fact he released her and faced her silent pale then he went out joan swiftly followed  kells was buckling on his spurs you heard he said the moment he saw jims face  yes replied jim  so much the better weve got to rustle joan put on that long coat of cleves take off your mask jim get what gold you have and hurry if were gone when you come back hurry down the road i want you with me  cleve stalked out and joan ran into her room and put on the long coat she had little time to choose what possessions she could take and that choice fell upon the little saddlebag into which she hurriedly stuffed comb and brush and soapall it would hold then she returned to the larger room  kells had lifted a plank of the floor and was now in the act of putting small buckskin sacks of gold into his pockets they made his coat bulge at the sides  joan stick some meat and biscuits in your pockets he said id never get hungry with my pockets full of gold but you might  joan rummaged around in bate woods rude cupboard  these biscuits are as heavy as goldand harder she said  kells flashed a glance at her that held pride admiration and sadness you are the gamest girl i ever knew i wish idbut thats too late joan if anything happens to me stick close to cleve i believe you can trust him come on now  then he strode out of the cabin joan had almost to run to keep up with him there were no other men now in sight she knew that jim would follow soon because his golddust was hidden in the cavern back of her room and he would not need much time to get it nevertheless she anxiously looked back she and kells had gone perhaps a couple of hundred yards before jim appeared and then he came on the run at a point about opposite the first tents he joined kells  jim how about guns asked the bandit  ive got two replied cleve  good theres no tellingjim im afraid of the gang theyre crazy what do you think  i dont know its a hard proposition  well get away all right dont worry about that but the gang will never come together again this singular man spoke with melancholy slow up a little now he added we dont want to attract attention but where is there any one to see us jim did i have you figured right about the creede job  you sure did i just lost my nerve  well no matter  then kells appeared to forget that he stalked on with keen glances searching everywhere until suddenly when he saw round a bend of the road he halted with grating teeth that road was empty all the way to the other end of camp but there surged a dark mob of men kells stalked forward again the last nugget appeared like an empty barn how vacant and significant the whole center of camp kells did not speak another word  joan hurried on between kells and cleve she was trying to fortify herself to meet what lay at the end of the road a strange hoarse roar of men and an upflinging of arms made her shudder she kept her eyes lowered and clung to the arms of her companions  finally they halted she felt the crowd before she saw it a motley assemblage with what seemed craned necks and intent backs they were all looking forward and upward but she forced her glance down  kells stood still jims grip was hard upon her arm presently men grouped round kells she heard whispers they began to walk slowly and she was pushed and led along more men joined the group soon she and kells and jim were hemmed in a circle then she saw the huge form of gulden the towering oliver and smith and blicky beard jones williams budd and others the circle they formed appeared to be only one of many groups all moving whispering facing from her suddenly a sound like the roar of a wave agitated that mass of men it was harsh piercing unnatural yet it had a note of wild exultation then came the stamp and surge and then the upflinging of arms and then the abrupt strange silence broken only by a hiss or an escaping breath like a sob beyond all joans power to resist was a deep primitive desire to look  there over the heads of the mobfrom the bench of the sloperose grotesque structures of newhewn lumber on a platform stood black motionless men in awful contrast with a dangling object that doubled up and curled upon itself in terrible convulsions it lengthened while it swayed it slowed its action while it stretched it took on the form of a man he swung by a rope round his neck his head hung back his hands beat a long tremor shook the body then it was still and swayed to and fro a dark limp thing  joans gaze was riveted in horror a dim red haze made her vision imperfect there was a sickening riot within her  there were masked men all around the platforma solid phalanx of them on the slope above they were heavily armed other masked men stood on the platform they seemed rigid figuresstiff jerky when they moved how different from the two forms swaying below  the structure was a rude scaffold and the vigilantes had already hanged two bandits  two others with hands bound behind their backs stood farther along the platform under guard before each dangled a noose  joan recognized texas and frenchy and on the instant the great crowd let out a hard breath that ended in silence  the masked leader of the vigilantes was addressing texas well spare your life if you confess whos the head of this border legion  shore its red pearce haw haw haw  well give you one more chance came the curt reply  texas appeared to become serious and somber i swear to god its pearce he declared  a lie wont save you come the truth we think we know but we want proof hurry  you can go where its hot responded texas  the leader moved his hand and two other masked men stepped forward  have you any message to send any oneanything to say he asked  nope  have you any request to make  hang that frenchman before me i want to see him kick  nothing more was said the two men adjusted the noose round the doomed mans neck texas refused the black cap and he did not wait for the drop to be sprung he walked off the platform into space as joan closed her eyes  again that strange full angry and unnatural roar waved through the throng of watchers it was terrible to hear joan felt the violent action of that crowd although the men close round her were immovable as stones she imagined she could never open her eyes to see texas hanging there yet she didand something about his form told her that he had died instantly he had been brave and loyal even in dishonor he had more than once spoken a kind word to her who could tell what had made him an outcast she breathed a prayer for his soul  the vigilantes were bolstering up the craven frenchy he could not stand alone they put the rope round his neck and lifted him off the platformthen let him down he screamed in his terror they cut short his cries by lifting him again this time they held him up several seconds his face turned black his eyes bulged his breast heaved his legs worked with the regularity of a jumpingjack they let him down and loosened the noose they were merely torturing him to wring a confession from him he had been choked severely and needed a moment to recover when he did it was to shrink back in abject terror from that loop of rope dangling before his eyes  the vigilante leader shook the noose in his face and pointed to the swaying forms of the dead bandits  frenchy frothed at the mouth as he shrieked out words in his native tongue but any miner there could have translated their meaning  the crowd heaved forward as if with one step then stood in a strained silence  talk english ordered the vigilante  ill tell ill tell  joan became aware of a singular tremor in kellss arm which she still clasped suddenly it jerked she caught a gleam of blue then the bellow of a gun almost split her ears powder burned her cheek she saw frenchy double up and collapse on the platform  for an instant there was a silence in which every man seemed petrified then burst forth a hoarse uproar and the stamp of many boots all in another instant pandemonium broke out the huge crowd split in every direction joan felt cleves strong arm around herfelt herself borne on a resistless tide of yelling stamping wrestling men she had a glimpse of kellss dark face drawing away from her another of guldens giant form in herculean action tossing men aside like ninepins another of weapons aloft savage wildeyed men fought to get into the circle whence that shot had come they broke into it but did not know then whom to attack or what to do and the rushing of the frenzied miners all around soon disintegrated kellss band and bore its several groups in every direction there was not another shot fired  joan was dragged and crushed in the melee not for rods did her feet touch the ground but in the clouds of dust and confusion of struggling forms she knew jim still held her and she clasped him with all her strength presently her feet touched the earth she was not jostled and pressed then she felt free to walk and with jim urging her they climbed a rockstrewn slope till a cabin impeded further progress but they had escaped the stream  below was a strange sight a scaffold shrouded in dustclouds a band of bewildered vigilantes with weapons drawn waiting for they knew not what three swinging ghastly forms and a dead man on the platform and all below a horde of men trying to escape from one another that shot of kellss had precipitated a rush no miner knew who the vigilantes were nor the members of the border legion every man there expected a bloody battledistrusted the man next to himand had given way to panic the vigilantes had tried to crowd together for defense and all the others had tried to escape it was a wild scene born of wild justice and blood at feverheat the climax of a disordered time where gold and violence reigned supreme it could only happen once but it was terrible while it lasted it showed the craven in men it proved the baneful influence of gold it brought in its fruition the destiny of alder creek camp for it must have been that the really brave and honest men in vast majority retraced their steps while the vicious kept running so it seemed to joan  she huddled against jim there in the shadow of the cabin wall and not for long did either speak they watched and listened the streams of miners turned back toward the space around the scaffold where the vigilantes stood grouped and there rose a subdued roar of excited voices many small groups of men conversed together until the vigilante leader brought all to attention by addressing the populace in general joan could not hear what he said and had no wish to hear  joan it all happened so quickly didnt it whispered jim shaking his head as if he was not convinced of reality  wasnt heterrible whispered joan in reply  he who  kells in her mind the bandit leader dominated all that wild scene  terrible if you like but id say great the nerve of him in the face of a hundred vigilantes and thousands of miners but he knew what that shot would do  never he never thought of that declared joan earnestly i felt him tremble i had a glimpse of his face oh first in his mind was his downfall and second the treachery of frenchy i think that shot showed kells as utterly desperate but weak he couldnt have helped itif that had been the last bullet in his gun  jim cleve looked strangely at joan as if her eloquence was both persuasive and incomprehensible  well that was a lucky shot for usand him too  do you think he got away she asked eagerly  sure they all got away wasnt that about the maddest crowd you ever saw  no wonder in a second every man there feared the man next to him would shoot that showed the power of kellss border legion if his men had been faithful and obedient he never would have fallen  joan you speak as if you regret it  oh i am ashamed replied joan i dont mean that i dont know what i do mean but still im sorry for kells i suffered so much those long long hours of suspense and his fortunes seemed my fortunesmy very lifeand yours too jim  i think i understand dear said jim soberly  jim whatll we do now isnt it strange to feel free  i feel as queer as you let me think replied jim  they huddled there in comparative seclusion for a long time after that joan tried to think of plans but her mind seemed unproductive she felt half dazed jim too appeared to be laboring under the same kind of burden moreover responsibility had been added to his  the afternoon waned till the sun tipped the high range in the west the excitement of the mining populace gradually wore away and toward sunset strings of men filed up the road and across the open the masked vigilantes disappeared and presently only a quiet and curious crowd was left round the grim scaffold and its dark swinging forms joans one glance showed that the vigilantes had swung frenchys dead body in the noose he would have escaped by treachery they had hanged him dead what a horrible proof of the temper of these newborn vigilantes they had left the bandits swinging what sight was so appalling as these limp dark swaying forms dead men on the ground had a dignityat least the dignity of death and death sometimes had a majesty but here both life and death had been robbed and there was only horror joan felt that all her life she would be haunted  joan weve got to leave alder creek declared cleve finally he rose to his feet the words seemed to have given him decision at first i thought every bandit in the gang would run as far as he could from here butyou cant tell what these wild men will do gulden for instance common sense ought to make them hide for a spell still no matter whats what we must leave now how to go  lets walk if we buy horses or wait for the stage well have to see men hereand im afraid  but joan therell be bandits along the road sure and the trails wherever they are would be less safe  lets travel by night and rest by day  that wont do with so far to go and no pack  then part of the way  no wed better take the stage for bannack if it starts at all itll be under armed guard the only thing iswill it leave soon come joan well go down into camp  dusk had fallen and lights had begun to accentuate the shadows joan kept close beside jim down the slope and into the road she felt like a guilty thing and every passing man or lowconversing group frightened her still she could not help but see that no one noticed her or jim and she began to gather courage jim also acquired confidence the growing darkness seemed a protection the farther up the street they passed the more men they met again the saloons were in full blast alder creek had returned to the free careless tenor of its way a few doors this side of the last nugget was the office of the stage and express company it was a wide tent with the front canvas cut out and a shelfcounter across the opening there was a dim yellow lamplight half a dozen men lounged in front and inside were several more two of whom appeared to be armed guards jim addressed no one in particular  when does the next stage leave for bannack  a man looked up sharply from the papers that littered a table before him it leaves when we start it he replied curtly  well when will that be  whats that to you he replied with a question still more curt  i want to buy seats for two  thats different come in and lets look you over hello its young cleve i didnt recognize you excuse me were a little particular these days  the mans face lighted evidently he knew jim and thought well of him this reassured joan and stilled the furious beating of her heart she saw jim hand over a sack of gold from which the agent took the amount due for the passage then he returned the sack and whispered something in jims ear jim rejoined her and led her away pressing her arm close to his side  its all right he whispered excitedly stage leaves just before daylight it used to leave in the middle of the forenoon but they want a good start tomorrow  they think it might be held up  he didnt say so but theres every reason to suspect that joan i sure hope it wont me with all this gold why i feel as if i weighed a thousand pounds  whatll we do now she inquired  jim halted in the middle of the road it was quite dark now the lights of the camp were flaring men were passing to and fro the loose boards on the walks rattled to their tread the saloons had begun to hum and there was a discordant blast from the last nugget  thats itwhatll we do he asked in perplexity  joan had no idea to advance but with the lessening of her fear and the gradual clearing of her mind she felt that she would not much longer be witless  weve got to eat and get some rest said jim sensibly  ill try to eatbut i dont think ill be able to sleep tonight replied joan  jim took her to a place kept by a mexican it appeared to consist of two tents with opening in front and door between the table was a plank resting upon two barrels and another plank resting upon kegs served as a seat there was a smoking lamp that flickered the mexicans tableware was of a crudeness befitting his house but it was clean and he could cooktwo facts that joan appreciated after her long experience of bate wood she and jim were the only customers of the mexican who spoke english rather well and was friendly evidently it pleased him to see the meal enjoyed both the food and the friendliness had good effect upon jim cleve he ceased to listen all the time and to glance furtively out at every footstep  joan i guess itll turn out all right he said clasping her hand as it rested upon the table suddenly he looked brighteyed and shy he leaned toward her do you rememberwe are married he whispered  joan was startled of course she replied hastily but had she forgotten  youre my wife  joan looked at him and felt her nerves begin to tingle a soft warm wave stole over her  like a boy he laughed this was our first meal togetheron our honeymoon  jim the blood burned in joans face  there you sityou beautiful but youre not a girl now youre dandy dale  dont call me that exclaimed joan  but i shallalways well keep that bandit suit always you can dress up sometimes to show offto make me rememberto scare thethe kids  jim cleve  oh joan im afraid to be happy but i cant help it were going to get away you belong to me and ive sacks and sacks of golddust lord ive no idea how much but you can never spend all the money isnt it just like a dream  joan smiled through tears and failed trying to look severe  get me and the gold awaysafebefore you crow she said  that sobered him he led her out again into the dark street with its dark forms crossing to and fro before the lights  its a long time before morning where can i take youso you can sleep a little he muttered  find a place where we can sit down and wait she suggested  no he pondered a moment i guess theres no risk  then he led her up the street and through that end of camp out upon the rough open slope they began to climb the stars were bright but even so joan stumbled often over the stones she wondered how jim could get along so well in the dark and she clung to his arm they did not speak often and then only in whispers jim halted occasionally to listen or to look up at the bold black bluff for his bearings presently he led her among broken fragments of cliff and half carried her over rougher ground into a kind of shadowy pocket or niche  heres where i slept he whispered  he wrapped a blanket round her and then they sat down against the rock and she leaned upon his shoulder  i have your coat and the blanket too she said wont you be cold  he laughed now dont talk any more youre white and faggedout you need to restto sleep  sleep how impossible she murmured  why your eyes are half shut now anyway ill not talk to you i want to think  jim kiss megood night she whispered  he bent over rather violently she imagined his head blotted out the light of the stars he held her tightly for a moment she felt him shake then he kissed her on the cheek and abruptly drew away how strange he seemed  for that matter everything was strange she had never seen the stars so bright so full of power so close all about her the shadows gathered protectingly to hide her and jim the silence spoke she saw jims face in the starlight and it seemed so keen so listening so thoughtful so beautiful he would sit there all night wideeyed and alert guarding her waiting for the gray of dawn how he had changed and she was his wife but that seemed only a dream it needed daylight and sight of her ring to make that real  a warmth and languor stole over her she relaxed comfortably after all she would sleep but why did that intangible dread hang on to her soul the night was so still and clear and perfecta radiant white night of starsand jim was there holding herand tomorrow they would ride away that might be but dark dangling shapes haunted her back in her mind and there too loomed kells where was he now gonegone on his bloody trail with his broken fortunes and his desperate bitterness he had lost her the lunge of that wild mob had parted them a throb of pain and shame went through her for she was sorry she could not understand why unless it was because she had possessed some strange power to instil or bring up good in him no woman could have been proof against that it was monstrous to know that she had power to turn him from an evil life yet she could not do it it was more than monstrous to realize that he had gone on spilling blood and would continue to go on when she could have prevented itcould have saved many poor miners who perhaps had wives or sweethearts somewhere yet there was no help for it she loved jim cleve she might have sacrificed herself but she would not sacrifice him for all the bandits and miners on the border  joan felt that she would always be haunted and would always suffer that pang for kells she would never lie down in the peace and quiet of her home wherever that might be without picturing kells dark and forbidding and burdened pacing some lonely cabin or riding a lonely trail or lying with his brooding face upturned to the lonely stars sooner or later he would meet his doom it was inevitable she pictured over that sinister scene of the dangling forms but nokells would never end that way terrible as he was he had not been born to be hanged he might be murdered in his sleep by one of that band of traitors who were traitors because in the nature of evil they had to be but more likely some gamblinghell with gold and life at stake would see his last fight these bandits stole gold and gambled among themselves and fought and that fight which finished kells must necessarily be a terrible one she seemed to see into a lonely cabin where a log fire burned low and lamps flickered and blue smoke floated in veils and men lay prone on the floorkells stark and bloody and the giant gulden dead at last and more terrible in death and on the rude table bags of gold and dull shining heaps of gold and scattered on the floor like streams of sand and useless as sand dust of goldthe destroyer     18  all joans fancies and dreams faded into obscurity and when she was aroused it seemed she had scarcely closed her eyes but there was the gray gloom of dawn jim was shaking her gently  no you werent sleepyits just a mistake he said helping her to arise now well get out of here  they threaded a careful way out of the rocks then hurried down the slope in the grayness joan saw the dark shape of a cabin and it resembled the one kells had built it disappeared presently when jim led her into a road she felt sure that this cabin had been the one where she had been a prisoner for so long they hurried down the road and entered the camp there were no lights the tents and cabins looked strange and gloomy the road was empty not a sound broke the stillness at the bend joan saw a stagecoach and horses looming up in what seemed gray distance jim hurried her on  they reached the stage the horses were restive the driver was on the seat whip and reins in hand two men sat beside him with rifles across their knees the door of the coach hung open there were men inside one of whom had his head out of the window the barrel of a rifle protruded near him he was talking in a low voice to a man apparently busy at the traces  hello cleve youre late said another man evidently the agent climb aboard whenll you be back  i hardly know replied cleve with hesitation  all right good luck to you he closed the coach door after joan and jim let em go bill  the stage started with a jerk to joan what an unearthly creak and rumble it made disturbing the silent dawn jim squeezed her hand with joy they were on the way  joan and jim had a seat to themselves opposite sat three menthe guard with his head half out of the window a bearded miner who appeared stolid or drowsy and a young man who did not look rough and robust enough for a prospector none of the three paid any particular attention to joan and jim  the road had a decided slope downhill and bill the driver had the four horses on a trot the rickety old stage appeared to be rattling to pieces it lurched and swayed and sometimes jolted over rocks and roots joan was hard put to it to keep from being bumped off the seat she held to a brace on one side and to jim on the other and when the stage rolled down into the creek and thumped over boulders joan made sure that every bone in her body would be broken this crossing marked the mouth of the gulch and on the other side the road was smooth  were going the way we came whispered jim in her ear  this was surprising for joan had been sure that bannack lay in the opposite direction certainly this fact was not reassuring to her perhaps the road turned soon  meanwhile the light brightened the day broke and the sun reddened the valley then it was as light inside the coach as outside joan might have spared herself concern as to her fellowpassengers the only one who noticed her was the young man and he after a stare and a halfsmile lapsed into abstraction he looked troubled and there was about him no evidence of prosperity jim held her hand under a fold of the long coat and occasionally he spoke of something or other outside that caught his eye and the stage rolled on rapidly seemingly in pursuit of the steady roar of hoofs  joan imagined she recognized the brushy ravine out of which jesse smith had led that day when kellss party came upon the new road she believed jim thought so too for he gripped her hand unusually hard beyond that point joan began to breathe more easily there seemed no valid reason now why every mile should not separate them farther from the bandits and she experienced relief  then the time did not drag so she wanted to talk to jim yet did not because of the other passengers jim himself appeared influenced by their absorption in themselves besides the keen ceaseless vigilance of the guard was not without its quieting effect danger lurked ahead in the bends of that road joan remembered hearing kells say that the bannack stage had never been properly held up by roadagents but that when he got ready for the job it would be done right riding grew to be monotonous and tiresome with the warmth of the sun came the dust and flies and all these bothered joan she did not have her usual calmness and as the miles steadily passed her nervousness increased  the road left the valley and climbed between foothills and wound into rockier country every dark gulch brought to joan a trembling breathless spell what places for ambush but the stage bowled on  at last her apprehensions wore out and she permitted herself the luxury of relaxing of leaning back and closing her eyes she was tired drowsy hot there did not seem to be a breath of air  suddenly joans ears burst to an infernal crash of guns she felt the whip and sting of splinters sent flying by bullets harsh yells followed then the scream of a horse in agony the stage lurching and slipping to a halt and thunder of heavy guns overhead  jim yelled at herthrew her down on the seat she felt the body of the guard sink against her knees then she seemed to feel to hear through an icy sickening terror  a scattering volley silenced the guns above then came the pound of hoofs the snort of frightened horses  jesse smith stop called jim piercingly  hold on thar beady replied a hoarse voice damn if it aint jim cleve  ho gul yelled another voice and joan recognized it as blickys  then jim lifted her head drew her up he was white with fear  dearareyouhurt  no im onlyscared she replied  joan looked out to see bandits on foot guns in hand and others mounted all gathering near the coach jim opened the door and stepping out bade her follow joan had to climb over the dead guard the miner and the young man huddled down on their seat  if it aint jim an kellss girldandy dale ejaculated smith fellers this means somethin say youngster hope you aint hurtor the girl  no but thats not your fault replied cleve why did you want to plug the coach full of lead  this beats me said smith kells sent you out in the stage but when he gave us the job of holdin it up he didnt tell us youd be in there when an whered you leave him  sometime last nightin campnear our cabin replied jim quick as a flash manifestly he saw his opportunity he left dandy dale with me told us to take the stage this morning i expected him to be in it or to meet us  didnt you have no orders  none except to take care of the girl till he came but he did tell me hed have more to say  smith gazed blankly from cleve to blicky and then at gulden who came slowly forward his hair ruffed his gun held low joan followed the glance of his great gray eyes and she saw the stagedriver hanging dead over his seat and the guards lying back of him the offside horse of the leaders lay dead in his traces with his mate nosing at him  whos in there boomed gulden and he thrust hand and gun in at the stage door come out  the young man stumbled out hands above his head pallid and shaking so weak he could scarcely stand  gulden prodded the bearded miner come out here you  the man appeared to be hunched forward in a heap  guess hes plugged said smith but he aint cashed hear him breathe heaves like a sick hoss  gulden reached with brawny arm and with one pull he dragged the miner off the seat and out into the road where he flopped with a groan there was blood on his neck and hands gulden bent over him tore at his clothes tore harder at something and then with a swing he held aloft a broad black belt sagging heavy with gold  hah he boomed it was just an exclamation horrible to hear but it did not express satisfaction or exultation he handed the goldbelt to the grinning budd and turned to the young man  got any gold  no ii wasnt a miner replied the youth huskily  gulden felt for a goldbelt then slapped at his pockets turn round ordered the giant  aw gul let him go remonstrated jesse smith  blicky laid a restraining hand upon guldens broad shoulder  turn round repeated gulden without the slightest sign of noticing his colleagues  but the youth understood and he turned a ghastly livid hue  for gods sakedont murder me he gasped i hadnothingno goldno gun  gulden spun him round like a top and pushed him forward they went half a dozen paces then the youth staggered and turning he fell on his knees  dontkillme he entreated  joan seeing jim cleve stiffen and crouch thought of him even in that horrible moment and she gripped his arm with all her might they must endure  the other bandits muttered but none moved a hand  gulden thrust out the big gun his hair bristled on his head and his huge frame seemed instinct with strange vibration like some object of tremendous weight about to plunge into resistless momentum  even the stricken youth saw his doom letmepray he begged  joan did not fault but a merciful unclamping of musclebound rigidity closed her eyes  gul yelled blicky with passion i aint agoin to let you kill this kid theres no sense in it were spotted back in alder creek run kid run  then joan opened her eyes to see the surly guldens arm held by blicky and the youth running blindly down the road joans relief and joy were tremendous but still she answered to the realizing shock of what gulden had meant to do she leaned against cleve all within and without a whirling darkness of fire the border wildness claimed her then she had the spirit though not the strength to fight she needed the sight and sound of other things to restore her equilibrium she would have welcomed another shock an injury and then she was looking down upon the gasping miner he was dying hurriedly joan knelt beside him to lift his head at her call cleve brought a canteen but the miner could not drink and he died with some word unspoken  dizzily joan arose and with cleve half supporting her she backed off the road to a seat on the bank she saw the bandits now at businesslike action blicky and smith were cutting the horses out of their harness beady jones like a ghoul searched the dead men the three bandits whom joan knew only by sight were making up a pack budd was standing beside the stage with his expectant grin and gulden with the agility of the gorilla he resembled was clambering over the top of the stage suddenly from under the drivers seat he hauled a buckskin sack it was small but heavy he threw it down to budd almost knocking over that bandit budd hugged the sack and yelled like an indian the other men whooped and ran toward him gulden hauled out another sack hands to the number of a dozen stretched clutchingly when he threw the sack there was a mad scramble they fought but it was only play they were gleeful blicky secured the prize and he held it aloft in triumph assuredly he would have waved it had it not been so heavy gulden drew out several small sacks which he provokingly placed on the seat in front of him the bandits below howled in protest then the giant with his arm under the seat his huge frame bowed heaved powerfully upon something and his face turned red he halted in his tugging to glare at his bandit comrades below if his great cavernous eyes expressed any feeling it was analogous to the reluctance manifest in his posturehe regretted the presence of his gang he would rather have been alone then with deepmuttered curse and mighty heave he lifted out a huge buckskin sack tied and placarded and marked  one hundred pounds he boomed  it seemed to joan then that a band of devils surrounded the stage all roaring at the huge bristling demon above who glared and bellowed down at them  finally gulden stilled the tumult which after all was one of frenzied joy  share and share alike he thundered now black in the face do you fools want to waste time here on the road dividing up this gold  what you say goes shouted budd  there was no dissenting voice  what a stake ejaculated blicky gul the boss had it figgered strange though he hasnt showed up  wherell we go queried gulden speak up you men  the unanimous selection was cabin gulch plainly gulden did not like this but he was just  all right cabin gulch it is but nobody outside of kells and us gets a share in this stake  many willing hands made short work of preparation gulden insisted on packing all the gold upon his saddle and had his will he seemed obsessed he never glanced at joan it was jesse smith who gave the directions and orders one of the stagehorses was packed another with a blanket for a saddle was given cleve to ride blicky gallantly gave his horse to joan shortened his stirrups to fit her and then whistled at the ridgy back of the stagehorse he elected to ride gulden was in a hurry and twice he edged off to be halted by impatient calls finally the cavalcade was ready jesse smith gazed around upon the scene with the air of a general overlooking a vanquished enemy  whoever fust runs acrost this job will have blind staggers dont you forgit thet  whats kells goin to figger asked blicky sharply  nothin fer kells he wasnt in at the finish declared budd  blicky gazed darkly at him but made no comment  i tell you blick i cant git this all right in my head said smith  say ask jim again mebbe now the jobs done he can talk suggested blicky  jim cleve heard and appeared ready for that question  i dont know much more than i told you but i can guess kells had this big shipment of gold spotted he must have sent us in the stage for some reason he said hed tell me what to expect and do but he didnt come back sure he knew youd do the job and just as sure he expected to be on hand hell turn up soon  this ruse of jims did not sound in the least logical or plausible to joan but it was readily accepted by the bandits apparently what they knew of kellss movements and plans since the breakup at alder creek fitted well with cleves suggestions  come on boomed gulden from the fore do you want to rot here  then without so much as a backward glance at the ruin they left behind the bandits fell into line jesse smith led straight off the road into a shallow brook and evidently meant to keep in it gulden followed next came beady jones then the three bandits with the packhorse and the other horses cleve and joan close together filed in here and last came budd and blicky it was rough slippery traveling and the riders spread out cleve however rode beside joan once at an opportune moment he leaned toward her  wed better run for it at the first chance he said somberly  no gulden joan had to moisten her lips to speak the monsters name  hell never think of you while he has all that gold  joans intelligence grasped this but her morbid dread terribly augmented now amounted almost to a spell still despite the darkness of her mind she had a flash of inspiration and of spirit  kells is my only hope if he doesnt join us soonthen well run and if we cant escape thatjoan made a sickening gesture toward the foreyou must kill me beforebefore  her voice trailed off failing  i will he promised through locked teeth  and then they rode on with dark faces bent over the muddy water and treacherous stones  when jesse smith led out of that brook it was to ride upon bare rock he was not leaving any trail horses and riders were of no consideration and he was a genius for picking hard ground and covering it he never slackened his gait and it seemed next to impossible to keep him in sight  for joan the ride became toil and the toil became pain but there was no rest smith kept mercilessly onward sunset and twilight and night found the cavalcade still moving then it halted just as joan was about to succumb jim lifted her off her horse and laid her upon the grass she begged for water and she drank and drank but she wanted no food there was a heavy dull beating in her ears a band tight round her forehead she was aware of the gloom of the crackling of fires of leaping shadows of the passing of men to and fro near her and most of all rendering her capable of a saving shred of selfcontrol she was aware of jims constant companionship and watchfulness then sounds grew far off and night became a blur  morning when it came seemed an age removed from that hideous night her head had cleared and but for the soreness of body and limb she would have begun the day strong there appeared little to eat and no time to prepare it gulden was rampant for action like a miser he guarded the saddle packed with gold this tune his comrades were as eager as he to be on the move all were obsessed by the presence of gold only one hour loomed in their consciousnessthat of the hour of division how fatal and pitiful and terrible of what possible use or good was gold to them  the ride began before sunrise it started and kept on at a steady trot smith led down out of the rocky slopes and fastnesses into green valleys jim cleve riding bareback on a lame horse had his difficulties still he kept close beside or behind joan all the way they seldom spoke and then only a word relative to this stern business of traveling in the trail of a hardriding bandit joan bore up better this day as far as her mind was concerned physically she had all she could do to stay in the saddle she learned of what steel she was actually madewhat her slender frame could endure that days ride seemed a thousand miles long and never to end yet the implacable smith did finally halt and that before dark  camp was made near water the bandits were a jovial lot despite a lack of food they talked of the morrow allthe worldlay beyond the next sunrise some renounced their pipes and sought their rest just to hurry on the day but gulden tireless sleepless eternally vigilant guarded the saddle of gold and brooded over it and seemed a somber giant carved out of the night and blicky nursing some deep and latedeveloped scheme perhaps in kellss interest or his own kept watch over gulden and all  jim cautioned joan to rest and importuned her and promised to watch while she slept  joan saw the stars through her shut eyelids all the night seemed to press down and softly darken  the sun was shining red when the cavalcade rode up cabin gulch the grazing cattle stopped to watch and the horses pranced and whistled there were flowers and flitting birds and glistening dew on leaves and a shining swift flow of waterthe brightness of morning and nature smiled in cabin gulch  well indeed joan remembered the trail she had ridden so often how that clump of willow where first she had confronted jim thrilled her now the pines seemed welcoming her the gulch had a sense of home in it for her yet it was fearful how much had happened there what might yet happen  then a clear ringing call stirred her pulse she glanced up the slope tall and straight and dark there on the bench with hand aloft stood the bandit kells     19  the weary dusty cavalcade halted on the level bench before the bandits cabin gulden boomed a salute to kells the other men shouted greeting in the wild exultation of triumph they still held him as chief but kells was not deceived he even passed by that heavily laden goldweighted saddle he had eyes only for joan  girl i never was so glad to see any one he exclaimed in husky amaze how did it happen i never  jim cleve leaned over to interrupt kells it was great kellsthat idea of yours putting us in the stagecoach you meant to hold up said cleve with a swift meaning glance but it nearly was the end of us you didnt catch up the gang didnt know we were inside and they shot the old stage full of holes  aha so thats it replied kells slowly but the main point isyou brought her through jim i cant ever square that  oh maybe you can laughed cleve as he dismounted  suddenly kells became aware of joans exhaustion and distress joan youre not hurt he asked in swift anxiety  no only played out  you look it come he lifted her out of the saddle and half carrying half leading her took her into the cabin and through the big room to her old apartment how familiar it seemed to joan a groundsquirrel frisked along a chink between the logs chattering welcome the place was exactly as joan had left it  kells held joan a second as if he meant to embrace her but he did not lord its good to see you i never expected to again but you can tell me all about yourself after you rest i was just having breakfast ill fetch you some  were you alone here asked joan  yes i was with bate and handy  hey kells roared the gang from the outer room  kells held aside the blanket curtain so that joan was able to see through the door the men were drawn up in a halfcircle round the table upon which were the bags of gold  kells whistled low joan therell be trouble now he said but dont you fear ill not forget you  despite his undoubted sincerity joan felt a subtle change in him and that coupled with the significance of his words brought a return of the strange dread kells went out and dropped the curtain behind him joan listened  share and share alike boomed the giant gulden  say called kells gaily arent you fellows going to eat first  shouts of derision greeted his sally  ill eat golddust added budd  have it your own way men responded kells blicky get the scales down off of that shelf say ill bet anybody ill have the most dust by sundown  more shouts of derision were flung at him  who wants to gamble now  boss ill take thet bet  haw haw you wont look so bright by sundown  then followed a moments silence presently broken by a clink of metal on the table  boss howd you ever git wind of this big shipment of gold asked jesse smith  ive had it spotted but handy oliver was the scout  well shore drink to handy exclaimed one of the bandits  an who was sendin out this shipment queried the curious smith them bags are marked all the same  it was a oneman shipment replied kells sent out by the boss miner of alder creek they call him overland something  that name brought joan to her feet with a thrilling fire her uncle old bill hoadley was called overland was it possible that the bandits meant him it could hardly be that name was a common one in the mountains  shore i seen overland lots of times said budd an he got wise to my watchin him  somebody tipped it off that the legion was after his gold went on kells i suppose we have pearce to thank for that but it worked out well for us the hell we raised there at the lynching must have thrown a scare into overland he had nerve enough to try to send his dust to bannack on the very next stage he nearly got away with it too for it was only lucky accident that handy heard the news  the name overland drew joan like a magnet and she arose to take her old position where she could peep in upon the bandits one glance at jim cleve told her that he too had been excited by the name then it occurred to joan that her uncle could hardly have been at alder creek without jim knowing it still among thousands of men all wild and toiling and selfsufficient hiding their identities anything might be possible after a few moments however joan leaned to the improbability of the man being her uncle  kells sat down before the table and blicky stood beside him with the goldscales the other bandits lined up opposite jim cleve stood to one side watching brooding  you cant weigh it all on these scales said blicky  thats sure replied kells well divide the small bags first ten sharesten equal parts spill out the bags blick and hurry look how hungry gulden looks somebody cook your breakfast while we divide the gold  haw haw  ho ho  who wants to eat  the bandits were gay derisive scornful eager like a group of boys half surly half playful at a game  wal i shore want to see my share weighted drawled budd  kells movedhis gun flashedhe slammed it hard upon the table  budd do you question my honesty he asked quick and hard  no offense boss i was just talkin  that quick change of kellss marked a subtle difference in the spirit of the bandits and the occasion gaiety and good humor and badinage ended there were no more broad grins or friendly leers or coarse laughs gulden and his groups clustered closer to the table quiet intense watchful suspicious  it did not take kells and his assistant long to divide the smaller quantity of the gold  here gulden he said and handed the giant a bag jesse bossert pike beady braverman blicky  here jim cleve get in the game he added throwing a bag at jim it was heavy it hit jim with a thud and dropped to the ground he stooped to reach it  that leaves one for handy and one for me went on kells blicky spill out the big bag  presently joan saw a huge mound of dull gleaming yellow the color of it leaped to the glinting eyes of the bandits and it seemed to her that a shadow hovered over them the movements of kells grew tense and hurried beads of sweat stood out upon his brow his hands were not steady  soon larger bags were distributed to the bandits that broke the waiting the watchfulness but not the tense eagerness the bandits were now like leashed hounds blicky leaned before kells and hit the table with his fist  boss ive a kick comin he said  come on with it replied the leader  aint gulden agoin to divide up thet big nugget  he is if hes square  a chorus of affirmatives from the bandits strengthened kellss statement gulden moved heavily and ponderously and he pushed some of his comrades aside to get nearer to kells  wasnt it my right to do a job by myselfwhen i wanted he demanded  no i agreed to let you fight when you wanted to kill a man when you liked that was the agreement  whatd i kill a man for  no one answered that in words but the answer was there in dark faces  i know what i meant continued gulden and im going to keep this nugget  there was a moments silence it boded ill to the giant  sohe declares himself said blicky hotly boss what you say goes  let him keep it declared kells scornfully ill win it from him and divide it with the gang  that was received with hoarse acclaims by all except gulden he glared sullenly kells stood up and shook a long finger in the giants face  ill win your nugget he shouted ill beat you at any game i call your hand now if youve got any nerve  come on boomed the giant and he threw his gold down upon the table with a crash  the bandits closed in around the table with sudden hard violence all crowding for seats  im agoin to set in the game yelled blicky  well all set in declared jesse smith  come on was guldens acquiescence  but we all cant play at once protested kells lets make up two games  naw  some of you eat then while the others get cleaned out  thets itcleaned out ejaculated budd meanly you seem to be sure kells an i guess ill keep shady of thet game  thats twice for you budd flashed the bandit leader beware of the third time  hyar fellers cut the cards fer who sets in an who sets out called blicky and he slapped a deck of cards upon the table  with grim eagerness as if drawing lots against fate the bandits bent over and drew cards budd braverman and beady jones were the ones excluded from the game  beady you fellows unpack those horses and turn them loose and bring the stuff inside said kells  budd showed a surly disregard but the other two bandits got up willingly and went out  then the game began with only cleve standing looking on the bandits were mostly silent they moved their hands and occasionally bent forward it was every man against his neighbor gulden seemed implacably indifferent and played like a machine blicky sat eager and excited under a spell jesse smith was a slow cool shrewed gambler bossert and pike two ruffians almost unknown to joan appeared carried away by their opportunity and kells began to wear that strange rapt weak expression that gambling gave him  presently beady jones and braverman bustled in carrying the packs then budd jumped up and ran to them he returned to the table carrying a demijohn which he banged upon the table  whisky exclaimed kells take that away we cant drink and gamble  watch me replied blicky  let them drink kells declared gulden well get their dust quicker then we can have our game  kells made no more comment the game went on and the aspect of it changed when kells himself began to drink seemingly unconscious of the fact joans dread increased greatly and leaving the peephole she lay back upon the bed always a sword had hung over her head time after time by some fortunate circumstance or by courage or wit or by an act of providence she had escaped what strangely menaced would she escape it again for she felt the catastrophe coming did jim recognize that fact remembering the look on his face she was assured that he did then he would be quick to seize upon any possible chance to get her away and always he would be between her and those bandits at most then she had only death to feardeath that he would mercifully deal to her if the worst came and as she lay there listening to the slowrising murmur of the gamblers with her thought growing clearer she realized it was love of jim and fear for himfear that he would lose herthat caused her cold dread and the laboring breath and the weighted heart she had cost jim this terrible experience and she wanted to make up to him for it to give him herself and all her life  joan lay there a long time thinking and suffering while the strange morbid desire to watch kells and gulden grew stronger and stronger until it was irresistible her fate her life lay in the balance between these two men she divined that  she returned to her vantagepoint and as she glanced through she vibrated to a shock the change that had begun subtly intangibly was now a terrible and glaring difference that great quantity of gold the equal chance of every gambler the marvelous possibilities presented to evil minds and the hell that hid in that black bottlethese had made playthings of every bandit except gulden he was exactly the same as ever but to see the others sent a chill of ice along joans veins kells was white and rapt plain to seehe had won blicky was wild with rage jesse smith sat darker grimmer but no longer cool there was hate in the glance he fastened upon kells as he bet beady jones and braverman showed an inflamed and impotent eagerness to take their turn budd sat in the game now and his face wore a terrible look joan could not tell what passion drove him but she knew he was a loser pike and bossert likewise were losers and stood apart sullen watching with sick jealous rage jim cleve had reacted to the strain and he was white with nervous clutching hands and piercing glances and the game went on with violent slap of card or pound of fist upon the table with the slide of a bag of gold or the little sodden thump of its weight with savage curses at loss and strange raw exultation at gain with hurry and violencemore than all with the wildness of the hour and the wildness of these men drawing closer and closer to the dread climax that from the beginning had been foreshadowed  suddenly budd rose and bent over the table his cards clutched in a shaking hand his face distorted and malignant his eyes burning at kells passionately he threw the cards down  there he yelled hoarsely and he stilled the noise  no good replied kells tauntingly is there any other game you play  budd bent low to see the cards in kellss hand and then straightening his form he gazed with haggard fury at the winner youve done me im cleanedim busted he raved  you were easy get out of the game replied kells with an exultant contempt it was not the passion of play that now obsessed him but the passion of success  i said you done me burst out budd insanely youre slick with the cards  the accusation acted like magic to silence the bandits to check movement to clamp the situation kells was white and radiant he seemed careless and nonchalant  all right budd he replied but his tone did not suit his strange look thats three times for you  swift as a flash he shot budd fell over gulden and the giant with one sweep of his arm threw the stricken bandit off budd fell heavily and neither moved nor spoke  pass me the bottle went on kells a little hoarse shakiness in his voice and go on with the game  can i set in now asked beady jones eagerly  you and jack wait thiss getting to be all between kells an me said gulden  weve sure got blicky done exclaimed kells there was something taunting about the leaders words he did not care for the gold it was the fight to win it was his egotism  make this game faster an bigger will you retorted blicky who seemed inflamed  boss a little luck makes you lofty interposed jesse smith in dark disdain pretty soon youll show yellow clear to your gizzard  the gold lay there on the table it was only a means to an end it signified nothing the evil the terrible greed the brutal lust were in the hearts of the men and hate liberated rampant stalked out unconcealed ready for blood  gulden change the game to suit these gents taunted kells  double stakes cut the cards boomed the giant instantly  blicky lasted only a few more deals of the cards then he rose loser of all his share a passionate and venomous bandit ready for murder but he kept his mouth shut and looked wary  boss cant we set in now demanded beady jones  say beady youre in a hurry to lose your gold replied kells wait till i beat gulden and smith  luck turned against jesse smith he lost first to gulden then to kells and presently he rose a beaten but game man he reached for the whisky  fellers i reckon i can enjoy kellss yellow streak more when i aint playin he said  the bandit leader eyed smith with awakening rancor as if a persistent hint of inevitable weakness had its effect he frowned and the radiance left his face for the forbidding cast  stand around you men and see some real gambling he said  at this moment in the contest kells had twice as much gold as gulden there being a huge mound of little buckskin sacks in front of him  they began staking a bag at a time and cutting the cards the higher card winning kells won the first four cuts how strangely that radiance returned to his face then he lost and won and won and lost the other bandits grouped around only jones and braverman now manifesting any eagerness all were silent there were suspense strain mystery in the air gulden began to win consistently and kells began to change it was a sad and strange sight to see this strong mans nerve and force gradually deteriorate under a fickle fortune the time came when half the amount he had collected was in front of gulden the giant was imperturbable he might have been a huge animal or destiny or something inhuman that knew the run of luck would be his as he had taken losses so he greeted gainswith absolute indifference while kellss hands shook the giants were steady and slow and sure it must have been hateful to kellsthis faculty of guldens to meet victory identically as he met defeat the test of a great gamblers nerve was not in sustaining loss but in remaining cool with victory the fact grew manifest that gulden was a great gambler and kells was not the giant had no emotion no imagination and kells seemed all fire and whirling hope and despair and rage his vanity began to bleed to death this game was the deciding contest the scornful and exultant looks of his men proved how that game was going again and again kellss unsteady hand reached for one of the whisky bottles once with a low curse he threw an empty bottle through the door  hey boss aint it about time began jesse smith but whatever he had intended to say he thought better of withholding it kellss sudden look and movement were unmistakable  the goddess of chance as false as the bandits vanity played with him he brightened under a streak of winning but just as his face began to lose its haggard shade to glow the tide again turned against him he lost and lost and with each bag of golddust went something of his spirit and when he was reduced to his original share he indeed showed that yellow streak which jesse smith had attributed to him the bandits effort to pull himself together to be a man before that scornful gang was pitiful and futile he might have been magnificent confronted by other issues of peril or circumstance but there he was craven he was a man who should never have gambled  one after the other in quick succession he lost the two bags of gold his original share he had lost utterly gulden had the great heap of dirty little buckskin sacks so significant of the hidden power within  joan was amazed and sick at sight of kells then and if it had been possible she would have withdrawn her gaze but she was chained there the catastrophe was imminent  kells stared down at the gold his jaw worked convulsively he had the eyes of a trapped wolf yet he seemed not wholly to comprehend what had happened to him  gulden rose slow heavy ponderous to tower over his heap of gold then this giant who had never shown an emotion suddenly terribly blazed  one more beta cut of the cardsmy whole stake of gold he boomed  the bandits took a stride forward as one man then stood breathless  one bet echoed kells aghast against what  against the girl  joan sank against the wall a piercing torture in her breast she clutched the logs to keep from falling so that was the impending horror she could not unrivet her eyes from the paralyzed kells yet she seemed to see jim cleve leap straight up and then stand equally motionless with kells  one cut of the cardsmy gold against the girl boomed the giant  kells made a movement as if to go for his gun but it failed his hand was a shaking leaf  you always bragged on your nerve went on gulden mercilessly youre the gambler of the border come on  kells stood there his doom upon him plain to all was his torture his weakness his defeat it seemed that with all his soul he combated something only to fail  one cutmy gold against your girl  the gang burst into one concerted taunt like snarling bristling wolves they craned their necks at kells  no damnyou no cried kells in hoarse broken fury with both hands before him he seemed to push back the sight of that gold of gulden of the malignant men of a horrible temptation  reckon boss thet yellow streak is operatin sang out jesse smith  but neither gold nor gulden nor men nor taunts ruined kells at this perhaps most critical crisis of his life it was the mad clutching terrible opportunity presented it was the strange and terrible nature of the wager what vision might have flitted through the gamblers mind but neither vision of loss nor gain moved him there licking like a flame at his soul consuming the good in him at a blast overpowering his love was the strange and magnificent gamble he could not resist it  speechless with a motion of his hand he signified his willingness  blicky shuffle the cards boomed gulden  blicky did so and dropped the deck with a slap in the middle of the table  cut called gulden  kellss shaking hand crept toward the deck  jim cleve suddenly appeared to regain power of speech and motion dont kells dont he cried piercingly as he leaped forward  but neither kells nor the others heard him or even saw his movement  kells cut the deck he held up his card it was the king of hearts what a transformation his face might have been that of a corpse suddenly revivified with glorious leaping life  only an ace can beat thet muttered jesse smith into the silence  gulden reached for the deck as if he knew every card left was an ace his cavernous eyes gloated over kells he cut and before he looked himself he let kells see the card  you cant beat my streak he boomed  then he threw the card upon the table it was the ace of spades  kells seemed to shrivel to totter to sink jim cleve went quickly to him held to him  kells go say goodby to your girl boomed gulden ill want her pretty soon come on you beady and braverman heres your chance to get even  gulden resumed his seat and the two bandits invited to play were eager to comply while the others pressed close once more  jim cleve led the dazed kells toward the door into joans cabin for joan just then all seemed to be dark  when she recovered she was lying on the bed and jim was bending over her he looked frantic with grief and desperation and fear  jim jim she moaned grasping his hands he helped her to sit up then she saw kells standing there he looked abject stupid drunk yet evidently he had begun to comprehend the meaning of his deed  kells began cleve in low hoarse tones as he stepped forward with a gun im going to kill youand joanand myself  kells stared at cleve go ahead kill me and kill the girl too thatll be better for her now but why kill yourself  i love her shes my wife  the deadness about kells suddenly changed joan flung herself before him  kellslisten she whispered in swift broken passion jim cleve wasmy sweetheartback in hoadley we quarreled i taunted him i said he hadnt nerve enougheven to be bad he left mebitterly enraged next day i trailed him i wanted to fetch him back you rememberhow you met me with roberthow you killed roberts and all the rest when jim and i met out herei was afraid to tell you i tried to influence him i succeededtill we got to alder creek there he went wild i married himhoping to steady him then the day of the lynchingwe were separated from you in the crowd that night we hidand next morning took the stage gulden and his gang held up the stage they thought you had put us there we fooled them but we had to come onhere to cabin gulchhoping to tellthat youd let us go and nownow  joan had not strength to go on the thought of gulden made her faint  its true kells added cleve passionately as he faced the incredulous bandit i swear it why you ought to see now  my god boy i do see gasped kells that dark sodden thickness of comprehension and feeling indicative of the hold of drink passed away swiftly the shock had sobered him  instantly joan saw itsaw in him the return of the other and better kells how stricken with remorse she slipped to her knees and clasped her arms around him he tried to break her hold but she held on  get up he ordered violently jim pull her away girl dont do that in front of me ive just gambled away  her life kells only that i swear cried cleve  kells listen began joan pleadingly you will not let thatthat cannibal have me  no by god replied kells thickly i was drunkcrazy forgive me girl you seehow did i knowwhat was coming oh the whole thing is hellish  you loved me once whispered joan softly do you love me still kells cant you see its not too late to save my lifeand your soul cant you see you have been bad but if you save me nowfrom guldensave me for this boy ive almost ruinedyouyou god will forgive you take us awaygo with usand never come back to the border  maybe i can save you he muttered as if to himself he appeared to want to think but to be bothered by the clinging arms around him joan felt a ripple go over his body and he seemed to heighten and the touch of his hands thrilled  then white and appealing cleve added his importunity  kells i saved your life once you said youd remember it some day nownow for gods sake dont make me shoot her  joan rose from her knees but she still clasped kells she seemed to feel the mounting of his spirit to understand how in this moment he was rising out of the depths how strangely glad she was for him  joan once you showed me what the love of a good woman really was ive never seen the same since then ive grown better in one wayworse in all others i let down i was no man for the border always that haunted me believe me wont youdespite all  joan felt the yearning in him for what he dared not ask she read his mind she knew he meant somehow to atone for his wrong  ill show you again she whispered ill tell you more if id never loved jim cleveif id met you id have loved you and bandit or not id have gone with you to the end of the world  joan the name was almost a sob of joy and pain sight of his face then blinded joan with her tears but when he caught her to him in a violence that was a terrible renunciation she gave her embrace her arms her lips without the vestige of a lie with all of womanliness and sweetness and love and passion he let her go and turned away and in that instant joan had a final divination that this strange man could rise once to heights as supreme as the depths of his soul were dark she dashed away her tears and wiped the dimness from her eyes hope resurged something strong and sweet gave her strength  when kells wheeled he was the kells of her earlier experiencecool easy deadly with the smile almost amiable and the strange pale eyes only the white radiance of him was different he did not look at her  jim will you do exactly what i tell you  yes i promise replied jim  how many guns have you  two  give me one of them  cleve held out the gun that all the while he had kept in his hand kells took it and put it in his pocket  pull your other gunbe ready said he swiftly but dont you shoot once till i go down then do your best save the last bullet for joanin case  i promise replied cleve steadily  then kells drew a knife from a sheath at his belt it had a long bright blade joan had seen him use it many a time round the campfire he slipped the blade up his sleeve retaining the haft of the knife in his hand he did not speak another word nor did he glance at joan again she had felt his gaze while she had embraced him as she raised her lips that look had been his last then he went out jim knelt beside the door peering between post and curtain  joan staggered to the chink between the logs she would see that fight if it froze her bloodthe very marrow of her bones  the gamblers were intent upon their game not a dark face looked up as kells sauntered toward the table gulden sat with his back to the door there was a shaft of sunlight streaming in and kells blocked it sending a shadow over the bent heads of the gamesters how significant that shadowa blackness barring gold still no one paid any attention to kells  he stepped closer suddenly he leaped into swift and terrible violence then with a lunge he drove the knife into guldens burly neck  up heaved the giant his mighty force overturning table and benches and men an awful boom strangely distorted and split burst from him  then kells blocked the door with a gun in each hand but only the one in his right hand spurted white and red instantly there followed a mad scramblehoarse yells over which that awful roar of guldens predominatedand the bang of guns clouds of white smoke veiled the scene and with every shot the veil grew denser red flashes burst from the ground where men were down and from each side of kells his form seemed less instinct with force it had shortened he was sagging but at intervals the red spurt and report of his gun showed he was fighting then a volley from one side made him stagger against the door the clear spang of a winchester spoke above the heavy boom of the guns  joans eyesight recovered from its blur or else the haze of smoke drifted for she saw better guldens actions fascinated her horrified her he had evidently gone crazy he groped about the room through the smoke to and fro before the fighting yelling bandits grasping with huge hands for something his sense of direction his equilibrium had become affected his awful roar still sounded above the din but it was weakening his giants strength was weakening his legs bent and buckled under him all at once he whipped out his two big guns and began to fire as he staggeredat random he killed the wounded blicky in the melee he ran against jesse smith and thrust both guns at him jesse saw the peril and with a shriek he fired pointblank at gulden then as gulden pulled triggers both men fell but gulden rose bloodybrowed bawling still a terrible engine of destruction he seemed to glare in one direction and shoot in another he pointed the guns and apparently pulled the triggers long after the shots had all been fired  kells was on his knees now with only one gun this wavered and fell wavered and fell his left arm hung broken but his face flashed white through the thin drifting clouds of smoke  besides gulden the bandit pike was the only one not down and he was hard hit when he shot his last he threw the gun away and drawing a knife he made at kells kells shot once more and hit pike but did not stop him silence after the shots and yells seemed weird and the groping giant trying to follow pike resembled a huge phantom with one wrench he tore off a leg of the overturned table and brandished that he swayed now and there was a whistle where before there had been a roar  pike fell over the body of blicky and got up again the bandit leader staggered to his feet flung the useless gun in pikes face and closed with him in weak but final combat they lurched and careened to and fro with the giant gulden swaying after them thus they struggled until pike moved under guldens swinging club the impetus of the blow carried gulden off his balance kells seized the haft of the knife still protruding from the giants neck and he pulled upon it with all his might gulden heaved up again and the movement enabled kells to pull out the knife a bursting gush of blood thick and heavy went flooding before the giant as he fell  kells dropped the knife and tottering surveyed the scene before himthe gasping gulden and all the quiet forms then he made a few halting steps and dropped near the door  joan tried to rush out but what with the unsteadiness of her limbs and jim holding her as he went out too she seemed long in getting to kells  she knelt beside him lifted his head his face was whitehis eyes were open but they were only the windows of a retreating soul he did not know her consciousness was gone then swiftly life fled     20  cleve steadied joan in her saddle and stood a moment beside her holding her hands the darkness seemed clearing before her eyes and the sick pain within her seemed numbing out  brace up hangto your saddle jim was saying earnestly any moment some of the other bandits might come you lead the way ill follow and drive the packhorse  but jim ill never be able to find the backtrail said joan  i think you will youll remember every yard of the trail on which you were brought in here you wont realize that till you see  joan started and did not look back cabin gulch was like a place in a dream it was a relief when she rode out into the broad valley the grazing horses lifted their heads to whistle joan saw the clumps of bushes and the flowers the waving grass but never as she had seen them before how strange that she knew exactly which way to turn to head to cross she trotted her horse so fast that jim called to say he could not drive a packanimal and keep to her gait every rod of the trail lessened a burden behind was something hideous and incomprehensible and terrible before beckoned something beginning to seem bright and it was not the ruddy calm sunset flooding the hills with color that something called from beyond the hills  she led straight to a campsite she remembered long before she came to it and the charred logs of the fire the rocks the tree under which she had lainall brought back the emotions she had felt there she grew afraid of the twilight and when night settled down there were phantoms stalking in the shadows when cleve in his hurried camp duties went out of her sight she wanted to cry out to him but had not the voice and when he was close still she trembled and was cold he wrapped blankets round her and held her in his arms yet the numb chill and the dark clamp of mind remained with her long she lay awake the stars were pitiless when she shut her eyes the blackness seemed unendurable she slept to wake out of nightmare and she dared sleep no more at last the day came  for joan that faint trail seemed a broad road blazoned through the wild canons and up the rocky fastness and through the thick brakes she led on and on and up and down never at fault with familiar landmarks near and far cleve hung close to her and now his call to her or to the packhorse took on a keener note every rough and wild mile behind them meant so much they did not halt at the noon hour they did not halt at the next campsite still more darkly memorable to joan and sunset found them miles farther on down on the divide at the head of lost canon  here joan ate and drank and slept the deep sleep of exhaustion sunrise found them moving and through the winding wild canon they made fast travel both time and miles passed swiftly at noon they reached the little open cabin and they dismounted for a rest and a drink at the spring joan did not speak a word here that she could look into the cabin where she had almost killed a bandit and then through silent lonely weeks had nursed him back to life was a proof that the long ride and distance were helping her sloughing away the dark deadlock to hope and brightness they left the place exactly as they had found it except that cleve plucked the card from the bark of the balsamtreeguldens aceofhearts target with its bulletholes  then they rode on out of that canon over the rocky ridge down into another canon on and on past an old campsite along a babbling brook for miles and so at last out into the foothills  toward noon of the next day when approaching a clump of low trees in a flat valley joan pointed ahead  jimit was in therewhere roberts and i campedand  you ride around ill catch up with you replied cleve  she made a wide detour to come back again to her own trail so different here presently cleve joined her his face was pale and sweaty and he looked sick they rode on silently and that night they camped without water on her own trail made months before the single tracks were there sharp and clear in the earth as if imprinted but a day  next morning joan found that as the wild border lay behind her so did the dark and hateful shadow of gloom only the pain remained and it had softened she could think now  jim cleve cheered up perhaps it was her brightening to which he responded they began to talk and speech liberated feeling miles of that backtrail they rode side by side holding hands driving the packhorse ahead and beginning to talk of old associations again it was sunset when they rode down the hill toward the little village of hoadley joans heart was full but jim was gay  wont i have it on your old fellows he teased but he was grim too  jim youwont telljust yet she faltered  ill introduce you as my wife theyll all think we eloped  no theyll say i ran after you please jim keep it secret a little itll be hard for me aunt jane will never understand  well ill keep it secret till you want to tellfor two things he said  what  meet me tonight under the spruces where we had that quarrel meet just like we did then but differently will you  ill beso glad  and put on your mask now you know joan sooner or later your story will be on everybodys tongue youll be dandy dale as long as you live near this border wear the mask just for fun imagine your aunt janeand everybody  jim id forgotten how i look exclaimed joan in dismay i didnt bring your long coat oh i cant face them in this suit  youll have to besides you look great its going to tickle methe sensation you make dont you see theyll never recognize you till you take the mask off please joan  she yielded and donned the black mask not without a twinge and thus they rode across the log bridge over the creek into the village the few men and women they met stared in wonder and recognizing cleve they grew excited they followed and others joined them  joan wont it be strange if uncle bill really is the overland of alder creek weve packed out every pound of overlands gold oh i hopei believe hes your uncle wouldnt it be great joan  but joan could not answer the word gold was a stab besides she saw aunt jane and two neighbors standing before a log cabin beginning to show signs of interest in the approaching procession  joan fell back a little trying to screen herself behind jim then jim halted with a cheery salute  for the lands sake ejaculated a sweetfaced grayhaired woman  if it isnt jim cleve cried another  jim jumped off and hugged the first speaker she seemed overjoyed to see him and then overcome her face began to work  jim we always hoped youdyoud fetch joan back  sure shouted jim who had no heart now for even an instants deception there she is  who what  joan slipped out of her saddle and tearing off the mask she leaped forward with a little sob  auntie auntie its joanalivewell oh so glad to be home dont look at my clotheslook at me  aunt jane evidently sustained a shock of recognition joy amaze consternation and shame of which all were subservient to the joy she cried over joan and murmured over her then suddenly alive to the curious crowd she put joan from her  youyou wild thing you desperado i always told bill youd run wild some day march in the house and get out of that indecent rig  that night under the spruces with the starlight piercing the lacy shadows joan waited for jim cleve it was one of the white silent mountain nights the brook murmured over the stones and the wind rustled the branches  the wonder of joans homecoming was in learning that uncle bill hoadley was indeed overland the discoverer of alder creek years and years of profitless toil had at last been rewarded in this rich gold strike  joan hated to think of gold she had wanted to leave the gold back in cabin gulch and she would have done so had jim permitted it and to think that all that gold which was not jim cleves belonged to her uncle she could not believe it  fatal and terrible forever to joan would be the significance of gold did any woman in the world or any man know the meaning of gold as well as she knew it how strange and enlightening and terrible had been her experience she had grown now not to blame any man honest miner or bloody bandit she blamed only gold she doubted its value she could not see it a blessing she absolutely knew its driving power to change the souls of men could she ever forget that vast anthill of toiling diggers and washers blind and deaf and dumb to all save gold  always limned in figures of fire against the black memory would be the forms of those wild and violent bandits gulden the monster the gorilla the cannibal horrible as was the memory of him there was no horror in thought of his terrible death that seemed to be the one memory that did not hurt  but kells was indestructiblehe lived in her mind safe out of the border now and at home she could look back clearly still all was not clear and never would be she saw kells the ruthless bandit the organizer the planner and the bloodspiller he ought have no place in a good womans memory yet he had she never condoned one of his deeds or even his intentions she knew her intelligence was not broad enough to grasp the vastness of his guilt she believed he must have been the worst and most terrible character on that wild border that border had developed him it had produced the time and the place and the man and therein lay the mystery for over against this bandits weakness and evil she could contrast strength and nobility she alone had known the real man in all the strange phases of his nature and the darkness of his crime faded out of her mind she suffered remorsealmost regret yet what could she have done there had been no help for that impossible situation as there was now no help for her in a right and just placing of kells among men he had stolen herwantonly murdering for the sake of lonely fruitless hours with her he had loved herand he had changed he had gambled away her soul and lifea last and terrible proof of the evil power of gold and in the end he had saved herhe had gone from her white radiant cool with strange pale eyes and his amiable mocking smile and all the ruthless force of his life had expended itself in one last magnificent stand if only he had known her at the endwhen she lifted his head but nothere had been only the fading lightthe strange weird look of a retreating soul already alone forever  a rustling of leaves a step thrilled joan out of her meditation  suddenly she was seized from behind and jim cleve showed that though he might be a joyous and grateful lover he certainly would never be an actor for if he desired to live over again that fatal meeting and quarrel which had sent them out to the border he failed utterly in his part there was possession in the gentle grasp of his arms and bliss in the trembling of his lips  jim you never did it that way laughed joan if you haddo you think i could ever have been furious  jim in turn laughed happily joan thats exactly the way i stole upon you and mauled you  you think so well i happen to remember now you sit here and make believe you are joan and let me be jim cleve ill show you  joan stole away in the darkness and noiselessly as a shadow she stole backto enact that violent scene as it lived in her memory  jim was breathless speechless choked  thats how you treated me she said  ii dont believe i could havebeen such aa bear panted jim  but you were and considerive not half your strength  then all i say isyou did right to drive me off only you should never have trailed me out to the border  ah but jim in my fury i discovered my love
