illustration publishers logo     a small boy and others     i   in the attempt to place together some particulars of the early life of william james and present him in his setting his immediate native and domestic air so that any future gathered memorials of him might become the more intelligible and interesting i found one of the consequences of my interrogation of the past assert itself a good deal at the expense of some of the others for it was to memory in the first place that my main appeal for particulars had to be made i had been too near a witness of my brothers beginnings of life and too close a participant by affection admiration and sympathy in whatever touched and moved him not to feel myself in possession even of a greater quantity of significant truth a larger handful of the fine substance of history than i could hope to express or apply to recover anything like the full treasure of scattered wasted circumstance was at the same time to live over the spent experience itself so deep and rich and rare with whatever sadder and sorer intensities even with whatever poorer and thinner passages after the manner of every ones experience and the effect of this in turn was to find discrimination among the parts of my subject again and again difficultso inseparably and beautifully they seemed to hang together and the comprehensive case to decline mutilation or refuse to be treated otherwise than handsomely this meant that aspects began to multiply and images to swarm so far at least as they showed to appreciation as true terms and happy values and that i might positively and exceedingly rejoice in my relation to most of them using it for all that as the phrase is it should be worth to knock at the door of the past was in a word to see it open to me quite wideto see the world within begin to compose with a grace of its own round the primary figure see it people itself vividly and insistently such then is the circle of my commemoration and so much these free and copious notes a labour of love and loyalty we were to my sense the blest group of us such a company of characters and such a picture of differences and withal so fused and united and interlocked that each of us to that fond fancy pleads for preservation and that in respect to what i speak of myself as possessing i think i shall be ashamed as of a cold impiety to find any element altogether negligible to which i may add perhaps that i struggle under the drawback innate and inbred of seeing the whole content of memory and affection in each enacted and recovered moment as who should say in the vivid image and the very scene the light of the only terms in which life has treated me to experience and i cherish the moment and evoke the image and repaint the scene though meanwhile indeed scarce able to convey how prevailingly and almost exclusively during years and years the field was animated and the adventure conditioned for me by my brothers nearness and that play of genius in him of which i had never had a doubt from the first  the first thensince i retrace our steps to the start for the pleasure strangely mixed though it be of feeling our small feet plant themselves afresh and artlessly stumble forward againthe first began long ago far off and yet glimmers at me there as out of a thin golden haze with all the charm for imagination and memory of pressing pursuit rewarded of distinctness in the dimness of the flush of life in the grey of the wonder of consciousness in everything everything having naturally been all the while but the abject little matter of course partly doubtless as the effect of a life now getting to be a tolerably long one spent in the older world i see the world of our childhood as very young indeed young with its own juvenility as well as with ours as if it wore the few and light garments and had gathered in but the scant properties and breakable toys of the tenderest age or were at the most a very unformed young person even a boisterous hobbledehoy it exhaled at any rate a simple freshness and i catch its pure breath at our infantile albany as the very air of long summer afternoonsoccasions tasting of ample leisure still bookless yet beginning to be bedless or cribless tasting of accessible garden peaches in a liberal backward territory that was still almost part of a country town tasting of manysized uncles aunts cousins of strange legendary domestics inveterately but archaically irish and whose familiar remarks and criticism of life were handed down as well as of dim family ramifications and local allusionsmystifications alwaysthat flowered into anecdote as into small hard plums tasting above all of a big muchshaded savoury house in which a softlysighing widowed grandmother catherine barber by birth whose attitude was a resigned consciousness of complications and accretions dispensed an hospitality seemingly as joyless as it was certainly boundless what she liked dear gentle lady of many cares and anxieties was the fiction of the day the novels at that time promptly pirated of mrs trollope and mrs gore of mrs marsh mrs hubback and the misses kavanagh and aguilar whose very names are forgotten now but which used to drive her away to quiet corners whence her figure comes back to me bent forward on a table with the book held out at a distance and a tall single candle placed apparently not at all to her discomfort in that age of sparer and braver habits straight between the page and her eyes there is a very animated allusion to one or two of her aspects in the fragment of a spiritual autobiography the reminiscences of a socalled stephen dewhurst printed by w j 1885 in the literary remains of henry james a reference which has the interest of being very nearly as characteristic of my father himself which his references in almost any connection were wont to be as of the person or the occasion evoked i had reached my sixteenth year when she died and as my only remembered grandparent she touches the chord of attachment to a particular vibration she represented for us in our generation the only english bloodthat of both her own parentsflowing in our veins i confess that out of that association for reasons and reasons i feel her image most beneficently bend we were as to three parts of two other stocks and i recall how from far back i reflectedfor i see i must have been always reflectingthat mixed as such a mixture our scotch with our irish might be it had had still a grace to borrow from the third infusion or dimension if i could freely have chosen moreover it was precisely from my fathers mother that fond votary of the finest faith in the vivifying and characterising force of mothers i should have wished to borrow it even while conscious that catherine barbers own people had drawn breath in american air for at least two generations before her our fathers father william james an irishman and a protestant born of county cavan had come to america a very young man and then sole of his family shortly after the revolutionary war my father the second son of the third of the marriages to which the country of his adoption was liberally to help him had been born in albany in 1811 our maternal greatgrandfather on the fathers side hugh walsh had reached our shores from a like irish home killyleagh county down somewhat earlier in 1764 he being then nineteen he had settled at newburghonthehudson half way to albany where some of his descendants till lately lingered our maternal greatgrandfather on the mothers sidethat is our mothers mothers father alexander robertson of polmont near edinburghhad likewise crossed the sea in the midcentury and prospered in new york very much as hugh walsh was prospering and william james was still more markedly to prosper further up the hudson as unanimous and fortunate beholders of the course of which admirable stream i like to think of them i find alexander robertson inscribed in a wee new york directory of the close of the century as merchant and our childhood in that city was passed as to some of its aspects in a sense of the afterglow reduced and circumscribed it is true but by no means wholly inanimate of his shining solidity  the sweet taste of albany probably lurked most in its being our admired antithesis to new york it was holiday whereas new york was home at least that presently came to be the relation for to my very very first fleeting vision i apprehend albany itself must have been the scene exhibited our parents had gone there for a year or two to be near our grandmother on their return from their first that is our mothers first visit to europe which had quite immediately followed my birth which appears to have lasted some year and a half and of which i shall have another word to say the albany experiment would have been then their first founded housekeeping since i make them out to have betaken themselves for the winter following their marriage to the ancient astor housenot indeed at that time ancient but the great and appointed modern hotel of new york the only one of such pretensions and which somehow continued to project its massive image that of a great square block of granite with vast dark warm interiors across some of the later and more sensitive stages of my infancy clearlyor i should perhaps rather say dimlyrecourse to that hospitality was again occasionally had by our parents who had originally had it to such a happy end that on january 9th 1842 my elder brother had come into the world there it remained a tradition with him that our fathers friend from an early time r w emerson then happening to be in new york and under that convenient roof was proudly and pressingly taken upstairs to admire and give his blessing to the latelyborn babe who was to become the second american william james the blessing was to be renewed i may mention in the sense that among the impressions of the next early years i easily distinguish that of the great and urbane emersons occasional presence in fourteenth street a centre of many images where the parental tent was before long to pitch itself and rest awhile i am interested for the moment however in identifying the scene of our very first perceptionsof my very own at least which i can here best speak for  one of these and probably the promptest in order was that of my brothers occupying a place in the world to which i couldnt at all aspireto any approach to which in truth i seem to myself ever conscious of having signally forfeited a title it glimmers back to me that i quite definitely and resignedly thought of him as in the most exemplary manner already beforehand with me already seated at his task when the attempt to drag me crying and kicking to the first hour of my education failed on the threshold of the dutch house in albany after the fashion i have glanced at in a collection of other pages than these just as i remember to have once borrowed a hint from our grandmothers interior in a work of imagination that failure of my powers or that indifference to them my retreat shrieking from the dutch house was to leave him once for all already there an embodied demonstration of the possiblealready wherever it might be that there was a question of my arriving when arriving at all belatedly and ruefully as if he had gained such an advance of me in his sixteen months experience of the world before mine began that i never for all the time of childhood and youth in the least caught up with him or overtook him he was always round the corner and out of sight coming back into view but at his hours of extremest ease we were never in the same schoolroom in the same game scarce even in step together or in the same phase at the same time when our phases overlapped that is it was only for a momenthe was clean out before i had got well in how far he had really at any moment dashed forward it is not for me now to attempt to say what comes to me is that i at least hung inveterately and woefully back and that this relation alike to our interests and to each other seemed proper and preappointed i lose myself in wonder at the loose ways the strange process of waste through which nature and fortune may deal on occasion with those whose faculty for application is all and only in their imagination and their sensibility there may be during those bewildered and brooding years so little for them to show that i liken the individual dunceas he so often must appearto some commercial traveller who has lost the key to his packed case of samples and can but pass for a fool while other exhibitions go forward  i achieve withal a dim remembrance of my final submission though it is the faintest ghost of an impression and consists but of the bright blur of a dames schoolroom a mere medium for small piping shuffling sound and suffered heat as well as for the wistfulness produced by glimmering squares that were fitfully screened though not to any revival of cheer by a huge swaying yet dominant object this dominant object the shepherdess of the flock was miss bayou or bayhooi recover but the alien sound of her name which memory caresses only because she may have been of like race with her temple of learning which faced my grandmothers house in north pearl street and really justified its exotic claim by its yellow archaic gableend i think of the same as of brick baked in the land of dykes and making a series of small steps from the base of the gable to the point these images are subject i confess to a soft confusionwhich is somehow consecrated none the less and out of which with its shade of contributory truth some sort of scene insists on glancing the very flush of the uneven bricks of the pavement lives in it the very smell of the street cobbles the imputed grace of the arching umbragei see it all as from under trees the form of steuben street which crossed our view as steep even to the very essence of adventure with a summit and still more with a nethermost and riskiest incline very far away there lives in it the aspect of the other housethe other and much smaller than my grandmothers conveniently near it and within sight which was pinkishred picked out with white whereas my grandmothers was greyishbrown and very grave and which must have stood back a little from the street as i seem even now to swing or at least to perch on a relaxed gate of approach that was conceived to work by an iron chain weighted with a big ball all under a spreading tree again and with the high oh so high white stone steps mustnt they have been marble and fanlighted door of the pinkishred front behind me i lose myself in ravishment before the marble and the pink there were other houses tooone of them the occasion of the first paid visit that struggles with my twilight of social consciousness a call with my father conveying me presumably for fond exhibition since if my powers were not exhibitional my appearance and my long fair curls of which i distinctly remember the lachrymose sacrifice suppositiously were on one of our aunts the youngest of his three sisters lately married and who predestined to an early death hovers there for me softly spectral in long light front ringlets the fashion of the time and the capital sign of all our paternal aunts seemingly with the remembered enhancement of her living in elk street the name itself vaguely portentous as through beasts of the forest not yet wholly exorcised and more or less under the high brow of that capitol which as aloft somewhere and beneath the thickest shades of all loomed familiar yet impressive at the end of almost any albany vista of reference i have seen other capitols since but the whole majesty of the matter must have been then distilled into my mindeven though the connection was indirect and the concrete image that of the primitive structure long since pretentiously and insecurely supersededso that later on the impression was to find itself as the phrase is discounted had it not moreover been reinforced at the time for that particular capitoline hour by the fact that our uncle our aunts husband was a son of mr martin van buren and that he was the president this at least led the imagination onor leads in any case my present imagination of that one ministering to what i have called the soft confusion  the confusion clears however though the softness remains when ceasing to press too far backward i meet the ampler light of conscious and educated little returns to the place for the education of new york enjoyed up to my twelfth year failed to blight its romantic appeal the images i really distinguish flush through the maturer medium but with the sense of them only the more wondrous the other house the house of my parents limited early sojourn becomes that of those of our cousins numerous at that time who preeminently figured for us the various brood presided over by my fathers second sister catherine james who had married at a very early age captain robert temple usa both these parents were to die young and their children six in number the two eldest boys were very markedly to people our preliminary scene this being true in particular of three of them the sharply differing brothers and the second sister mary temple radiant and rare extinguished in her first youth but after having made an impression on many persons and on ourselves not least which was to become in the harmonious circle for all time matter of sacred legend and reference of associated piety those and others with them were the numerous dawnings on which in many cases the deepening and final darknesses were so soon to follow our fathers family was to offer such a chronicle of early deaths arrested careers broken promises orphaned children it sounds coldblooded but part of the charm of our grandmothers house for usor i should perhaps but speak for myselfwas in its being so much and so sociably a nurseried and playroomed orphanage the children of her lost daughters and daughtersinlaw overflowed there mainly as girls on whom the surviving sonsinlaw and sons occasionally and most trustingly looked in parentally bereft cousins were somehow more thrilling than parentally provided ones and most thrilling when in the odd fashion of that time they were sent to school in new york as a preliminary to their being sent to school in europe they spent scraps of holidays with us in fourteenth street and i think my first childish conception of the enviable lot formed amid these associations was to be so little fathered or mothered so little sunk in the short range that the romance of life seemed to lie in some constant improvisation by vague overhovering authorities of new situations and horizons we were intensely domesticated yet for the very reason perhaps that we felt our young bonds easy and they were so easy compared to other small plights of which we had stray glimpses that my first assured conception of true richness was that we should be sent separately off among cold or even cruel aliens in order to be there thrillingly homesick homesickness was a luxury i remember craving from the tenderest agea luxury of which i was unnaturally or at least prosaically deprived our motherless cousin augustus barker came up from albany to the institution charlierunless it was as i suspect a still earlier specimen with a name that fades from me of that type of french establishment for boys which then and for years after so incongruously flourished in new york and though he professed a complete satisfaction with pleasures tasted in our innocent society i felt that he was engaged in a brave and strenuous adventure while we but hugged the comparatively safe shore     ii   we were dayboys william and i at dispensaries of learning the number and succession of which today excite my wonder we couldnt have changed oftener it strikes me as i look back if our presence had been inveterately objected to and yet i enjoy an inward certainty that my brother being vividly bright and i quite blankly innocuous this reproach was never brought home to our house it was an humiliation to me at first small boys though we were that our instructors kept being instructresses and thereby a grave reflection both on our attainments and our spirit a bevy of these educative ladies passes before me i still possess their names as for instance that of mrs daly and that of miss rogers previously of the chelsea female institute though at the moment of sixth avenue this latter whose benches indeed my brother didnt haunt but who handled us literally with glovesi still see the elegant objects as miss rogers beat time with a long black ferule to some species of droning chant or chorus in which we spent most of our hours just as i see her very tall and straight and spare in a light blue dress her firm face framed in long black glossy ringlets and the stamp of the chelsea female institute all over her mrs daly clearly the immediate successor to the nebulous miss bayou remains quite substantialperhaps because the sphere of her small influence has succeeded in not passing away up to this present writing so that in certain notes on new york published a few years since i was moved to refer to it with emotion as one of the small red houses on the south side of waverley place that really carry the imagination back to a vanished social order they carry mine to a stout redfaced lady with grey hair and a large apron the latter convenience somehow suggesting as she stood about with a resolute air that she viewed her little pupils as so many small slices cut from the loaf of life and on which she was to dab the butter of arithmetic and spelling accompanied by way of jam with a light application of the practice of prizegiving i recall an occasion indeed i must in justice mention when the jam really was thickmy only memory of a schoolfeast strange to say throughout our young annals something uncanny in the air of the schoolroom at the unwonted evening or late afternoon hour and tables that seemed to me prodigiously long and on which the edibles were chunky and sticky the stout redfaced lady must have been irish as the name she bore importedor do i think so but from the indescribably irish look of her revisited house it refers itself at any rate to a new york age in which a little more or a little less of the colour was scarce notable in the general flush  of pure unimported strain however were miss sedgwick and mrs wright lavinia d the next figures in the processionthe procession that was to wind up indeed with two foreign recruits small brown snappy mademoiselle delavigne who plied us with the french tongue at home and who had been introduced to us as the nieceor could it have been the grandnieceof the celebrated casimir and a large russian lady in an extraordinarily short cape i like to recall the fashion of short capes of the same stuff as her dress and merovingian sidebraids that seemed to require the royal crown of frédégonde or brunéhaut to complete their effect this final and aggravational representative of the compromising sex looms to my minds eye i should add but as the creature of an hour in spite of her having been domiciled with us whereas i think of mademoiselle delavigne as flitting in and out on quick fine more or less clothshod feet of exemplary neatness the flatsoled feet of louis philippe and of the female figures in those volumes of gavarni then actual then contemporaneous which were kept in a piece of furniture that stood between the frontparlour windows in fourteenth street together with a set of béranger enriched by steel engravings to the strange imagery of which i so wonderingly responded that all other art of illustration ever since has been for me comparatively weak and cold these volumes and the tall entrancing folios of nashs lithographed mansions of england in the olden time formed a store lending itself particularly to distribution on the drawingroom carpet with concomitant pressure to the same surface of the small students stomach and relieving agitation of his backward heels i make out that it had decidedly been given to mlle delavigne to represent to my first perception personal france she was besides not being at all pink or shy oval and fluent and mistress somehow of the stepthe step of levity that involved a whisk of her short skirts there she was to the life on the page of gavarni attesting its reality and there again did that page in return i speak not of course of the unplumbed depths of the appended text attest her own felicity i was later on to feelthat is i was to learnhow many impressions and appearances how large a sense of things her type and tone prefigured the evanescence of the large russian lady whom i think of as rather rank i cant express it otherwise may have been owing to some question of the purity of her accent in french it was one of her attributes and her grounds of appeal to us that she had come straight from siberia and it is distinct to me that the purity was challenged by a friend of the house and withoutpathetically enoughprovoking the only answer the plea that the missing atticism would have been wasted on young barbarians the siberian note on our inmates part may perhaps have been the least of her incongruities she was above all too big for a little job towered over us doubtless too heroically and her proportions hover but to lose themselveswith the successors to her function awaiting us a little longer  meanwhile to revert an instant if the depressed consciousness of our still more or less quailing educationally beneath the female eyeand there was as well the deeper depth there was the degrading fact that with us literally consorted and contended girls that we sat and strove even though we drew the line at playing with them and at knowing them when not of the swarming cousinship at homeif that felt awkwardness didnt exactly coincide with the ironic effect of gussys appearances his emergence from rich mystery and his return to it our state was but comparatively the braver he always had so much more to tell us than we could possibly have to tell him on reflection i see that the most completely rueful period couldnt after all greatly have prolonged itself since the female eye last bent on us would have been that of lavinia d wright to our connection with whom a small odd reminiscence attaches a date a little schoolmate displayed to me with pride while the connection lasted a beautiful coloured a positively iridescent and gilded card representing the first of all the great exhibitions of our age the london crystal palace of 1851his father having lately gone out to it and sent him the dazzling memento in 1851 i was eight years old and my brother scarce more than nine in addition to which it is distinct to me in the first place that we were never faithful long or for more than one winter to the same studious scene and in the second that among our instructors mrs lavinia had no successor of her own sex unless i count mrs vredenburg of new brighton where we spent the summer of 1854 when i had reached the age of eleven and found myself bewildered by recognition of the part that attendance at school was so meanly to play in the hitherto unclouded long vacation this was true at least for myself and my next younger brother wilky who under the presumption now dawning of his community of pursuits with my own was from that moment off and on for a few years my extremely easy yokefellow and playfellow on william charged with learningi thought of him inveterately from our younger time as charged with learningno such trick was played he rested or roamed that summer on his accumulations a fact which as i was sure i saw these more and more richly accumulate didnt in the least make me wonder it comes back to me in truth that i had been prepared for anything by his having said to me toward the end of our time at lavinia ds and with characteristic authorityhis enjoyment of it coming from my character i mean quite as much as from his ownthat that lady was a very able woman as shown by the experiments upstairs he was upstairs of course and i was down and i scarce even knew what experiments were beyond their indeed requiring capability the region of their performance was williams natural sphere though i recall that i had a sense of peeping into it to a thrilled effect on seeing our instructress illustrate the proper way to extinguish a candle she firmly pressed the flame between her thumb and her two forefingers and on my remarking that i didnt see how she could do it promptly replied that i of course couldnt do it myself as he could because i should be afraid  that reflection on my courage awakes another echo of the same scant seasonsince the test involved must have been that of our taking our way home through fourth avenue from some point up town and mrs wrights situation in east twentyfirst street was such a point the hudson river railroad was then in course of construction or was being made to traverse the upper reaches of the city through that part of which raged to my young sense a riot of explosion and a great shouting and waving of red flags when the gunpowder introduced into the rocky soil was about to take effect it was our theory that our passage there in the early afternoon was beset with danger and our impression that we saw fragments of rock hurtle through the air and smite to the earth another and yet another of the persons engaged or exposed the point of honour among several of us was of course nobly to defy the danger and i feel again the emotion with which i both hoped and feared that the red flags lurid signals descried from afar would enable or compel us to renew the feat that i didnt for myself inveterately renew it i seem to infer from the memory of other perambulations of the periodas to which i am divided between their still present freshness and my sense of perhaps making too much of these tiny particles of history my stronger rule however i confess and the one by which i must here consistently be guided is that from the moment it is a question of projecting a picture no particle that counts for memory or is appreciable to the spirit can be too tiny and that experience in the name of which one speaks is all compact of them and shining with them there was at any rate another way home with other appeals which consisted of getting straight along westward to broadway a sphere of a different order of fascination and bristling as i seem to recall with more vivid aspects greater curiosities and wonderments the curiosity was of course the countryplace as i supposed it to be on the northeast corner of eighteenth street if i am not mistaken a big brown house in grounds peopled with animal life which little as its site may appear to know it today lingered on into considerably later years i have but to close my eyes in order to open them inwardly again while i lean against the tall brown iron rails and peer through to a romantic view of browsing and pecking and parading creatures not numerous but all of distinguished appearance two or three elegant little cows of refined form and colour two or three nibbling fawns and a larger company above all of peacocks and guineafowl with doubtlessthough as to this i am vaguesome of the commoner ornaments of the barnyard i recognise that the scene as i evoke it fails of grandeur but it none the less had for me the note of greatnessall of which but shows of course what a very townbred small person i was and was to remain  i see myself moreover as somehow always alone in these and like new york flâneries and contemplations and feel how the sense of my being so being at any rate master of my short steps such as they were through all the beguiling streets was probably the very savour of each of my chance feasts which stirs in me at the same time some wonder at the liberty of range and opportunity of adventure allowed to my tender age though the puzzle may very well drop after all as i ruefully reflect that i couldnt have been judged at home reckless or adventurous what i look back to as my infant license can only have had for its ground some timely conviction on the part of my elders that the only form of riot or revel ever known to me would be that of the visiting mind wasnt i myself for that matter even at that time all acutely and yet resignedly even quite fatalistically aware of what to think of this i at any rate watch the small boy dawdle and gape again i smell the cold dusty paint and iron as the rails of the eighteenth street corner rub his contemplative nose and feeling him foredoomed withhold from him no grain of my sympathy he is a convenient little image or warning of all that was to be for him and he might well have been even happier than he was for there was the very pattern and measure of all he was to demand just to be somewherealmost anywhere would doand somehow receive an impression or an accession feel a relation or a vibration he was to go without many things ever so manyas all persons do in whom contemplation takes so much the place of action but everywhere in the years that came soon after and that in fact continued long in the streets of great towns in new york still for some time and then for a while in london in paris in geneva wherever it might be he was to enjoy more than anything the so far from showy practice of wondering and dawdling and gaping he was really i think much to profit by it what it at all appreciably gave himthat is gave him in producible formwould be difficult to state but it seems to him as he even now thus indulges himself an education like another feeling as he has come to do more and more that no education avails for the intelligence that doesnt stir in it some subjective passion and that on the other hand almost anything that does so act is largely educative however small a figure the process might make in a scheme of training strange indeed furthermore are some of the things that have stirred a subjective passionstirred it i mean in young persons predisposed to a more or less fine inspired application     iii   but i positively dawdle and gape herei catch myself in the act so that i take up the thread of fond reflection that guides me through that mystification of the summer school which i referred to a little way back at the time when the summer school as known in america today was so deep in the bosom of the future the seat of acquisition i speak of must have been contiguous to the house we occupiedi recall it as most intimately and objectionably nearand carried on in the interest of those parents from new york who in villeggiatura under the queer conditions of those days with the many modern mitigations of the gregarious lot still unrevealed and the many refinements on the individual one still undeveloped welcomed almost any influence that might help at all to form their children to civility yet i remember that particular influence as more noisy and drowsy and dusty than anything elseas to which it must have partaken strongly of the general nature of new brighton a neighbourhood that no apt agency whatever had up to that time concerned itself to fashion and that was indeed to remain shabbily shapeless for years since i recall almost as dire an impression of it received in the summer of 1875 i seem more or less to have begun life for that matter with impressions of new brighton there comes back to me another considerably more infantile than that of 1854 so infantile indeed that i wonder at its having stuckthat of a place called the pavilion which must have been an hotel sheltering us for july and august and the form of which to childish retrospect unprejudiced by later experience was that of a great greek temple shining over blue waters in the splendour of a white colonnade and a great yellow pediment the elegant image remained though imprinted in a child so small as to be easily portable by a stout nurse i remember and not less easily duckable i gasp again and was long to gasp with the sense of salt immersion received at her strong hands wonderful altogether in fact i find as i write the quantity the intensity of picture recoverable from even the blankest and tenderest state of the little canvas  i connect somehow with the pavilion period a visit paid with my fatherwho decidedly must have liked to take me about i feel so rich in that general reminiscenceto a family whom we reached in what struck me as a quite lovely embowered place on a very hot day and among whom luxuries and eccentricities flourished together they were numerous the members of this family they were beautiful they partook of their meals or were at the moment partaking of one out of doors and the then preeminent figure in the group was a very big newfoundland dog on whose back i was put to ride that must have been my first vision of the liberal lifethough i further ask myself what my age could possibly have been when my weight was so fantastically far from hinting at later developments but the romance of the hour was particularly in what i have called the eccentric note the fact that the children my entertainers riveted my gaze to stockingless and shoeless legs and feet conveying somehow at the same time that they were not poor and destitute but rich and providedjust as i took their gardenfeast for a sign of overflowing foodand that their state as of children of nature was a refinement of freedom and grace they were to become great and beautiful the household of that glimmering vision they were to figure historically heroically and serve great public ends but always to my remembering eyes and fond fancy they were to move through life as with the bare white feet of that original preferred fairness and wildness this is rank embroidery but the old surface itself insists on spreadingit waits at least with an air of its own the rest is silence i canextraordinary encumbrance even for the most doating of parents on a morning callbut have returned with my father to our hotel since i feel that i must not only to this but to a still further extent face the historic truth that we were for considerable periods during our earliest time nothing less than hotel children between the faroff and the later phases at new brighton stretched a series of summers that had seen us all regularly installed for a couple of months at an establishment passing in the view of that simpler age for a vast caravanserythe hamilton house on the south long island shore so called from its nearness to the fort of that name which had fort lafayette the bastille of the civil war out in the channel before it and which probably cast a stronger spell upon the spirit of our childhood williams and mine at least than any scene presented to us up to our reaching our teens  i find that i draw from the singularly unobliterated memory of the particulars of all that experience the power quite to glory in our shame of so entrancing an interest did i feel it at the time to be an hotel child and so little would i have exchanged my lot with that of any small person more privately bred we were private enough in all conscience i think i must have felt the rest of the year and at what age mustnt i quite have succumbed to the charm of the world seen in a larger way for there incomparably was the chance to dawdle and gape there were human appearances in endless variety and on the exhibitionstage of a piazza that my gape measured almost as by miles it was even as if i had become positively conscious that the social scene so peopled would pretty well always say more to me than anything else what it did say i of course but scantly understood but i none the less knew it spoke and i listened to its voice i seem to recall very much as young edwin in dr beatties poem listened to the roar of tempests and torrents from the nobler eminence of beetling crags and in exposure to still deeper abysses i cling for the moment however to the small story of our vredenburg summer as we were for long afterwards invidiously to brand it the more that it so plays its part in illustration under the light of a later and happier age of the growth when not rather of the arrest of manners and customs roundabout our birthplace i think we had never been so much as during these particular months disinherited of the general and public amenities that reinforce for the young private precept and exampledisinherited in favour of dust and glare and mosquitoes and pigs and shanties and rumshops of no walks and scarce more drives of a repeated no less than of a strong emphasis on the more sordid sides of the irish aspect in things there was a castellated residence on the hill above usvery high i remember supposing the hill and very stately the structure it had towers and views and pretensions and belonged to a colonel whom we thought very handsome and very costumed as if befrogged and highbooted which he couldnt have been at all only ought to have been would even certainly have been at a higher pitch of social effect and whose son and heir also very handsome and known familiarly and endearingly as chick had a velvet coat and a pony and i think spurs all luxuries we were without and was cousin to boys the de coppets whom we had come to know at our school of the previous winter and who somehowdoubtless partly as guests of the opulent chickhovered again about the field of idleness  the de coppets particularly in the person of the firstborn louis had been a value to us or at any rate to mefor though i was in common with my elders then unacquainted with the application of that word as i use it here what was my incipient sense of persons and things what were my first stirred observant and imaginative reactions discriminations and categories but a vague groping for it the de coppets again as more especially and most impressively interpreted by the subtle louis enjoyed the preeminence of being european they had dropped during the scholastic term of 18534 straight from the lake of geneva into the very bosom of mr richard pulling jenkss select resort for young gentlemen then situated in broadway below fourth street and had lately been present at an historic pageantwhether or no celebrating the annals of the town of coppet i know notin which representatives of their family had figured in armour and on horseback as the barons to our comprehension de coup or cou their father was thus of the canton de vaudonly their mother had been native among ourselves and sister to the colonel of the castellations but what was the most vivid mark of the brothers and vividest on the part of the supersubtle louis was his french treatment of certain of our native local names ohio and iowa for instance which he rendered as to their separate vowels with a daintiness and a delicacy invidious and imperturbable so that he might have been chateaubriand declaiming les natchez at madame récamiersoeeoh and eeowah a proceeding in him a violence offered to his serried circle of little staring and glaring new yorkers supplied with the usual allowance of fists and boottoes which as it was clearly conscious i recollect thinking unsurpassed for cool calm courage those were the right nameswhich we owed wholly to the french explorers and jesuit fathers so much the worse for us if we vulgarly didnt know it i lose myself in admiration of the consistency the superiority the sublimity of the not at all gameplaying yet in his own way so singularly sporting louis he was naturally and incorruptibly frenchas so oddly i have known other persons of both sexes to be whose english was naturally and incorruptibly american the appearance being thus that the possession of indigenous english alone forms the adequate barrier and the assured racial ground oh the queer reversions observed on the part of latinized compatriots in the course of a long lifethe remarkable drops from the quite current french or italian to the comparatively improvised native idiom with the resulting effect of the foreign tongue used as a domestic and the domestic that is the original american used as a foreign tongue or without inherited confidence  louis de coppet though theoretically american and domiciled was naturally french and so pressed further home to me that sense of europe to which i feel that my very earliest consciousness wakeda perversity that will doubtless appear to ask for all the justification i can supply and some of which i shall presently attempt to give he opened vistas and i count ever as precious anyone everyone who betimes does that for the small straining vision performing this office never so much doubtless as when during that summer he invited me to collaborate with him in the production of a romance which il se fit fort to get printed to get published when success or in other words completion should crown our effort our effort alas failed of the crown in spite of sundry solemn and mysterious meetingsso much devoted i seem to remember to the publishing question that others more fundamental dreadfully languished leaving me convinced however that my friend would have got our fiction published if he could only have got it written i think of my participation in this vain dream as of the very first gage of visiting approval offered to the exercise of a giftthough quite unable to conceive my companions ground for suspecting a gift of which i must at that time quite have failed to exhibit a single in the least phenomenal symptom it had none the less by his overtures been handsomely imputed to me that was in a manner a beginninga small start yet not wholly unattended with bravery louis de coppet i must add brought to light later on so far as i know no compositions of his own we met him long after in switzerland and eventually heard of his having married a young russian lady and settled at nice if i drop on his memory this apology for a bayleaf it is from the fact of his having given the earliest or at least the most personal tap to that pointed prefigurement of the manners of europe which inserted wedgelike if not to say peglike into my young allegiance was to split the tender organ into such unequal halves his the toy hammer that drove in the very point of the golden nail  it was as if there had been a mild magic in that breath however scant of another world but when i ask myself what element of the pleasing or the agreeable may have glimmered through the then general the outer and enveloping conditions i recover many more of the connections in which forms and civilities lapsed beyond repair than of those in which they struggled at all successfully it is for some record of the question of taste of the consciousness of an æsthetic appeal as reflected in forms and aspects that i shall like best to testify as the promise and the development of these things on our earlier american scene are the more interesting to trace for their doubtless demanding a degree of the finer attention the plain and happy profusions and advances and successes as one looks back reflect themselves at every turn the quick beats of material increase and multiplication with plenty of people to tell of them and throw up their caps for them but the edifying matters to recapture would be the adventures of the higher criticism so far as there was anyand so far too as it might bear on the real quality and virtue of things the state of manners the terms of intercourse the care for excellence the sense of appearances the intellectual reaction generally however any breasting of those deep waters must be but in the form for me of an occasional dip it meanwhile fairly overtakes and arrests me here as a contributive truth that our general medium of life in the situation i speak of was such as to make a large defensive verandah which seems to have very stoutly and completely surrounded us play more or less the part of a raft of rescue in too high a tidetoo high a tide there beneath us as i recover it of the ugly and the graceless my particular perspective may magnify a little wildlywhen it doesnt even more weirdly diminish but i read into the great hooded and guarded resource in question an evidential force as if it must really have played for us so far as its narrowness and its exposure permitted the part of a bufferstate against the wilderness immediately near that of the empty the unlovely and the mean interposing a little ease didnt it interpose almost all the ease we knewso that when amiable friends arriving from new york by the boat came to see us there was no rural view for them but that of our great shame a view of the pigs and the shanties and the loose planks and scattered refuse and rude public ways never even a fieldpath for a gentle walk or a garden nook in afternoon shade i recall my prompt distaste a strange precocity of criticism for so much ariditysince of what lost arcadia at that age had i really had the least glimpse  our scant margin must have affected me more nobly i should in justice add when old mrs l passed or hovered for she sometimes caustically joined the circle and sometimes during the highest temperatures which were very high that summer but flitted across it in a single flowing garment as we amazedly conceived one of the signs of that grand impertinence i supposed which belonged to dowagersdowagers who were recognised characters and free speakers doing and saying what they liked this ancient lady was lodged in some outlying tract of the manyroomed house which in more than one quarter stretched away into mystery but the piazza to which she had access was unbroken and whenever she strayed from her own territory she swam afresh into ours i definitely remember that having heard and perhaps read of dowagers who as i was aware had scarce been provided for in our social scheme i said to myself at first sight of our emphatic neighbour a person clearly used to exceptional deference this must be a perfect specimen which was somehow very wonderful the absolute first sight however had preceded the new brighton summer and it makes me lose myself in a queer dim vision all the obscurities attendant on my having been present as a very small boy indeed at an evening entertainment where mrs l figured in an attire that is still vivid to me a blue satin gown a long black lace shawl and a headdress consisting in equally striking parts of a brown wig a plume of some sort waving over it and a band or fillet whether of some precious metal or not i forget keeping it in place by the aid of a precious stone which adorned the centre of her brow such was my first view of the féronnière of our grandmothers when not of our greatgrandmothers i see its wearer at this day bend that burdened brow upon me in a manner sufficiently awful while her knuckly white gloves toyed with a large fan and a vinaigrette attached to her thumb by a chain and as she was known to us afterwards for a friend of my albany grandmothers it may have been as a tribute to this tie that she allowed me momentarily to engage her attention then it predominantly must have been that i knew her for a dowagerthough this was a light in which i had never considered my grandmother herself but what i have quite lost the clue to is the question of my extraordinary footing in such an assembly the occasion of a dance of my elders youthful elders but young married people into which really my mother as a participant must have introduced me     iv   it took place in the house of our cousins robert and kitty emmet the elderfor we were to have two cousin kittys of that ilk and yet another consanguineous robert at least the latter name being naturally among them all of a pious indeed of a glorious tradition and three of my fathers nieces marrying three emmet brothers the first of these the robert aforesaid catherine james daughter of my uncle augustus his then quite recent and as i remember her animated and attractive bride whose fair hair framed her pointed smile in full and fardrooping front curls i easily evoke as my first apprehended image of the free and happy young woman of fashion a sign of the wondrous fact that ladies might live for pleasure pleasure always pleasure alone she was distinguished for nothing whatever so much as for an insatiable love of the dance that passion in which i think of the good the best new york society of the time as having capered and champagned itself away her younger sister gertrude afterwards married to jamesor more inveterately jimpendleton of virginia followed close upon her heels literally speaking and though emulating her in other respects too was to last through many troubles much longer looking extraordinarily the while like the younger portraits of queen victoria and to have much hospitality showing it and showing everything in a singularly natural way for a considerable collection of young hobbledehoy kinsmen but i am solicited a moment longer by the queer little issues involvedas if a social light would somehow stream from themin my having been taken a mere mite of observation to kitty emmets grownup assembly was it that my mother really felt that to the scrap that i was other scraps would perhaps strangely adhere to the extent thus of something to distinguish me by nothing else probably having as yet declared itselfsuch a scrap for instance as the fine germ of this actual ferment of memory and play of fancy a retroactive vision almost intense of the faded hour and a fond surrender to the questions with which it bristles all the female relatives on my fathers side who reappear to me in these evocations strike me as having been intensely and admirably but at the same time almost indescribably natural which fact connects itself for the brooding painter and fond analyst with fifty other matters and impressions his vision of a whole social orderif the american scene might indeed have been said at that time to be positively ordered wasnt the fact that the dancing passion was so out of proportion to any social resource just one of the signs of the naturaland for that matter in both sexes alike of the artless kindred it was shining to us that jim pendleton had a yachtthough i was not smuggled aboard it there the line was drawnbut the deck must have been more used for the german than for other manoeuvres often doubtless under the lead of our cousin robert the eldest of the many light irresponsibles to whom my father was uncle distinct to me still being the image of that phenomenally lean and nimble choreographic hero bob james to us always who almost ghostfashion led the cotillion on from generation to generation his skulllike smile with its accent from the stiff points of his long moustache and the brightly hollow orbits of his eyes helping to make of him an immemorial elegant skeleton  it is at all events to the sound of fiddles and the popping of corks that i see even young brides as well as young grooms originally so formed to please and to prosper as our hosts of the restless little occasion i have glanced at vanish untimely become mysterious and legendary with such unfathomed silences and significant headshakes replacing the earlier concert so that i feel how ones impression of so much foredoomed youthful levity received constant and quite thrilling increase it was of course an impression then obscurely gathered but into which one was later on to read strange pagesto some of which i may find myself moved to revert mere mite of observation though i have dubbed myself i wont pretend to have deciphered any of them amid the bacchanal sounds that on the evening so suggestively spent floated out into the region of washington place it is round that general centre that my richest memories of the gay little life in general clusteras if it had been for the circle in which i seem justified in pretending to have moved of the finer essence of town covering as it did the stretch of broadway down to canal street with closer at hand the new york hotel which figured somehow inordinately in our family annals the two newer ones the glory of their brief and discredited their flouted and demolished age the brown metropolitan and the white st nicholas were much further down and rising northward to the ultima thule of twentythird street only second then in the supposedly ample scheme of the regular ninth wide street i cant indeed have moved much on that night of revelations and yet of enigmas over which i still hang fascinated i must have kept intensely still in my corner all wondering and all fearingfearing notice most and in a definite way i but remember the formidable interest of my so convincing dowager to hark back for a second to her and the fact that a great smooth white cloth was spread across the denuded room converted thus into a field of frolic the prospect of which much excited my curiosity i but recover the preparations however without recovering the performance mrs l and i must have been the only persons not shaking a foot and premature unconsciousness clearly in my case supervened out of it peeps again the riddle the so quaint trait de moeurs of my infant participation but i set that down as representative and interesting and have done with it  the manners of the time had obviously a bonhomie of their owncertainly so on our particularly indulgent and humane little field as to which general proposition the later applications and transformations of the bonhomie would be interesting to trace it has lingered and fermented and earned other names but i seem on the track of its prime evidence with that note of the sovereign ease of all the young persons with whom we grew up in the aftertime as our view took in with new climes and new scenes other examples of the class these were always to affect us as more formed and finished more tutored and governessed warned and armed at more points for and doubtless often against the social relation so that this prepared state on their part and which at first appeared but a preparation for shyness or silence or whatever other ideal of the unconversable came to be for us the normal since it was the relative and not the positive still less the superlative state no charming creatures of the growing girl sort were ever to be natural in the degree of these nearer and remoter ornaments of our family circle in youth when after intervals and absences the impression was renewed we saw how right we had been about it and i feel as if we had watched it for years under the apprehension and the vision of some inevitable change wondering with an affectionate interest what effect the general improvement in manners might perhaps all unfortunately have upon it i make out as i look back that it was really to succumb at no point to this complication that it was to keep its really quite inimitable freshness to the end or in other words when it had been the first free growth of the old conditions was to pass away but with the passing of those themselves for whom it had been the sole possible expression for it was as of an altogether special shade and sort that the new york young naturalness of our prime was touchingly to linger with usso that to myself at present with only the gentle ghosts of the so numerous exemplars of it before me it becomes the very stuff of the soft cerements in which their general mild mortality is laid away we used to have in the aftertime amid fresh recognitions and reminders the kindest old new york identifications for it the special shade of its identity was thus that it was not consciousreally not conscious of anything in the world or was conscious of so few possibilities at least and these so immediate and so a matter of course that it came almost to the same thing that was the testimony that the slight subjects in question strike me as having borne to their surrounding mediumthe fact that their unconsciousness could be so preserved they played about in it so happily and serenely and sociably as unembarrassed and loquacious as they were unadmonished and uninformedonly aware at the most that a good many people within their horizon were dissipated as in point of fact alas a good many were what it was to be dissipatedthat however was but in the most limited degree a feature of their vision they would have held under pressure that it consisted more than anything else in getting tipsy  infinitely queer and quaint almost incongruously droll the sense somehow begotten in ourselves as very young persons of our being surrounded by a slightly remote yet dimly rich outer and quite kindred circle of the tipsy i remember how once as a very small boy after meeting in the hall a most amiable and irreproachable gentleman all but closely consanguineous who had come to call on my mother i anticipated his further entrance by slipping in to report to that parent that i thought he must be tipsy and i was to recall perfectly afterwards the impression i so made on herin which the general proposition that the gentlemen of a certain group or connection might on occasion be best described by the term i had used sought to destroy the particular presumption that our visitor wouldnt by his ordinary measure show himself for one of those he didnt to all appearance for i was afterwards disappointed at the lapse of lurid evidence that memory remained with me as well as a considerable subsequent wonder at my having leaped to so baseless a view the truth was indeed that we had too in the most innocent way in the world our sense of dissipation as an abounding element in family histories a sense fed quite directly by our fondness for making our fatheri can at any rate testify for the urgency of my own appeal to himtell us stories of the world of his youth he regaled us with no scandals yet it somehow rarely failed to come out that each contemporary on his younger scene each hero of each thrilling adventure had in spite of brilliant promise and romantic charm ended badly as badly as possible this became our gaping generalisationit gaped even under the moral that the anecdote was always and so familiarly humanly and vividly designed to convey everyone in the little old albany of the dutch houses and the steep streets and the recurrent family namestownsends clintons van rensselaers pruyns i pick them up again at hazard and all uninvidiously out of reverberations long since stilleveryone without exception had at last taken a turn as far as possible from edifying and what they had most in common the hovering presences the fitful apparitions that speaking for myself so engaged my imagination was just the fine old albany dramain the light of which a ring of mystery as to their lives mainly carried on at the new york hotel aforesaid surrounded them and their charm inveterate as i believed shone out as through vaguelyapprehended stormclouds their charm was in various marks of which i shall have more to sayfor as i breathe all this hushed air again even the more broken things give out touching human values and faint sweet scents of character flushes of old beauty and goodwill  the grim little generalisation remained none the less and i may speak of itsince i speak of everythingas still standing the striking evidence that scarce aught but disaster could in that so unformed and unseasoned society overtake young men who were in the least exposed not to have been immediately launched in business of a rigorous sort was to be exposedin the absence i mean of some fairly abnormal predisposition to virtue since it was a world so simply constituted that whatever wasnt business or exactly an office or a store places in which people sat close and made money was just simply pleasure sought and sought only in places in which people got tipsy there was clearly no mean least of all the golden one for it was just the ready even when the moderate possession of gold that determined that hurried on disaster there were whole sets and groups there were sympathetic though too susceptible races that seemed scarce to recognise or to find possible any practical application of moneyed that is of transmitted ease however limited but to go more or less rapidly to the bad with itwhich meant even then going as often as possible to paris the bright and empty air was as void of careers for a choice as of cathedral towers for a sketcher and i passed my younger time till within a year or two of the civil war with an absolute vagueness of impression as to how the political life of the country was carried on the field was strictly covered to my young eyes i make out by three classes the busy the tipsy and daniel webster this last great man must have represented for us a class in himself as if to be political was just to be daniel webster in his proper person and with room left over for nobody else that he should have filled the sky of public life from pole to pole even to a childish consciousness not formed in new england and for which that strenuous section was but a name in the geographybook is probably indeed a sign of how large in the general air he comparatively loomed the public scene was otherwise a blank to our young vision i discern till later on in paris i sawfor at that unimproved period we of the unfledged didnt suppose ourselves to meetcharles sumner with whose name indeed there further connects itself the image of a thrilled hour in the same city some months before the gathering of a group of indignant persons on the terrace of a small oldworld hôtel or pavilion looking out on the avenue des champs elysées slightly above the rondpoint and just opposite the antediluvian jardin dhiver who remembers the jardin dhiver who remembers the ancient lodges of the octroi the pair of them facing each other at the barrière de lÉtoile and among them a passionate lady in tears over the news fresh that morning of the assault on sumner by the south carolina ruffian of the house the wounded senator injured in health had come to europe later on to recuperate and he offered me my first view to the best of my belief not only of a statesman but of any person whomsoever concerned in political life i distinguish in the earlier twilight of fourteenth street my fathers return to us one november daywe knew he had been out to votewith the news that general winfield scott his and the then whig candidate had been defeated for the presidency just as i rescue from the same limbo my afterwards proud little impression of having met that highpiled hero of the mexican war whom the civil war was so soon and with so little ceremony to extinguish literally met him at my fathers side in fifth avenue where he had just emerged from a crossstreet i remain vague as to what had then happened and scarce suppose i was at the age probably of eight or nine presented but we must have been for some moments face to face while from under the vast amplitude of a dark blue military cloak with a big velvet collar and loosened silver clasp which spread about him like a symbol of the tented field he greeted my parentso clear is my sense of the time it took me to gape all the way up to where he towered aloft     v   the not very glorious smoke of the mexican war i note for another touch had been in the air when i was a still smaller boy and i have an association with it that hovers between the definite and the dim a vision of our uncle captain as he then was robert temple usa in regimentals either on his way to the scene of action or on the return from it i see him as a person half asleep sees some large object across the room and against the windowlighteven if to the effect of my now asking myself why so far from the scene of action he was in panoply of war i seem to see him cockhatted and feathered tooan odd vision of dancing superior plumes which doesnt fit if he was only a captain however i cultivate the wavering shade merely for its value as my earliest glimpse of any circumstance of the public orderunless indeed another the reminiscence to which i owe today my sharpest sense of personal antiquity had already given me the historic thrill the scene of this latter stir of consciousness is for memory an apartment in one of the three fifth avenue houses that were not long afterward swallowed up in the present brevoort hotel and consists of the admired appearance of my uncles gus and john james to announce to my father that the revolution had triumphed in paris and louis philippe had fled to england these last words the flight of the king linger on my ear at this hour even as they fell there we had somehow waked early to a perception of paris and a vibration of my very most infantine sensibility under its sky had by the same stroke got itself preserved for subsequent wondering reference i had been there for a short time in the second year of my life and i was to communicate to my parents later on that as a baby in long clothes seated opposite to them in a carriage and on the lap of another person i had been impressed with the view framed by the clear window of the vehicle as we passed of a great stately square surrounded with highroofed houses and having in its centre a tall and glorious column i had naturally caused them to marvel but i had also under crossquestioning forced them to compare notes as it were and reconstitute the miracle they knew what my observation of monumental squares had beenand alas hadnt neither new york nor albany could have offered me the splendid perspective and for that matter neither could london which moreover i had known at a younger age still conveyed along the rue sthonoré while i waggled my small feet as i definitely remember doing under my flowing robe i had crossed the rue de castiglione and taken in for all my time the admirable aspect of the place and the colonne vendôme i dont now pretend to measure the extent to which my interest in the events of 1848i was five years oldwas quickened by that souvenir a tradition further reinforced i should add by the fact that some relative or other some member of our circle was always either there there being of course generally europe but particularly and pointedly paris or going there or coming back from there i at any rate revert to the sound of the rich words on my uncles lips as to my positive initiation into history it was as if i had been ready for them and could catch on i had heard of kings presumably and also of fleeing but that kings had sometimes to flee was a new and striking image to which the apparent consternation of my elders added dramatic force so much in any case for what i may claimperhaps too idlyon behalf of my backward reach  it has carried me far from my rather evident proposition that if we saw the natural so happily embodied about usand in female maturity or comparative maturity scarce less than in female adolescencethis was because the artificial or in other words the complicated was so little there to threaten it the complicated as we were later on to define it was but another name for those more massed and violent assaults upon the social sense that we were to recognise subsequently by their effectsobserving thus that a sense more subtly social had so been created and that it quite differed from that often almost complete inward blankness in respect to any circumjacent any constituted order to the exhibition of which our earlier air and our family scene had inimitably treated us we came more or less to see that our young contemporaries of another world the trained and admonished the disciplined and governessed or in a word the formed relatively speaking had been made aware of many things of which those at home hadnt been yet we were also to noteso far as we may be conceived as so precociously noting though we were certainly incorrigible observersthat the awareness in question remaining at the best imperfect our little friends as distinguished from our companions of the cousinship greater and less advanced and presumed but to flounder and recede elated at once and abashed and on the whole but feebly sophisticated the cousinship on the other hand all unalarmed and unsuspecting and unembarrassed lived by pure serenity sociability and loquacity the oddest fact about its members being withal that it didnt make them bores i seem to feel as i look back or at least not worse bores than sundry specimens of the other growth there can surely never have been anything like their good faith and generally speaking their amiability i should have but to let myself go a little to wish to cite examplessave that in doing so i should lose sight of my point which is to recall again that whether we were all amiable or not and frankly i claim it in a high degree for most of us the scene on which we so freely bloomed does strike me when i reckon up as extraordinarily unfurnished how came it then that for the most part so simple we yet werent more inane this was doubtless by reason of the quantity of our inward lifeours of our fathers house in especial i meanwhich made an excellent in some cases almost an incomparable fond for a thicker civility to mix with when growing experience should begin to take that in it was also quaint among us i may be reminded to have begun with the inward life but we began after the manner of all men as we could and i hold that if it comes to that we might have begun much worse  i was in my seventeenth year when the raid and the capture of john brown of harpers ferry fame enjoyed its sharp reverberation among us though we were then on the other side of the world and i count this as the very first reminder that reached me of our living on our side in a political order i had perfectly taken in from the pages of punch which contributed in the highest degree to our education that the peoples on the other side so lived as there was no american punch and to this time has been none to give small boys the sense and the imagination of living with their public administrators daniel webster and charles sumner had never become for my fancy members of a class a class which numbered in england by john leechs showing so many other members still than lords brougham palmerston and john russell the war of secession soon arriving was to cause the field to bristle with features and the sense of the state in our generation infinitely to quicken but that alarm came upon the country like a thief at night and we might all have been living in a land in which there seemed at least nothing save a comparatively small amount of quite private property to steal even private property in other than the most modest amounts scarce figured for our particular selves which doubtless came partly from the fact that amid all the albany issue there was ease with the habit of ease thanks to our grandfathers fine old abilityhe had decently provided for so large a generation but our consciousness was positively disfurnished as that of young americans went of the actualities of business in a world of business as to that we all formed together quite a monstrous exception business in a world of business was the thing we most agreed differ as we might on minor issues in knowing nothing about we touched it and it touched us neither directly nor otherwise and i think our fond detachment not to say our helpless ignorance and on occasion since i can speak for one fine instance our settled density of understanding made us an unexampled and probably for the ironic smart gods of the american heaven a lamentable case of course even the office and the store leave much of the provision for an approximately complete scheme of manners to be accounted for still there must have been vast numbers of people about us for whom under the usages the assault on the imagination from without was much stronger and the fillingin of the general picture much richer it was exactly by the lack of that fillingin that wewe more especially who lived at near view of my fathers admirable examplehad been thrown so upon the inward life no one could ever have taken to it even in the face of discouragement more kindly and naturally than he but the situation had at least that charm that in default of so many kinds of the outward people had their choice of as many kinds of the inward as they would and might practise those kinds with whatever consistency intensity and brilliancy of our fathers perfect gift for practising his kind i shall have more to say but i meanwhile glance yet again at those felicities of destitution which kept us collectively so genially interested in almost nothing but each other and which come over me now as one of the famous blessings in disguise  there were artists in the prospectdidnt mr tom hicks and mr paul duggan and mr c p cranch and mr felix darley this last worthy of a wider reputation capable perhaps even of a finer development than he attained more or less haunt our friendly fireside and give us also the sense of others landscapist cropseys and coles and kensetts and bustproducing iveses and powerses and moziers hovering in an outer circle there were authors not less some of them vague and female and in this case as a rule glossily ringletted and monumentally breastpinned but mostly frequent and familiar after the manner of george curtis and parke godwin and george ripley and charles dana and n p willis and for brighter lights or those that in our then comparative obscurity almost deceived the morn mr bryant washington irving and e a poethe lastnamed of whom i cite not so much because he was personally present the extremity of personal absence had just overtaken him as by reason of that predominant lustre in him which our small opening minds themselves already recognised and which makes me wonder today at the legend of the native neglect of him was he not even at that time on all lips had not my brother promptly master of the subject beckoned on my lagging mind with a recital of the goldbug and the pit and the pendulumboth of which however i was soon enough to read for myself adding to them the murders in the rue morgue were we not also forever mounting on little platforms at our infant schools to speak the raven and lenore and the verses in which we phrased the heroine as annabelleefalling thus into the trap the poet had so recklessly laid for us as he had laid one for our interminable droning not less in the other pieces i have named so far from misprizing our illstarred magician we acclaimed him surely at every turn he lay upon our tables and resounded in our mouths while we communed to satiety even for boyish appetites over the thrill of his choicest pages dont i just recognise the ghost of a dim memory of a childrens christmas party at the house of fourteenth street neighboursthey come back to me as the beans who and what and whence and whither the kindly beanswhere i admired over the chimney piece the fulllength portrait of a lady seated on the ground in a turkish dress with hair flowing loose from a cap which was not as the caps of ladies known to me and i think with a tambourine who was somehow identified to my enquiring mind as the wife of the painter of the piece mr osgood and the so ministering friend of the unhappy mr poe there she throned in honour like queen constance on the huge firm earthall for that and her tambourine and surely we could none of us have done more for the connection  washington irving i met with infant promptitude very much as i had met general scott only this time it was on a steamboat that i apprehended the great man my father under whose everpatient protection i then wasduring the summer afternoons sail from new york to fort hamiltonhaving named him to me for this long preservation before they greeted and talked and having a fact of still more moment to mention with the greatest concern afterwards mr irving had given him the news of the shipwreck of margaret fuller in those very waters fire island at least was but just without our big bay during the great august storm that had within the day or two passed over us the unfortunate lady was essentially of the boston connection but she must have been and probably through emerson a friend of my parentsmustnt she have held conversations in the finest exotic bostonese in new york emerson himself lecturing there to admirationsince the more i squeeze the sponge of memory the more its stored secretions flow to remind me here again that being with those elders late one evening at an exhibition of pictures possibly that of the national academy then confined to scant quarters i was shown a small fulllength portrait of miss fuller seated as now appears to me and wrapped in a long white shawl the failure of which to do justice to its original my companions denounced with some emphasis was this work from the hand of mr tom hicks aforesaid or was that artist concerned only with the lifesized the enormous as i took it to be the fulllength the violently protruded accessories in which come back to me with my infant sense of the wonder and the beauty of them as expressed above all in the image of a very long and lovely lady the new bride of the artist standing at a window before a row of plants or bulbs in tall coloured glasses the light of the window playing over the figure and the treatment of its glass and of the flowerpots and the other furniture passed by my impression for the sign of the master hand and was it all brave and charming or was it only very hard and stiff quite ugly and helpless i put these questions as to a vanished world and by way of pressing back into it only the more clingingly and tenderlywholly regardless in other words of whether the answers to them at all matter they matter doubtless but for fond evocation and if one tries to evoke one must neglect none of the arts one must do it with all the forms why i should so like to do it is another matterand what outside interest i may suppose myself to create perhaps still another i fatuously proceed at any rate i make so far as i can the small warm dusky homogeneous new york world of the midcentury close about us     vi   i see a small and compact and ingenuous society screened in somehow conveniently from north and west but open wide to the east and comparatively to the south and though perpetually moving up broadway none the less constantly and delightfully walking down it broadway was the feature and the artery the joy and the adventure of ones childhood and it stretched and prodigiously from union square to barnums great american museum by the city hallor only went further on the saturday mornings absurdly and deplorably frequent alas when we were swept off by a loving aunt our mothers only sister then much domesticated with us and to whom the ruthless care had assigned itself from the first to wall street and the torture chamber of dr parkhurst our tremendously respectable dentist who was so old and so empurpled and so polite in his stock and dresscoat and dark and glossy wig that he had been our mothers and our aunts haunting fear in their youth as well since in their quiet warren street not far off they were dreadful to think comparatively under his thumb he extremely resembles to my minds eye certain figures in phizs illustrations to dickens and it was clear to us through our long ordeal that our elders must by some mistaken law of compensation some refinement of the vindictive be making us pay for what they in like helplessness had suffered from him as if we had done them any harm our analysis was muddled yet in a manner relieving and for us too there were compensations which we grudged indeed to allow but which i could easily even if shyly have named one of these was godeys ladys book a sallow pile of which it shows to me for sallow in the warmer and less stony light of the wall street of those days and through the smell of ancient anodynes lay on joey bagstocks table for our beguilement while we waited i was to encounter in phizs dombey and son that design for our tormentors type there is no doubt whatever that i succumbed to the spell of godey who unlike the present essences was an anodyne before the fact as well as after since i remember poring in his pages over tales of fashionable life in philadelphia while awaiting my turn in the chair not less than doing so when my turn was over and to the music of my brothers groans this must have been at the hours when we were left discreetly to our own fortitude through our aunts availing herself of the relative proximity to go and shop at stewarts and then come back for us the ladies great shop vast marmorean plateglassy and notoriously fatal to the female nerve we ourselves had wearily trailed through it hanging on the skirts very literally of indecision which bravely waylaid custom on the broadway corner of chambers street wasnt part of the charm of lifesince i assume that there was such a charmin its being then i allude to life itself so much more downtowny on the supposition at least that our young gravitation in that sense for most of the larger joys consorted with something of the general habit the joy that had to be fished out like truth from the very bottom of the well was attendance at trinity church still in that age supereminent pointedly absolute the finest feature of the southward scene to the privilege of which the elder albany cousins were apt to be treated when they came on to stay with us an indulgence making their enjoyment of our city as downtowny as possible too for i seem otherwise to see them but as returning with the familiar stewart headache from the prolonged strain of selection  the great reward dispensed to us for our sessions in the house of painas to which it became our subsequent theory that we had been regularly dragged there on alternate saturdayswas our being carried on the return to the house of delight or to one of them for there were specifically two where we partook of icecream deemed sovereign for sore mouths deemed sovereign in fact all through our infancy for everything two great establishments for the service of it graced the prospect one thompsons and the other taylors the former i perfectly recall grave and immemorial the latter upstart but dazzling and having together the effect that whichever we went to we wondered if we hadnt better have gone to the otherwith that capacity of childhood for making the most of its adventures after a fashion that may look so like making the least it is in our fathers company indeed that as i press the responsive spring i see the bedizened saucers heaped up for our fond consumption they bore the taylortitle painted in blue and gilded with the christian name as parentally pointed out to us perverted to jhon for john whereas the thompsonname scorned such vulgar and above all such misspelt appeals whence i infer that still other occasions for that experience waited on usas almost any would serve and a paternal presence so associated with them was not in the least conceivable in the wall street repaire that presence is in fact not associated for me to any effect of distinctness with the least of our suffered shocks or penaltiesthough partly doubtless because our acquaintance with such was of the most limited a conclusion i form even while judging it to have been on the whole sufficient for our virtue this sounds perhaps as if we had borne ourselves as prodigies or prigswhich was as far as possible from being the case we were bred in horror of conscious propriety of what my father was fond of calling flagrant morality what i myself at any rate read back into our rare educational ease for the memory of some sides of which i was ever to be thankful is besides the general humanisation of our apprehended world and our social tone the unmistakeable appearance that my father was again and again accompanied in public by his small second son so many young impressions come back to me as gathered at his side and in his personal haunts not that he mustnt have offered his firstborn at least equal opportunities but i make out that he seldom led us forth such as we were together and my brother must have had in his turn many a mild adventure of which the secreti like to put it soperished with him he was to remember as i perceived later on many things that i didnt impressions i sometimes wished as with a retracing jealousy or at least envy that i might also have fallen direct heir to but he professed amazement and even occasionally impatience at my reach of reminiscenceliking as he did to brush away old moral scraps in favour of new rather than to hoard and so complacently exhibit them if in my way i collected the new as well i yet cherished the old the ragbag of memory hung on its nail in my closet though i learnt with time to control the habit of bringing it forth and i say that with a due sense of my doubtless now appearing to empty it into these pages  i keep picking out at hazard those passages of our earliest age that help to reconstruct for me even by tiny touches the experience of our parents any shade of which seems somehow to signify i cherish to the extent of here reproducing an old daguerreotype all the circumstances of the taking of which i intensely recallthough as i was lately turned twelve when i figured for it the feat of memory is perhaps not remarkable it documents for me in so welcome and so definite a manner my fathers cultivation of my company it documents at the same time the absurdest little legend of my small boyhoodthe romantic tradition of the value of being taken up from wherever we were staying to the queer empty dusty smelly new york of midsummer i apply that last term because we always arrived by boat and i have still in my nostril the sense of the abords of the hot town the rank and rubbishy waterside quarters where big loose cobbles for the least of all the base items lay wrenched from their sockets of pungent black mud and where the dependent streets managed by a law of their own to be all corners and the corners to be all groceries groceries indeed largely of the green order so far as greenness could persist in the torrid air and that bristled in glorious defiance of traffic with the overflow of their wares and implements carts and barrows and boxes and baskets sprawling or stacked familiarly elbowed in its course the bumping hack the comprehensive carriage of other days the only vehicle of hire then known to us while the situation was accepted by the loose citizen in the garb of a freeman save for the brass star on his breastand the new york garb of the period was as i remember it an immense attestation of liberty why the throb of romance should have beat time for me to such visions i can scarce explain or can explain only by the fact that the squalor was a squalor wonderfully mixed and seasoned and that i should wrong the whole impression if i didnt figure it first and foremost as that of some vast succulent cornucopia what did the stacked boxes and baskets of our youth represent but the boundless fruitage of that more bucolic age of the american world and what was after all of so strong an assault as the rankness of such a harvest where is that fruitage now where in particular are the peaches dantan where the mounds of isabella grapes and seckel pears in the sticky sweetness of which our childhood seems to have been steeped it was surely save perhaps for oranges a more informally and familiarly fruiteating time and bushels of peaches in particular peaches big and peaches small peaches white and peaches yellow played a part in life from which they have somehow been deposed every garden almost every bush and the very boys pockets grew them they were cut up and eaten with cream at every meal domestically brandied they figured the rest of the year scarce less freelyif they were rather a party dish it was because they made the party whenever they appeared and when icecream was added or they were added to it they formed the highest revel we knew above all the public heaps of them the highpiled receptacles at every turn touched the street as with a sort of southern plenty the note of the rejected and scattered fragments the memory of the slippery skins and rinds and kernels with which the old dislocated flags were bestrown is itself endeared to me and contributes a further pictorial grace we ate everything in those days by the bushel and the barrel as from stores that were infinite we handled watermelons as freely as cocoanuts and the amount of stomachache involved was negligible in the general edenlike consciousness  the glow of this consciousness even in so small an organism was part of the charm of these retreats offered me cityward upon our base of provisions a part of the rest of which i disengage was in my fond perception of that almost eccentrically homeloving habit in my father which furnished us with half the household humour of our childhoodbesides furnishing him with any quantity of extravagant picture of his so prompt pangs of anguish in absence for celebration of his precipitate returns it was traditional for us later on and especially on the european scene that for him to leave us in pursuit of some advantage or convenience some improvement of our condition some enlargement of our view was for him breathlessly to reappear after the shortest possible interval with no account at all to give of the benefit aimed at but instead of this a moving representation a far richer recital of his spiritual adventures at the horrid inhuman inns and amid the hard alien races which had stayed his advance he reacted he rebounded in favour of his fireside from whatever brief explorations or curiosities these passionate spontaneities were the pulse of his life and quite some of the principal events of ours and as he was nothing if not expressive whatever happened to him for inward intensity happened abundantly to us for pity and terror as it were as well as for an ease and a quality of amusement among ourselves that was really always to fail us among others comparatively late in life after his death i had occasion to visit in lieu of my brother then in europe an american city in which he had had since his own fathers death interests that were of importance to us all on my asking the agent in charge when the owner had last taken personal cognisance of his property that gentleman replied only half to my surprise that he had never in all his years of possession performed such an act then it was perhaps that i most took the measure of his fine faith in human confidence as an administrative function he had to have a relation somehow expressedand as he was the vividest and happiest of letterwriters it rarely failed of coming but once it was established it served him in every case much better than fussy challenges which had always the drawback of involving lapses and inattentions in regard to solicitudes more pressing he incurably took for grantedincurably because whenever he did so the process succeeded with which association however i perhaps overdrench my complacent vision of our summer snatches at town through a grave accident in early life country walks on rough roads were in spite of his great constitutional soundness tedious and charmless to him he liked on the other hand the peopled pavement the thought of which made him restless when away hence the fidelities and sociabilities however superficial that he couldnt not reaffirmif he could only reaffirm the others the really intimate and still more communicable soon enough afterwards  it was these of the improvised and casual sort that i shared with him thus indelibly for truly if we took the boat to town to do things i did them quite as much as he and so that a little boy could scarce have done them more my part may indeed but have been to surround his part with a thick imaginative aura but that constituted for me an activity than which i could dream of none braver or wilder we went to the office of the new york tribunemy fathers relations with that journal were actual and close and that was a wonderful world indeed with strange steepnesses and machineries and noises and hurrying barearmed brighteyed men and amid the agitation clever easy kindly jocular partly undressed gentlemen it was always july or august some of whom i knew at home taking it all as if it were the most natural place in the world it was big to me big to me with the breath of great vague connections and i supposed the gentlemen very old though since aware that they must have been for the connections remarkably young and the conversation of one of them the one i saw oftenest up town who attained to great local and to considerable national eminence afterwards and who talked often and thrillingly about the theatres i retain as many bright fragments of as if i had been another little boswell it was as if he had dropped into my mind the germ of certain interests that were long afterwards to floweras for instance on his announcing the receipt from paris of news of the appearance at the théâtre français of an actress madame judith who was formidably to compete with her coreligionary rachel and to endanger that artists laurels why should madame judiths name have stuck to me through all the years since i was never to see her and she is as forgotten as rachel is remembered why should that scrap of gossip have made a date for my consciousness turning it to the comédie with an intensity that was long afterwards to culminate why was it equally to abide for me that the same gentleman had on one of these occasions mentioned his having just come back from a wonderful city of the west chicago which though but a year or two old with plank sidewalks when there were any and holes and humps where there were none and shanties where there were not big blocks and everything where there had yesterday been nothing had already developed a huge energy and curiosity and also an appetite for lectures i became aware of the comédie i became aware of chicago i also became aware that even the most alluring fiction was not always for little boys to read it was mentioned at the tribune office that one of its reporters mr solon robinson had put forth a novel rather oddly entitled hot corn and more or less having for its subject the career of a little girl who hawked that familiar american luxury in the streets the volume i think was put into my fathers hand and i recall my prompt desire to make acquaintance with it no less than the remark as promptly addressed to my companion that the work however engaging was not one that should be left accessible to an innocent child the pang occasioned by this warning has scarcely yet died out for me nor my sense of my first wonder at the discriminationso great became from that moment the mystery of the tabooed book of whatever identity the question in my breast of why if it was to be so right for others it was only to be wrong for me i remember the soreness of the thought that it was i rather who was wrong for the bookwhich was somehow humiliating in that amount of discredit one couldnt but be involved neither then nor afterwards was the secret of hot corn revealed to me and the sense of privation was to be more prolonged i fear than the vogue of the tale which even as a success of scandal couldnt have been great     vii   dimly queer and pathetic to me were to remain through much of the after time indeed most of those early indigenous vogues and literary flurries so few of those that brushed by my childhood had been other than a tinkling that suddenly stopped i am afraid i mean that what was touching was rather the fact that the tinkle could penetrate than the fact that it died away the light of criticism might have beat so straightif the sense of proportion and the fact of compassion hadnt waved it awayon the æsthetic phase during which the appeal was mainly by the tinkle the scarlet letter and the seven gables had the deep tone as much as one would but of the current efforts of the imagination they were alone in having it till walt whitman broke out in the later fiftiesand i was to know nothing of that happy genius till long after an absorbed perusal of the lamplighter was what i was to achieve at the fleeting hour i continue to circle round that romance was on every ones lips and i recollect it as more or less thrust upon me in amends for the imposed sacrifice of a ranker actualitythat of the improper mr robinson i mean as to whom there revives in me the main question of where his impropriety in so general a platitude of the bourgeois could possibly have dwelt it was to be true indeed that walt whitman achieved an impropriety of the first magnitude that success however but showed us the platitude returning in a genial rage upon itself and getting out of control by generic excess there was no rage at any rate in the lamplighter over which i fondly hung and which would have been my first grownup novelit had been soothingly offered me for thathad i consented to take it as really and truly grownup i couldnt have said what it lacked for the character i only had my secret reserves and when one blest afternoon on the new brighton boat i waded into the initials i saw how right i had been the initials was grownup and the difference thereby exquisite it came over me with the very first page assimilated in the fluttered little cabin to which i had retired with itall in spite of the fact too that my attention was distracted by a pair of remarkable little girls who lurked there out of more public view as to hint that they werent to be seen for nothing  that must have been a rich hour for i mix the marvel of the boon children strange pale little flowers of the american theatre with my conscious joy in bringing back to my mother from our forage in new york a gift of such happy promise as the history of the longlegged mr hamilton and his two bavarian beauties the elder of whom hildegarde was to figure for our small generation as the very type of the haughty as distinguished from the forward heroine since i think our categories really came to no more than those i couldnt have got very far with hildegarde in moments so scant but i memorably felt that romance was thick round meeverything at such a crisis seeming to make for it at once the boon children conveyed thus to new brighton under care of a lady in whose aspect the strain of the resolute triumphed over the note of the battered though the showy in it rather succumbed at the same time to the dowdy were already billed as infant phenomena for a performance that night at the pavilion where our attendance it was a shock to feel couldnt be promised and in gazing without charge at the pair of weary and sleepy little mountebanks i found the histrionic character and the dramatic profession for the first time revealed to me they filled me with fascination and yet with fear they expressed a melancholy grace and a sort of peevish refinement yet seemed awfully detached and indifferent indifferent perhaps even to being pinched and slapped for arts sake at home they honoured me with no notice whatever and regarded me doubtless as no better than one of the little louts peeping through the tent of the show in return i judged their appearance dissipated though fascinating and sought consolation for the memory of their scorn and the loss of their exhibition as time went on in noting that the bounds of their fame seemed somehow to have been stayed i neither met them nor heard of them again the little batemans must have obscured their comparatively dim lustre flourishing at the same period and with a larger command of the pictorial poster and the other primitive symbols in broadwaysuch posters and such symbols as they were at that timethe little batemans who were to be reserved in maturer form for my much later and more grateful appreciation  this weak reminiscence has obstructed however something more to the purpose the retained impression of those choicest of our loiterings that took place still far downtown at the bookstore home of delights and haunt of fancy it was at the bookstore we had called on the day of the initials and the boon childrenand it was thence we were returning with our spoil of which the charming novel must have been but a fragment my impression composed itself of many pieces a great and various practice of burying my nose in the halfopen book for the strong smell of paper and printers ink known to us as the english smell was needed to account for it that was the exercise of the finest sense that hung about us my brother and meor of one at least but little less fine than the sense for the satisfaction of which we resorted to thompsons and to taylors it bore me company during all our returns from forages and left me persuaded that i had only to snuff up hard enough fresh uncut volume in hand to taste of the very substance of london all our books in that age were english at least all our downtown onesi personally recall scarce any that were not and i take the perception of that quality in them to have associated itself with more fond dreams and glimmering pictures than any other one principle of growth it was all a result of the deeply infected state i had been prematurely poisonedas i shall presently explain the bookstore fondest of my fathers resorts though i remember no more of its public identity than that it further enriched the brave depth of broadway was overwhelmingly and irresistibly english as not less tonically english was our principal host there with whom we had moreover my father and i thanks to his office such personal and genial relations that i recall seeing him grace our board at home in company with his wife whose vocal strain and complexion and coiffure and flounces i found none the less informing none the less racial for my not being then versed in the language of analysis  the true inwardness of these rich meaningsthose above all of the bookstore itselfwas that a tradition was thus fed a presumption thus created a vague vision thus filled in all expression is clumsy for so mystic a process what else can have happened but that having taken over under suggestion and with singular infant promptitude a particular throbbing consciousness i had become aware of the source at which it could best be refreshed that consciousness so communicated was just simply of certain impressions certain sources of impression again proceeding from over the sea and situated beyond itor even much rather of my parents own impression of such the fruit of a happy time spent in and about london with their two babies and reflected in that portion of their talk with each other to which i best attended had all their talk for its subject in my infant ears that happy timedid it deal only with london and piccadilly and the green park where over against their dwelling their two babies mainly took the air under charge of fanny of albany their american nurse whose remark as to the degree to which the british museum fell short for one who had had the privilege of that of albany was handed down to us did it never forbear from windsor and richmond and sudbrook and ham common amid the rich complexity of which crowding their discourse with echoes they had spent their summerall a scattering of such pearls as it seemed that their secondborn could most deftly and instinctively pick up our sole maternal aunt already mentioned as a devoted and cherished presence during those and many later years was in a position to share with them the treasure of these mild memories which strike me as having for the most part through some bright household habit overflowed at the breakfasttable where i regularly attended with w j she had imbibed betimes in europe the seeds of a long nostalgia and i think of her as ever so patiently communicative on that score under pressure of my artless appeal that i should have been so inquiring while still so destitute of primary data was doubtless rather an anomaly and it was for that matter quite as if my infant divination proceeded by the light of nature i divined that it would matter to me in the future that english life should be of this or that fashion my father had subscribed for me to a small periodical of quarto form covered in yellow and entitled the charm which shed on the question the softest lustre but of which the appearances were sadly intermittent or then struck me as being inasmuch as many of our visits to the bookstore were to ask for the new numberonly to learn with painful frequency that the last consignment from london had arrived without it i feel again the pang of that disappointmentas if through the want of what i needed most for going on the english smell was exhaled by the charm in a peculiar degree and i see myself affected by the failure as by that of a vital tonic it was not at the same time by a charm the more or the less that my salvation was to be as it were worked out or my imagination at any rate duly convinced conviction was the result of the very air of home so far as i most consciously inhaled it this represented no doubt a failure to read into matters close at hand all the interest they were capable of yielding but i had taken the twist had sipped the poison as i say and was to feel it to that end the most salutary cup i saw my parents homesick as i conceived for the ancient order and distressed and inconvenienced by many of the more immediate features of the modern as the modern pressed upon us and since their theory of our better living was from an early time that we should renew the quest of the ancient on the very first possibility i simply grew greater in the faith that somehow to manage that would constitute success in life i never found myself deterred from this fond view which was implied in every question i asked every answer i got and every plan i formed  those are great words for the daydream of infant ignorance yet if success in life may perhaps be best defined as the performance in age of some intention arrested in youth i may frankly put in a claim to it to press my nose against the sources of the english smell so different for young bibliophiles from any american was to adopt that sweetness as the sign of my atmosphere roundabout might be the course to take but one was in motion from the first and one never lost sight of the goal the very names of places and things in the other worldthe marked opposite in most ways of that in which new york and albany fort hamilton and new brighton formed so fallacious a maximumbecame to me values and secrets and shibboleths they were probably often on my tongue and employed as ignorance determined but i quite recall being ashamed to use them as much as i should have liked it was new brighton i reconstruct and indeed definitely remember that finished us at lastthat and our final sordid school w js and mine in new york the ancient order had somehow to be invoked when such advantages as those were the best within our compass and our means not further to anticipate at all events that climax was for a while but vaguely in sight and the illusion of felicity continued from season to season to shut us in it is only of what i took for felicity however few the years and however scant the scene that i am pretending now to speak though i shall have strained the last drop of romance from this vision of our towny summers with the quite sharp reminiscence of my first sitting for my daguerreotype i repaired with my father on an august day to the great broadway establishment of mr brady supreme in that then beautiful art and it is my impressionthe only point vague with methat though we had come up by the staten island boat for the purpose we were to keep the affair secret till the charming consequence should break at home upon my mother strong is my conviction that our mystery in the event yielded almost at once to our elation for no tradition had a brighter household life with us than that of our fathers headlong impatience he moved in a cloud if not rather in a high radiance of precipitation and divulgation a chartered rebel against cold reserves the good news in his hand refused under any persuasion to grow stale the sense of communicable pleasure in his breast was positively explosive so that we saw those surprises in which he had conspired with our mother for our benefit converted by him in every case under our shamelessly encouraged guesses into common conspiracies against heragainst her knowing that is how thoroughly we were all compromised he had a special and delightful sophistry at the service of his overflow and never so fine a fancy as in defending it on human grounds he was something very different withal from a parent of weak mercies weakness was never so positive and plausible nor could the attitude of sparing you be more handsomely or on occasion even more comically aggressive  my small point is simply however that the secresy of our conjoined portrait was probably very soon by his act to begin a public and shining life and to enjoy it till we received the picture as to which moreover still another remembrance steals on me a proof of the fact that our adventure was improvised sharp again is my sense of not being so adequately dressed as i should have taken thought for had i foreseen my exposure though the resources of my wardrobe as then constituted could surely have left me but few alternatives the main resource of a small new york boy in this line at that time was the little sheathlike jacket tight to the body closed at the neck and adorned in front with a single row of brass buttonsa garment of scant grace assuredly and compromised to my consciousness above all by a strange ironic light from an unforgotten source it was but a short time before those days that the great mr thackeray had come to america to lecture on the english humourists and still present to me is the voice proceeding from my fathers library in which some glimpse of me hovering at an opening of the door in passage or on staircase prompted him to the formidable words come here little boy and show me your extraordinary jacket my sense of my jacket became from that hour a heavy onefurther enriched as my vision is by my shyness of posture before the seated the celebrated visitor who struck me in the sunny light of the animated room as enormously big and who though he laid on my shoulder the hand of benevolence bent on my native costume the spectacles of wonder i was to know later on why he had been so amused and why after asking me if this were the common uniform of my age and class he remarked that in england were i to go there i should be addressed as buttons it had been revealed to me thus in a flash that we were somehow queer and though never exactly crushed by it i became aware that i at least felt so as i stood with my head in mr bradys vise beautiful most decidedly the lost art of the daguerreotype i remember the exposure as on this occasion interminably long yet with the result of a facial anguish far less harshly reproduced than my suffered snapshots of a later age too few i may here interject were to remain my gathered impressions of the great humourist but one of them indeed almost the only other bears again on the play of his humour over our perversities of dress it belongs to a later moment an occasion on which i see him familiarly seated with us in paris during the spring of 1857 at some repast at which the younger of us too by that time habitually flocked in our affluence of five our youngest was beside him a small sister then not quite in her eighth year and arrayed apparently after the fashion of the period and place and the tradition lingered long of his having suddenly laid his hand on her little flounced person and exclaimed with ludicrous horror crinolinei was suspecting it so young and so depraved  a fainter image that of one of the new york moments just eludes me pursue it as i will i recover but the setting and the fact of his brief presence in it with nothing that was said or done beyond my being left with my father to watch our distinguished friends secretary who was also a young artist establish his easel and proceed to paint the setting as i recall it was an odd oblong blank private parlour at the clarendon hotel then the latest thing in hotels but whose ancient corner of fourth avenue andwas it eighteenth streetlong ago ceased to know it the gentle very gentle portraitist was mr eyre crowe and the obliging sitter my father who sat in response to mr thackerays desire that his protégé should find employment the protector after a little departed blessing the business which took the form of a small fulllength of the model seated his arm extended and the hand on the knob of his cane the work it may at this time of day be mentioned fell below its general possibilities but i note the scene through which i must duly have gaped and wondered for i had as yet seen no one least of all a casual acquaintance in an hotel parlour really paint before as a happy example again of my parents positive cultivation of my society it would seem and thought for my social education and then there are other connections i recall it as a sunday morning i recover the place itself as a featureless voidbleak and bare with its developments all to come the hotel parlour of other new york daysbut vivid still to me is my conscious assistance for the first time at operations that were to mean much for many of my coming years those of quiet mr crowe held me spellboundi was to circle so wistfully as from that beginning round the practice of his art which in spite of these earnest approaches and intentions never on its own part in the least acknowledged our acquaintance scarcely much more than it was ever to respond for that matter to the overtures of the mild aspirant himself known to my observation long afterwards in the london years as the most touchingly resigned of the children of disappointment not only by association was he a thackerayan figure but much as if the masters hand had stamped him with the outline and the value with life and sweetness and patienceshown as after the long futility seated in a quiet wait very long too for the end that was sad one couldnt but feel yet it was in the oddest way impossible to take him for a failure he might have been one of fortunes strictly but what was that when he was one of thackerays own successesin the minor line but with such a grace and such a truth those of some dim second cousin to colonel newcome     viii   i feel that at such a rate i remember too much and yet this mild apparitionism is only part of it to look back at all is to meet the apparitional and to find in its ghostly face the silent stare of an appeal when i fix it the hovering shade whether of person or place it fixes me back and seems the less lostnot to my consciousness for that is nothing but to its ownby my stopping however idly for it the day of the daguerreotype the august afternoon what was it if not one of the days when we went to union square for luncheon and for more icecream and more peaches and even more even most enjoyment of ease accompanied by stimulation of wonder it may have been indeed that a visit to mrs cannon rather on that occasion engaged usmemory selects a little confusedly from such a wealth of experience for the wonder was the experience and that was everywhere even if i didnt so much find it as take it with me to be sure of not falling short mrs cannon lurked near fourth streetthat i abundantly grasp not more definitely placing her than in what seemed to me a labyrinth of grave byestreets westwardly back of broadway yet at no great distance from it where she must have occupied a house at a corner since we reached her not by steps that went up to a front door but by others that went slightly down and formed clearly an independent side access a feature that affected me as rich and strange what the steps went down to was a spacious room light and friendly so that it couldnt have been compromised by an area which offered the brave mystification amid other mystifications of being at once a parlour and a shop a shop in particular for the relief of gentlemen in want of pockethandkerchiefs neckties collars umbrellas and strawcovered bottles of the essence known in old new york as cullonewith a very long and big o mrs cannon was always seated at some delicate white or other needlework as if she herself made the collars and the neckties and hemmed the pockethandkerchiefs though the air of this conflicts with the sense of importation from remoter centres of fashion breathed by some of the more thrilling of the remarks i heard exchanged at the same time that it quickened the oddity of the place for the oddity was in many thingsabove all perhaps in there being no counter no rows of shelves and no vulgar till for mrs cannons commerce the parlour clearly dissimulated the shopand positively to that extent that i might uncannily have wondered what the shop dissimulated it represented honestly i made out in the course of visits that seem to me to have been delightfully repeated the more informal of the approaches to our friends brave background or hinterland the realm of her main industry the array of the furnished apartments for gentlemengentlemen largely for whom she imported the eau de cologne and the neckties and who struck me as principally consisting of the ever remarkable uncles desirous at times on their restless returns from albany or wherever of an intimacy of comfort that the new york hotel couldnt yield fascinating thus the implications of mrs cannons establishment where the talk took the turn in particular of mr john and mr edward and mr howard and where miss maggie or miss susie who were on the spot in other rocking chairs and with other poised needles made their points as well as the rest of us the interest of the place was that the uncles were somehow always under discussionas to where they at the moment might be or as to when they were expected or above all as to how the how was the great matter and the fine emphasis they had last appeared and might be conceived as carrying themselves and that their consumption of neckties and eau de cologne was somehow inordinate i might have been judging it in my innocence as their only consommation i refer to those sources i say the charm of the scene the finer part of which must yet have been that it didnt as it regularly lapsed dispose of all mystifications if i didnt understand however the beauty was that mrs cannon understood that was what she did most of all even more than hem pockethandkerchiefs and collars and my father understood and each understood that the other did miss maggie and miss susie being no whit behind it was only i who didnt understandsave in so far as i understood that which was a kind of pale joy and meanwhile there would be more to come from uncles so attachingly so almost portentously discussable the vision at any rate was to stick by me as through its oldworld friendly grace its light on the elder amenity the prettier manners the tender personal note in the good ladys importations and anxieties that of the handmade fabric and the discriminating service fit to figure as a value anywhereby which i meant in the right corner of any social picture i afterwards said to myselfthat refined and composed significance of mrs cannons scene  union square was a different matter though with the element there also that i made out that i didnt make out my sense of drama was in this case i think rather more frightened off than led on a drawback for which however i consoled myself by baked apples and custards an inveterate feature of our sunday luncheon there those of weekdays being various and casual and by a study of a great store as it seemed to me of steelplated volumes devoted mainly to the heroines of romance with one in particular presenting those of shakespeare in which the plates were so artfully coloured and varnished and complexion and dress thereby so endeared to memory that it was for long afterwards a shock to me at the theatre not to see just those bright images with their peculiar toggeries come on i was able but the other day moreover to renew almost on the very spot the continuity of contemplation large lumpish presences precarious creations of a day seemed to have elbowed out of the square all but one or two of the minor monuments pleasant appreciable things of the other time yet close to university place the old house of the picturebooks and the custards and the domestic situation had though disfigured and overscored not quite received its deathstroke i disengaged by a mere identification of obscured window and profaned portico a whole chapter of history which fact should indeed be a warning to penetration a practical plea here for the superficialby its exhibition of the rate at which the relations of any gage of experience multiply and ramify from the moment the mind begins to handle it i pursued a swarm of such relations on the occasion i speak of up and down west fourteenth street and over to seventh avenue running most of them to earth with difficulty but finding them at half a dozen points quite confess to a queer stale sameness the gage of experience as i say had in these cases been strangely sparedthe sameness had in two or three of them held out as with conscious craft but these are impressions i shall presently find it impossible not to take up again at any cost  i first realised fourteenth street at a very tender age and i perfectly recall that flush of initiation consisting as it did of an afternoon call with my father at a house there situated one of an already fairly mature row on the south side and quite near sixth avenue it was as our house just acquired by us that he thus invited my approval of itheaping as that does once more the measure of my small adhesiveness i thoroughly approvedquite as if i had foreseen that the place was to become to me for ever so long afterwards a sort of anchorage of the spirit being at the hour as well a fascination for the eyes since it was there i first fondly gaped at the process of decorating i saw charming men in little caps ingeniously formed of folded newspaperwhere in the roaring city are those quaint badges of the handicrafts nowmounted on platforms and casting plaster into moulds i saw them in particular paste long strips of yellowish grained paper upon walls and i vividly remember thinking the grain and the pattern for there was a pattern from waisthigh down a complication of dragons and sphinxes and scrolls and other fine flourishes a wonderful and sumptuous thing i would give much i protest to recover its lost secret to see what it really wasso interesting ever to retrace and sometimes so difficult of belief in a community of ones own knowing is the general æsthetic adventure are the dangers and delusions the all but fatal accidents and mortal ailments that taste has smilingly survived and after which the fickle creature may still quite brazenly look one in the face our quarter must have bristled in those years with the very worst of the dangersignalsthough indeed they figured but as coarse complacencies the age of brown stone had just been ushered in and that material in deplorable in monstrous form over all the vacant spaces and eligible sites then numerous between the fifth and sixth avenues more and more affronted the day we seemed to have come up from a world of quieter harmonies the world of washington square and thereabouts so decent in its dignity so instinctively unpretentious there were even there spots of shabbiness that i recall such as the charmless void reaching westward from the two houses that formed the fifth avenue corner to our grandfathers our new york grandfathers house itself built by him with the happiest judgment not so long before and at no distant time in truth to be solidly but much less pleasingly neighboured the ancient name of the paradeground still hung about the central space and the ancient wooden palings then so generally accounted proper for central spacesthe whole image infinitely recedesaffected even my innocent childhood as rustic and mean union square at the top of the avenueor what practically then counted for the topwas encased more smartly in iron rails and further adorned with a fountain and an aged amateurlooking constable awful to my generation in virtue of his star and his switch i associate less elegance with the paradeground into which we turned for recreation from my neighbouring damesschool and where the parades deployed on no scale to check our own evolutions though indeed the switch of office abounded there for what i best recover in the connection is a sense and smell of perpetual autumn with the ground so muffled in the leaves and twigs of the now long defunct ailanthustree that most of our own motions were a kicking of them upthe semisweet rankness of the plant was all in the airand small boys pranced about as cavaliers whacking their steeds there were bigger boys bolder still to whom this vegetation or something kindred that escapes me yielded long black beanlike slips which they lighted and smoked the smaller ones staring and impressed i at any rate think of the small one i can best speak for as constantly wading through an indian summer of these disjecta fascinated by the leafkicking process the joy of lonely trudges over a course in which those parts and the slightly more northward pleasantly confound themselves these were the homely joys of the nobler neighbourhood elements that had their match and more hard by the fourteenth street home in the poplars the pigs the poultry and the irish houses two or three in number exclusive of a very fine dutch one seated then this last almost as among gardens and grovesa breadth of territory still apparent on the spot in that marginal ease that spread of occupation to the nearly complete absence of which new york aspects owe their general failure of style  but there were finer vibrations as wellfor the safelyprowling infant though none perhaps so fine as when he stood long and drank deep at those founts of romance that gushed from the huge placards of the theatre these announcements at a day when advertisement was contentedly but information had very much the form of magnified playbills they consisted of vast oblong sheets yellow or white pasted upon tall wooden screens or into hollow sockets and acquainting the possible playgoer with every circumstance that might seriously interest him these screens rested sociably against trees and lampposts as well as against walls and fences to all of which they were i suppose familiarly attached but the sweetest note of their confidence was that in parallel lines and the good old way characters facing performers they gave the whole cast which in the palmy days of the drama often involved many names i catch myself again in the fact of endless stations in fifth avenue near the southwest corner of ninth street as i think it must have been since the dull long run didnt exist then for the young badaud and the poster there was constantly and bravely renewed it engaged my attention whenever i passed as the canvas of a great master in a great gallery holds that of the pious tourist and even though i cant at this day be sure of its special reference i was with precocious passion at home among the theatresthanks to our parents fond interest in them as from this distance i see it flourish for the time and to the liberal law and happy view under which the addiction was shared with us they never caring much for things we couldnt care for and generally holding that what was good to them would be also good for their children it had the effect certainly of preparing for these so far as we should incline to cherish it a strange little fund of theatrical reminiscence a small hoard of memories maintaining itself in my own case for a lifetime and causing me to wonder today before its abundance on how many evenings of the month or perhaps even of the week we were torn from the pursuits of home     ix   the truth is doubtless however much less in the wealth of my experience than in the tenacity of my impression the fact that i have lost nothing of what i saw and that though i cant now quite divide the total into separate occasions the various items surprisingly swarm for me i shall return to some of them wishing at present only to make my point of when and how the seeds were sown that afterwards so thickly sprouted and flowered i was greatly to love the drama at its best as a form whatever variations of faith or curiosity i was to know in respect to the infirm and inadequate theatre there was of course anciently no question for us of the drama at its best and indeed while i lately by chance looked over a copious collection of theatrical portraits beginning with the earliest age of lithography and photography as so applied and documentary in the highest degree on the personalities as we nowadays say of the old american stage stupefaction grew sharp in me and scepticism triumphed so vulgar so barbarous seemed the array of types so extraordinarily provincial the note of every figure so less than scant the claim of such physiognomies and such reputations rather dismal everywhere i admit the histrionic image with the artificial lights turned offthe fatigued and disconnected face reduced to its mere self and resembling some closed and darkened inn with the sign still swung but the place blighted for want of custom that consideration weighs but what a gang all the same when thus left to their own devices the performers men and women alike of that world of queer appreciations i ought perhaps to bear on them lightly in view of what in especial comes back to me the sense of the sacred thrill with which i began to watch the green curtain the particular one that was to rise to the comedy of errors on the occasion that must have been for what i recall of its almost unbearable intensity the very first of my ever sitting at a play i should have been indebted for the momentous evening in that case to mr william burton whose small theatre in chambers street to the rear of stewarts big shop and hard by the park as the park was at that time understood offered me then my prime initiation let me not complain of my having owed the adventure to a still greater william as well nor think again without the right intensity the scarce tolerable throb of the way the torment of the curtain was mixed half so dark a defiance and half so rich a promise ones eyes bored into it in vain and yet one knew it would rise at the named hour the only question being if one could exist till then the play had been read to us during the day a celebrated english actor whose name i inconsistently forget had arrived to match mr burton as the other of the dromios and the agreeable mrs holman who had to my relentless vision too retreating a chin was so good as to represent adriana i regarded mrs holman as a friend though in no warmer light than that in which i regarded miss mary taylorsave indeed that mrs holman had the pull on ones affections of coming out to sing in white satin and quite irrelevantly between the acts an advantage she shared with the younger and fairer and more dashing the dancing miss malvina who footed it and tambourined it and shawled it irruptively in lonely state when not admiring mr burton in shakespeare we admired him as paul pry as mr toodles and as aminadab sleek in the serious family and we must have admired him very muchhis huge fat person his huge fat face and his vast slightly pendulous cheek surmounted by a sort of elephantine wink to which i impute a remarkable baseness being still perfectly present to me  we discriminated none the less we thought mr blake a much finer comedian much more of a gentleman and a scholarmellow mr blake whom with the brave and emphatic mrs blake how they must have made their points i connect partly with the burton scene and partly with that of slightly subsequent creation which after flourishing awhile slightly further up broadway under the charmlessly commercial name of broughams lyceum we had almost only lyceums and museums and lecture rooms and academies of music for playhouse and opera then entered upon a long career and a migratory life as wallacks theatre i fail doubtless to keep all my associations clear but what is important or what i desire at least to make pass for such is that when we most admired mr blake we also again admired miss mary taylor and it was at broughams not at burtons that we rendered her that tributereserved for her performance of the fond theatrical daughter in the english version of le père de la débutante where i see the charming panting darkhaired creature in flowing white classically relieved by a gold tiara and a golden scarf rush back from the supposed stage to the represented greenroom followed by thunders of applause and throw herself upon the neck of the brokendown old gentleman in a blue coat with brass buttons who must have been after all on second thoughts mr placide greater flights or more delicate shades the art of pathetic comedy was at that time held not to achieve only i straighten it out that mr and mrs blake not less than miss mary taylor who preponderantly haunts my vision even to the disadvantage of miss kate horn in nan the goodfornothing until indeed she is displaced by the brilliant laura keene did migrate to broughams where we found them all themselves as goldsmiths hardcastle pair and other like matters we rallied especially to blake as dogberry on the occasion of my second shakespearean night for as such i seem to place it when laura keene and mr lesterthe lester wallack that was to bedid beatrice and benedick i yield to this further proof that we had our proportion of shakespeare though perhaps antedating that rapt vision of much ado which may have been preceded by the dazzled apprehension of a midsummer nights dream at the broadway there was a confessed theatre this latter now present to me in every bright particular it supplied us we must have felt our greatest conceivable adventurei cannot otherwise account for its emerging so clear everything here is as of yesterday the identity of the actors the details of their dress the charm imparted by the sisters gougenheim the elegant elder as the infatuated helena and the other the roguish joey as the mischievous puck hermia was mrs nagle in a short salmoncoloured peplum over a white petticoat the whole bulgingly confined by a girdle of shining gilt and forming a contrast to the loose scarves of helena while mr nagle not devoid i seem to remember of a blue chin and the latency of a fine brogue was either lysander or demetrius mr davidge also i surmise with a brogue was bottom the weaver and madame ponisi oberonmadame ponisi whose range must have been wide since i see her also as the whiteveiled heroine of the cataract of the ganges where preferring death to dishonour she dashes up the more or less perpendicular waterfall on a fiery black steed and with an effect only a little blighted by the chance flutter of a drapery out of which peeps the leg of a trouser and a big male foot and then again though presumably at a somewhat later time or in strictness after childhoods fond hour as this and that noble matron or tragedy queen i descry her at any rate as representing all characters alike with a broad brown face framed in bands or crowns or other heavy headgear out of which cropped a row of very small tight black curls the cataract of the ganges is all there as well a tragedy of temples and idols and wicked rajahs and real water with davidge and joey gougenheim again for comic reliefthough all in a coarser radiance thanks to the absence of fairies and amazons and moonlit mechanical effects the charm above all so seen of the play within the play and i rank it in that relation with green bushes despite the celebrity in the latter of madame céleste who came to us straight out of london and whose admired walk up the stage as miami the huntress a wonderful majestic and yet voluptuous stride enhanced by a short kilt black velvet leggings and a gun haughtily borne on the shoulder is vividly before me as i write the piece in question was i recall from the pen of mr bourcicault as he then wrote his namehe was so early in the field and must have been from long before inasmuch as he now appears to me to have supplied mr brougham of the lyceum aforesaid with his choicest productions  i sit again at london assurance with mrs wallackfanny wallack i think not that i quite know who she wasas lady gay spanker flushed and vociferous first in a ridinghabit with a tail yards long and afterwards in yellow satin with scarce a tail at all i am present also at love in a maze in which the stage represented with primitive art i fear a supposedly intricate gardenlabyrinth and in which i admired for the first time mrs russell afterwards long before the public as mrs hoey even if opining that she wanted especially for the lownecked ordeal less osseous a structure there are pieces of that general association i admit the clue to which slips from me the drama of modern life and of french originthough what was then not of french originin which miss julia bennett fresh from triumphs at the haymarket made her first appearance in a very becoming white bonnet either as a brilliant adventuress or as the innocent victim of licentious design i forget which though with a sense somehow that the white bonnet when of true elegance was the note at that period of the adventuress miss julia bennett with whom at a later age one was to renew acquaintance as the artful and ample mrs barrow full of manner and presence and often edwin booths portia desdemona and julie de mortemer i figure her as having in the dimmer phase succeeded to miss laura keene at wallacks on the secession thence of this original charmer of our parents the flutter of whose prime advent is perfectly present to me with the relish expressed for that english sweetness of her speech i already wondered why it shouldnt be english which was not as the speech mostly known to us the uncles within my hearing even imitated for commendation some of her choicer sounds to which i strained my ear on seeing her afterwards as mrs chillington in the refined comedietta of a morning call where she made delightful game of mr lester as sir edward ardent even to the point of causing him to crawl about on all fours and covered with her shawl after the fashion of a horseblanket that delightful impression was then unconscious of the blight to comethat of my apprehending years after that the brilliant comedietta was the tribute of our anglosaxon taste to alfred de mussets elegant proverb of the porte ouverte ou fermée in which nothing could find itself less at home than the horseplay of the english version miss laura keene with a native grace at the start a fresh and delicate inspiration i infer from the kind of pleasure she appears to have begun with giving was to live to belie her promise and becoming hard and raddled forfeit on the evidence all claim to the higher distinction a fact not surprising under the lurid light projected by such a sign of the atmosphere of ineptitude as an accepted and condoned perversion to vulgarity of mussets perfect little work how could quality of talent consort with so dire an absence of quality in the material offered it where could such lapses lead but to dust and desolation and what happy instinct not be smothered in an air so dismally nonconducting is it a foolish fallacy that these matters may have been on occasion at that time worth speaking of is it only presumable that everything was perfectly cheap and common and everyone perfectly bad and barbarous and that even the least corruptible of our typical spectators were too easily beguiled and too helplessly kind the beauty of the main truth as to any remembered matter looked at in due detachment or in other words through the haze of time is that comprehension has then become one with criticism compassion as it may really be called one with musing vision and the whole company of the anciently restless with their elations and mistakes their sincerities and fallacies and vanities and triumphs embalmed for us in the mild essence of their collective submission to fate we neednt be strenuous about them unless we particularly want to and are glad to remember in season all that this would imply of the strenuous about our own origines our muddled initiations if nothing is more certain for us than that many persons within our recollection couldnt help being rather generally unadmonished and unaware so nothing is more in the note of peace than that such a perceived state pushed to a point makes our scales of judgment but ridiculously rattle our admonition our superior awareness is of many thingsand among these of how infinitely at the worst they lived the pale superseded and how much it was by their virtue  which reflections in the train of such memories as those just gathered may perhaps seem overstrainedthough they really to my own eyes cause the images to multiply still others of these break in upon me and refuse to be slighted reconstituting as i practically am the history of my fostered imagination for whatever it may be worth i wont pretend to a disrespect for any contributive particle i left myself just above staring at the fifth avenue poster and i cant but linger there while the vision it evokes insists on swarming it was the age of the arrangements of dickens for the stage vampedup promptly on every scene and which must have been the roughest theatrical tinkers work but at two or three of which we certainly assisted i associate them with mr broughams temple of the art yet am at the same time beset with the captain cuttle of dombey and son in the form of the big burton who never i earnestly conceive graced that shrine so that i wander a trifle confusedly isnt it he whom i remember as a monstrous micawber the coarse parody of a charming creation with the entire baldness of a huge easter egg and collarpoints like the sails of mediterranean feluccas dire of course for all temperance in these connections was the need to conform to the illustrations of phiz himself already an improvising parodist and happy only so long as not imitated not literally reproduced strange enough the æsthetic of artists who could desire but literally to reproduce i give the whole question up however i stray too in the dust and with a positive sense of having in the first place but languished at home when my betters admired miss cushmanterribly out of the picture and the frame we should today pronounce her i fearas the nancy of oliver twist as far away this must have been as the lifetime of the prehistoric park to which it was just within my knowledge that my elders went for opera to come back on us sounding those rich old italian names bosio and badiali ronconi and steffanone i am not sure i have them quite right signs of a rueful sound to us that the line as to our infant participation was somewhere drawn it had not been drawn i all the more like to remember when under proper protection at castle garden i listened to that rarest of infant phenomena adelina patti poised in an armchair that had been pushed to the footlights and announcing her incomparable gift she was about of our own age she was one of us even though at the same time the most prodigious of fairies of glittering fables that principle of selection was indeed in abeyance while i sat with my mother either at tripler hall or at niblosi am vague about the occasion but the names as for fine old confused reasons plead alike to my penand paid a homage quite other than critical i dare say to the then slightly worn henrietta sontag countess rossi who struck us as supremely elegant in pink silk and white lace flounces and with whom there had been for certain members of our circle some contact or intercourse that i have wonderingly lost i learned at that hour in any case what acclamation might mean and have again before me the vast highpiled auditory thundering applause at the beautiful pink ladys clear birdnotes a thrilling a tremendous experience and my sole other memory of concertgoing at that age save the impression of a strange huddled hour in some smaller public place some very minor hall under dim lamps and again in my mothers company where we were so near the improvised platform that my nose was brushed by the petticoats of the distinguished amateur who sang casta diva a very fine fair woman with a great heaving of bosom and flirt of crinoline and that the ringletted italian gentleman in black velvet and a romantic voluminous cloak who represented or rather who professionally and uncontrollably was an improvisatore had for me the effect as i crouched gaping of quite bellowing down my throat that occasion i am clear was a concert for a charity with the volunteer performance and the social patroness and it had squeezed in where it wouldat the same time that i somehow connect the place in broadway on the right going down and not much below fourth street except that everything seems to me to have been just below fourth street when not just above with the scene of my great public exposure somewhat later the wonderful exhibition of signor blitz the peerless conjurer who on my attending his entertainment with w j and our frequent comrade of the early time hal coster practised on my innocence to seduce me to the stage and there plunge me into the shame of my sad failure to account arithmetically for his bewilderingly subtracted or added or divided pockethandkerchiefs and playingcards a paralysis of wit as to which i once more and with the same wan despair feel my companions shy telegraphy of relief their snickerings and mouthings and raised numerical fingers reach me from the benches  the second definite matter in the dickens connection is the smike of miss westonwhose prænomen i frivolously forget though i fear it was lizzie but who was afterwards mrs e l davenport and then sequently to some public strife or chatter mrs charles matthewsin a version of nicholas nickleby that gracelessly managed to be all tearful melodrama longlost foundlings wicked ralph nicklebys and scowling arthur grides with other baffled villains and scarcely at all crummleses and kenwigses much less squeerses though there must have been something of dotheboys hall for the proper tragedy of smike and for the broad yorkshire effect a precious theatrical value of john brodie the ineffaceability was the anguish to my tender sense of nicholass starved and tattered and fawning and whining protégé in face of my sharp retention of which through all the years who shall deny the immense authority of the theatre or that the stage is the mightiest of modern engines such at least was to be the force of the dickens imprint however applied in the soft clay of our generation it was to resist so serenely the wash of the waves of time to be brought up thus against the author of it or to speak at all of the dawn of ones early consciousness of it and of his presence and power is to begin to tread ground at once sacred and boundless the associations of which looming large warn us off even while they hold he did too much for us surely ever to leave us freefree of judgment free of reaction even should we care to be which heaven forbid he laid his hand on us in a way to undermine as in no other case the power of detached appraisement we react against other productions of the general kind without liking them the less but we somehow liked dickens the more for having forfeited half the claim to appreciation that process belongs to the fact that criticism roundabout him is somehow futile and tasteless his own taste is easily impugned but he entered so early into the blood and bone of our intelligence that it always remained better than the taste of overhauling him when i take him up today and find myself holding off i simply stop not holding off that is but holding on and from the very fear to do so which sounds i recognise like perusal like renewal of the scantest i dont renew i wouldnt renew for the world wouldnt that is with ones treasure so hoarded in the dusty chamber of youth let in the intellectual air happy the house of life in which such chambers still hold out even with the draught of the intellect whistling through the passages we were practically contemporary contemporary with the issues the fluttering monthly numbersthat was the point it made for us a good fortune constituted for us in itself romance on which nothing to the end succeeds in laying its hands  the whole question dwells for me in a single small reminiscence though there are others still that of my having been sent to bed one evening in fourteenth street as a very small boy at an hour when in the library and under the lamp one of the elder cousins from albany the youngest of an orphaned brood of four of my grandmothers most extravagant adoption had begun to read aloud to my mother the new which must have been the first instalment of david copperfield i had feigned to withdraw but had only retreated to cover close at hand the friendly shade of some screen or drooping tablecloth folded up behind which and glued to the carpet i held my breath and listened i listened long and drank deep while the wondrous picture grew but the tense cord at last snapped under the strain of the murdstones and i broke into the sobs of sympathy that disclosed my subterfuge i was this time effectively banished but the ply then taken was ineffaceable i remember indeed just afterwards finding the sequel in especial the vast extrusion of the micawbers beyond my actual capacity which took a few years to grow adequateyears in which the general contagious consciousness and our own household response not least breathed heavily through hard times bleak house and little dorrit the seeds of acquaintance with chuzzlewit and dombey and son these coming thickly on i had found already sown i was to feel that i had been born born to a rich awareness under the very meridian there sprouted in those years no such other crop of ready references as the golden harvest of copperfield yet if i was to wait to achieve the happier of these recognitions i had already pored over oliver twistalbeit now uncertain of the relation borne by that experience to the incident just recalled when oliver was new to me at any rate he was already old to my betters whose view of his particular adventures and exposures must have been concerned i think moreover in the fact of my public and lively wonder about them it was an exhibition deprecatedto infant innocence i judge unless indeed my remembrance of enjoying it only on the terms of fitful snatches in another though a kindred house is due mainly to the existence there of george cruikshanks splendid form of the work of which our own foreground was clear it perhaps even seemed to me more cruikshanks than dickenss it was a thing of such vividly terrible images and all marked with that peculiarity of cruikshank that the offered flowers or goodnesses the scenes and figures intended to comfort and cheer present themselves under his hand as but more subtly sinister or more suggestively queer than the frank badnesses and horrors the nice people and the happy moments in the plates frightened me almost as much as the low and the awkward which didnt however make the volumes a source of attraction the less toward that high and square old backparlour just westward of sixth avenue as we in the same street were related to it that formed romantically half our alternative domestic field and offered to our small inquiring steps a larger range and privilege if the dickens of those years was as i have just called him the great actuality of the current imagination so i at once meet him in force as a feature even of conditions in which he was but indirectly involved  for the other house the house we most haunted after our own was that of our cousin albert still another of the blest orphans though this time of our mothers kindred and if it was my habit as i have hinted to attribute to orphans as orphans a circumstantial charm a setting necessarily more delightful than our fatherd and motherd one so there spread about this appointed comrade the perfection of the type inasmuch as he alone was neither brotherd nor sisterd an air of possibilities that were none the less vivid for being quite indefinite he was to embody in due course poor young man some of these possibilitiesthose that had originally been for me the vaguest of all but to fix his situation from my present view is not so much to wonder that it spoke to me of a wild freedom as to see in it the elements of a rich and rounded picture the frame was still there but a short time since cracked and empty broken and gaping like those few others of the general overgrown scene that my late quest had puzzled out and this has somehow helped me to read back into it the old figures and the old long story told as with excellent art we knew the figures well while they lasted and had with them the happiest relation but without doing justice to their truth of outline their felicity of character and force of expression and function above all to the compositional harmony in which they moved that lives again to my considering eyes and i admire as never before the fine artistry of fate our cousins guardian the natural and the legal was his aunt his only one who was the cousin of our mother and our own aunt virtually our only one so far as a felt and adopted closeness of kinship went and the three daughters of two sole and muchunited sisters had been so brought up together as to have quite all the signs and accents of the same strain and the same nest the cousin helen of our young prospect was thus all but the sister helen of our mothers lifetime as was to happen and was scarcely less a stout brave presence and an emphasised character for the new generation than for the old noted here as she is in particular for her fine oldtime value of clearness and straightness i see in her strong simplicity that of an earlier quieter world a new york of better manners and better morals and homelier beliefs the very elements of some portrait by a grave dutch or other truthseeking master she looks out with some of the strong marks the anxious honesty the modest humour the folded resting hands the dark handsome serious attire the important composed cap almost the badge of a guild or an order that hang together about the images of past worthies of whichever sex who have had as one may say the courage of their character and qualify them for places in great collections i note with appreciation that she was strenuously actively good and have the liveliest impression both that no one was ever better and that her goodness somehow testifies for the whole tone of a society a remarkable cluster of private decencies her value to my imagination is even most of all perhaps in her mere local consistency her fine old new york ignorance and rigour her traditions scant but stiff had grown there close to herthey were all she needed and she lived by them candidly and stoutly that there have been persons so little doubtful of duty helps to show us how societies grow a proportionately small amount of absolute conviction about it will carry we thus make out a vast dead weight of mere comparative she was as anxious over hers indeed as if it had ever been in questionwhich is a proof perhaps that being void of imagination when you are quite entirely void makes scarcely more for comfort than having too much which only makes in a manner for a homeless freedom or even at the worst for a questioned veracity with a big installed conscience there is virtue in a grain of the figurative facultyit acts as oil to the stiff machine  yet this life of straight and narrow insistences seated so clearly in our view didnt take up all the room in the other house the house of the pictured the intermittent oliver though of the fewer books in general than ours and of the finer proportions and less peopled spaces there were but three persons to fill them as well as of the more turbaned and powdered family portraits one of these the most antique a french pastel which must have been charming of a young collateral ancestor who had died on the european tour a vast marginal range seemed to me on the contrary to surround the adolescent nephew who was some three years i judge beyond me in age and had other horizons and prospects than ours no question of europe for him but a patriotic preparation for acquaintance with the south and west or what was then called the westhe was to see his own country first winking at us while he did so though he was in spite of differences so nearly and naturally neighbourd and brotherd with us that the extensions of his range and the charms of his position counted somehow as the limits and the humilities of ours he went neither to our schools nor to our hotels but hovered out of our view in some other educational air that i cant now point to and had in a remote part of the state a vast wild property of his own known as the beaverkill to which so far from his aunts and his uncles taking him there he affably took them and to which also he vainly invited w j and me pointing thereby to us however though indirectly enough perhaps the finest childish case we were to know for the famous acceptance of the inevitable it was apparently not to be thought of that instead of the inevitable we should accept the invitation the place was in the wilderness incalculably distant reached by a whole days rough drive from the railroad through every danger of flood and field with prowling bears thrown in and probable loss of limb of which there were sad examples from swinging scythes and axes but we of course measured our privation just by those facts and grew up so far as we did then grow to believe that pleasures beyond price had been cruelly denied us i at any rate myself grew up sufficiently to wonder if poor alberts type as it developed to the anxious elder view from the first mightnt rather have undermined countenance his pleasant foolish face and odd shy air of being suspected or convicted on grounds less vague to himself than to us may well have appeared symptoms of the course of the rig he was eventually to run i could think of him but as the fils de famille ideally constituted not that i could then use for him that designation but that i felt he must belong to an important special class which he in fact formed in his own person everything was right truly for these felicitiesto speak of them only as dramatic or pictorial values since if we were present all the while at more of a drama than we knew so at least to my vague divination the scene and the figures were there not excluding the chorus and i must have had the instinct of their being as right as possible i see the actors move again through the high rather bedimmed roomsit is always a matter of winter twilight firelight lamplight each one appointed to his or her part and perfect for the picture which gave a sense of fulness without ever being crowded  that composition had to wait awhile in the earliest time to find its proper centre having been from the free point of view i thus cultivate a little encumbered by the presence of the most aged of our relatives the oldest person i remember to have familiarly knownif it can be called familiar to have stood off in fear of such strange proofs of accomplished time our greataunt wyckoff our maternal grandmothers elder sister i infer and an image of living antiquity as i figure her today that i was never to see surpassed i invest her in this vision with all the idolquality that may accrue to the venerablesolidly seated or even throned hooded and draped and tuckedin with big protective protrusive ears to her chair which helped it to the effect of a shrine and a large face in which the odd blackness of eyebrow and of a couple of other touches suggested the conventional marks of a painted image she signified her wants as divinities do for i recover from her presence neither sound nor stir remembering of her only that as described by her companions the pious ministrants she had said so and so when she hadnt spoken at all was she really as she seemed so tremendously old so old that her daughter our mothers cousin helen and ours would have had to come to her in middle life to account for it or did antiquity at that time set in earlier and was surrender of appearance and dress matching the intrinsic decay only more complacent more submissive and as who should say more abject i have my choice of these suppositions each in its way of so lively an interest that i scarce know which to prefer though inclining perhaps a little to the idea of the backward reach if aunt wyckoff was as i first remember her scarce more than seventy say the thought fills me with one sort of joy the joy of our modern our so generally greater and nobler effect of duration who wouldnt more subtly strive for that effect and intelligently so striving reach it better than such nonquestioners of fatethe moral of whose case is surely that if they gave up too soon and too softly we wiser witnesses can reverse the process and fight the whole ground but i apologise to the heavy shade in question if she had really drained her conceivable cup and for that matter rather like to suppose it so rich and strange is the pleasure of finding the pastthe past above allanswered for to ones own touch this being our only way to be sure of it it was the past that one touched in her the american past of a preponderant unthinkable queerness and great would seem the fortune of helping on the continuity at some other far end     x   it was at all events the good ladys disappearance that more markedly cleared the deckscleared them for that long slow sustained action with which i make out that nothing was afterwards to interfere she had sat there under her stiff old fathers portrait with which her own on the other side of the chimney mildly balanced but these presences acted from that time but with cautious reserves a brave finished cleareyed image of such properties as the lastnamed in particular our alreadymentioned alexander robertson a faint and diminished replica of whose picture the really fine original as i remember it having been long since perverted from our view i lately renewed acquaintance with in a pious institution of his founding where after more than one push northward and some easy accommodations he lives on into a world that knows him not and of some of the high improvements of which he can little enough have dreamed of the world he had personally known there was a feature or two still extant the legend of his acres and his local concerns as well as of his solid presence among them was considerably cherished by us though for ourselves personally the relics of his worth were a lean feast to sit at they were by some invidious turn of fate all to help to constitute the heritage of our young kinsman the orphaned and administered fils de famille whose father alexander wyckoff son of our greataunt and one of the two brothers of cousin helen just discernibly flushes for me through the ominous haze that preceded the worst visitation of cholera new york was to know alexander whom early widowed and a victim of that visitation i evoke as with something of a premature baldness of a blackness of short whisker of an expanse of light waistcoat and of a harmless pomp of manner appeared to have quite predominantly come in for the values in question which he promptly transmitted to his small motherless son and which were destined so greatly to increase there are clues i have only lost not making out in the least today why the sons of aunt wyckoff should have been so happily distinguished our greatuncle of the name isnt even a dim ghost to mehe had passed away beyond recall before i began to take notice but i hold rightly i feel that it was not to his person these advantages were attached they could have descended to our grandmother but in a minor degreewe should otherwise have been more closely aware of them it comes to me that so far as we had at all been aware it had mostly gone off in smoke i have still in my ears some rueful allusion to lands apparently in the general country of the beaverkill which had come to my mother and her sister as their share of their grandfather robertsons amplitude among the furtherapportioned shares of their four brothers only to be sacrificed later on at some scant appraisement it is in the nature of lands at a distance and in regions imperfectly reclaimed to be spoken of always as immense and i at any rate entertained the sense that we should have been great proprietors in the far wilderness if we had only taken more interest our interests were peculiarly urbanthough not indeed that this had helped us much something of the mystery of the vanished acres hung for me about my maternal uncle john walsh the only one who appeared to have been in respect to the dim possessions much on the spot but i too crudely failed of my chance of learning from him what had become of them  not that they had seen him poor gentleman very much further or that i had any strong sense of opportunity i catch at but two or three projections of him and only at one of his standing much at his ease i see him before the fire in the fourteenth street library sturdy with straight black hair and as if the beaverkill had rather stamped him but cleanshaven in a stock and a black frockcoati hear him perhaps still more than i see him deliver himself on the then great subject of jenny lind whom he seemed to have emerged from the wilderness to listen to and as to whom i remember thinking it strange small critic that i must have begun to be a note of the wilderness in him that he spoke of her as miss lind albeit i scarce know and must even less have known then what other form he could have used the rest of my sense of him is tinged with the ancient pitythat of our so exercised response in those years to the general sad case of uncles aunts and cousins obscurely afflicted the uncles in particular and untimely gathered sharp to me the memory of a call one dusky wintry sunday afternoon in clinton place at the house of my uncle robertson walsh then the head of my mothers family where the hapless younger brother lay dying whom i was taken to the top of the house to see and of the sinister twilight grimness of whose lot stretched there amid odours of tobacco and of drugs or of some especial strong drug in one of the chambers of what i remember as a remote and unfriended arching attic probably in fact the best place of prescribed quiet i was to carry away a fast impression all the uncles of whichever kindred were to come to seem sooner or later to be dying more or less before our eyes of melancholy matters and yet their general story so far as one could read it appeared the story of life i conceived at any rate that john walsh celibate lonely and goodnaturedly blackbrowed had been sacrificed to the faroff robertson acres which on their side had been sacrificed to i never knew what the point of my divagation however is that the barmecide banquet of another tract of the same provenance was always spread for us opposite the other house from which point it stretched on the north side of the street to sixth avenue though here we were soon to see it diminished at the corner by a structure afterwards known to us as our prosiest new york school this edifice devoted today to other uses but of the same ample insignificance still left for exploitation at that time an uncovered townterritory the transmitted tale of which was that our greatgrandfather living down near the battery had had his country villa or more strictly speaking his farm there with free expanses roundabout shrunken though the tract a part of it remainedin particular a space that i remember though with the last faintness to have seen appeal to the public as a teagarden or openair café a haunt of dance and song and of other forms of rather ineffective gaiety the subsequent conversion of the site into the premises of the french theatre i was to be able to note more distinctly resorting there in the winter of 18745 though not without some wan detachment to a series of more or less exotic performances and admiring in especial the high and hard virtuosity of madame ristori the unfailing instinct for the wrong emphasis of the then acclaimed mrs rousby i still hear the assured great woman great woman of a knowing friend met as i went out and the stout fidelity to a losing game as well as to a truth not quite measurable among us of the late the but lugubriouslycomic the blighted john toole  these are glimmering ghosts though that drama of the scene hard by at which i have glanced gives me back its agents with a finer intensity for the long action set in as i have hinted with the death of aunt wyckoff and if rather taking its time at first to develop maintained to the end which was in its full finality but a few years since the finest consistency and unity with cousin helen in rich prominence for the heroine with the pale adventurous albert for the hero or young protagonist a little indeed in the sense of a small new york orestes ridden by furies with a pair of confidants in the form first of the heroines highly respectable but quite negligible husband and second of her close friend and quasisister our own admirable aunt with alexanders younger brother above all the odd the eccentric the attaching henry for the stake as it were of the game so for the spectator did the figures distribute themselves the three principal on the large stageit became a field of such spreading interestswell in front and the accessory pair all sympathy and zeal prompt comment and rich resonance hovering in the background responsive to any call and on the spot at a sign this most particularly true indeed of our anything but detached aunt much less a passive recipient than a vessel constantly brimming and destined herself to become the outstanding agent almost the dea ex machina in the last act of the story her colleague of the earlier periods though to that title she would scarce have granted his right i designate rather as our earnest cousins husband than as our kinsman even by courtesy since he was mr to his own wife for whom the dread of liberties taken in general included even those that might have been allowed to herself he had not in the least like the others in his case married into the cousinship with us and this apparently rather by his defect than by ours his christian name if certainly not for use was scarce even for ornamentwhich consorted with the felt limits roundabout him of aids to mention and with the fact that no man could on his journey through life well have been less eagerly designated or apostrophised if there are persons as to whom the mr never comes up at all so there are those as to whom it never subsides but some of them all keep it by the greatness and others oddly enough by the smallness of their importance the subject of my present reference as i think of him neverthelessby which i mean in spite of his place in the latter groupgreatly helps my documentation he must have been of so excellent and consistent a shade of nullity to that value if value it be there almost always attaches some question of the degree and the position with adjuncts with a relation the zero may figure as a numeraland the neglected zero is mostly for that matter endowed with a consciousness and subject to irritation for this dim little gentleman so perfectly a gentleman no appeal and no redress from the beginning to the end of his career were made or entertained or projected no question of how to treat him or of how he might see it or feel it could ever possibly rise he was blank from whatever view remaining so under application of whatever acid or exposure to whatever heat the one identity he could have was to be part of the consensus  such a case is rarethat of being no case at all that of not having even the interest of the grievance of not being one we as a rule catch glimpses in the downtrodden of such resentmentsthey have at least sometimes the importance of feeling the weight of our tread the phenomenon was here quite otherthat of a natural platitude that had never risen to the level of sensibility when you have been wronged you can be righted when you have suffered you can be soothed if you have that amount of grasp of the scene however humble the drama of your life to some extent enacts itself with the logical consequence of your being proportionately its hero and having to be taken for such let me not dream of attempting to say for what cousin helen took her spectral spouse though i think it the most marked touch in her portrait that she kept us from ever knowing she was a person about whom you knew everything else but there she was genially inscrutable and above all claimed no damages on the score of slights offered him she knew nothing whatever of these yet could herself be much wounded or hurtwhich latter word she sounded in the wondrous old new york manner so irreducible to notation she covered the whole case with a mantle which was yet much more probably that of her real simplicity than of a feigned unconsciousness i doubt whether she knew that men could be amiable in a different manner from that which had to serve her for supposing her husband amiable when the mould and the men cast in it were very different she failed or at least she feared to conclude to amiabilitythough some women as different themselves as such stranger men might take it for that directly interrogated she might such was the innocence of these longextinct manners have approved of male society in stronger doses or more vivid huessave where consanguinity or indeed relationship by marriage to which she greatly deferred had honestly imposed it the singular thing for the drama to which i return was that there it was just consanguinity that had made the burden difficult and strange and of a nature to call on great decisions and patient plans even though the most ominous possibilities were not involved i reconstruct and reconstruct of course but the elements had to my childish vision at least nothing at all portentous if any light of the lurid played in for me just a little it was but under much later information what my childish vision was really most possessed of i think was the figure of the spectral spouse the dim little gentleman as i have called him pacing the whole length of the two big parlours in prolonged repetition much as if they had been the deck of one of those ships anciently haunted by him as supercargo or whatever in strange far seasaccording to the only legend connected with him save that of his early presumption in having approached such as he was so fine a young woman and his remarkable luck in having approached her successfully a luck surprisingly renewed for him since it was also part of the legend that he had previously married and lost a bride beyond his deserts     xi   i am strictly speaking at this point on a visit to albert who at times sociably condescended to my fewer yearsi still appreciate the manoftheworld ease of it but my host seems for the minute to have left me and i am attached but to the rich perspective in which uncle for albert too he was only all namelessly uncle comes and goes out of the comparative high brownness of the back room commanding brave extensions as i thought them a covered piazza over which in season isabella grapes accessibly clustered and beyond which stretched further a yard that was as an ample garden compared to ours at home i keep in view his little rounded back at the base of which his arms are interlocked behind him and i know how his bald head yet with the hair bristling up almost in shorthorn fashion at the sides is thrust inquiringly not to say appealingly forward i assist at his emergence where the fine old mahogany doors of separation are rolled back on what used to seem to me silver wheels into the brighter yet colder half of the scene and attend him while he at last looks out awhile into fourteenth street for news of whatever may be remarkably objectionably or mercifully taking place there and then i await his regular return preparatory to a renewed advance far from indifferent as i innocently am to his discoveries or his comments it is cousin helen however who preferentially takes them up attaching to them the right importance which is for the moment the very greatest that could possibly be attached to anything in the world i for my part occupied with those marks of character in our pacing companionhis long slightly equine countenance his eyebrows ever elevated as in the curiosity of alarm and the so limited play from side to side of his extremely protrusive head as if somehow through tightness of the wash neckcloths that he habitually wore and that wound and rewound in their successive stages made his neck very long without making it in the least thick and reached their climax in a proportionately very small knot tied with the neatest art i scarce can have known at the time that this was as complete a little oldworld figure as any that might then have been noted there far or near yet if i didnt somehow subtly feel it why am i now so convinced that i must have had familiarly before me a masterpiece of the great daumier say or henri monnier or any other then contemporary projector of monsieur prudhomme the timorous philistine in a world of dangers with whom i was later on to make acquaintance i put myself the question of scant importance though it may seem but there is a reflection perhaps more timely than any answer to it i catch myself in the act of seeing poor anonymous dear as cousin helen confined herself her life long to calling him in the light of an image arrested by the french genius and this in truth opens up vistas i scarce know what it doesnt suggest for the fact of sharpness of intensity of type which fact in turn leads my imagination almost any dance making me ask myself quite most of all whether a person so marked by it mustnt really have been a highly finished figure  that degree of finish was surely rare among usrare at a time when the charm of so much of the cousinship and the uncleship the kinship generally had to be found in their so engagingly dispensing with any finish at all they happened to be amiable to be delightful buti think i have already put the questionwhat would have become of us all if they hadnt been a question the shudder of which could never have been suggested by the presence i am considering he too was gentle and bland as it happenedand i indeed see it all as a world quite unfavourable to arrogance or insolence or any hard and high assumption but the more i think of him even at the risk of thinking too much the more i make out in him a tone and a manner that deprecated crude ease plenty of this was already in the air but if he hadnt so spoken of an order in which forms still counted it might scarce have occurred to one that there had ever been any it comes over me therefore that he testifiedand perhaps quite beautifully i remember his voice and his speech which were not those of that new york at all and with the echo faint as it is arrives the wonder of where he could possibly have picked such things up they were as forms adjusted and settled things from what finer civilisation therefore had they come down to him to brood on this the least little bit is verily as i have said to open up vistasout of the depths of one of which fairly glimmers the queerest of questions maynt we accordingly have been the rest of us all wrong and the dim little gentleman the only one among us who was right may not his truth to type have been a matter that as mostly typeless ourselves we neither perceived nor appreciatedso that if as is conceivable he felt and measured the situation and simply chose to be bland and quiet and keep his sense to himself he was a hero without the laurel as well as a martyr without the crown the light of which possibility is however too fierce i turn it off i tear myself from the viewnoting further but the one fact in his history that by my glimpse of it quite escapes ambiguity the youthful albert i have mentioned was to resist successfully through those years that solicitation of europe our own response to which both as a general and a particular solution kept breaking out in choral wails but the other house none the less nourished projects so earnest that they could invoke the dignity of comparative silence and patience the other house didnt aspire to the tongues but it aspired to the grand tour of which ours was on many grounds incapable only after years and when endless things had happenedalbert having long before in especial quite taken up his stake and ostensibly dropped out of the gamedid the great adventure get itself enacted with the effect of one of the liveliest illustrations of the irony of fate what had most of all flushed through the dream of it during years was the legend at last quite antediluvian of the dim little gentlemans early wanderjahre that experience of distant lands and seas which would find an application none the less lively for having had long to wait it had had to wait in truth half a century yet its confidence had apparently not been impaired when new york on the happy day began to recede from view europe had surprises none the less and who knows to what extent it may after half a century have had shocks the coming true of the old dream produced at any rate a snap of the tense cord and the ancient worthy my imagination has in the tenderest of intentions thus played with disembarked in england only to indulge in the last of his startled stares only to look about him in vague deprecation and give it all up he just landed and died but the grand tour was none the less proceeded withcousin helen herself aided by resources personal social and financial that left nothing to desire triumphantly performed it though as with a feeling of delicacy about it firmly overcome  but it has taken me quite out of the other house so that i patch up again at a stroke that early scene of her double guardianship at which my small wonder assisted it even then glimmered on me i think that if albert was all so romantically in charge of his auntwhich was a perfectly nondescript relationso his uncle henry her odd brother was her more or less legal ward not less despite his being so very much alberts senior in these facts and in the character of each of the three persons involved resided the drama which must more or less have begun as i have hinted when simpleminded henry at a date i seem to have seized definitely emerged from rusticationthe beaverkill had but for a certain term protected or promoted his simplicityand began on his side to pace the wellworn field between the fourteenth street windows and the piazza of the isabella grapes i see him there less vividly than his fellowpedestrian only because he was afterwards to loom so much larger whereas his companion even while still present was weakly to shrink and fade at this late day only do i devise for that companion a possible history the simpleminded henrys annals on the other hand grew in interest as soon as they became interesting at all this happened as soon as one took in the ground and some of the features of his tutelage the basis of it all was that harmless as he appeared he was not to be trusted i remember how portentous that truth soon looked both in the light of his intense amiability and of sister helens absolute certitude he wasnt to be trustedit was the sole very definite fact about him except the fact that he had so kindly come down from the faroff beaverkill to regale us with the perfect demonstration dutifully resignedly setting himself among us to point the whole moral himself he appeared from the moment we really took it in to be doing in the matter no more than he ought he exposed himself to our invidious gaze on this ground with a humility a quiet courtesy and an instinctive dignity that come back to me as simply heroic he had himself accepted under strenuous suggestion the dreadful view and i see him today in the light of the grand dénouement deferred for long years but fairly dazzling when it came as fairly sublime in his decision not to put anyone in the wrong about him a day sooner than he could possibly help the whole circle of us would in that event be so dreadfully sold as to our wisdom and justice he proving only noble and exquisite it didnt so immensely matter to him as that the establishment of his true character didnt so he went on as if for all the yearsand they really piled themselves up his passing for a dangerous idiot or at least for a slave of his passions from the moment he was allowed the wherewithal in the least to indulge them was a less evil for him than seeing us rudely corrected it was in truth an extraordinary situation and would have offered a splendid subject as we used to say to the painter of character the novelist or the dramatist with the hand to treat it after i had read david copperfield an analogy glimmeredit struck me even in the early time cousin henry was more or less another mr dick just as cousin helen was in her relation to him more or less another miss trotwood there were disparities indeed mr dick was the harmless lunatic on that ladys premises but she admired him and appealed to him lunatics in her generous view might be oracles and there is no evidence if i correctly remember that she kept him low our mr dick was suffered to indulge his passions but on ten cents a day while his fortune under conscientious under admirable carecousin helen being no less the wise and keen woman of business than the devoted sisterrolled up and became large likewise miss trotwoods inmate hadnt at all the perplexed brooding brow with the troubled fold in it that represented poor henrys only form of criticism of adverse fate they had alike the large smooth open countenance of those for whom life has been simplified and if mr dick had had a fortune he would have remained all his days as modestly vague about the figure of it as our relative consented to remain the latters interests were agricultural while his predecessors as we remember were mainly historical each at any rate had in a general way his miss trotwood not to say his sister helen  the good henrys miss trotwood lived and died without an instants visitation of doubt as to the due exercise of her authority as to what would happen if it faltered her victim waiting in the handsomest manner till she had passed away to show us allall who remained after so long to do him justicethat nothing but what was charming and touching could possibly happen this was in part at least the dazzling dénouement i have spoken of he became as soon as fortunate dispositions could take effect the care of our admirable aunt between whom and his sister and himself close cousinship from far back had practically amounted to sisterhood by which time the other house had long been another house altogether its ancient site relinquished its contents planted afresh far northward with new traditions invoked though with that of its great friendliness to all of us for our mothers sake still confirmed here with brief brightness clouded at the very last the solution emerged we became aware not without embarrassment that poor henry at large and supplied with funds was exactly as harmless and blameless as poor henry stinted and captive as to which if anything had been wanting to our confusion or to his own dignity it would have been his supreme abstinence his suppression of the least didnt i tell you he didnt even pretend to have told us when he so abundantly might and nothing could exceed the grace with which he appeared to have noticed nothing he handled dollars as decently and just as profusely as he had handled dimes the only light shade on the sceneexcept of course for its being so belated which did make it pathetically dimwas the question of how nearly he at all measured his resources not his heart but his imagination in the long years had been starved and though he was now all discreetly and wisely encouraged to feel rich it was rather sadly visible that thanks to almost half a century of overdiscipline he failed quite to rise to his estate he did feel rich just as he felt generous the misfortune was only in his weak sense for meanings that with the whole situation made delicacy of the first importance as indeed what was perhaps most striking in the entire connection was the part played by delicacy from the first it had all been a drama of the delicate the consummately scrupulous and successful administration of his resources for the benefit of his virtue so that they could be handed over in the event without the leakage of a fraction what was that but a triumph of delicacy so delicacy conspired delicacy surrounded him the case having been from the early time that could he only be regarded as sufficiently responsible could the sources of his bounty be judged fairly open to light pressure there was question of none but the lightest that bounty might blessedly flow this had been miss trotwoods own enlightened view on behalf of one of the oddest and most appealing collections of wistful wondering single gentlewomen that a great calculating benevolence perhaps ever found arrayed before itornaments these all of the second and third cousinship and interested spectators of the almost inexpressible facts  i should have liked completely to express them in spite of the difficultyif not indeed just by reason of that the difficulty of their consisting so much more of character than of incident heaven save the artless opposition though this last element figured bravely enough too thanks to some of the forms taken by our young alberts wild wilfulness he was so weakafter the most approved fashion of distressing young men of meansthat his successive exhibitions of it had a fine high positive effect such as would have served beautifully act after act for the descent of the curtain the issue however differing in this from the common theatrical trick depended less on who should die than on who should live the younger of cousin helens pair of wardsputting them even only as vessels of her attempted earnestnesshad violently broken away but a remedy to this grief for reasons too many to tell dwelt in the possible duration could it only not be arrested of two other lives one of these her own the second the guileless henrys the single gentlewomen to a remarkable number whom she regarded and treated as nieces though they were only daughters of cousins were such objects of her tender solicitude that she and henry and albert being alike childless the delightful thing to think of was on certain contingencies the nieces prospective wealth there were contingencies of courseand they exactly produced the pity and terror her estate would go at her death to her nearest of kin represented by her brother and nephew it would be only of her savingsfortunately with her kind eye on the gentlewomen zealous and long continuedthat she might dispose by will and it was but a troubled comfort that should he be living at the time of her death the susceptible henry would profit no less than the wanton albert henry was at any cost to be kept in life that he might profit the woeful question the question of delicacy for a woman devoutly conscientious was how could anyone else how above all could fifteen other persons be made to profit by his profiting she had been as earnest a steward of her brothers fortune as if directness of pressure on him in a sense favourable to her intereststhat is to her sympathies which were her only interestshad been a matter of course with her whereas in fact she would have held it a crime given his simplicity to attempt in the least to guide his hand if he didnt outlive his nephewand he was older though as would appear so much more virtuoushis inherited property she being dead would accrue to that unedifying person there was the pity and as for the question of the disposition of henrys savings without the initiative of henrys intelligence in that alas was the terror henrys savingsthere had been no terror for her naturally in beautifully husbanding his resources for himdangled naturally with no small vividness before the wistful gentlewomen to whom if he had but had the initiative he might have made the most princely presents such was the oddity not to say the rather tragic drollery of the situation that henrys idea of a present was ten cents worth of popcorn or some similar homely trifle and that when one had created for him a world of these proportions there was no honest way of inspiring him to write cheques for hundreds all congruous though these would be with the generosity of his nature as shown by the exuberance of his popcorn the ideal solution would be his flashing to intelligence just long enough to apprehend the case and of his own magnanimous movement sign away everything but that was a fairytale stroke and the fairies here somehow stood off  thus between the wealth of her earnestness and the poverty of her courageher dread that is of exposing herself to a legal process for undue influenceour good lady was not at peace or to be exact was only at such peace as came to her by the free bestowal of her own accumulations during her lifetime and after her death she predeceased her brother and had the pang of feeling that if half her residuum would be deplorably diverted the other half would be by the same stroke imperfectly applied the artless henry remained at once so well provided and so dimly inspired here was suspense indeed for a last curtain but one and my fancy glows all expertly for the disclosure of the final scene than which nothing could well have been happier on all the premises save for a single flaw the installation in fortyfourth street of our admirable aunt often through the later years domiciled there but now settled to community of life with a touching charge and representing near him his extinguished their extinguished sister the too few years that followed were the good mans indian summer and a very wonderful timeso charmingly it shone forth for all concerned that he was a person fitted to adorn as the phrase is almost any position our admirable aunt not less devoted and less disinterested than his former protectress had yet much more imagination she had enough in a word for perfect confidence and under confidence what remained of poor henrys life bloomed like a garden freshly watered sad alas the fact that so scant a patch was now left it sufficed however and he rose just in time to every conception it was as i have already noted as if he had all the while known as if he had really been a conscious victim to the superstition of his blackness his final companion recognised as it were his powers and it may be imagined whether when he absolutely himself proposed to benefit the gentlewomen she passed him or not the blessed pen he had taken a year or two to publish by his behaviour the perfection of his civility and so on that safe ground made use of the pen his competence was afterwards attacked and it emerged triumphant exactly as his perfect charity and humility and amenity and his long inward loneliness of half a century did he had bowed his head and sometimes softly scratched it during that immense period he had occasionally after roaming downstairs with the troubled fold in his brow and the difficult the smothered statement on his lips his vocabulary was scant and stiff the vocabulary of pleading explanation often found too complicated by the witty retired once more to his room sometimes indeed for hours to think it all over again but had never failed of sobriety or propriety or punctuality or regularity never failed of one of the virtues his imputed indifference to which had been the ground of his discipline it was very extraordinary and of all the stories i know is i think the most beautifulso far at least as he was concerned the flaw i have mentioned the one break in the final harmony was the death of our admirable aunt too soon shortly before his own and while taken with illness at the same time he lay there deprived of her attention he had that of the gentlewomen however two or three of the wisest and tenderest being deputed by the others and if his original estate reverted at law they presently none the less had occasion to bless his name     xii   i turn round again to where i last left myself gaping at the old ricketty billboard in fifth avenue and am almost as sharply aware as ever of the main source of its spell the fact that it most often blazed with the rich appeal of mr barnum whose lectureroom attached to the great american museum overflowed into posters of all the theatrical bravery disavowed by its title it was my rueful theory of those daysthough tasteful i may call it too as well as ruefulthat on all the holidays on which we werent dragged to the dentists we attended as a matter of course at barnums that is when we were so happy as to be able to which to my own particular consciousness wasnt every time the case the case was too often to my melancholy view that w j quite regularly on the nondental saturdays repaired to this seat of joy with the easy alberthe at home there and master of the scene to a degree at which somehow neither of us could at the best arrive he quite moulded truly in those years of plasticity as to the æsthetic bent and the determination of curiosity i seem to make out by the general barnum association and revelation it was not i hasten to add that i too didnt to the extent of my minor chance drink at the spring for how else should i have come by the whole undimmed sense of the connectionthe weary waiting in the dusty halls of humbug amid bottled mermaids bearded ladies and chill dioramas for the lectureroom the true centre of the seat of joy to open vivid in especial to me is my almost sick wondering of whether i mightnt be rapt away before it did open the impression appears to have been mixed the drinking deep and the holding out holding out in particular against failure of food and of stagefares provision for transport to and fro being questions equally intense the appeal of the lectureroom in its essence a heavy extra so exhausted our resources that even the sustaining doughnut of the refreshmentcounter would mock our desire and the long homeward crawl the length of broadway and further seem to defy repetition those desperate days none the less affect me now as having flushed with the very complexion of romance their aches and inanitions were part of the adventure the homeward straggle interminable as it appeared flowered at moments into rapt contemplationsthat for instance of the painted portrait large as life of the celebrity of the hour then dancing at the broadway theatre lola montes countess of lansfeldt of a dazzling and unreal beauty and in a ridinghabit lavishly open at the throat  it was thus quite in order that i should pore longest there at my fondest corner over the barnum announcementsmy present inability to be superficial about which has given in fact the measure of my contemporary care these announcements must have been in their way marvels of attractive composition the placard bristling from top to toe with its analytic synopsis of scenery and incidents the synoptical view cast its net of fine meshes and the very word savoured of incantation it is odd at the same time that when i question memory as to the living hours themselves those of the stuffed and dim little hall of audience smelling of peppermint and orangepeel where the curtain rose on our gasping but rewarded patience two performances only stand out for me though these in the highest relief love or the countess and the serf by j sheridan knowlesi see that still as the blazonry of one of them just as i see miss emily mestayer large red in the face coifed in a tangle of small fine damplooking short curls and clad in a lightblue garment edged with swansdown shout at the top of her lungs that a purrrse of gold would be the fair guerdon of the minion who should start on the spot to do her bidding at some desperate crisis that i forget i forget huon the serf whom i yet recall immensely admiring for his nobleness i forget everyone but miss mestayer who gave form to my conception of the tragic actress at her highest she had a hooked nose a great play of nostril a vast protuberance of bosom and always the crop of close moist ringlets i say always for i was to see her often again during a much later phase the midmost years of that boston museum which aimed at so vastly higher a distinction than the exploded lectureroom had really done though in an age that snickered even abnormally low it still lacked the courage to call itself a theatre she must have been in comedy which i believe she also usefully and fearlessly practised rather unimaginable but there was no one like her in the boston time for cursing queens and eaglebeaked mothers the shakespeare of the booths and other such would have been unproducible without her she had a rusty rasping heaving and tossing authority of which the bitterness is still in my ears i am revisited by an outer glimpse of her in that after age when she had come comparatively speaking into her ownthe sight of her accidentally incurred one tremendously hot summer night as she slowly moved from her lodgings or wherever in the high bowdoin street region down to the not distant theatre from which even the temperature had given her no reprieve and well remember how the queer light of my young impression playing up again in her path she struck me as the very image of mere sore histrionic habit and use a worn and weary a battered even though almost sordidly smoothed thing of the theatre very much as an old infinitelyhandled and greasy violoncello of the orchestra might have been it was but an effect doubtless of the heat that she scarcely seemed clad at all slippered shuffling and though somehow hatted and vaguely veiled or streamered wrapt in a gauzy sketch of a dressinggown she pointed to my extravagant attention the moral of thankless personal service of the reverse of the picture of the cost of amusing the public in a case of amusing it as who should say every hour and i had thrilled before her as the countess in lovesuch contrasted combinations but she carried her head very high as with the habit of crowns and trains and tiradeshad in fact much the air of some deposed and reduced sovereign living on a scant allowance so that all invisibly and compassionately i took off my hat to her  to which i must add the other of my two barnumite scenic memories my having anciently admired her as the eliza of uncle toms cabin her swelling bust encased in a neat cotton gown and her flight across the iceblocks of the ohio if i rightly remember the perilous stream intrepidly and gracefully performed we lived and moved at that time with great intensity in mrs stowes novelwhich recalling my prompt and charmed acquaintance with it i should perhaps substitute for the initials earlier mentioned here as my first experiment in grownup fiction there was however i think for that triumphant work no classified condition it was for no sort of reader as distinct from any other sort save indeed for northern as differing from southern it knew the large felicity of gathering in alike the small and the simple and the big and the wise and had above all the extraordinary fortune of finding itself for an immense number of people much less a book than a state of vision of feeling and of consciousness in which they didnt sit and read and appraise and pass the time but walked and talked and laughed and cried and in a manner of which mrs stowe was the irresistible cause generally conducted themselves appreciation and judgment the whole impression were thus an effect for which there had been no processany process so related having in other cases had to be at some point or other critical nothing in the guise of a written book therefore a book printed published sold bought and noticed probably ever reached its mark the mark of exciting interest without having at least groped for that goal as a book or by the exposure of some literary side letters here languished unconscious and uncle tom instead of making even one of the cheap short cuts through the medium in which books breathe even as fishes in water went gaily roundabout it altogether as if a fish a wonderful leaping fish had simply flown through the air this feat accomplished the surprising creature could naturally fly anywhere and one of the first things it did was thus to flutter down on every stage literally without exception in america and europe if the amount of life represented in such a work is measurable by the ease with which representation is taken up and carried further carried even violently furthest the fate of mrs stowes picture was conclusive it simply sat down wherever it lighted and made itself so to speak at home thither multitudes flocked afresh and there in each case it rose to its height again and went with all its vivacity and good faith through all its motions  these latter were to leave me however with a fonder vision still than that of the comparatively jejune lectureroom version for the first exhibition of them to spring to the front was the fine free rendering achieved at a playhouse till then ignored by fashion and culture the national theatre deep down on the east side whence echoes had come faintest to ears polite but where a sincerity vivid though rude was now supposed to reward the curious our numerous attendance there under this spell was my first experience of the theatre party as we have enjoyed it in our timeeach emotion and impression of which is as fresh to me as the most recent of the same family precious through all indeed perhaps is the sense strange only to later sophistication of my small encouraged state as a free playgoera state doubly wondrous while i thus evoke the full contingent from union square where for that matter i think the wild evening must have been planned i am lost again in all the goodnature from which small boys on wild evenings could dangle so unchiddensince the state of unchiddenness is what comes back to me wellnigh clearest how without that complacency of conscience could every felt impression so live again it is true that for my present sense of the matter snubs and raps would still tingle would count double just wherefore it is exactly however that i mirror myself in these depths of propriety the social scheme as we knew it was in its careless charity worthy of the golden agethough i cant sufficiently repeat that we knew it both at its easiest and its safest the fruits dropped right upon the board to which we flocked together the least of us and the greatest with differences of appetite and of reach doubtless but not with differences of place and of proportionate share my appetite and my reach in respect to the more fullbodied uncle tom might have brooked certainly any comparison i must have partaken thoroughly of the feast to have left the various aftertastes so separate and so strong it was a great thing to have a canon to judge byit helped conscious criticism which was to fit on wings for use ever after to the shoulders of appreciation in the light of that advantage i could be sure my second eliza was less dramatic than my first and that my first cassy that of the great and bloodcurdling mrs bellamy of the lectureroom touched depths which made the lady at the national prosaic and placid i could already be down on a placid cassy just as on the other hand the rocking of the icefloes of the ohio with the desperate eliza infant in arms balancing for a leap from one to the other had here less of the audible creak of carpentry emulated a trifle more to my perception the real water of mr crummless pump they cant even at that have emulated it much and one almost envies quite making up ones mind not to denounce the simple faith of an age beguiled by arts so rude  however the point exactly was that we attended this spectacle just in order not to be beguiled just in order to enjoy with ironic detachment and at the very most to be amused ourselves at our sensibility should it prove to have been trapped and caught to have become thus aware of our collective attitude constituted for one small spectator at least a great initiation he got his first glimpse of that possibility of a free play of mind over a subject which was to throw him with force at a later stage of culture when subjects had considerably multiplied into the critical arms of matthew arnold so he is himself at least interested in seeing the matteras a progress in which the first step was taken before that crude scenic appeal by his wondering among his companions where the absurd the absurd for them ended and the fun the real fun which was the gravity the tragedy the drollery the beauty the thing itself briefly might be legitimately and tastefully held to begin uncanny though the remark perhaps i am not sure i wasnt thus more interested in the pulse of our party under my tiny recording thumb than in the beat of the drama and the shock of its opposed forcesvivid and touching as the contrast was then found for instance between the tragicomical topsy the slavegirl clad in a pinafore of sackcloth and destined to become for anglosaxon millions the type of the absolute in the artless and her little mistress the blonde eva a figure rather in the kenwigs tradition of pantalettes and pigtails whom i recall as perching quite suicidally with her elbows out and a preliminary shriek on that bulwark of the mississippi steamboat which was to facilitate her all but fatal immersion in the flood why should i have duly noted that no little game on her part could well less have resembled or simulated an accident and yet have been no less moved by her reappearance rescued from the river but perfectly dry in the arms of faithful tom who had plunged in to save her without either so much as wetting his shoes than if i had been engaged with her in a reckless romp i could count the white stitches in the loose patchwork and yet could take it for a story rich and harmonious i could know we had all intellectually condescended and that we had yet had the thrill of an æsthetic adventure and this was a brave beginning for a consciousness that was to be nothing if not mixed and a curiosity that was to be nothing if not restless  the principle of this prolonged arrest which i insist on prolonging a little further is doubtless in my instinct to grope for our earliest æsthetic seeds careless at once and generous the hands by which they were sown but practically appointed none the less to cause that peculiarly flurried hare to runflurried because over ground so little native to itwhen so many others held back is it that air of romance that gilds for me then the barnum backgroundtaking it as a symbol that makes me resist to this effect of a passionate adverse loyalty any impulse to translate into harsh terms any old sordidities and poverties the great american museum the downtown scenery and aspects at large and even the uptown improvements on them as then flourishingwhy they must have been for the most part of the last meanness the barnum picture above all ignoble and awful its blatant face or frame stuck about with innumerable flags that waved poor vulgarsized ensigns over spurious relics and catchpenny monsters in effigy to say nothing of the promise within of the still more monstrous and abnormal livingfrom the total impression of which things we plucked somehow the flower of the ideal it grew i must in justice proceed much more sweetly and naturally at niblos which represented in our scheme the ideal evening while barnum figured the ideal day so that i ask myself with that sense of our resorting there under the rich cover of night which was the supreme charm how it comes that this larger memory hasnt swallowed up all others for here absolutely was the flower at its finest and grown as nowhere elsegrown in the great garden of the ravel family and offered again and again to our deep inhalation i see the ravels french acrobats dancers and pantomimists as representing for our culture pure grace and charm and civility so that one doubts whether any candid community was ever so much in debt to a race of entertainers or had so happy and prolonged so personal and grateful a relation with them they must have been with their offshoots of martinettis and others of three or four generations besides being of a rich theatrical stock generally and we had our particular friends and favourites among them we seemed to follow them through every phase of their career to assist at their tottering steps along the tightrope as very small children kept in equilibrium by very big balancingpoles caretakers here walking under in case of falls to greet them as madame axel of robust maturity and in a spanish costume bounding on the same tense cord more heavily but more assuredly and finally to know the climax of the art with them in raoul or the nightowl and jocko or the brazilian apeand all this in the course of our own brief infancy my impression of them bristles so with memories that we seem to have rallied to their different productions with much the same regularity with which we formed fresh educational connections and they were so much our property and our pride that they supported us handsomely through all fluttered entertainment of the occasional albany cousins i remember how when one of these visitors wound up in honour of new york to the very fever of perception broke out one evening while we waited for the curtain to rise oh dont you hear the cries theyre beating them im sure they are cant it be stopped we resented the charge as a slur on our very honour for what our romantic relative had heatedly imagined to reach us in a hushedup manner from behind was the sounds attendant on the application of blows to some acrobatic infant who had funked his little job impossible such horrors in the world of pure poetry opened out to us at niblos a temple of illusion of tragedy and comedy and pathos that though its abords of stony brown metropolitan hotel on the wrong side must have been bleak and vulgar flung its glamour forth into broadway what more pathetic for instance so that we publicly wept than the fate of wondrous martinetti jocko who after befriending a hapless french family wrecked on the coast of brazil and bringing back to life a small boy rescued from the waves i see even now with every detail this inanimate victim supine on the strand met his death by some cruel bullet of which i have forgotten the determinant cause only remembering the final agony as something we could scarce bear and a strain of our sensibility to which our parents repeatedly questioned the wisdom of exposing us  these performers and these things were in all probability but of a middling skill and splendourit was the pretrapèze age and we were caught by mild marvels even if a friendly good faith in them something sweet and sympathetic was after all a value whether of their own humanity their own special quality or only of our innocence never to be renewed but i light this taper to the initiators so to call them whom i remembered when we had left them behind as if they had given us a silver key to carry off and so to refit after long years to sweet names never thought of from then till now signor léon javelli in whom the french and the italian charm appear to have met who was he and what did he brilliantly do and why of a sudden do i thus recall and admire him i am afraid he but danced the tightrope the most domestic of our friends resources as it brought them out by the far stretch of the rope into the bosom of the house and against our very hearts where they leapt and bounded and wavered and recovered closely face to face with us but i dare say he bounded brave signor léon to the greatest height of all let this vague agility in any case connect him with that revelation of the ballet the sentimentalpastoral of other years which in the four lovers for example a pantomimic lesson as in words of one syllable but all quick and gay and droll would have affected us as classic i am sure had we then had at our disposal that term of appreciation when we read in english storybooks about the pantomimes in london which somehow cropped up in them so often those were the only things that didnt make us yearn so much we felt we were masters of the type and so almost sufficiently was that a stopgap for london constantly deferred we hadnt the transformationscene it was true though what this really seemed to come to was clown and harlequin taking liberties with policementhese last evidently a sharp note in a picturesqueness that we lacked our own slouchy officers saying nothing to us of that sort but we had at niblos harlequin and columbine albeit of less pure a tradition and we knew moreover all about clowns for we went to circuses too and so repeatedly that when i add them to our list of recreations the good old orthodox circuses under tents set up in vacant lots with which new york appears at that time to have bristled time and place would seem to have shrunken for most other pursuits and not least for that of serious learning and the case is aggravated as i remember franconis which we more or less haunted and which aiming at the grander style and the monumental effect blazed with fresh paint and rang with roman chariotraces up there among the deserts of twentyninth street or wherever considerably south perhaps but only a little east of the vaster desolations that gave scope to the crystal palace second of its name since followingnot passibus æquis alasthe london structure of 1851 this enterprise forestalled by a year or two the paris palais de lindustrie of 1855 such as it was i feel again its majesty on those occasions on which i draggedif i must here once more speak for myself onlyafter albany cousins through its courts of edification i remember being very tired and cold and hungry there in a little light drab and very glossy or shiny talma breasted with rather troublesome buttonholeembroideries though concomitantly conscious that i was somehow in europe since everything about me had been brought over which ought to have been consoling and seems in fact to have been so in some degree inasmuch as both my own pain and the sense of the cousinly the albany headaches quite fade in that recovered presence of big european art embodied in thorwaldsens enormous christ and the disciples a shining marble company ranged in a semicircle of dark maroon walls if this was europe then europe was beautiful indeed and we rose to it on the wings of wonder never were we afterwards to see great showy sculpture in whatever profuse exhibition or of whatever period or school without some renewal of that charmed thorwaldsen hour some taste again of the almost sugary or confectionery sweetness with which the great white images had affected us under their suppertable gaslight the crystal palace was vast and various and dense which was what europe was going to be it was a deepdown jungle of impressions that were somehow challenges even as we might helplessly defied find foreign words and practices over which formidably towered kisss mounted amazon attacked by a leopard or whatever a work judged at that day sublime and the glory of the place so that i felt the journey back in the autumn dusk and the sixth avenue cars established just in time a relapse into soothing flatness a return to the fourteenth street horizon from a far journey and a hundred looming questions that would still tremendous thought come up for all the personal answers of which one cultivated the seed     xiii   let me hurry however to catch again that thread i left dangling from my glance at our small vague spasms of schoolmy personal sense of them being as vague and small i mean in contrast with the fuller and stronger cup meted out all round to the albany cousins much more privileged i felt in every stroke of fortune or at least much more interesting though it might be wicked to call them more happy through those numberless bereavements that had so enriched their existence i mentioned above in particular the enviable consciousness of our little redheaded kinsman gus barker who as by a sharp prevision snatched what gaiety he might from a life to be cut short in a cavalry dash by one of the confederate bullets of 1863 he blew out at us on new york sundays as i have said sharp puffs of the atmosphere of the institution charlierstrong to us that is the atmosphere of whose institutions was weak but it was above all during a gregarious visit paid him in a livelier field still that i knew myself merely motherd and brotherd it had been his fate to be but scantly the latter and never at all the formerour aunt janet had not survived his birth but on this day of our collective pilgrimage to singsing where he was at a military school and clad in a fashion that represented to me the very panoply of war he shone with a rare radiance of privation ingenuous and responsive of a social disposition a candour of gaiety that matched his physical activitythe most beautifully made athletic little person and in the highest degree appealing and engaginghe not only did us the honours of his dazzling academy dazzling at least to me but had all the air of showing us over the great state prison which even then flourished near at hand and to which he accompanied us a party of a composition that comes back to me as wonderful the new york and albany cousinships appearing to have converged and met for the happy occasion with the generations and sexes melting together and moving in a loose harmonious band the party must have been less numerous than by the romantic tradition or confused notation of my youth and what i mainly remember of it beyond my sense of our being at once an attendant train to my aged and gentle and in general most unadventurous grandmother and a chorus of curiosity and amusement roundabout the vivid gussy is our collective impression that state prisons were on the whole delightful places vast bright and breezy with a gay free circulation in corridors and on stairs a pleasant prevalence of hot soup and fresh crusty rolls in tins of which visitors admiringly partook and for the latter in chance corners and on sunny landings much interesting light brush of gentlemen remarkable but for gentlemanly crimesthat is defalcations and malversations to striking and impressive amounts  i recall our coming on such a figure at the foot of a staircase and his having been announced to us by our conductor or friend in charge as likely to be there and what a charm i found in his cool loose uniform of shining white as i was afterwards to figure it as well as in his generally refined and distinguished appearance and in the fact that he was engaged while exposed to our attention in the commendable act of paring his nails with a smart penknife and that he didnt allow us to interrupt him one of my companions i forget which had advised me that in these contacts with illustrious misfortune i was to be careful not to stare and present to me at this moment is the wonder of whether he would think it staring to note that he quite stared and also that his hands were fine and fair and one of them adorned with a signet ring i was to have later in life a glimpse of two or three dismal penitentiaries places affecting me as sordid as dark and dreadful but if the revelation of singsing had involved the idea of a timely warning to the young mind my small sensibility at least was not reached by the lesson i envied the boldeyed celebrity in the array of a planter at his easewe might have been his slavesquite as much as i envied gussy in connection with which i may remark here that though in that early time i seem to have been constantly eager to exchange my lot for that of somebody else on the assumed certainty of gaining by the bargain i fail to remember feeling jealous of such happier personsin the measure open to children of spirit i had rather a positive lack of the passion and thereby i suppose a lack of spirit since if jealousy bears as i think on what one sees ones companions able to doas against ones own falling shortenvy as i knew it at least was simply of what they were or in other words of a certain sort of richer consciousness supposed doubtless often too freely supposed in them they were so otherthat was what i felt and to be other other almost anyhow seemed as good as the probable taste of the bright compound wistfully watched in the confectioners window unattainable impossible of course but as to which just this impossibility and just that privation kept those active proceedings in which jealousy seeks relief quite out of the question a platitude of acceptance of the poor actual the absence of all vision of how in any degree to change it combined with a complacency an acuity of perception of alternatives though a view of them as only through the confectioners hard glassthat is what i recover as the nearest approach to an apology in the soil of my nature for the springing seed of emulation i never dreamed of competinga business having in it at the best for my temper if not for my total failure of temper a displeasing ferocity if competing was bad snatching was therefore still worse and jealousy was a sort of spiritual snatching with which nevertheless all the while one might have been like soandso who had such horizons a helpless little love of horizons i certainly cherished and could sometimes even care for my own these always shrank however under almost any suggestion of a further range or finer shade in the purple rim offered to other eyesand that is what i take for the restlessness of envy it wasnt that i wished to change with everyone with anyone at a venture but that i saw gifts everywhere but as mine and that i scarce know whether to call the effect of this miserable or monstrous it was the effect at least of selfabandonmenti mean to visions  there must have been on that occasion of the singsing daywhich it deeply interests me to piece togethersome state of connection for some of us with the hospitalities of rhinebeck the place of abode of the eldest of the albany unclesthat is of the three most in our view for there were two others the eldest of all a halfuncle only who formed a class quite by himself and the very youngest who with lively interests of his own had still less attention for us than either of his three brothers the house at rhinebeck and all its accessories which struck our young sense as innumerable in especial the great bluff of the hudson on which it stood yields me images scarcely dimmed though as the effect but of snatches of acquaintance there at all events the gentlygroaningever so gently and drylyalbany grandmother with the albany cousins as to whom i here discriminate her two adopted daughters maturest and mildest of the general tribe must have paused for a stay a feature of which would be perhaps her juncture with the new york contingent somewhere sociably achieved for the befriending of juvenile gussy it shimmers there the whole circumstance with i scarce know what large innocence of charity and ease the gussypretext for reunion all so thin yet so important an appeal the simplicity of the interests and the doings the assumptions and the concessions each today so touching almost so edifying we were surely all gentle and generous together floating in such a clean light social order sweetly proof against ennuiunless it be a bad note as is conceivable never never to feel boredand thankful for the smallest æsthetic or romantic mercies my vision loses itself withal in vaster connectionsabove all in my general sense of the then grand newness of the hudson river railroad so far at least as its completion to albany was concerned a modern blessing that even the youngest of us were in a position to appraise the time had been when the steamboat had to content usand i feel how amply it must have done so as i recall the thrill of docking in dim early dawns the whole hour of the albany waterside the night of huge strange paddling and pattering and shrieking and creaking once ended and contrast with it all certain long sessions in the train at an age and in conditions when neither train nor traveller had suffered chastening sessions of a high animation as i recast them but at the same time of mortal intensities of lassitude the elements here indeed are much confused and mixedi must have known that discipline of the hectic interest and the extravagant strain in relation to rhinebeck only an étape doubtless on the way to new york for the albany kinship but the limit to our smaller patiences of any northward landjourney and yet not the young fatigue i repeat but the state of easy wonder is what most comes back the stops too repeated but perversely engaging the heat and the glare too great but the river by the window making reaches and glimpses so that the great swing of picture and force of light and colour were themselves a constant adventure the uncles above all too preeminent too recurrent to the creation of a positive soreness of sympathy of curiosity and yet constituting by their presence half the enlargement of the time for the presence of uncles incoherent albany uncles is somehow what most gives these hours their stamp for memory i scarce know why nor do i much i confess distinguish occasionsbut i see what i see the long the rattling car of the old open native form and the old harsh native exposure the sense of arrival forever postponed qualified however also by that of having in my hands a volume of m arsène houssaye philosophes et comédiennes remarkably submitted by one of my relatives to my judgment i see them always the relatives in slow circulation restless and nervous and casual their note not less than strikingly genial but with vaguenesses lapses eclipses that deprived their society of a tactless weight they cheered us on in their way born optimists clearly if not logically determined ones they were always reassuring and sustaining though with a bright brevity that must have taken immensities i think for granted they wore their hats slightly toward the nose they strolled they hung about they reported of progress and of the company they dropped suggestions new magazines packets of the edible deprecated for the immature they figured in fine to a small nephew as the principal men of their time and so far as the two younger and more familiar were concerned the most splendid as to aspect and apparel it was none the less to the least shining though not essentially the least comforting of this social trio that if i rightly remember i owed my introduction to the chronique galante of the eighteenth century  there tags itself at any rate to the impression a flutter as of some faint some recaptured grimace for another of his kindly offices which i associate somehow with the deck of a steamboat his production for our vague benefit of a literary classic the confessions as he called our attention to them of the celebrated rosseau i catch again the echo of the mirth excited to my surprise by this communication and recover as well my responsive advance toward a work that seemed so to promise but especially have i it before me that some play of light criticism mostly attended on the part of any circle this speakers more ambitious remarks for all that and in spite of oddities of appearance and type it was augustus james who spread widest in default of towering highest to my wistful view of the larger life and who covered definite and accessible ground this ground the house and precincts of linwood at rhinebeck harboured our tender years i surmise but at few and brief moments but it hadnt taken many of these to make it the image of an hospitality liberal as i supposed great social situations were liberal suppositions on this score having in childhood or at least they had in mine as little as possible to do with dry data didnt linwood bristle with great views and other glories with gardens and graperies and black ponies to say nothing of gardeners and grooms who were notoriously and quotedly droll to say nothing in particular of our aunt elizabeth who had been miss bay of albany who was the mother of the fair and free young waltzingwomen in new york and who floats back to me through the rhinebeck picture aquiline but easy with an effect of handsome highbrowed highnosed looseness of dressinggowns or streaming shawls the dowdy the delightful shawl of the period and of claws of bright benevolent steel that kept nipping for our charmed advantage roses and grapes and peaches and currantclusters together with turns of phrase and scraps of remark that fell as by quite a like flash of shears these are mere scrapings of golddust but my mind owes her a vibration that however tiny was to insist all these years on markingon figuring in a whole complex of picture and drama the clearest note of which was that of worry and woe a crisis prolonged in deeproofed outer galleries through hot august evenings and amid the dim flare of open windows to the hum of domesticated insects all but inexpressible the part played in the young mind naturally even though perversely even though inordinately arranged as a stage for the procession and exhibition of appearances by matters all of a usual cast contacts and impressions not arriving at the dignity of shocks but happening to be to the taste as one may say of the little intelligence happening to be such as the fond fancy could assimilate ones record becomes under memories of this orderand that is the only troublea tale of assimilations small and fine out of which refuse directly interesting to the subjectvictim only the most branching vegetations may be conceived as having sprung such are the absurdities of the poor dear inward lifewhen translated that is and perhaps ineffectually translated into terms of the outward and trying at all to flourish on the lines of the outward a reflection that might stay me here werent it that i somehow feel morally affiliated tied as by knotted fibres to the elements involved  one of these was assuredly that my father had again characteristically suffered me to dangle he having been called to linwood by the dire trouble of his sister mrs temple and brought me with him from staten islandi make the matter out as of the summer of 54 we had come up he and i to new york but our doings there with the journey following are a blank to me i recover but my sense on our arrival of being for the first time in the presence of tragedy which the shining scene roundabout made more sinistersharpened even to the point of my feeling abashed and irrelevant wondering why i had come my aunt under her brothers roof had left her husband wasted with consumption near death at albany gravely ill herselfshe had taken the disease from him as it was taken in those days and was in the event very scantly to survive himshe had been ordered away in her own interest for which she cared no scrap and my father the person in all his family most justly appealed and most anxiously listened to had been urged to come and support her in a separation that she passionately rejected vivid to me still as floating across verandahs into the hot afternoon stillness is the wail of her protest and her grief i remember being scared and hushed by it and stealing away beyond its reach i remember not less what resources of high control the whole case imputed for my imagination to my father and how creeping off to the edge of the eminence above the hudson i somehow felt the great bright harmonies of air and space becoming one with my rather proud assurance and confidence that of my own connection for life for interest with such sources of light the great impression however the one that has brought me so far was another matter only that of the close lamptempered outer evening aforesaid with my parent again somewhere deep within yet not too far to make us hold our breath for it tenderly opposing his sisters purpose of flight and the presence at my side of my young cousin marie youngest daughter of the house exactly of my own age and named in honour of her having been born in paris to the influence of which fact her shining black eyes her small quickness and brownness marking sharply her difference from her sisters so oddly so almost extravagantly testified it had come home to me by some voice of the air that she was spoiled and it made her in the highest degree interesting we ourselves had been so associated at home without being in the least spoiled i think we even rather missed it so that i knew about these subjects of invidious reflection only by literaturemainly no doubt that of the nurseryin which they formed quite by themselves a romantic class and the fond fancy always predominant i prized even while a little dreading the chance to see the condition at work this chance was given me it was clearthough i risk in my record of it a final anticlimaxby a remark from my uncle augustus to his daughter seated duskily in our group which included two or three dim dependent forms he expressed the strong opinion that marie should go to bedexpressed it that is with the casual cursory humour that was to strike me as the main expressional resource of outstanding members of the family and that would perhaps have had under analysis the defect of making judgment very personal without quite making authority so authority they hadnt of a truth these all so human outstanding ones they made shift but with light appreciation sudden suggestion a peculiar variety of happy remark in the air it had been remarked but in the air i feel sure that marie should seek her coucha truth by the dark wing of which i ruefully felt myself brushed and the words seemed therefore to fall with a certain ironic weight what i have retained of their effect at any rate is the vague fact of some objection raised by my cousin and some sharper point to his sentence supplied by her father promptly merged in a visible commotion a flutter of my young companion across the gallery as for refuge in the maternal arms a protest and an appeal in short which drew from my aunt the simple phrase that was from that moment so preposterously to count for me come now my dear dont make a scenei insist on your not making a scene that was all the witchcraft the occasion used but the note was none the less epochmaking the expression so vivid so portentous was one i had never heardit had never been addressed to us at home and who should say now what a world one mightnt at once read into it it seemed freighted to sail so far it told me so much about life life at these intensities clearly became scenes but the great thing the immense illumination was that we could make them or not as we chose it was a long time of course before i began to distinguish between those within our compass more particularly as spoiled and those producible on a different basis and which should involve detachment involve presence of mind just the qualities in which maries possible output was apparently deficient it didnt in the least matter accordingly whether or no a scene was then proceeded toand i have lost all count of what immediately happened the mark had been made for me and the door flung open the passage gathering up all the elements of the troubled time had been itself a scene quite enough of one and i had become aware with it of a rich accession of possibilities     xiv   it must have been after the singsing episode that gussy came to us in new york for sundays and holidays from scarce further off than round the cornerhis foreign institution flourishing i seem to remember in west tenth street or whereverand yet as floated by exotic airs and with the scent of the spiceislands hanging about him he was being educated largely with cubans and mexicans in those new york days more than half the little flock of the foreign institutions in general over whom his easy triumphs while he wagged his little red head for them were abundantly credible reinforced as my special sense of them was moreover by the similar situation of his sister older than he but also steeped in the exotic medium and also sometimes bringing us queer echoes of the tongues i remember being deputed by my mother to go and converse with her on some question of her coming to us at the establishment of madame reichhardt pronounced à la française réchard where i felt that i had crossed for the hour the very threshold of europe it being impressed on me by my cousin who was tall and handsome and happy with a laugh of more beautiful sound than any laugh we were to know again that french only was speakable on the premises i sniffed it up aromatically the superior language in passage and parlourit took the form of some strong savoury soup an educational potage réchard that must excellently have formed the taste that was again i felt as i came away a part of the rich experience of being thrown in tender juvenile form upon the world this genial girl like her brother was in the grand situation of having no home and of carrying on life such a splendid kind of life by successive visits to relations though neither she nor gussy quite achieved the range of their elder brother bob of that ilk a handsome young man a just blurred attractive illusive presence who hovered a bit beyond our real reach and apparently displayed the undomesticated character at its highest he seemed exposed for his pleasureif pleasure it wasand my wonder to every assault of experience his very name took on from these imputations a browner glow and it was all in the right key that a few years later he should after showing some talent for sculpture have gone the hapless way of most of the albany youth have become a theme for sad vague headshakes kind and very pitying in his case and died prematurely and pointlessly or in other words by my conception picturesquely the headshakes were heavier and the sighs sharper for another slim shade one of the younger and i believe quite the most hapless of those i have called the outstanding ones he too several years older than we again a tormenting hoverer and vanisher he too charmingly sisterd though sisterd only and succumbing to monstrous early trouble after having shown some talent for music the ghostliness of these æsthetic manifestations as i allude to them is the thinnest conceivable chip of stray marble the faintest faroff twang of old chords i ask myself for the odd obscurity of it under what inspiration music and sculpture may have tinkled and glimmered to the albany ear and eye as we at least knew those organs and with what queer and weak delusions our unfortunates may have played quite ineffably quaint and falot this proposition of that sort of resource for the battle of life as it then and there opened and above all beautifully suggestive of our sudden collective disconnectedness ours as the whole kinships from the american resource of those days albanian or other that precious light was the light of business only and we by a common instinct artlessly joining hands went forth into the wilderness without so much as a twinkling taper  our consensus on all this ground was amazingit brooked no exception the word had been passed all round that we didnt that we couldnt and shouldnt understand these things questions of arithmetic and of fond calculation questions of the countinghouse and the market and we appear to have held to our agreement as loyally and to have accepted our doom as serenely as if our faith had been mutually pledged the rupture with my grandfathers tradition and attitude was complete we were never in a single case i think for two generations guilty of a stroke of business the most that could be said of us was that though about equally wanting all round in any faculty of acquisition we happened to pay for the amiable weakness less in some connections than in others the point was that we moved so oddly and consistentlyas it was our only form of consistencyover our limited pasture never straying to nibble in the strange or the steep places what was the matter with us under this spell and what the moral might have been for our case are issues of small moment after all in face of the fact of our mainly so brief duration it was given to but few of us to be taught by the event to be made to wonder with the last intensity what had been the matter this it would be interesting to worry out might i take the time for the story wouldnt be told i conceive by any mere rueful glance at other avidities the preference for ease the play of the passions the appetite for pleasure these things have often accompanied the business imagination just as the love of life and the love of other persons and of many of the things of the world just as quickness of soul and sense have again and again not excluded it however it comes back as i have already hinted to the manner in which the things of the world could but present themselves there were not enough of these and they were not fine and fair enough to engage happily so much unapplied so much loose and crude attention we hadnt doubtless at all a complete play of intelligenceif i may not so far discriminate as to say they hadnt or our lack of the instinct of the market neednt have been so much worth speaking of other curiosities other sympathies might have redressed the balance i make out our young cousin j j as dimly aware of this while composing the light melodies that preluded to his extinction and which that catastrophe so tried to admonish us to think of as promising but his image is more present to me still as the great incitement during the few previous years to our constant dream of educational relief of some finer kind of social issue through europe  it was to europe j j had been committed he was over there forging the small apologetic arms that were so little to avail him but it was quite enough for us that he pointed the way to the pension sillig at vevey which shone at us from afar as our own more particular solution it was true that the pension sillig figured mainly as the solution in cases of recognised wildness there long flourished among new york parents whose view of such resources had the proper range a faith in it for that complaint and it was as an act of faith that failing other remedies our young wifeless uncle conscious himself of no gift for control or for edification had placed there his difficult son he returned with delight from this judicious course and there was an hour when we invoked to intensity a similar one in our own interest and when the air of home did little but reflect from afar the glitter of blue swiss lakes the tinkle of cattlebells in alpine pastures the rich bonhomie that m sillig dispensing an education all of milk and honey and edelweiss and ranzdesvaches combined with his celebrated firmness for tough subjects poor j j came back i fear much the same subject that he went but he had verily performed his scant office on earth that of having brought our then prospect our apparent possibility a trifle nearer he seemed to have been wild even beyond m silligs measurewhich was highly disappointing but if we might on the other hand be open to the reproach of falling too short of it there were establishments adapted to every phase of the american predicament so that our general direction could but gain in vividness i think with compassion altogether of the comparative obscurity to which our eventual success in gathering the fruits few and scant though they might be thus relegates those to whom it was given but to toy so briefly with the flowers they make collectively their tragic trio j j the elder most loved most beautiful most sacrificed of the albany uncles j j the youngerthey were young together they were luckless together and the combination was as strange as the disaster was sweeping and the daughter and sister amplest of the natural easiest of the idle who lived on to dress their memory with every thread and patch of her own perfect temper and then confirm the tradition after all by too early and woeful an end  if it comes over me under the brush of multiplied memories that we might well have invoked the educational relief i just spoke of i should doubtless as promptly add that my own case must have been intrinsically of the poorest and indeed make the point once for all that i should be taken as having seen and felt much of the whole queerness through the medium of rare inaptitudes i can only have been inapt i make out to have retained so positively joyless a sense of it all to be aware of most of it now but as dim confusion as bewildered anxiety there was interest always certainlybut it strikes me today as interest in everything that wasnt supposedly or prescriptively of the question at all and in nothing that was so respectably involved and accredited without some sharpness of interest i shouldnt now have the memories but these stick to me somehow with none of the hard glue of recovered spirits recovered vivacities assurances successes i cant have had through it all i think a throb of assurance or success without which at the same time absurdly and indescribably i lived and wriggled floundered and failed lost the clue of everything but a general lucid consciousness lucid that is for my tender years which i clutched with a sense of its value what happened all the while i conceive was that i imagined thingsand as if quite on systemwholly other than as they were and so carried on in the midst of the actual ones an existence that somehow floated and saved me even while cutting me off from any degree of direct performance in fact from any degree of direct participation at all there presumably was the interestin the intensity and plausibility and variety of the irrelevance an irrelevance which for instance made all pastors and masters and especially all fellowoccupants of benches and desks all elbowing and kicking presences within touch or view so many monsters and horrors so many wonders and splendours and mysteries but never so far as i can recollect realities of relation dispensers either of knowledge or of fate playmates intimates mere coævals and coequals they were something betterbetter above all than the coequal or coæval they were so thoroughly figures and characters divinities or demons and endowed in this light with a vividness that the mere reality of relation a commoner directness of contact would have made i surmise comparatively poor this superior shade of interest was not none the less so beguiling that i recall without unmitigated horror or something very like it a winter passed with my brother at the institution vergnès our sorry subjection to which argues to my present sense an unmitigated surrounding aridity to a french school must have been earnestly imputed the virtue of keeping us in patience till easier days should come infinitely touching our parents view of that new york fetish of our young time an acquisition of the languagesan acquisition reinforcing those opportunities which we enjoyed at home so far as they mustered and at which i have briefly glanced charming and amusing to me indeed certain faint echoes wavering images of this superstition as it played about our path ladies and gentlemen dimly foreign mere broken syllables of whose names come back to me attending there to converse in tongues and then giving way to others through failures of persistencewhether in pupils or preceptors i know not there hovers even count adam gurowski polish patriotic exiled temporarily famous with the vision of his being invoked for facility and then relinquished for difficulty though i scarce guess on which of his battlegroundshe was so polyglot that he even had a rich command of new yorkese     xv   it is to the institution vergnès that my earliest recovery of the sense of being in any degree educated with w j attaches itself an establishment which occupied during the early fifties a site in the very middle of broadway of the lower the real broadway where it could throb with the very pulse of the traffic in which we all innocently rejoicedbelieving it i surmise the liveliest conceivable a fact that is by itself in the light of the present an odd rococo note the lower broadwayi allude to the whole fourth street and bond street where now is the bond street of that antiquitywas then a seat of education since we had not done with it as i shall presently show even when we had done with the institution a prompt disillusionment and i brood thus over a period which strikes me as long and during which my personal hours of diligence were somehow more than anything else hours of the pavement and the shopfront or of such contemplative exercise as the very considerable distance for small legs between those regions and the westward fourteenth street might comprise pedestrian gaping having been in childhood as i have noted prevailingly my line fate appeared to have kindly provided for it on no small scale to the extent even that it must have been really my sole and single form of athletics vague heated competition and agitation in the then enclosed union square would seem to point a little among us all to nobler types of motion but of any basis for recreation anything in the nature of a playground or a breathingspace the institution itself was serenely innocent this i take again for a note extraordinarily mediæval it occupied the first and second floors if i rightly remember of a wide front that overhanging the endless thoroughfare looked out on bouncing clattering stages and painfully dragged carts and the promiscuous human shufflethe violence of repercussions from the new york pavement of those years to be further taken into account and i win it back from every side as in spite of these aspects of garish publicity a dark and dreadful and withal quite absurd scene i see places of that general time even places of confinement in a dusty golden light that special memories of small misery scarce in the least bedim and this holds true of our next and quite neighbouring refuge the establishment of m vergnès alone darkles and shrinks to mea sordidly black interior is my main image for it attenuated only by its having very soon afterwards as a suffered ordeal altogether lapsed and intermitted faintly in the gloom i distinguish m vergnès himselfquite old very old indeed as i supposed him and highly irritated and markedly bristling though of nothing in particular that happened to me at his or at anyones else hands have i the scantest remembrance what really most happened no doubt was that my brother and i should both come away with a mind prepared for a perfect assimilation of alphonse daudets chronicle of jack years and years later on to make the acquaintance in that work of the petits pays chauds among whom jack learnt the first lessons of life was to see the institution vergnès at once revive swarming as it did with small homesick cubans and mexicans the complete failure of blondness that marks the memory is doubtless the cumulative effect of so many of the new york petits pays chauds preponderantly brown and black and conducing to a greasy gloom into this gloom i fear i should see all things recede together but for a certain salient note the fact that the whole staff appears to have been constantly in a rage from which naturally resulted the accent of shrillness the only accent we could pick up though we were supposed to be learning for the extreme importance of it quantities of french and the sound of high vociferation i remember infuriated ushers of foreign speech and flushed complexionthe tearing across of hapless exercises and dictées and the hurtle through the air of dodged volumes only never despite this the extremity of smiting there can have been at the institution no blows instructionally dealtnor even from our hours of ease do any such echoes come back to me little cubans and mexicans i make out were not to be vulgarly whackedin deference presumably to some latent relic or imputed survival of castilian pride which would impose withal considerations of quite practical prudence food for reflection and comparison might well have been so suggested interesting at least the element of contrast between such opposed conceptions of tone temper and manner as the passion without whacks or with whacks only of inanimate objects ruling the scene i have described and the whacks without passion the grim impersonal strictly penal applications of the rod which then generally represented what was still involved in our english tradition it was the two theories of sensibility of personal dignity that so diverged but with such other divergences now on top of those that the old comparison falls away we today go unwhacked altogetherthough from a pride other than castilian it is difficult to say at least what ideal has thus triumphed in the vergnès air at any rate i seem myself to have sat unscathed and unterrifiednot alarmed even by so much as a call to the blackboard only protected by my insignificance which yet covered such a sense of our dusky squalor queer for us the whole affair assuredly but how much queerer for the poor petits pays chauds who had come so far for their privilege we had come comparatively but from round the cornerand that left the state of education and the range of selection all about as quaint enough what could these things then have been in the various native climes of the petits pays chauds  it was by some strong wave of reaction clearly that we were floated next into the quieter haven of mr richard pulling jenkswhere cleaner waters as i feel their coolness still must have filled a neater though it was true slightly more contracted trough yet the range of selection had been even on this higher plane none too strikingly exemplified our jumping had scant compasswe still grubbed with a good conscience in broadway and sidled about fourth street but i think of the higher education as having there from various causes none the less begun to glimmer for us a diffused brightness a kind of high crosslight of conflicting windows rests for me at all events on the little realm of mr pulling jenks and bathes it as with positively sweet limitations limited must it have been i feel with our couple of middling rooms front and back our close packing our large unaccommodating stove our grey and gritty oilcloth and again our importunate broadway from the aggregation of which elements there distils itself without my being able to account for it a certain perversity of romance i speak indeed here for myself in particular and keen for romance must i have been in such conditions i admit since the sense of it had crept into a recreational desert even as utter as that of the institution vergnès up out of broadway we still scrambledi can smell the steep and cold and dusty wooden staircase straight into broadway we droppedi feel again the generalised glare of liberation and i scarce know what tenuity of spirit it argues that i should neither have enjoyed nor been aware of missing speaking again for myself only a space wider than the schoolroom floor to react and knock about in i literally conclude that we must have knocked about in broadway and in broadway alone like perfect little men of the world we must have been let loose there to stretch our legs and fill our lungs without prejudice either to our earlier and later freedoms of going and coming i as strictly infer at the same time that broadway must have been then as one of the alleys of eden for any sinister contact or consequence involved for us a circumstance that didnt in the least interfere too as i have noted with its offer of an entrancing interest the interest verily could have been a calculated thing on the part of our dear parents as little as on that of mr jenks himself therefore let it be recorded as still most odd that we should all have assented to such deficiency of landscape such exiguity of sport i take the true inwardness of the matter to have been in our having such short hours long as they may have appeared at the time that the day left margin at the worst for private inventions i think we found landscape for ourselvesand wherever i at least found vision i found such sport as i was capable ofeven between the front and back rooms and the conflicting windows even by the stove which somehow scorched without warming and yet round which mr coe and mr dolmidge the drawingmaster and the writingmaster arriving of a winters day used notedly and in the case of mr coe lamentedly to draw out their delays is the dusty golden light of retrospect in this connection an effluence from mr dolmidge and mr coe whose ministrations come back to me as the sole directly desired or invoked ones i was to know in my years such as they were of pupilage  i see them in any case as oldworld images figures of an antique stamp products mustnt they have been of an order in which some social relativity or matterofcourse adjustment some transmitted form and pressure were still at work mr dolmidge inordinately lean cleanshaved as was comparatively uncommon then and in a swallowtailed coat and i think a black satin stock was surely perfect in his absolutely functional way a pure penholder of a man melancholy and mild who taught the most complicated flourishesgreat scrolls of them met our view in the form of surging seas and beaked and beadyeyed eagles the eagle being so calligraphic a birdwhile he might just have taught resignation he was not at all funnyno one out of our immediate family circle in fact almost no one but w j himself who flowered in every waste seems to have struck me as funny in those years but he was to remain with me a picture of somebody in dickens one of the phiz if not the cruikshank pictures mr coe was another affair bristling with the question of the hard but somehow too with the revelation of the soft the deeply attaching a worthy of immense stature and presence crowned as with the thick white hair of genius wearing a great gathered or puckered cloak with a vast velvet collar and resembling as he comes back to me the general winfield scott who lived so much in our eyes then the oddity may well even at that hour have been present to me of its taking so towering a person to produce such small drawingcards it was as if some mighty bird had laid diminutive eggs mr coe of a truth laid his all over the place and though they were not of more than handy sizevery small boys could set them up in state on very small desksthey had doubtless a great range of number and effect they were scattered far abroad and i surmise celebrated they represented crooked cottages feathery trees browsing and bristling beasts and other rural objects all rendered as i recall them in little detached dashes that were like stories told in words of one syllable or even more perhaps in short gasps of delight it must have been a stammering art but i admired its fluency which swims for me moreover in richer though slightly vague associations mr coe practised on a larger scale in colour in oils producing wondrous neat little boards that make me to this day think of them and more particularly smell them when i hear of a panel picture a glamour of greatness attends them as brought home by w j from the masters own place of instruction in that old university building which partly formed the east side of washington square and figures to memory or to fond imagination as throbbing with more offices and functions a denser chiaroscuro than any reared hugeness of today where character is so lost in quantity is there any present structure that plays such a part in proportion to its sizethough even as i ask the question i feel how nothing on earth is proportioned to present sizes these alone are proportionedand to mere skyspace and mere amount amount of steel and stone which is comparatively uninteresting perhaps our needs and our elements were then absurdly were then provincially few and that the patches of character in that small grey granite compendium were all we had in general to exhibit let me add at any rate that some of them were exhibitionaleven to my tender years i mean since i respond even yet to my privilege of presence at some commencement or commemoration such as might be natural doubtless to any university where as under a high rich roof before a chancellor in a gown and amid serried admirers and impressive applause there was speaking of the finest sort and where above all i gathered in as a dazzling example the rare assurance of young winthrop somebody or somebody winthrop who though still in jackets held us spellbound by his rendering of serjeant buzfuzs exposure of mr pickwick long was i to marvel at the high sufficiency of young winthrop somebody or somebody winthropin which romantic impression it is perhaps after all though with the consecration of one or two of the novels of the onceadmired theodore of that name which so remarkably insists thrown in the sense of the place is embalmed  i must not forget indeed that i throw in also mr coeeven if with less assured a hand by way of a note on those higher flights of power and promise that i at this time began to see definitely determined in my brother as i catch w js image from far back at its most characteristic he sits drawing and drawing always drawing especially under the lamplight of the fourteenth street back parlour and not as with a plodding patience which i think would less have affected me but easily freely and as who should say infallibly always at the stage of finishing off his head dropped from side to side and his tongue rubbing his lower lip i recover a period during which to see him at all was so to see himthe other flights and faculties removed him from my view these were a matter of coursehe recurred he passed nearer but in his moments of ease and i clearly quite accepted the ease of his disappearances didnt he always when within my view light them up and justify them by renewed and enlarged vividness so that my whole sense of him as formed for assimilations scarce conceivable made our gaps of contact too natural for me even to be lessons in humility humility had nothing to do with itas little even as envy would have had i was below humility just as we were together outside of competition mutually hors concours his competitions were with othersin which how wasnt he how could he not be successful while mine were with nobody or nobodys with me which came to the same thing as heaven knows i neither braved them nor missed them that winter as i recover it represents him as sufficiently within view to make his position or whereabouts in the upper air definitei must have taken it for granted before but could now in a manner measure it and the freshness of this sense something serene in my complacency had to do i divine with the effect of our moving with the rest of our company which was not numerous but practically but appreciably select on a higher and fairer plane than ever yet predominantly of course we owed this benefit to richard pulling himself of whom i recall my brothers saying to me at a considerably later time and with an authority that affected me as absolute that he had been of all our masters the most truly genial in fact the only one to whom the art of exciting an interest or inspiring a sympathy could be in any degree imputed i take this to have meant that he would have adorned a higher sphereand it may have been to explain his so soon swimming out of our ken that into a higher sphere he rapidly moved i can account at least for our falling away from him the very next year and declining again upon baser things and a lower civilisation but by some probability of his flight just thereafter effected to a greater distance to one of the far upper reaches of the town some years must have elapsed and some distinction have crowned him when being briefly in new york together w j and i called on him of a sunday afternoon to findwhat i hadnt been at all sure ofthat he still quite knew who we were or handsomely pretended to handsomely in spite of his markedly confirmed identity of appearance with the punch husband to judy of the funny papers and the street show bald rotund of ruddy complexion with the nose the chin the arched eye the paunch and the barbiche to say nothing of the ferule nursed in his arms and with which in the show such free play is made mr jenks yet seems to me to have preserved a dignity as well as projected an image and in fact have done other things besides he whacked occasionallyhe must have been one of the last of the whackers but i dont remember it as ugly or dreadful or drolldont remember that is either directly feeling or reflectively enjoying it it fails somehow to break the spell of our civilisation my share in which however comes back to me as merely contemplative it is beyond measure odd doubtless that my main association with my studies whether of the infant or the adolescent order should be with almost anything but the fact of learningof learning i mean what i was supposed to learn i could only have been busy at the same time with other pursuitswhich must have borne some superficial likeness at least to the acquisition of knowledge of a free irresponsible sort since i remember few either of the inward pangs or the outward pains of a merely graceless state i recognise at the same time that it was perhaps a sorry business to be so interested in one didnt know what such are whether at the worst or at the best some of the aspects of that season as mr jenkss image presides in the light of which i may perhaps again rather wonder at my imputation to the general picture of so much amenity clearly the good man was a civiliserwhacks and all and by some art not now to be detected he was a complacent classicwhich was what my brothers claim for him i dare say mostly represented though that passed over the head of my tenth year it was a good note for him in this particular that deploring the facile textbooks of doctor anthon of columbia college in which there was even more crib than text and holding fast to the sterner discipline of andrews and stoddard and of that other more conservative commentator he too doubtless long since superseded whose name i blush to forget i think in fine of richard pullings small but sincere academy as a consistent little protest against its big and easy and quite outdistancing rival the columbia college school apparently in those days quite the favourite of fortune     xvi   i must in some degree have felt it a charm there that we were not under his rule inordinately prepared for business but were on the contrary to remember that the taste of cornelius nepos in the air even rather stale though it may have been had lacked the black bitterness marking our next ordeal and that i conceive to have proceeded from some rank predominance of the theory and practice of bookkeeping it had consorted with this that we found ourselves by i know not what inconsequence a pair of the assets of a firm messrs forest and quackenboss who carried on business at the northwest corner of fourteenth street and sixth avenue having for the winter of 18545 taken our education in hand as their establishment had the style so i was conscious at the time of its having the general stamp and sense of a shopa shop of long standing of numerous clients of lively bustle and traffic the structure itself was to my recent recognition still there and more than ever a shop with improvements and extensions but dealing in other wares than those anciently and as i suppose then quite freshly purveyed so far at least as freshness was imputable to the senior member of the firm who had come down to our generation from a legendary past and with a striking resemblance of head and general air to benjamin franklin mr forest under whose more particular attention i languished had lasted on from a plainer age and having formed by the legend in their youth the taste of two or three of our new york unclesthough for what it could have been goodness only knewwas still of a trempe to whack in the fine old way at their nephews and sons i see him aloft benevolent and hard mildly massive in a black dress coat and trousers and a white neckcloth that should have figured if it didnt a frill and on the highest rostrum of our experience whence he comes back to me as the dryest of all our founts of knowledge though quite again as a link with faroff manners and forms and as the most historic figure we had ever had to do with w j as i distinguish had in truth scarcely to do with himw j lost again on upper floors in higher classes in real pursuits and connecting me in an indirect and almost deprecated manner with a strange curly glossy an anointed and bearded mr quackenboss the junior partner who conducted the classical department and never whackedonly sent down his subjects with every confidence to his friend i make out with clearness that mr forest was awful and arid and yet that somehow by the same stroke we didnt under his sway go in terror only went exceedingly in want even if in want indeed of i scarce for myself know what since it might well have been enough for me in so resounding an air to escape with nothing worse than a failure of thrill if i didnt feel that interest i must clearly not have inspired it and i marvel afresh under these memories at the few points at which i appear to have touched constituted reality that however is a different connection altogether and i read back into the one i have been noting much of the chill or at least the indifference of a foreseen and foredoomed detachment it was during that winter that i began to live by anticipation in another world and to feel our uneasy connection with new york loosen beyond recovery i remember for how many months when the rupture took place we had been to my particular consciousness virtually in motion though i regain at the same time the impression of more experience on the spot than had marked our small previous history this however a branch of the matter that i must for the moment brush aside for it would have been meanwhile odd enough to hold us in arrest a momentthat quality of our situation that could suffer such elements as those i have glanced at to take so considerably the place of education as more usually and conventionally understood and by that understanding more earnestly mapped out a deficiency in the whole thing that i fail at all consistently to deplore howeverstruck as i am with the rare fashion after which in any small victim of life the inward perversity may work  it works by converting to its uses things vain and unintended to the great discomposure of their prepared opposites which it by the same stroke so often reduces to naught with the result indeed that one may most of all see itso at least have i quite exclusively seen it the little life out for its chanceas proceeding by the inveterate process of conversion as i reconsider both my own and my brothers early starteven his too made under stronger propulsionsit is quite for me as if the authors of our being and guardians of our youth had virtually said to us but one thing directed our course but by one word though constantly repeated convert convert convert with which i have not even the sense of any needed appeal in us for further apprehension of the particular precious metal our chemistry was to have in view i taste again in that pure air no ghost of a hint for instance that the precious metal was the refined gold of successa reward of effort for which i remember to have heard at home no good word nor any sort of word ever faintly breathed it was a case of the presumption that we should hear words enough abundantly elsewhere so that any dignity the idea might claim was in the first place not worth insisting on and in the second might well be overstated we were to convert and convert successin the sense that was in the general airor no success and simply everything that should happen to us every contact every impression and every experience we should know were to form our soluble stuff with only ourselves to thank should we remain unaware by the time our perceptions were decently developed of the substance finally projected and most desirable that substance might be just consummately virtue as a social grace and valueand as a matter furthermore on which pretexts for ambiguity of view and of measure were as little as possible called upon to flourish this last luxury therefore quite failed us and we understood no whit the less what was suggested and expected because of the highly liberal way in which the pill if i may call it so was gilded it had been made upto emphasise my imagein so bright an air of humanity and gaiety of charity and humour what i speak of is the medium itself of course that we were most immediately steeped ini am glancing now at no particular turn of our young attitude in it and i can scarce sufficiently express how little it could have conduced to the formation of prigs our fathers prime horror was of themhe only cared for virtue that was more or less ashamed of itself and nothing could have been of a happier whimsicality than the mixture in him and in all his walk and conversation of the strongest instinct for the human and the liveliest reaction from the literal the literal played in our education as small a part as it perhaps ever played in any and we wholesomely breathed inconsistency and ate and drank contradictions the presence of paradox was so bright among usthough fluttering ever with as light a wing and as short a flight as need have beenthat we fairly grew used to allow from an early time for the so many and odd declarations we heard launched to the extent of happily discounting them the moral of all of which was that we need never fear not to be good enough if we were only social enough a splendid meaning indeed being attached to the latter term  thus we had ever the amusement since i can really call it nothing less of hearing morality or moralism as it was more invidiously worded made hay of in the very interest of character and conduct these things suffering much it seemed by their association with the consciencethat is the conscious consciencethe very home of the literal the haunt of so many pedantries pedantries on all this ground were anathema and if our dear parent had at all minded his not being consistent and had entertained about us generally less passionate an optimism not an easy but an arduous state in him moreover he might have found it difficult to apply to the promotion of our studies so free a suspicion of the inhumanity of method method certainly never quite raged among us but it was our fortune nevertheless that everything had its turn and that such indifferences were no more pedantic than certain rigours might perhaps have been of all of which odd notes of our situation there would and possibly will be more to saymy present aim is really but to testify to what most comes up for me today in the queer educative air i have been trying to breathe again that definite reflection is that if we had not had in us to some degree the root of the matter no method however confessedly or aggressively pedantic would much have availed for us and that since we apparently did have it deep down and inert in our small patches of virgin soil the fashion after which it struggled forth was an experience as intense as any other and a record of as great a dignity it may be asked me i recognise of the root of what matter i so complacently speak and if i say why of the matter of our having with considerable intensity proved educable or if you like better teachable that is accessible to experience it may again be retorted that wont do for a decent account of a young consciousness for think of all the things that the failure of method of which you make so light didnt put into yours think of the splendid economy of a realor at least of a planned and attempted education a regular course of instructionand then think of the waste involved in the so inferior substitute of which the pair of you were evidently victims an admonition this on which i brood less however than on the still other sense rising from the whole retrospect of my now feeling sure of my having mastered the particular history of just that wasteto the point of its actually affecting me as blooming with interest to the point even of its making me ask myself how in the world if the question is of the injection of more things into the consciousness as would seem the case mine could have done with more thanks to its small trick perhaps vicious i admit of having felt itself from an early time almost uncomfortably stuffed i see my critic by whom i mean my representative of method at any price take in this plea only to crush it with his confidencethat without the signal effects of method one must have had by an inexorable law to resort to shifts and ingenuities and can therefore only have been an artful dodger more or less successfully dodging i take full account of the respectability of the prejudice against one or two of the uses to which the intelligence may at a pinch be putthe criminal use in particular of falsifying its history of forging its records even and of appearing greater than the traceable grounds warrant one can but fall back none the less on the particular untraceability of groundswhen it comes to that cases abound so in which with the grounds all there the intelligence itself is not to be identified i contend for nothing moreover but the lively interest of the view and above all of the measure of almost any mental history after the fact of less interest comparatively is that sight of the mind beforebefore the demonstration of the fact that is and while still muffled in theories and presumptions purple and fine linen and as such highly becoming though these be of what shall prove best for it  which doubtless too numerous remarks have been determined by my sense of the tenuity of some of my clues i had begun to count our wavering steps from so very far back and with a lively disposition i confess not to miss even the vaguest of them i can scarce indeed overstate the vagueness that quite had to attend a great number in presence of the fact that our father caring for our spiritual decency unspeakably more than for anything else anything at all that might be or might become ours would have seemed to regard this cultivation of it as profession and career enough for us had he but betrayed more interest in our mastery of any art or craft it was not certainly that the profession of virtue would have been anything less than abhorrent to him but that singular though the circumstance there were times when he might have struck us as having after all more patience with it than with this that or the other more technical thrifty scheme of the beauty of his dissimulated anxiety and tenderness on these and various other suchlike heads however other examples will arise for i see him now as fairly afraid to recognise certain anxieties fairly declining to dabble in the harshness of practical precautions or impositions the effect of his attitude so little thought out as shrewd or as vulgarly providential but in spite of this so socially and affectionally founded could only be to make life interesting to us at the worst in default of making it extraordinarily paying he had a theory that it would somehow or other always be paying enoughand this much less by any poor conception of our wants for he delighted in our wants and so sympathetically and sketchily and summarily wanted for us than by a happy and friendly though slightly nebulous conception of our resources delighting ever in the truth while generously contemptuous of the facts so far as we might make the differencethe facts having a way of being many and the truth remaining but onehe held that there would always be enough since the truth the true truth was never ugly and dreadful and we didnt and wouldnt depart from it by any cruelty or stupidity for he wouldnt have had us stupid and might therefore depend on it for due abundance even of meat and drink and raiment even of wisdom and wit and honour it is too much to say that our so preponderantly humanised and socialised adolescence was to make us look out for these things with a subtle indirectness but i return to my proposition that there may still be a charm in seeing such hazards at work through a given even if not in a systematised case my cases are of course given so that economy of observation after the fact as i have called it becomes inspiring not less than the amusement or whatever it may be of the question of what might happen of what in point of fact did happen to several very towny and domesticated little persons who were confirmed in their towniness and fairly enriched in their sensibility instead of being chucked into a scramble or exposed on breezy uplands under the shewolf of competition and discipline perhaps any success that attended the experimentwhich was really as i have hinted no plotted thing at all but only an accident of accidentsproceeded just from the fact that the small subjects a defeated romulus a prematurely sacrificed remus had in their very sensibility an asset as we have come to say a principle of life and even of fun perhaps on the other hand the success would have been greater with less of that particular complication or facilitation and more of some other which i shall be at a loss to identify what i find in my path happens to be the fact of the sensibility and from the light it sheds the curious as also the common things that did from occasion to occasion play into it seem each to borrow a separate and vivifying glow  as at the institution vergnès and at mr pulling jenkss however this might be so at forests or in other words at the more numerous establishment of messrs forest and quackenboss where we spent the winter of 1854 reality in the form of multitudinous mates was to have swarmed about me increasingly at forests the prolonged rollcall in the morning as i sit in the vast bright crowded smelly smoky room in which rusty black stoveshafts were the nearest hint of architecture bristles with names hoes and havemeyers stokeses phelpses colgates and others of a subsequently great new york salience it was sociable and gay it was sordidly spectacular one was then by an inch or two a bigger boythough with crushing superiorities in that line all round and when i wonder why the scene was sterile which was what i took it for at the worst the reason glooms out again in the dreadful blight of arithmetic which affected me at the time as filling all the air the quantity imposed may not in fact have been positively gross yet it is what i most definitely remembernot i mean that i have retained the dimmest notion of the science but only of the dire image of our being in one way or another always supposedly addressed to it i recall strange neighbours and deskfellows who not otherwise too objectionable were uncanny and monstrous through their possession cultivation imitation of ledgers daybooks doubleentry tall pages of figures interspaces streaked with oblique ruled lines that weirdly balanced whatever that might mean and other like horrors nothing in truth is more distinct to me than the tune to which they were without exception at their ease on such groundunless it be my general dazzled humiliated sense through those years of the common the baffling mastery all round me of a hundred handy arts and devices everyone did things and had thingseveryone knew how even when it was a question of the small animals the dormice and grasshoppers or the hoards of food and stationery that they kept in their desks just as they kept in their heads such secrets for how to do sumsthose secrets that i must even then have foreseen i should even so late in life as this have failed to discover i may have known things have by that time learnt a few myself but i didnt know thatwhat i did know whereas those who surrounded me were all agog to my vision with the benefit of their knowledge i see them in this light across the years fairly grin and grimace with it and the presumable vulgarity of some of them certain scattered shades of baseness still discernible comes to me as but one of the appearances of an abounding play of genius who was it i ever thought stupideven when knowing or at least feeling that sundry expressions of life or force which i yet had no name for represented somehow art without grace or what after a fashion came to the same thing presence without type all of which i should add didnt in the least prevent my moving on the plane of the remarkable so that if as i have noted the general blank of consciousness in the conditions of that winter rather tended to spread this could perhaps have but had for its best reason that i was fairly gorged with wonders they were too much of the same kind the result that is of everyones seeming to know everythingto the effect a little that everything suffered by it there was a boy called simpson my juxtaposition to whom i recall as uninterruptedly close and whose origin can only have been i think quite immediately irishand simpson i feel sure was a friendly and helpful character yet even he reeked to my sense with strange accomplishmentno single show of which but was accompanied in him by a smart protrusion of the lower lip a crude complacency of power that almost crushed me to sadness it is as if i had passed in that sadness most of those ostensibly animated months an effect however doubtless in some degree proceeding for later appreciation from the more intelligible nearness of the timeit had brought me to the end of my twelfth year which helps not a little to turn it to prose how i gave to that state in any case such an air of occupation as to beguile not only myself but my instructorswhich i infer i did from their so intensely letting me alonei am quite at a loss to say i have in truth mainly the remembrance of being consistently either ignored or exquisitely considered i know not which to call it even if without the belief which would explain it that i passed for generally wanting any more than for naturally odious it was strange at all eventsit could only have beento be so stupid without being more brutish and so perceptive without being more keen here were a case and a problem to which no honest master with other and better cases could have felt justified in giving time he would have had at least to be morbidly curious and i recall from that sphere of rule no instance whatever of the least refinement of inquiry i should even probably have missed one of these more flattering shades of attention had i missed attention at all but i think i was never really aware of how little i got or how much i did without i read back into the whole connection indeed the chill or at least the indifference of a foreseen and foredoomed detachment i have noted how at this desperate juncture the mild forces making for our conscious relief pushing the door to europe definitely open began at last to be effective nothing seemed to matter at all but that i should become personally and incredibly acquainted with piccadilly and richmond park and ham common i regain at the same time the impression of more experience on the spot than had marked our small previous history  pitiful as it looks to these ampler days the mere little fact that a small court for recreation was attached to our academy added something of a grace to life we descended in relays for intermission into a paved and walled yard of the scantest size the only provision for any such privilegenot counting the street itself of which at the worst of other conditions we must have had free rangethat i recover from those years the ground is built over now but i could still figure on a recent occasion our small breathingspace together with my then abject little sense that it richly sufficedor rather positively that nothing could have been more romantic for within our limit we freely conversed and at nothing did i assist with more interest than at free conversation certain boys hover before me the biggest the fairest the most worthy of freedom dominating the scene and scattering upon fifty subjects the most surprising lights one of these heroes whose stature and complexion are still there for me to admire did tricks of legerdemain with the scant apparatus of a handkerchief a key a pocketknifeas to some one of which it is as fresh as yesterday that i ingenuously invited him to show me how to do it and then on his treating me with scorn renewed without dignity my fond solicitation fresher even than yesterday fadelessly fresh for me at this hour is the cutting remark thereupon of another boy who certainly wasnt simpson and whose identity is lost for me in his mere inspired authority oh oh oh i should think youd be too proud i had neither been too proud nor so much as conceived that one might be but i remember well how it flashed on me with this that i had failed thereby of a high luxury or privilegewhich the whole future however might help me to make up for to what extent it has helped is another matter but so fine was the force of the suggestion that i think i have never in all the years made certain returns upon my spirit without again feeling the pang from the cool little voice of the fourteenth street yard such was the moral exercise it at least allowed us room for it also allowed us room to be just for an inordinate consumption of hot waffles retailed by a benevolent black auntie who presided with her husbands aid as i remember at a portable stove set up in a passage or recess opening from the court to which we flocked and pushed in a merciless squeeze with all our coppers and the products of which the oblong farinaceous compound faintly yet richly brown stamped and smoking not crisp nor brittle but softly absorbent of the syrup dabbed upon it for a finish revealed to me i for a long time even for a very long time supposed the highest pleasure of sense we stamped about we freely conversed we ate sticky waffles by the hundredi recall no worse acts of violence unless i count as such our intermissional rushes to pynsents of the avenue a few doors off in the particular interest of a confection that ran the waffle close as the phrase is for popularity while even surpassing it for stickiness pynsents was higher up in the row in which forests had its frontother and dearer names have dropped from me but pynsents adheres with all the force of the strong saccharine principle this principle at its highest we conceived was embodied in small ambercoloured mounds of chopped cocoanut or whatever other substance if a finer there be profusely lusciously endued and distributed on small tin trays in the manner of haycocks in a field we acquired we appropriated we transported we enjoyed them they fairly formed perhaps after all our highest enjoyment but with consequences to our pocketsand i speak of those other than financial with an intimacy a reciprocity of contact at any or at every personal point that i lose myself in the thought of     xvii   i lose myself of a truth under the whole pressure of the spring of memory proceeding from recent revisitings and recognitionsthe action of the fact that time until lately had spared hereabouts and may still be sparing in the most exceptional way by an anomaly or a mercy of the rarest in new york a whole cluster of landmarks leaving me to spot and verify right and left the smallest preserved particulars these things at the pressure flush together again interweave their pattern and quite thrust it at me the absurd little fusion of images for a history or a picture of the timethe background of which i see after all so much less as the harsh sixth avenue corner than as many other matters those scant shades claimed us but briefly and superficially and it comes back to me that oddly enough in the light of autumn afternoons our associates the most animated or at any rate the best put in little figures of our landscape were not our comparatively obscure schoolmates who seem mostly to have swum out of our ken between any day and its morrow our other companions those we practically knew at home ignored our school having better or worse of their own but peopled somehow for us the social scene which figuring there for me in documentary vividness bristles with van burens van winkles de peysters costers senters norcoms robinsons these last composing round a stonethrowing eugene wards hunts and tutti quantito whose ranks i must add our invariable albert beforementioned and who swarm from up and down and east and west appearing to me surely to have formed a rich and various society our salon it is true was mainly the street loose and rude and crude in those days at bestthough with a rapid increase of redeeming features to the extent to which the spread of micaceous brown stone could redeem as exhibited especially in the ample face of the scotch presbyterian church promptly rising just opposite our own peculiar row and which it now marks for me somewhat grimly a span of life to have seen laboriously rear itself continuously flourish and utterly disappear while in construction it was only less interesting than the dancingacademy of mr edward ferrero slightly west of it and forming with it in their embryonic stage a large and delightfully dangerous adjunct to our playground though with the distinction of coming much to surpass it for interest in the final phase while we clambered about on ladders and toyed with the peril of unfloored abysses while we trespassed and pried and pervaded snatching a scant impression from sorry material enough clearly the sacred edifice enjoyed a credit beyond that of the profane but when both were finished and opened we flocked to the sound of the fiddle more freely it need scarce be said than to that of the psalm freely indeed in our particular case scarce expresses the latter relation since our young liberty in respect to churchgoing was absolute and we might range at will through the great city from one place of worship and one form of faith to another or might on occasion ignore them all equally which was what we mainly did whereas we rallied without a break to the halls of ferrero a view of the staringly and as i supposed dazzlingly frescoed walls the internal economy the high amenity the general æsthetic and social appeal of which still hangs in its wealth before me dr mcelroy uplifting tightclosed eyes strange longdrawn accents and gaunt scraggy chin squirming and swaying and cushionthumping in his only a shade more chastely adorned temple is distinct enough toojust as we enjoyed this bleak intensity the more to my personal vision through the vague legend and no legend was too vague for me to cherish of his being the next pastor in succession to the one under whom our mother thereto predirected by our good greatgrandfather alexander robertson already named who was nothing if not scotch and presbyterian and authoritative as his brave old portrait by the elder jarves attests had sat before her marriage the marriage so lamentedly diverting her indeed from this tradition that to mark the rueful rupture it had invoked one evening with the aid of india muslin and a wondrous gold headband in the maternal the washington square parlours but the secular nuptial consecration of the then mayor of the cityi think mr varick  we progeny were of course after this mild convulsion not at all in the fold yet it strikes me as the happy note of a simple age that we were practically of a sunday at least wherever we might have chosen to enter since going forth hand in hand into the sunshine and i connect myself here with my next younger not with my elder brother whose orbit was other and larger we sampled in modern phrase as small unprejudiced inquirers obeying their inspiration any resort of any congregation detected by us doing so i make out moreover with a sense of earnest provision for any contemporary challenge what church do you go tothe challenge took in childish circles that searching form of the form it took among our elders my impression is more vague to which i must add as well that our fending in this fashion for ourselves didnt so prepare us for invidious remarkremark i mean upon our pewless state which involved to my imagination much the same discredit that a houseless or a cookless would have doneas to hush in my breast the appeal to our parents not for religious instruction of which we had plenty and of the most charming and familiar but simply for instruction a very different thing as to where we should say we went in our world under cold scrutiny or derisive comment it was colder than any criticism i recall to hear our father reply that we could plead nothing less than the whole privilege of christendom and that there was no communion even that of the catholics even that of the jews even that of the swedenborgians from which we need find ourselves excluded with the freedom we enjoyed our dilemma clearly amused him it would have been impossible he affirmed to be theologically more en règle how as mere detached unaccompanied infants we enjoyed such impunity of range and confidence of welcome is beyond comprehension save by the light of the old manners and conditions the old local bonhomie the comparatively primal innocence the absence of complications with the several notes of which last beatitude my reminiscence surely shines it was the theory of the time and place that the young were they but young enough could take publicly no harm to which adds itself moreover and touchingly enough all the difference of the old importances it wasnt doubtless that the social or call it simply the human position of the child was higher than todaya circumstance not conceivable it was simply that other dignities and values and claims other social and human positions were less definite and settled less prescriptive and absolute a rich sophistication is after all a gradual growth and it would have been sophisticated to fear for us before such bright and vacant vistas the perils of the way or to see us received anywhere even with the irony of patronage we hadnt in fact seats of honour but that justice was done usthat is that we were placed to our advantagei infer from my having liked so to go even though my grounds may have been but the love of the exhibition in general thanks to which figures faces furniture sounds smells and colours became for me wherever enjoyed and enjoyed most where most collected a positive little orgy of the senses and riot of the mind let me at the same time make the point thatsuch may be the snobbery of extreme youthi not only failed quite to rise to the parental reasoning but made out in it rather a certain sophistry such a prevarication for instance as if we had habitually said we kept the carriage we observably didnt keep kept it because we sent when we wanted one to university place where mr hathorn had his liverystable a connection this last promoted by my fathers frequent need of the aid to circulate his walks were limited through an injury received in youth and promoting in turn and at a touch to my consciousness the stir of small the smallest remembered things i recall the adventure no infrequent one of being despatched to mr hathorn to bespeak a conveyance and the very air and odour the genial warmth at a fine steaming irish pitch of the stables and their stamping and backing beasts their resounding boardedness their chairs tipped up at such an angle for lifted heels a pair of which latter seek the floor again at my appeal as those of big bearded mr hathorn himself an impression enriched by the drive home in lolling and bumping possession of the great vehicle and associated further with sunday afternoons in spring with the question of distant harlem and remoter bloomingdale with the experience at one of these junctures of faraway hoboken if it wasnt williamsburg which fits in fancifully somewhere when the carriage was reinforced by a ferry and the ferry by something something to my present vision very dim and dusty and archaic something quite ragged and graceless in the nature of a public teagarden and ices the finest link here however is for some reason with the new york hotel and thereby with albany uncles thereby also with mr hathorn in person waiting and waiting expensively on his box before the house and somehow felt as attuned to albany uncles even as mrs cannon had subtly struck me as being  intenser than these vague shades meanwhile is my vision of the halls of ferrerowhere the orgy of the senses and even the riot of the mind of which i have just spoken must quite literally have led me more of a dance than anywhere let this sketch of a lost order note withal that under so scant a general provision for infant exercise as distinguished from infant ease our hopping and sliding in tune had to be deemed urgent it was the sense for this form of relief that clearly was general superseding as the ampler ferrero scene did previous limited exhibitions even those for that matter coming back to me in the ancient person of m charriaui guess at the writing of his namewhom i work in but confusedly as a professional visitor a subject gaped at across a gulf of fear in one of our huddled schools all the more that i perfectly evoke him as resembling with a difference or two the portraits of the aged voltaire and that he had fiddle in hand and jarret tendu incited the young agility of our mother and aunt edward ferrero was another matter in the prime of life goodlooking romantic and moustachiod he was suddenly to figure on the outbreak of the civil war as a general of volunteersvery much as if he had been one of bonapartes improvised young marshals in anticipation of which however he wasnt at all fierce or superior to my remembrance but most kind to sprawling youth in a charming man of the world fashion and as if we wanted but a touch to become also men of the world remarkably goodlooking as i say by the measure of that period and extraordinarily agilehe could so gracefully leap and bound that his bounding into the military saddle such occasion offering had all the felicity and only wanted the pink fleshings of the circushe was still more admired by the mothers with whom he had to my eyes a most elegant relation than by the pupils among all of whom at the frequent and delightful soirées he caused trays laden with lucent syrups repeatedly to circulate the scale of these entertainments as i figured it and the florid frescoes just damp though they were with newness and the free lemonade and the freedom of remark equally great with the mothers were the lavish note in himjust as the fact that he never himself fiddled but was followed over the shining parquet by attendant fiddlers represented doubtless a shadow the less on his later dignity so far as that dignity was compassed dignity marked in full measure even at the time the presence of his sister madame dubreuil a handsome authoritative person who instructed us equally in fact preponderantly and who though comparatively not sympathetic so engaged physiognomically my wondering interest that i hear to this hour her shrill francoamerican accent dont look at me little boylook at my feet i see them now these somewhat fat members beneath the uplifted skirt encased in bronzed slippers without heels but attached by graceful crossbands over her white stockings to her solid anklesan emphatic sign of the time not less than i recover my surprised sense of their supporting her without loss of balance substantial as she was in the first position her command of which her ankles clapped close together and her body very erect was so perfect that even with her toes right and left fairly turning the corner backward she never fell prone on her face  it consorted somehow with this wealth of resource in her that she appeared at the soirées or at least at the great fancydress soirée in which the historic truth of my experience free lemonade and all is doubtless really shut up as the genius of california a dazzling vision of white satin and golden flouncesher brother meanwhile maintaining that more distinctively european colour which i feel to have been for my young presumption the convincing essence of the scene in the character of a mousquetaire de louis quinze highly consonant with his type there hovered in the background a flushed fullchested and tawnily shortbearded m dubreuil who as a singer of the heavy order at the opera carried us off into larger things stillthe opera having at last about then after dwelling for years down town in shifty tents and tabernacles set up its own spacious pavilion and reared its head as the academy of music all at the end or what served for the end of our very street where though it wasnt exactly near and union square bristled between i could yet occasionally gape at the great bills beside the portal in which m dubreuil always so serviceably came in at the bottom of the cast a subordinate artist a grand utility at the best i believe and presently to become on that scene slightly ragged i fear even in its freshness permanent stagemanager or as we say nowadays producer he had yet eminently to my imagination the richer the european value especially for instance when our air thrilled in the sense that our attentive parents reechoed with the visit of the great grisi and the great mario and i seemed though the art of advertisement was then comparatively so young and so chaste to see our personal acquaintance as he could almost be called thickly sandwiched between them such was ones strange sense for the connections of things that they drew out the halls of ferrero till these too seemed fairly to resound with norma and lucrezia borgia as if opening straight upon the stage and europe by the stroke had come to us in such force that we had but to enjoy it on the spot that could never have been more the case than on the occasion of my assuming for the famous fancyballnot at the operatic academy but at the dancingschool which came so nearly to the same thingthe dress of a débardeur whatever that might be which carried in its puckered folds of dark green relieved with scarlet and silver such an exotic fragrance and appealed to me by such a legend the legend had come round to us it was true by way of albany whence we learned at the moment of our need that one of the adventures one of the least lamentable of our cousin johnny had been his figuring as a débardeur at some parisian revel the elegant evidence of which neatly packed though with but vague instructions for use was helpfully sent on to us the instructions for use were in fact so vague that i was afterward to become a bit ruefully conscious of having sadly dishonoured or at least abbreviated my model i fell that is i stood short of my proper form by no less than half a leg the essence of the débardeur being it appeared that he emerged at the knees in white silk stockings and with neat calves from the beribboned breeches which i artlessly suffered to flap at my ankles the discovery after the fact was disconcertingyet had been best made withal too late for it would have seemed i conceive a less monstrous act to attempt to lengthen my legs than to shorten johnnys culotte the trouble had been that we hadnt really known what a débardeur was and i am not sure indeed that i know to this day it had been more fatal still that even fond albany couldnt tell us     xviii   i have nevertheless the memory of a restless relish of all that timeby which i mean of those final months of new york even with so scant a record of other positive successes to console me i had but one success alwaysthat of endlessly supposing wondering admiring i was sunk in that luxury which had never yet been so great and it might well make up for anything it made up perfectly and more particularly as the stopgap as which i have already defined it for the scantness of the period immediately round us since how could i have wanted richer when the limits of reality as i advanced upon them seemed ever to recede and recede it is true that but the other day on the scene revisited i was to be struck rather as by their weird immobility there on the north side still untenanted after sixty years a tremendous span in the life of new york was the vacant lot undiminished in which a friendly goat or two used to browse whom we fed perversely with scraps of paper just as perversely appreciated indeed through the relaxed wooden palings there hovers for me an impression of the glass roofs of a florist a suffered squatter for a while but florists and goats have alike disappeared and the barrenness of the place is as sordid as only untended gaps in great cities can seem one of its boundaries however still breathes associationsthe home of the wards the more eastward of a pair of houses then and still isolated has remained the same through all vicissitudes only now quite shabbily mellow and like everything else much smaller than one had remembered it yet this too without prejudice to the large the lustrous part played in our prospect by that interesting family i saddle their mild memory a bit subjectively perhaps with the burden of that charactermaking out that they were interesting really in spite of themselves and as unwittingly as m jourdain expressed himself in prose owing their wild savour as they did to that new england stamp which we took to be strong upon them and no other exhibition of which we had yet enjoyed it made them different made them in their homely grace rather aridly romantic i pored in those days over the freshness of the franconia stories of the brothers abbott then immediately sequent to the sweet rollo series and even more admired and there hung about the wards to my sense that atmosphere of apples and nuts and cheese of pies and jackknives and squrruls of domestic biblereading and attendance at evening lecture of the fear of parental discipline and the cultivated art of dodging it combined with great personal toughness and hardihood an almost envied liability to warts on hard brown hands a familiarity with garments domestically wrought a brave rusticity in short that yet hadnt prevented the annexation of whole tracts of town life unexplored by ourselves and achieved by the brothers since their relatively recent migration from connecticutwhich state in general with the city of hartford in particular hung as a hazy fruity rivery background the very essence of indian summer in the rear of their discourse three in number johnny and charley and freddy with castigating elders even to the second and third generation back dimly discerned through closed windowpanes they didnt at all haunt the halls of ferreroit was a part of their homely grace and their social tone if not of their want of the latter that this couldnt in the least be in question for them on the other hand they frequented charley and freddy at least the free school which was round in thirteenth streetjohnny the eldest having entered the free academy an institution that loomed large to us and that i see as towered or castellated or otherwise impressively embellished in vague vignettes in stray representations perhaps only of the grey schoolbook order which are yet associated for me with those fond images of lovely ladies handpainted decorating at either end the interior of the old omnibusses we must have been in relation with no other feeders at the public trough of learningi cant account otherwise for the glamour as of envied privilege and strange experience that surrounded the wards they mixed to the great sharpening of the edge of their wit in the wild life of the people beside which the life at mr pulling jenkss and even at the institution vergnès was colourless and commonplace somehow they were of the people and still were full of family formswhich seemed one dimly made out through the false perspective of all the cousinships the stronger and clearer note of new england the note that had already determined a shy yearning under perusal of the rollo and franconia chronicles the special mark of these friends was perhaps however that of being socially young while they were annually old little freddy in particular very short very inured and very popular though less curiously wrinkled about eyes and mouth than charley confessed to monstrous birthdays even while crouching or hopping even while racing or roaring as a high superiority in the games of the street prescribed it was to strike me later on when reading or hearing of young americans of those parts who had turned hard or reckless by reaction from excessive discipline theologic and economic and had gone to sea or to california or to the bad that freddy and charley were typical of the race even if their fortunes had taken as i hoped a happier form that i said to myself for the interest of it that the stuff of the wards their homely grace was all new englandso far at least as new england wasnt emerson and margaret fuller and mr channing and the best boston families such in small very plastic minds is the intensity if not the value of early impressions  and yet how can such visions not have paled in the southern glow of the norcoms who had lately arrived en masse from louisville and had improvised a fine old kentucky home in the last house of our rowthe one to be occupied so differently after their strange and precipitate flight as i dimly make out by the ladies of the sacred heart those who presently if i mistake not moved out to bloomingdale if they were not already in part established there next us westward were the ogdens three slim and fair sisters who soared far above us in age and general amenity then came the van winkles two sisters i think and a brotherhe much the most serious and judicious as well as the most educated of our friends and so at last the norcoms during their brief but concentrated most vivid and momentous reign a matter as i recall it of a couple of breathless winters we were provided by their presence with as happy a foil as we could have wished to the plainness and dryness of the wards their homely grace was all their own and was also embodied in three brothers eugene reginald albert whose ages would have corresponded i surmise with those of johnny charley and freddy if these latter hadnt in their way as i have hinted defied any close notation elder sonsthere were to my recollection no daughtersmoved too as with their heads in the clouds notably stiffy eldest of all whom we supposed gorgeous who affected us as sublime and unapproachable and to whom we thus applied the term in use among us before we had acquired for reference to such types the notion of the nuance the dandy the dude the masher divided i was i recall between the dread and the glory of being so greeted well stiffy as a penalty of the least attempt at personal adornment the higher intensity for our sense of the norcoms came from the large the lavish ease of their hospitality whereas our intercourse with the wards was mainly in the street or at most the yardand it was a wonder how intimacy could to that degree consort with publicity a glazed southern gallery known to its occupants as the pooch and to the rake of which their innermost penetralia seemed ever to stand open encompasses my other memories everything took place on the pooch including the free quite the profuse consumption of hot cakes and molasses including even the domestic manufacture of sausages testified to by a strange machine that was worked like a handorgan and by the casual halves when not the wholes of stark stiff hogs fresh from kentucky stores we must have been for a time constantly engaged with this delightful group who never ceased to welcome us or to feed us and yet of the presence of whose members under other roofs than their own by a return of hospitality received i retain no image they didnt count and didnt grudgethe sausagemill kept turning and the molasses flowing for all who came that was the expression of their southern grace especially embodied in albert my exact contemporary and chosen friend reggie had but crushed my fingers under the hinge of a closing door the mark of which act of inadvertence i was to carry through life who had profuse and tightlycrinkled hair and the moral of whose queer little triangular brown teeth casting verily a shade on my attachment to him was pointed for me not by himself as the error of a kentucky diet  the great kentucky error however had been the introduction into a free state of two pieces of precious property which our friends were to fail to preserve the pair of affectionate black retainers whose presence contributed most to their exotic note we revelled in the fact that davy and aunt sylvia pronounced ansilvy a lightbrown lad with extraordinarily shining eyes and his straight grave deepercoloured mother not radiant as to anything but her vivid turban had been born and kept in slavery of the most approved pattern and such as this intensity of their condition made them a joy a joy to the curious mind to consort with davy mingled in our sports and talk he enriched he adorned them with a personal a pictorial lustre that none of us could emulate and servitude in the absolute thus did more for him socially than we had ever seen done above stairs or below for victims of its lighter forms what was not our dismay therefore when we suddenly learntit must have blown right up and down the streetthat mother and son had fled in the dead of night from bondage had taken advantage of their visit to the north simply to leave the house and not return covering their tracks successfully disappearing they had never been for us so beautifully slaves as in this achievement of their freedom for they did brilliantly achieve itthey escaped on northern soil beyond recall or recovery i think we had already then on the spot the sense of some degree of presence at the making of history the question of what persons of colour and of their condition might or mightnt do was intensely in the air this was exactly the season of the freshness of mrs stowes great novel it must have come out at the moment of our fondest acquaintance with our neighbours though i have no recollection of hearing them remark upon itany remark they made would have been sure to be so strong i suspect they hadnt read it as they certainly wouldnt have allowed it in the house any more indeed than they had read or were likely ever to read any other work of fiction i doubt whether the house contained a printed volume unless its head had had in hand a lawbook or so i to some extent recover mr norcom as a lawyer who had come north on important difficult business on contentious precarious groundsa large bald politicallooking man very loose and ungirt just as his wife was a desiccated depressed lady who mystified me by always wearing her nightcap a feeblyfrilled but tightlytied and unmistakable one and the compass of whose maternal figure beneath a large long collarless cape or mantle defined imperfectly for me of course its connection with the further increase of alberts little brothers and sisters there being already by my impression two or three of these in the background had davy and ansilvy at least read uncle tomthat question might well come up for us with the certainty at any rate that they ignored him less than their owners were doing these latter good people who had been so fond of their humble dependents and supposed this affection returned were shocked at such ingratitude though i remember taking a vague little inward northern comfort in their inability in their discreet decision not to raise the hue and cry wasnt one even just dimly aware of the heavy hush that in the glazed gallery among the sausages and the johnnycakes had followed the first gasp of resentment i think the honest norcoms were in any case astonished let alone being much incommoded just as we were for that matter when the genial family itself installed so at its ease failed us with an effect of abruptness simply ceased in their multitude to be there i dont remember their going nor any pangs of parting i remember only knowing with wonderment that they had gone that obscurity had somehow engulfed them and how afterwards in the light of later things memory and fancy attended them figured their history as the public complication grew and the great intersectional plot thickened felt even absurdly and disproportionately that they had helped one to know southerners the slim the sallow the straighthaired and darkeyed eugene in particular haunted my imagination he had not been my comrade of electionhe was too much my senior but i cherished the thought of the fine fearless young fireeater he would have become and when the war had broken out i know not what dark but pitying vision of him stretched stark after a battle  all of which sounds certainly like a meagre rangewhich heaven knows it was but with a plea for the several attics already glanced at and the positive æsthetic reach that came to us through those dim resorts quite worth making they were scattered and they constituted on the part of such of our friends as had license to lead us up to them a ground of authority and glory proportioned exactly to the size of the field this extent was at cousin helens with a large house and few inmates vast and free so that no hospitality under the eaves might have matched that offered us by the young albertif only that heir of all the ages had had rather more imagination he had i think as little as was possiblewhich would have counted in fact for an unmitigated blank had not w j among us on that spot and elsewhere supplied this motive force in any quantity required he imaginedthat was the pointthe comprehensive comedies we were to prepare and to act comprehensive by the fact that each one of us even to the godfearing but surreptitiously lawbreaking wards was in fairness to be enabled to figure not one of us but was somehow to be provided with a part though i recall my brother as the constant comic star the attics were thus in a word our respective temples of the dramatemples in which the stage the greenroom and the wardrobe however strike me as having consumed most of our margin i remember that is up and down the streetand the association is mainly with its far westward reachesso much more preparation than performance so much more conversation and costume than active rehearsal and on the part of some of us especially doubtless on my own so much more eager denudation both of body and mind than of achieved or inspired assumption we shivered unclad and impatient both as to our persons and to our aims waiting alike for ideas and for breeches we were supposed to make our dresses no less than to create our characters and our material was in each direction apt to run short i remember how far ahead of us my brother seemed to keep announcing a motive producing a figure throwing off into space conceptions that i could stare at across the interval but couldnt appropriate so that my vision of him in these connections is not so much of his coming toward me or toward any of us as of his moving rapidly away in fantastic garb and with his back turned as if to perform to some other and more assured public there were indeed other publics publics downstairs who glimmer before me seated at the open foldingdoors of ancient parlours but all from the point of view of an absolute supernumerary more or less squashed into the wing but never coming on who were the copious huntswhose ample house on the north side toward seventh avenue still stands next or near that of the de peysters so that i perhaps confound some of the attributes of each though clear as to the blond beekman or beek of the latter race not less than to the robust george and the stout the very stout henry of the former whom i see bounding before a gathered audience for the execution of a pas seul clad in a garment of turkey red fashioned by his own hands and giving way at the seams to a complete absence of dessous under the strain of too fine a figure this too though i make out in those connections that is in the twilight of hunt and de peyster garrets our command of a comparative welter of draperies so that i am reduced to the surmise that henry indeed had contours  i recover further some sense of the high places of the van winkles but think of them as pervaded for us by the upper air of the proprieties the proprieties that were so numerous it would appear when once one had had a glimpse of them rather than by the crude fruits of young improvisation wonderful must it clearly have been still to fed amid laxities and vaguenesses such a difference of milieux and as they used to say of atmospheres this was a word of those daysatmospheres were a thing to recognise and cultivate for people really wanted them gasped for them which was why they took them on the whole on easy terms never exposing them under an apparent flush to the last analysis did we at any rate really vibrate to one social tone after another or are these adventures for me now but fond imaginations no we vibratedor ill be hanged as i may say if i didnt little as i could tell it or may have known it little as anyone else may have known there were shades after all in our democratic order in fact as i brood back to it i recognise oppositions the sharpest contrasts the most intense it wasnt given to us all to have a social tone but the costers surely had one and kept it in constant use whereas the wards next door to them were possessed of no approach to any and indeed had the case been other had they had such a consciousness would never have employed it would have put it away on a high shelf as they put the lastbaked pie out of freddys and charleys reachheaven knows what they two would have done with it the van winkles on the other hand were distinctly so provided but with the special note that their provision was one so to express it with their educational their informational call it even their professional mr van winkle if i mistake not was an eminent lawyer and the note of our own house was the absence of any profession to the quickening of our general as distinguished from our special sensibility there was no turkey red among those particular neighbours at all events and if there had been it wouldnt have gaped at the seams i didnt then know it but i sipped at a fount of culture in the sense that is that our connection with the house being through edgar he knew about thingsinordinately as it struck me so for that matter did little public freddy ward but the things one of them knew about differed wholly from the objects of knowledge of the other all of which was splendid for giving one exactly a sense of things it intimated more and more how many such there would be altogether and part of the interest was that while freddy gathered his among the wild wastes edgar walked in a regular maze of culture i didnt then know about culture but edgar must promptly have known this impression was promoted by his moving in a distant a higher sphere of study amid scenes vague to me i dimly descry him as appearing at jenkss and vanishing again as if even that hadnt been good enoughthough i may be here at fault and indeed can scarce say on what arduous heights i supposed him as a dayscholar to dwell i took the unknown always easily for the magnificent and was sure only of the limits of what i saw it wasnt that the boys swarming for us at school were not often to my vision unlimited but that those peopling our hours of ease as i have already noted were almost inveterately sothey seemed to describe always out of view so much larger circles i linger thus on edgar by reason of its having somehow seemed to us that he describedwas it at doctor anthonsthe largest of all if there was a bigger place than doctor anthons it was there he would have been i break down as to the detail of the matter in any push toward vaster suppositions but let me cease to stir this imponderable dust     xix   i try at least to recover here however some closer notation of w js aspectsyet only with the odd effect of my either quite losing him or but apprehending him again at seated play with his pencil under the lamp when i see him he is intently though summarily rapidly drawing his head critically balanced and his eyebrows working and when i dont see him it is because i have resignedly relinquished him i cant have been often for him a deprecated still less an actively rebuffed suitor because as i say again such aggressions were so little in order for me but i remember that on my once offering him my company in conditions those of some planned excursion in which it wasnt desired his putting the question of our difference at rest with the minimum of explanation by the responsible remark i play with boys who curse and swear i had sadly to recognise that i didnt that i couldnt pretend to have come to that yetand truly as i look back either the unadvisedness and inexpertness of my young contemporaries on all that ground must have been complete an interesting note on our general manners after all or my personal failure to grasp must have been besides which i wonder scarce less now than i wondered then in just what company my brothers privilege was exercised though if he had but richly wished to be discouraging he quite succeeded it wasnt that i mightnt have been drawn to the boys in question but that i simply wasnt qualified all boys i rather found were difficult to play withunless it was that they rather found me but who would have been so difficult as these they account but little moreover i make out for w js eclipses so that i take refuge easily enough in the memory of my own pursuits absorbing enough at times to have excluded other views i also plied the pencil or to be more exact the peneven if neither implement critically rapidly or summarily i was so often engaged at that period it strikes me in literaryor to be more precise in dramatic accompanied by pictorial compositionthat i must again and again have delightfully lost myself i had not on any occasion personally succeeded amid our theatric strife in reaching the footlights but how could i have doubted nevertheless with our large theatrical experience of the nature and of my understanding of the dramatic form i sacrificed to it with devotionby the aid of certain quarto sheets of ruled paper bought in sixth avenue for the purpose my fathers store though i held him a great fancier of the article in general supplied but the unruled grateful in particular for the happy provision by which each fourth page of the folded sheet was left blank when the drama itself had covered three pages the last one over which i most laboured served for the illustration of what i had verbally presented every scene had thus its explanatory picture and as each actthough i am not positively certain i arrived at actswould have had its vivid climax addicted in that degree to fictive evocation i yet recall on my part no practice whatever of narrative prose or any sort of verse i cherished the sceneas i had so vibrated to the idea of it that evening at linwood i thought i lisped at any rate i composed in scenes though how much or how far the scenes came is another affair entrances exits the indication of business the animation of dialogue the multiplication of designated characters were things delightful in themselveswhile i panted toward the canvas on which i should fling my figures which it took me longer to fill than it had taken me to write what went with it but which had on the other hand something of the interest of the dramatists casting of his personæ and must have helped me to believe in the validity of my subject  from where on these occasions that subject can have dropped for me i am at a loss to say and indeed have a strong impression that i didnt at any moment quite know what i was writing about i am sure i couldnt otherwise have written so much with scenes when i think what certitude did i want morescenes being the root of the matter especially when they bristled with proper names and noted movements especially above all when they flowered at every pretext into the very optic and perspective of the stage where the boards diverged correctly from a central point of vision even as the lashes from an eyelid straight down to the footlights let this reminiscence remind us of how rarely in those days the real stage was carpeted the difficulty of composition was naught the one difficulty was in so placing my figures on the fourth page that these radiations could be marked without making lines through them the odd part of all of which was that whereas my cultivation of the picture was maintained my practice of the play my addiction to scenes presently quite dropped i was capable of learning though with inordinate slowness to express ideas in scenes and was not capable with whatever patience of making proper pictures yet i aspired to this form of design to the prejudice of any other and long after those primitive hours was still wasting time in attempts at it i cared so much for nothing else and that vaguely redressed as to a point my general failure of acuteness i nursed the conviction or at least i tried to that if my clutch of the pencil or of the watercolour brush should once become intense enough it would make up for other weaknesses of graspmuch as that would certainly give it to do this was a very false scent which had however the excuse that my brothers example really couldnt but act upon methe scent was apparently so true for him from the moment my small interest in art that is my bent for gaping at illustrations and exhibitions was absorbing and genuine there were elements in the case that made it natural the picture the representative design directly and strongly appealed to me and was to appeal all my days and i was only slow to recognise the kind in this order that appealed most my face was turned from the first to the idea of representationthat of the gain of charm interest mystery dignity distinction gain of importance in fine on the part of the represented thing over the thing of accident of mere actuality still unappropriated but in the house of representation there were many chambers each with its own lock and long was to be the business of sorting and trying the keys when i at last found deep in my pocket the one i could more or less work it was to feel with reassurance that the picture was still after all in essence ones aim so there had been in a manner continuity been not so much waste as one had sometimes ruefully figured so many wastes are sweetened for memory as by the taste of the economy they have led to or imposed and from the vantage of which they could scarce look better if they had been current and blatant profit wasnt the very bareness of the field itself moreover a challenge in a degree to designnot i mean that there seemed to ones infant eyes too few things to paint as to that there were always plentybut for the very reason that there were more than anyone noticed and that a hunger was thus engendered which one cast about to gratify the gratification nearest home was the imitative the emulativethat is on my part w j i see needed no reasons no consciousness other than that of being easily able so he drew because he could while i did so in the main only because he did though i think we cast about as i say alike making the most of every image within view i doubt if he made more than i even then did though earlier able to account for what he made afterwards on other ground and in richer air i admit the challenge was in the fulness and not in the bareness of aspects with their natural result of hunger appeased exhibitions illustrations abounded in paris and londonthe reflected image hung everywhere about so that if there we daubed afresh and with more confidence it was not because noone but because everyone did in fact when i call our appetite appeased i speak less of our browsing vision which was tethered and insatiable than of our sense of the quite normal character of our own proceedings in europe we knew there was art just as there were soldiers and lodgings and concierges and little boys in the streets who stared at us especially at our hats and boots as at things of derisionjust as to put it negatively there were practically no hot rolls and no iced water perhaps too i should add we didnt enjoy the works of mr benjamin haydon then clustered at the pantheon in oxford street which in due course became our favourite haunt so infinitely more after all than we had enjoyed those arrayed at the düsseldorf collection in broadway whence the huge canvas of the martyrdom of john huss comes back to me in fact as a revelation of representational brightness and charm that pitched once for all in these matters my young sense of what should be  ineffable unsurpassable those hours of initiation which the broadway of the fifties had been when all was said so adequate to supply if one wanted pictures there were pictures as large i seem to remember as the side of a house and of a bravery of colour and lustre of surface that i was never afterwards to see surpassed we were shown without doubt under our genial law here too everything there was and as i cast up the items i wonder i confess what ampler fare we could have dealt with the düsseldorf school commanded the market and i think of its exhibition as firmly seated going on from year to yearnew york judging now to such another tune must have been a brave patron of that manufacture i believe that scandal even was on occasion not evaded rather was boldly invoked though of what particular sacrifices to the pure plastic or undraped shocks to bourgeois prejudice the comfortable german genius of that period may have been capable history has kept no record new accessions at any rate vividly new ones in which the freshness and brightness of the paint particularly lustrous in our copious light enhanced from time to time the show which i have the sense of our thus repeatedly and earnestly visiting and which comes back to me with some vagueness as installed in a disaffected church where gothic excrescences and an ecclesiastical roof of a mild order helped the importance no impression here however was half so momentous as that of the epochmaking masterpiece of mr leutze which showed us washington crossing the delaware in a wondrous flare of projected gaslight and with the effect of a revelation to my young sight of the capacity of accessories to stand out i live again in the thrill of that eveningwhich was the greater of course for my feeling it in my parents company when i should otherwise have been in bed we went down after dinner in the fourteenth street stage quite as if going to the theatre the scene of exhibition was near the stuyvesant institute a circumstance stirring up somehow a swarm of associations echoes probably of lectures discussed at home yet at which my attendance had doubtless conveniently lapsed but mr leutzes drama left behind any paler proscenium we gaped responsive to every item lost in the marvel of the wintry light of the sharpness of the iceblocks of the sickness of the sick soldier of the protrusion of the minor objects that of the strands of the rope and the nails of the boots that i say on the part of everything of its determined purpose of standing out but that above all of the profiled national heros purpose as might be said of standing up as much as possible even indeed of doing it almost on one leg in such difficulties and successfully balancing so memorable was that evening to remain for me that nothing could be more strange in connection with it than the illustration by the admired work on its in after years again coming before me of the cold cruelty with which time may turn and devour its children the picture more or less entombed in its relegation was lividly deadand that was bad enough but half the substance of ones youth seemed buried with it there were other pictorial evenings i may add not all of which had the thrill deep the disappointment on my own part i remember at bryans gallery of christian art to which also as for great emotions we had taken the omnibus after dinner it cast a chill this collection of wormeaten diptychs and triptychs of angular saints and seraphs of black madonnas and obscure bambinos of such marked and approved primitives as had never yet been shipped to our shores mr bryans shipment was presently to fall i believe under grave suspicion was to undergo in fact fatal exposure but it appealed at the moment in apparent good faith and i have not forgotten how conscious that it was fresh from europefresh was beautiful in the connectioni felt that my yearning should all have gone out to it with that inconsequence to handle i doubt whether i proclaimed that it bored meany more than i have ever noted till now that it made me begin badly with christian art i like to think that the collection consisted without abatement of frauds and fakes and that if these had been honest things my perception wouldnt so have slumbered yet the principle of interest had been somehow compromised and i think i have never since stood before a real primitive a primitive of the primitives without having first to shake off the grey mantle of that night the main disconcertment had been its ugly twist to the name of italy already sweet to me for all its dimnesseven could dimness have prevailed in my felt measure of the pictorial testimony of home testimony that dropped for us from the ample canvas of mr cole the american turner which covered half a side of our front parlour and in which though not an object represented in it began to stand out after the manner of mr leutze i could always lose myself as soon as look it depicted florence from one of the neighbouring hillsi have often since wondered which the picture being long ago lost to our sight florence with her domes and towers and old walls the old walls mr cole had engaged for but which i was ruefully to miss on coming to know and love the place in after years then it was i felt how long before my attachment had started on its coursethat closer vision was no beginning it only took up the tale just as it comes to me again today at the end of time that the contemplative monk seated on a terrace in the foreground a constant friend of my childhood must have been of the convent of san miniato which gives me the site from which the painter wrought we had italy again in the corresponding room behinda great abundance of italy i was free to think while i revolved between another large landscape over the sofa and the classic marble bust on a pedestal between the two back windows the figure a part of the figure of a lady with her head crowned with vineleaves and her hair disposed with a laxity that was emulated by the front of her dress as my next younger brother exposed himself to my derision by calling the bit of brocade simulated by the chisel that depending from a single shoulderstrap so imperfectly covered her this image was known and admired among us as the bacchante she had come to us straight from an american studio in rome and i see my horizon flush again with the first faint dawn of conscious appreciation or in other words of the critical spirit while two or three of the more restrictive friends of the house find our marble lady very cold for a bacchante cold indeed she must have beenquite as of the tombstone temperament but that objection would drop if she might only be called a nymph since nymphs were mild and moderate and since discussion of a work of art mainly hung in those days on that issue of the producible name i fondly recall by the same token that playing on a certain occasion over the landscape above the sofa restrictive criticism uttered in my indulged hearing introduced me to what had probably been my very first chance on such ground for active participation the picture from the hand of a french painter m lefèvre and of but slightly scanter extent than the work of mr cole represented in frank rich colours and as a socalled view in tuscany a rural scene of some exuberance a broken and precipitous place amid mountains and forests where two or three barelegged peasants or woodmen were engaged with much emphasis of posture in felling a badly gashed but spreading oak by means of a tense rope attached to an upper limb and at which they pulled together tuscanyare you sure its tuscany said the voice of restrictive criticism that of the friend of the house who in the golden age of the precursors though we were still pretty much precursors had lived longest in italy and then on my fathers challenge of this demur oh in tuscany you know the colours are much softerthere would be a certain haze in the atmosphere why of course i can hear myself now blushingly but triumphantly interminglethe softness and the haze of our florence there isnt florence in tuscany it had to be parentally admitted that florence wasbesides which our friend had been there and knew so that thereafter within our walls a certain malaise reigned for if the florence was like it then the lefèvre couldnt be and if the lefèvre was like it then the florence couldnt a lapse from old convenienceas from the moment we couldnt name the lefèvre where were we all of which it might have been open to me to feel i had uncannily promoted     xx   my own sense of the great matter meanwhilethat is of our possibilities still more than of our actualities of italy in general and of florence in particularwas a perfectly recoverable little awareness as i find of certain mild soft irregular breathings thence on the part of an absent pair in whom our parents were closely interested and whose communications whose roman sorrentine florentine letters letters in especial from the baths of lucca kept open in our air more than any other sweet irritation that question of europe which was to have after all in the immediate years so limited so shortened a solution mary temple the elder had early in our fourteenth street period married edmund tweedy a haunter of that neighbourhood and of our house in it from the first but never more than during a winter spent with us there by that quasirelative who by an extension of interest and admirationshe was in those years quite exceedingly handsomeranked for us with the albany aunts adding so a twist as it were to our tie with the temple cousins her own close kin this couple must have been putting real relatives aside my parents best friends in europe twitching thereby hardest the fine firm thread attached at one end to our general desire and at the other to their supposed felicity the real relatives those planted out in the same countries are a chapter by themselves whose effect on us whose place in our vision i should like to trace that of the kings for instance of my mothers kin that of the masons of my fathersthe kings who cultivated for years the highest instructional social and moral possibilities at geneva the masons above all less strenuous but more sympathetic who reported themselves to us hauntingly during a considerable period as enjoying every conceivable agrément at tours and at the then undeveloped trouville even the winter trouville on the lowest possible terms fain would i as for the mere pleasure of it under the temptation to delineate gather into my loose net the singularly sharp and rounded image of our cousin charlotte of the former name who figured for us on the field of europe wherever we looked and all the rest of time as a character of characters and a marvel of placid consistency through my vague remembrance of her return from china after the arrest of a commercial career there by her husbands death in the red seawhich somehow sounded like a dreadful form of death and my scarce less faint recovery of some christmas treat of our childhood under her roof in gramercy park amid dim chinoiseries and in that twilight of time dimmer offspring vernon anne arthur marked to us always in the distincter years as of all our young relatives the most intensely educated and most pointedly properan occasion followed by her permanent and invidious withdrawal from her own country i would keep her in my eye through the genevese age and on to the crisis of the civil war in which vernon unforgiven by her stiff conservatism for his northern loyalty laid down before petersburg a young life of understanding and pain uncommemorated as to the gallantry of its endhe had insistently returned to the front after a recovery from first wounds as under his mothers maledictionon the stone beneath which he lies in the old burial ground at newport the cradle of his fathers family i should further pursue my subject through other periods and places other constantly quiet but vivid exhibitions to the very end of the storywhich for myself was the impression first of a little lonely softvoiced gentle relentless lady in a dull surrey garden of a summer afternoon more than half blind and all dependent on the dame de compagnie who read aloud to her that saturday review which had ever been the prop and mirror of her opinions and to which she remained faithful her children estranged and outworn dead and ignored and the vision second and for a climax of an oldworld rezdechaussée at versailles goal of my final pilgrimage almost in presence of the end end of her very personal career i mean but not of her perfectly firm spirit or of her charmingly smooth address  i confess myself embarrassed by my very ease of recapture of my young consciousness so that i perforce try to encourage lapses and keep my abundance down the place for the lapse consents with difficulty however to be any particular point of the past at which i catch myself easily caught as i am looking about me it has certainly nothing in common with that coign of vantage enjoyed by me one june afternoon of 1855 in the form of the minor share of the box of a carriage that conveyed us for the first time since our babyhood w js and mine through so much of a vast portentous london i was an item in the overflow of a vehicle completely occupied and i thrilled with the spectacle my seat beside the coachman so amply commandedwithout knowing at this moment why amid other claims i had been marked for such an eminence i so far justify my privilege at least as still to feel that prime impression of extreme intensity underlie deep down the whole mass of later observation there are london aspects which so far as they still touch me after all the years touch me as just sensible reminders of this hour of early apprehension so penetrated for me as to have kept its ineffaceable stamp for at last we had come to europewe had disembarked at liverpool but a couple of days before from that steamer atlantic of the collins line then active but so soon to be utterly undone of which i had kept a romantic note ever since a certain evening of a winter or two before i had on that occasion assisted with my parents at a varied theatrical exhibitionthe theatre is distinct to me as broughamsone of the features of which was the at that time flourishing farce of betsy baker a picture of some predicament supposed droll of its hero mr mouser whose wife if i am correct carries on a laundry and controls as she may a train of young assistants a feature of the piece comes back to me as the pursuit of mr mouser round and round the premises by the troop of laundresses shouting his name in chorus capture by them being abject though whether through fear of their endearments or of their harsher violence i fail to remember it was enough that the public nerve had at the moment been tried by the nonarrival of the atlantic several days overdue to the pitch at last of extreme anxiety so that when after the fall of the curtain on the farce the distracted mr mouser still breathless reappeared at the footlights where i can see him now abate by his plight no jot of the dignity of his announcement ladies and gentlemen i rejoice to be able to tell you that the good ship atlantic is safe the house broke into such plaudits so huge and prolonged a roar of relief as i had never heard the like of and which gave me my first measure of a great immediate public emotioneven as the incident itself today reminds me of the familyparty smallness of the old new york those happy limits that could make us all care and care to fond vociferation for the same thing at once it was a moment of the golden agerepresenting too but a snatch of elation since the wretched arctic had gone down in mortal woe and her other companion the pacific leaving england a few months later and under the interested eyes of our family group then temporarily settled in london was never heard of more let all of which show again what traps are laid about me for unguarded acute reminiscence  i meet another of these though i positively try to avoid it in the sense of a day spent on the great fusty curtained bed a mediæval fourposter such as i had never seen of the hotel at the london and northwestern station where it appeared to our great inconvenience that i had during the previous months somewhere perversely absorbed probably on staten island upwards of a year before the dull seed of malaria which now suddenly broke out in chills and fever this condition of the intermittent order hampered our movements but left alternate days on which we could travel and as present to me as ever is the apprehended interest of my important and determinant state and of our complicated prospect while i lay much at my easefor i recall in particular certain short sweet times when i could be left alonewith the thick and heavy suggestions of the london room about me the very smell of which was ancient strange and impressive a new revelation altogether and the window open to the english june and the far off hum of a thousand possibilities i consciously took them in these last and must then i think have first tasted the very greatest pleasure perhaps i was ever to knowthat of almost holding my breath in presence of certain aspects to the end of so taking in it was as if in those hours that precious fine art had been disclosed to mescantly as the poor place and the small occasion might have seemed of an order to promote it we seize our property by an avid instinct wherever we find it and i must have kept seizing mine at the absurdest little rate and all by this deeply dissimulative process of taking in through the whole succession of those summer days the next application of it that stands out for me or the next that i make room for here since i note after all so much less than i remember is the intensity of a fond apprehension of paris a few days later from the balcony of an hotel that hung through the soft summer night over the rue de la paix i hung with the balcony and doubtless with my brothers and my sister though i recover what i felt as so much relation and response to the larger the largest appeal only that of the whole perfect parisianism i seemed to myself always to have possessed mentallyeven if i had but just turned twelveand that now filled out its frame or case for me from every lighted window up and down as if each of these had been for strength of sense a word in some immortal quotation the very breath of civilised lips how i had anciently gathered such stores of preconception is more than i shall undertake an account ofthough i believe i should be able to scrape one together certain it is at any rate that half the beauty of the whole exposed second floor of a modiste just opposite for instance with the fittings and figurings as well as the intent immobilities of busy young women descried through frank and as it were benignant apertures and of such bright fine strain that they but asked to work far into the night came from the effect on the part of these things of so exactly crowning and comforting i couldnt have said what momentous young dream i might have been right to myselfas against some danger of being wrong and if i had uttered my main comment on it all this must certainly have been i told you so i told you so what i had told myself was of course that the impression would be of the richest and at the same time of the most insinuating and this after all didnt sail very close but i had had before me from far back a picture which might have been hung in the very sky and here was every touch in it repeated with a charm had i ever till then known what a charm wasa large a local a social charm leaving out that of a few individuals it was at all events this mystery ones propertythat of ones mind and so once for all i helped myself to it from my balcony and tucked it away it counted all immensely for practice in taking in  i profited by that no doubt still a few days later at an hour that has never ceased to recur to me all my life as crucial as supremely determinant the travellingcarriage had stopped at a village on the way from lyons to geneva between which places there was then no railway a village now nameless to me and which was not yet nantua in the jura where we were to spend the night i was stretched at my ease on a couch formed by a plank laid from seat to seat and covered by a small mattress and other draperies an indulgence founded on my visitation of fever which though not now checking our progress assured me in our little band these invidious luxuries it may have been that as my body was pampered so i was moved equally to pamper my spirit for my appropriative instinct had neglected no item of our case from the firstby which i mean from the moment of our getting under way that morning with much elaboration in the court of the old hôtel de lunivers at lyons where we had arrived two days before and awaited my good pleasure during fortyeight hours that overflowed for us perhaps somewhat less than any pair of days yet but as regards which it was afterwards my complacent theory that my contemplative rest at the ancient inn with all the voices and graces of the past of the court of the french scheme of manners in general and of ancient inns as such in particular had prepared me not a little when i should in due course hear of it for what was meant by the vie de provincethat expression which was to become later on so toned as old fine colour and old fine opinion are toned it was the romance of travel and it was the suggested romance flushed with suppositions and echoes with implications and memories memories of ones reading save the mark all the more that our proper bestowal required two carriages in which we were to post ineffable thought and which bristled with every kind of contradiction of common experience the postilion in a costume rather recalling from the halls of ferrero that of my débardeur bobbed up and down the italian courier jean nadali blackwhiskered and acquired in london sat in the rumble along with annette godefroi of metz freshcoloured broadfaced and fairbraided a bonne lorraine if ever there was acquired in new york i enjoy the echo of their very names neither unprecedented nor irreproducible yet which melt together for me to intensification with all the rest with the recovered moment above all of our pause at the inndoor in the cool sunshinewe had mounted and mountedduring which in my absurdly cushioned state i took in as i have hinted by a long slow swig that testified to some power of elbow a larger draught of the wine of perception than any i had ever before owed to a single throb of that faculty the village street which was not as village streets hitherto known to me opened out beyond an interval into a high place on which perched an object also a fresh revelation and that i recognised with a deep joythough a joy that was doubtless partly the sense of fantastic ease of abated illness and of cold chickenas at once a castle and a ruin the only castle within my ken had been by my impression the machicolated villa above us the previous summer at new brighton and as i had seen no structure rise beyond that majesty so i had seen none abased to the dignity of ruin loose boards were no expression of this latter phase and i was already somehow aware of a deeper note in the crumbled castle than any note of the solid onelittle experience as i had had either of solidity at a point in the interval at any rate below the slope on which this memento stood was a woman in a black bodice a white shirt and a red petticoat engaged in some sort of field labour the effect of whose intervention just then is almost beyond my notation i knew her for a peasant in sabotsthe first peasant i had ever beheld or beheld at least to such advantage she had in the whole aspect an enormous value emphasising with her petticoats tonic strength the truth that sank in as i laythe truth of ones embracing there in all the presented character of the scene an amount of character i had felt no scene present not even the one i had raked from the hôtel westminster the sort of thing that even as mere fulness and mere weight would sit most warmly in the mind supremely in that ecstatic vision was europe sublime synthesis expressed and guaranteed to meas if by a mystic gage which spread all through the summer air that i should now only now never lose it hold the whole consistency of it up to that time it might have been but mockingly whisked before me europe mightnt have been flattered it was true at my finding her thus most signified and summarised in a sordid old woman scraping a mean living and an uninhabitable tower abandoned to the owls that was but the momentary measure of a small sick boy however and the virtue of the impression was proportioned to my capacity it made a bridge over to more things than i then knew     xxi   how shall i render certain other impressions coming back to me from that summer which were doubtless involved in my having still for a time on the alternate days when my complaint was active to lie up on various couches and for my main comfort consider the situation i considered it best i think gathering in the fruits of a quickened sensibility to it in certain umbrageous apartments in which my parents had settled themselves near geneva an old house in ample grounds and among great spreading trees that pleasantly brushed our windows in the summer heats and airs known if i am not mistaken as the campagne gerebsoffwhich its mistress an invalid russian lady had partly placed at our disposition while she reclined in her own quarter of the garden on a chaise longue and under a mushroom hat with a green veil and i in the course of the mild excursions appointed as my limit considered her from afar in the light of the legends supplied to me as to her identity history general practices and proceedings by my younger brother wilky who according to his nature or i may say to his genius had made without loss of time great advances of acquaintance with her and quickened thereby my sense of his superior talent for life wilkys age followed closely on mine and from that time on we conversed and consorted though with lapses and disparities i being on the whole during the succession of those years in the grateful the really fortunate position of having one exposure rather the northward as it were to the view of w j and the other perhaps the more immediately sunned surface to the genial glow of my junior of this i shall have more to say but to meet in memory meanwhile even this early flicker of him is to know again something of the sense that i attached all along our boyhood to his successful sociability his instinct for intercourse his genius as i have used the word for making friends it was the only genius he had declaring itself from his tenderest years never knowing the shadow of defeat and giving me above all from as far back and by the very radiation of the fact endlessly much to think of for i had in a manner thanks to the radiation much of the benefit his geniality was absolutely such that the friends he made were made almost less for himself so to speak than for other friendsof whom indeed we his own adjuncts were easily firstso far at least as he discriminated at night all cats are grey and in this brothers easy view all his acquaintance were his family the trail of his sociability was over us all alikethough it here concerns me but to the effect as i recover it of its weight on my comparatively so indirect faculty for what is called taking life i must have already at the campagne gerebsoff begun to see him take it with all his directnessbegun in fact to be a trifle tormentedly aware that though there might be many ways of so doing we are condemned practically to a choice not made free of them all reduced to the use of but one at the best which it is to our interest to make the most of since we may indeed sometimes make much there was a small sad charm i should doubtless add in this operation of the contrast of the case before me with my own case it was positively as if wilkys were supplying me on occasion with the most immediate matter for my own that was particularly marked after he had with our elder brother been placed at school the pensionnat roediger at châtelaine then much esteemed and where i was supposedly to join them on my complete recovery i recall sociable irrepressibly sociable sorties thence on the part of the pair as promptly breaking out not less than i recall sociable afternoon visits to the establishment on the part of the rest of us it was my brothers first boarding school but as we had in the new york conditions kept punctually rejoining our family so in these pleasant genevese ones our family returned the attention of this also more anon my particular point is just the wealth of wilkys contribution to my rich current consciousnessthe consciousness fairly made rich by my taking in as aforesaid at reflective hours hours when i was in a manner alone with it our roomy and shadowy our almost haunted interior  admirable the scale and solidity in general of the ancient villas planted about geneva and our house affected me as so massive and so spacious that even our own half of it seemed vast i had never before lived so long in anything so old and as i somehow felt so deep depth depth upon depth was what came out for me at certain times of my waiting above in my immense room of thick embrasures and rather prompt obscurity while the summer afternoon waned and my companions often below at dinner lingered and left me just perhaps a bit overwhelmed that was the sense of itthe character in the whole place pressed upon me with a force i hadnt met and that was beyond my analysiswhich is but another way of saying how directly notified i felt that such material conditions as i had known could have had no depth at all my depth was a vague measure no doubt but it made space in the twilight for an occasional small sound of voice or step from the garden or the rooms of which the great homely the opaque green shutters opened there softly to echo inmixed with reverberations finer and more momentous personal experimental if they might be called so which i much encouraged they borrowed such tone from our new surrounding medium and half of which were reducible to wilkys personalities and wilkys experience these latter irrepressibly communicated being ever enviably though a trifle bewilderingly and even formidably of personalities there was the difference and the opposition as i really believe i was already awarethat one way of taking life was to go in for everything and everyone which kept you abundantly occupied and the other way was to be as occupied quite as occupied just with the sense and the image of it all and on only a fifth of the actual immersion a circumstance extremely strange life was taken almost equally both waysthat i mean seemed the strangeness mere brute quantity and number being so much less in one case than the other these latter were what i should have liked to go in for had i but had the intrinsic faculties that more than ever came home to me on those occasions when as i could move further and stay out longer i accompanied my parents on afternoon visits to châtelaine and the campagne roediger a scene that has remained with me as nobly placid and pastoral the great trees stood about casting afternoon shadows the old thickwalled greenshuttered villa and its dépendances had the air of the happiest home the big bearded bonhomie of m roediger among his little polyglot chargesno petits pays chauds theseappeared to justify and more the fond new york theory of swiss education the kind à la portée of young new yorkers as a beautifully genialised humanised civilised even romanticised thing in which amid lawny mountain slopes the languages flowed into so many beaming recipients on a stream of milk and honey and the relation above all the relation from master to pupil and back again was of an amenity that wouldnt have been of this world save for the providential arrangement of a perfect pedagogic switzerland did you notice the relationhow charming it was our parents were apt to say to each other after these visits in reference to some observed show of confidence between instructor and instructed while as for myself i was lost in the wonder of all the relationsmy younger brother seemed to live and to his own ingenuous relish as well in such a happy hum of them the languages had reason to prosperthey were so copiously represented the english jostled the american the russian the german and there even trickled through a little funny french  a great geneva school of those days was the institution haccius to which generations of our young countrymen had been dedicated and our own faces first turnedunder correction however by the perceived truth that if the languages were in question the american reigned there almost unchallenged the establishment chosen for our experiment must have appealed by some intimate and insinuating side and as less patronised by the rich and the sophisticatedfor even in those days some americans were rich and several sophisticated little indeed as it was all to matter in the event so short a course had the experiment just then to run what it mainly brings back to me is the fine old candour and queerness of the new york state of mind begotten really not a little i think under our own roof by the mere charmed perusal of rodolphe toeppfers voyages en zigzag the two goodly octavo volumes of which delightful work an adorable book taken with its illustrations had come out early in the fifties and had engaged our fondest study it is the copious chronicle by a schoolmaster o£ endless humour and sympathyof what degree and form of authority it never occurred to one even to askof his holiday excursions with his pupils mainly on foot and with staff and knapsack through the incomparable switzerland of the time before the railways and the rush before the monster hotels the desecrated summits the vulgarised valleys the circular tours the perforating tubes the funiculars the hordes the horrors to turn back to toeppfers pages today is to get the sense of a lost paradise and the effect for me even yet of having pored over them in my childhood is to steep in sweetness and quaintness some of the pictureshis own illustrations are of the pleasantest and drollest and the association makes that faded swiss master of landscape calame of the socalled calamités a quite sufficient ruysdael it must have been conceived for us that we would lead in these conditionsalways in pursuit of an educationa life not too dissimilar to that of the storied exiles in the forest of arden though one would fain not press after all upon ideals of culture so little organised so little conscious up to that moment of our ferocities of comparison and competition of imposed preparation this particular loose ideal reached out from the desertor what might under discouragement pass for such it invoked the light but a simplicity of view which was somehow one with the beauty of other convictions accompanied its effort and though a glance at the social psychology of some of its cheerful estimates its relative importances assumed and acted upon might here seem indicated there are depths of the ancient serenity that nothing would induce me to sound  i need linger the less moreover since we in fact oddly enough lingered so little so very little for reasons doubtless well known to ourselves at the time but which i at present fail to recapture that what next stands vividly out for me is our renewed passage through paris on the way to london for the winter a turn of our situation invested at the time with nothing whatever of the wonderful yet which would again half prompt me to soundings were i not to recognise in it that mark of the fitful that accent of the improvised that general quality of earnest and reasoned yet at the same time almost passionate impatience which was to devote us for some time to variety almost to incoherency of interest we had fared across the sea under the glamour of the swiss school in the abstract but the swiss school in the concrete soon turned stale on our hands a fact over which i remember myself as no further critical than to feel not without zest that since one was all eyes and the world decidedly at such a pace all images it ministered to the panoramic it ministered to begin with through our very early start for lyons again in the october dawnwithout nadali or the carriages this time but on the basis of the malleposte vast yellow and rumbling which we availed wholly to fill and of which the high haughtiness was such that it could stop even for an instant only at appointed and much dissevered placesto the effect i recall of its vainly attempted arrest by our cousin charlotte king beforementioned whom i see now suddenly emerge fresh confident and pretty from some rural retreat by the road a scene of simple villeggiatura rien que pour saluer ces dames as she pleaded to the conductor whom she practically if not permittedly overmastered leaving with me still the wonder of her happy fusion of opposites the coach had not in the event paused but so neither had she and as it ignored flush and flurry quite as it defied delay she was equally a match for it in these particulars blandly achieving her visit to us while it rumbled on making a perfect success and a perfect grace of her idea she dropped as elegantly out as she had gymnastically floated in and ces dames must much have wished they could emulate her art save for this my view of that migration has faded though to shine out again to the sense of our early morning arrival in paris a couple of days later and our hunt there vain at first for an hotel that would put us numerously up vain till we had sat awhile in the rue du helder i think before that of an albany uncle luckily on the scene and finally invoked who after some delay descended to us with a very foreign air i fancied and no possibility to his regret of placing us under his own roof as if indeed i remember reflecting we could such as we were have been desired to share his foreign interestssuch as they were he espoused our cause however with gay goodnaturewhile i wondered in my admiration for him and curiosity about him how he really liked us and a bit doubtfully whether i should have liked us had i been in his place and after some further adventure installed us at the hôtel de la ville de paris in the rue de la villelevèque a resort now long since extinct though it lingered on for some years and which i think of as rather huddled and disappointingly private to the abatement of spectacle and standing obliquely beyond a wall a high gateway and a more or less cobbled court     xxii   little else of that parisian passage remains with meit was probably of the briefest i recover only a visit with my father to the palais de lindustrie where the first of the great french exhibitions on the model much reduced of the english crystal palace of 1851 was still open a fact explaining the crowded inns and from that visit win back but the department of the english pictures and our stopping long before the order of release of a young english painter j e millais who had just leaped into fame and my impression of the rare treatment of whose babys bare legs pendent from its mothers arms is still as vivid to me as if from yesterday the vivid yields again to the vaguei scarce know why so utterlytill consciousness waking up in london renews itself late one evening and very richly at the gloucester hotel or coffeehouse as i think it was then still called which occupied that corner of piccadilly and berkeley street where more modern establishments have since succeeded it but where a fatigued and famished american family found on that occasion a fine old british virtue in cold roast beef and bread and cheese and ale their expert acclamation of which echoes even now in my memory it keeps company there with other matters equally british and as we say now early victorian the thick gloom of the inn rooms the faintness of the glimmering tapers the blest inexhaustibility of the fine joint surpassed only by that of the grave waiters reserveplain immutably plain fare all but prompting in our elders an emphasis of relief and relish the theres nothing like it after all tone which reexcited expectation which in fact seemed this time to reannounce a basis for faith and joy  that basis presently shrank to the scale of a small house hard by the hotel at the entrance of berkeley squareexpeditiously lighted on it would thus appear which again has been expensively superseded but to the ancient little facts of which i fondly revert since i owe them what i feel to have been in the far past the prime faint revelation the small broken expression of the london i was afterwards to know the place wears on the spot to this day no very different face the house that has risen on the site of ours is still immediately neighboured at the left by the bookseller the circulatinglibrarian and newsagent who modestly flourished in our time under the same name the great establishment of mr gunter just further along is as soberly and solidly seated the mews behind the whole row from the foot of hay hill at the right wanders away to bruton street with the irregular grace that spoke to my young fancy hay hill itself is somehow less sharply precipitous besides being no longer paved as i seem to recall its having been with big boulders and i was on the point of saying that its antique charm in some degree abides nothing however could be further from the truth its antique charm quite succumbed years ago to that erection of lumpish mansions which followed the demolition of the oldworld townresidence as the houseagents say standing on the south side between court and i suppose garden where dover street gives way to grafton a house of many histories of vague importances and cold reserves and deep suggestions i used to think after scaling the steep quite on purpose to wonder about it a whole chapter of life was condensed for our young sensibility i make out into the couple of monthsthey can scarce have been morespent by us in these quarters which must have proved too narrow and too towny but it can have had no passage so lively as the occurrences at once sequent to my fathers having too candidly made known in some public print probably the times that an american gentleman at such an address desired to arrange with a competent young man for the tuition at home of his three sons the effect of his rash failure to invite application by letter only was the assault of an army of visitors who filled us with consternation they hung about the door cumbered the hall choked the staircase and sat grimly individual in odd corners how they were dealt with given my fathers precipitate and general charity i can but feebly imagine our own concern in the event was with a sole selected presence that of scotch mr robert thompson who gave us his care from breakfast to luncheon each morning that winter who afterwards carried on a school at edinburgh and whom in years long subsequent i happened to help r l stevenson to recognise gaily as his early pedagogue he was so deeply solicitous yet withal so mild and kind and shy with no harsher injunction to us ever than come now be getting on that one could but think well of a world in which so gentle a spirit might flourish while it is doubtless to the credit of his temper that remembrance is a blank in respect to his closer ministrations i recall vividly his fresh complexion his very round clear eyes his tendency to trip over his own legs or feet while thoughtfully circling about us and his constant dresscoat worn with trousers of a lighter hue which was perhaps the prescribed uniform of a daily tutor then but i ask myself in vain what i can have studied with him there remaining with me afterwards to testifythis putting any scrap of stored learning asideno single textbook save the lambs tales from shakespeare which was given me as of all things in the world a reward a reward for what i am again at a loss to saynot certainly for having got on to anything like the tune plaintively for the most part piped to me it is a very odd and yet to myself very rich and full reminiscence though i remember how looking back at it from after days w j denounced it to me and with it the following year and more spent in paris as a poor and arid and lamentable time in which missing such larger chances and connections as we might have reached out to we had done nothing he and i but walk about together in a state of the direst propriety little high black hats and inveterate gloves the childish costume of the place and period to stare at grey streetscenery that of early victorian london had tones of a neutrality dawdle at shopwindows and buy watercolours and brushes with which to bedaub eternal drawingblocks we might i dare say have felt higher impulses and carried out larger plansthough indeed present to me for this on my brothers so expressing himself is my then quick recognition of the deeper stirrings and braver needs he at least must have known and my perfect if rueful sense of having myself had no such quarrel with our conditions embalmed for me did they even to that shorter retrospect appear in a sort of fatalism of patience spiritless in a manner no doubt yet with an inwardly active productive and ingenious side  it was just the fact of our having so walked and dawdled and dodged that made the charm of memory in addition to which what could one have asked more than to be steeped in a medium so dense that whole elements of it forms of amusement interest and wonder soaked through to some appreciative faculty and made one fail at the most of nothing but ones lessons my brother was right in so far as that my questionthe one i have just reproducedcould have been asked only by a person incorrigible in throwing himself back upon substitutes for lost causes substitutes that might temporarily have appeared queer and small a person so haunted even from an early age with visions of life that aridities for him were half a terror and half an impossibility and that the said substitutes the economies and ingenuities that protested in their dumb vague way against weakness of situation or of direct and applied faculty were in themselves really a revel of spirit and thought it had indeed again an effect of almost pathetic incoherence that our brave quest of the languages suffering so prompt and for the time at least so accepted and now so inscrutably irrecoverable a check should have contented itself with settling us by that christmas in a house more propitious to our development in st johns wood where we enjoyed a considerable garden and wistful view though by that windowed privilege alone of a large green expanse in which ladies and gentlemen practised archery just thatand not the art even but the mere spectaclemight have been one of the substitutes in question if not for the languages at least for one or another of the romantic connections we seemed a little to have missed it was such a whiff of the old world of robin hood as we could never have looked up from the mere thumbed story in fourteenth street at any rate to any soft confidence of more than i can begin to say that is by a greater number of queer small channels did the world about us thus continuous with the old world of robin hood steal into my sensea constant state of subjection to which fact is no bad instance of those refinements of surrender that i just named as my fond practice i seem to see today that the london of the fifties was even to the weak perception of childhood a much less generalised a much more eccentrically and variously characterised place than the present great accommodated and accommodating city it had fewer resources but it had many more features scarce one of which failed to help the whole to bristle with what a little gaping american could take for an intensity of difference from his supposed order it was extraordinarily the picture and the scene of dickens now so changed and superseded it offered to my presumptuous vision still more the reflection of thackerayand where is the detail of the reflection of thackeray nowso that as i trod the vast length of baker street the thackerayan vista of other days i throbbed with the pride of a vastly enlarged acquaintance  i dare say our perambulations of baker street in our little top hats and other neatnesses must have been what w j meant by our poverty of lifewhereas it was probably one of the very things most expressive to myself of the charm and the colour of history and from the point of view of the picturesque of society we were often in baker street by reason of those stretchedout walks at the remembered frequency and longdrawn push of which i am today amazed recalling at the same time however that save for robert thompsons pitching ball with us in the garden they took for us the place of all other agilities i cant but feel them to have been marked in their way by a rare curiosity and energy good mr thompson had followed us in our move occupying quarters not far off above a bakers shop on a terracea group of objects still untouched by timewhere we occasionally by way of change attended for our lessons and where not the least of our inspirations was the confidence again and again justified that our midmorning break would determine the appearance of a selfconscious stale cake straight from below received by us all each time as if it had been a sudden happy thought and ushered in by a little girl who might have been a dickens foundling or orfling our being reduced to mumble cake in a suburban lodging by way of reaction from the strain of study would have been perhaps a pathetic picture but we had fielddays too when we accompanied our excellent friend to the tower the thames tunnel st pauls and the abbey to say nothing of the zoological gardens almost close at hand and with which we took in that age of lingering forms no liberty of abbreviation to say nothing either of madame tussauds then in our interminable but so amiable baker street the only shade on the amiability of which was just that gruesome association with the portal of the bazaarsince madame tussaud had of all her treasures most vividly revealed to me the mrs manning and the burke and hare of the chamber of horrors which lurked just within it whom for days after making their acquaintance and prolonging it no further than our conscientious friend thought advisable i half expected when alone to meet quite dreadfully on the staircase or on opening a door all this experience was valuable but it was not the languagessave in so far indeed as it was the english which we hadnt in advance so much aimed at yet which more or less and very interestingly came it at any rate perhaps broke our fall a little that french of a sort continued to be with us in the remarkably erect person of mademoiselle cusin the swiss governess who had accompanied us from geneva whose quite sharply extrusive but on the whole exhilarating presence i associate with this winter and who led in that longish procession of more or less similar domesticated presences which was to keep the torch that is the accent among us fairly alight the variety and frequency of the arrivals and departures of these ladieswhose ghostly names again so far as i recall them i like piously to preserve augustine danse amélie fortin marie guyard marie bonningue félicie bonningue clarisse badermystifies me in much the same degree as our own academic vicissitudes in new york i can no more imagine why sociable and charitable we so often changed governesses than i had contemporaneously grasped the principle of our succession of schools the whole group of phenomena reflected i gather as a rule much more the extreme promptitude of the parental optimism than any disproportionate habit of impatience the optimism begot precipitation and the precipitation had too often to confess itself what is instructive what is historic is the probability that young persons offering themselves at that time as guides and communicatorsthe requirements of our small sister were for long modest enoughquite conceivably lacked preparedness and were so thrown back on the extempore which in turn lacked abundance one of these figures that of mademoiselle danse the most parisian and prodigiously so was afterwards to stand out for us quite luridlya cloud of revelations succeeding her withdrawal a cloud which thick as it was never obscured our impression of her genius and her charm the daughter of a political proscript who had but just escaped by the legend being seized in his bed on the terrible night of the deuxdécembre and who wrote her micawberish letters from gallipolis ohio she subsequently figured to my imagination in the light that is of the divined revelations too dreadful for our young ears as the most brilliant and most genial of irregular characters exhibiting the parisian mentality at its highest or perhaps rather its deepest and more remarkable for nothing than for the consummate little art and grace with which she had for a whole year draped herself in the mantle of our innocent air it was exciting it was really valuable to have to that extent rubbed shoulders with an adventuress it showed one that for the adventuress there might on occasion be much to be said  those however were later thingsextensions of view hampered for the present as i have noted by our mere london streetscenery which had much to build out for us i see again that we but endlessly walked and endlessly daubed and that our walks with an obsession of their own constantly abetted our daubing we knew no other boys at all and we even saw no others i seem to remember save the essentially rude ones rude with a kind of mediæval rudeness for which our clear new york experience had given us no precedent and of which the great and constant sign was the artless invidious wonder produced in them on our public appearances by the alien stamp in us that for our comfort we vainly sought to dissimulate we conformed in each particular so far as we could to the prevailing fashion and standard of a narrow range in those days but in our very plumageputting our ramage asideour woodnote wild must have seemed to sound so sharply we challenged when abroad the attention of our native contemporaries and even sometimes of their elders pulled up at sight of us in the fromheadtofoot stare a curiosity void of sympathy and that attached itself for some reason especially to our feet which were not abnormally large the london people had for themselves at the same time an exuberance of type we found it in particular a world of costume often of very odd costumethe most intimate notes of which were the postmen in their frockcoats of military red and their black beaver hats the milkwomen in hats that often emulated these in little shawls and strange short full frocks revealing enormous boots with their pails swung from their shoulders on wooden yokes the inveterate footmen hooked behind the coaches of the rich frequently in pairs and carrying staves together with the mounted and belted grooms without the attendance of whom riders of whichever sexand riders then were much more numerousalmost never went forth the range of character on the other hand reached rather dreadfully down there were embodied and exemplified horrors in the streets beside which any present exhibition is pale and i well remember the almost terrified sense of their salience produced in me a couple of years later on the occasion of a flying return from the continent with my father by a long an interminable drive westward from the london bridge railwaystation it was a soft june evening with a lingering light and swarming crowds as they then seemed to me of figures reminding me of george cruikshanks artful dodger and his bill sikes and his nancy only with the bigger brutality of life which pressed upon the cab the earlyvictorian fourwheeler as we jogged over the bridge and cropped up in more and more gaslit patches for all our course culminating somewhere far to the west in the vivid picture framed by the cabwindow of a woman reeling backward as a man felled her to the ground with a blow in the face the london view at large had in fact more than a cruikshank there still survived in it quite a hogarth sidewhich i had of course then no name for but which i was so sharply to recognise on coming back years later that it fixed for me the veracity of the great pictorial chronicler hogarths mark is even yet not wholly overlaid though time has per contra dealt with that stale servility of address which most expressed to our young minds the rich burden of a past the consequence of too much history i liked for my own part a lot of history but felt in face of certain queer old obsequiosities and appeals whinings and sidlings and handrubbings and curtseydroppings the general play of apology and humility behind which the great dim social complexity seemed to mass itself that one didnt quite want so inordinate a quantity of that particular light and shade however the big broom of change has swept the scene bare more history still has been after all what it wanted quite another order in the whole connection strikes me as reigning todaythough not without the reminder from it that the relations in which manner as a generalised thing in which tone is positively pleasant is really assured and sound clear and interesting are numerous and definite only when it has had in its past some strange phases and much misadventure     xxiii   we were still being but vaguely formed yet it was a vagueness preferred apparently by our parents to the only definiteness in any degree open to us that of the english school away from home the london private school near home they would absolutely none of which they saw as a fearful and wonderful though seemingly effective preparation of the young for english life and an english career but related to that situation only so little related in fact to any other as to make it in a differing case an educational culdesac the worst of economies they had doubtless heard claimed for it just that no other method for boys was so splendidly general but they had i judge their own sense of the matterwhich would have been that it all depended on what was meant by this the truth was above all that to them the formative forces most closely bearing on us were not in the least vague but very definite by their measure and intention there were advantages generally much belauded that appealed to them scantly and other matters conceptions of character and opportunity ideals values importances enjoying no great common credit but for which it was their belief that they under whatever difficulties more or less provided in respect of which i further remind myself of the blest fewness as yet of our years and i come back to my own sense benighted though it may have been of a highlycoloured and remarkably active life i recognise our immediate our practical ferment even in our decent perambulations our discussions w js and mine of whether we had in a given case best apply for a renewal of our artists materials to messrs rowney or to messrs windsor and newton and in our pious resort on these determinations to rathbone place more beset by our steps probably than any other single corner of the town and the short but charged vista of which lives for me again in the tempered light of those old winter afternoons of scarce less moment than these were our frequent visits in the same general connection to the old pantheon of oxford street now fallen from its high estate but during that age a place of fine rococo traditions a bazaar an exhibition an opportunity at the end of long walks for the consumption of buns and gingerbeer and above all a monument to the genius of that wonderful painter b r haydon we must at one time quite have haunted the pantheon where we doubtless could better than elsewhere sink to contemplative to ruminative rest haydons huge canvases covered the wallsi wonder what has become now of the banishment of aristides attended to the city gate by his wife and babe every attitude and figure in which especially that of the foreshortened boy picking up stones to shy at the alltoojust stares out at me still we found in these works remarkable interest and beauty the reason of which was partly no doubt that we hung to fascination at home over the three volumes of the hapless artists autobiography then a new book which our father indulgent to our preoccupation had provided us with but i blush to risk the further surmise that the grand manner the heroic and the classic in haydon came home to us more warmly and humanly than in the masters commended as old who at the national gallery seemed to meet us so little halfway to hold out the hand of fellowship or suggest something that we could do or could at least want to the beauty of haydon was just that he was new shiningly new and if he hinted that we might perhaps in some happy future emulate his big bravery there was nothing so impossible about it if we adored daubing we preferred it fresh and the genius of the pantheon was fresh whereas strange to say rubens and titian were not even the charm of the pantheon yielded however to that of the english collection the vernon bequest to the nation then arrayed at marlborough house and to which the great plumed and draped and dusty funeral car of the duke of wellington formed an attractive adjunct the groundfloor chambers there none of them at that time royally inhabited come back to me as altogether bleak and bare and as owing their only dignity to maclise mulready and landseer to david wilkie and charles leslie they were by some deepseated english mystery the real unattainable just as they were none the less the directly inspiring and the endlessly delightful i could never have enough of maclises playscene in hamlet which i supposed the finest composition in the world though ophelia did look a little as if cut in silhouette out of white paper and pasted on while as i gazed and gazed again at leslies sancho panza and his duchess i pushed through the great hall of romance to the central or private apartments trafalgar square had its straight message for us only in the maytime exhibition the royal academy of those days having without a home of its own to borrow space from the national galleryspace partly occupied in the summer of 1856 by the first fresh fruits of the preraphaelite efflorescence among which i distinguish millaiss vale of rest his autumn leaves and if i am not mistaken his prodigious blind girl the very word preraphaelite wore for us that intensity of meaning not less than of mystery that thrills us in its perfection but for one season the prime hour of first initiations and i may perhaps somewhat mix the order of our great little passages of perception momentous to us again was to be the academy show of 1858 where there were from the same wide source still other challenges to wonder holman hunts scapegoat most of all which i remember finding so charged with the awful that i was glad i saw it in companyit in company and i the same i believed or tried to believe i should have feared to face it all alone in a room by that time moreoveri mean by 1858we had been more fully indoctrinated or such was the case at least with w j for whom in paris during the winter of 1857 instruction at the atelier of m léon coigniet of a limited order and adapted to his years had been candidly providedthat m léon coigniet whose marius meditating among the ruins of carthage impressed us the more at the luxembourg even more haunted by us in due course than the pantheon had been in consequence of this family connection  let me not however nip the present thread of our æsthetic evolution without a glance at that comparatively spare but deeply appreciated experience of the london theatric privilege which so far as occasion favoured us also pressed the easy spring the new york familiarities had to drop going to the play presented itself in london as a serious ponderous business a procession of two throbbing and heaving cabs over vast foggy tracts of the town after much arrangement in advance and with a renewal of far peregrination through twisting passages and catacombs even after crossing the magic threshold we sat in strange places with still stranger ones behind or beside we felt walls and partitions in our rear getting so hot that we wondered if the house was to burst into flame i recall in especial our being arrayed to the number of nine persons all of our contingent in a sort of rustic balcony or verandah which simulating the outer gallery of a swiss cottage framed in creepers formed a feature of mr albert smiths oncefamous representation of the tour of mont blanc big bearded rattling chattering mimicking albert smith again charms my senses though subject to the reflection that his type and presence superficially so important so ample were somehow at odds with such ingratiations with the reckless levity of his performancea performance one of the great effects of which was as i remember it the very brief stop and redeparture of the train at Épernay with the ringing of bells the bawling of guards the cries of travellers the slamming of doors and the tremendous pop as of a colossal champagnecork made all simultaneous and vivid by mr smiths mere personal resources and graces but it is the publicity of our situation as a happy family that i best remember and how to our embarrassment we seemed put forward in our illustrative châlet as part of the boisterous show and of what had been paid for by the house two other great evenings stand out for me as not less collectively enjoyed one of these at the princesss then under the management of charles kean the unprecedented as he was held shakespearean revivalist the other at the olympic where alfred wigan the extraordinary and too shortlived robson and the shrewd and handsome mrs stirling were the high attraction our enjoyment of charles keans presentation of henry the eighth figures to me as a momentous date in our lives we did nothing for weeks afterwards but try to reproduce in watercolours queen katharines dreamvision of the beckoning consoling angels a radiant group let down from the skies by machinery then thought marvellouswhen indeed we were not parading across our schoolroom stage as the portentous cardinal and impressively alternating his last speech to cromwell with buckinghams that is with mr ryders address on the way to the scaffold the spectacle had seemed to us prodigiousas it was doubtless at its time the last word of costly scenic science though as i look back from the high ground of an age that has mastered tone and fusion i seem to see it as comparatively garish and violent after the manner of the complacently approved stainedglass churchwindows of the same period i was to have my impression of charles kean renewed later onten years later in americawithout a rag of scenic reinforcement when i was struck with the fact that no actor so little graced by nature probably ever went so far toward repairing it by a kind of cold rage of endeavour were he and his wife really not coercively interesting on that boston night of macbeth in particular hadnt their art a distinction that triumphed over battered age and sorry harshness or was i but too easily beguiled by the old association i have enjoyed and forgotten numberless rich hours of spectatorship but somehow still find hooked to the wall of memory the picture of this hushed couple in the castle court with the knocking at the gate with macbeths stare of pitiful horror at his unused daggers and with the grand manner up to the height of the argument of mrs keans coldly portentous snatch of them what i especially owe that lady is my sense of what she had in common as a queer hooped and hooknosed figure of large circumference and archaic attire strange tasteless toggery with those performers of the past who are preserved for us on the small canvases of hogarth and zoffany she helped one back at that time of her life to a vision of the mrs cibbers and the mrs pritchardsso affecting may often be such recovered links  i see the evening at the olympic as really itself partaking of that antiquity even though still waters run deep then in its flourishing freshness and as to which i remember my fine old friend fanny kembles mentioning to me in the distant aftertime that she had directed tom taylor to charles de bernards novel of un gendre for the subject of it passed at the moment for a highly modern social study it is perhaps in particular through the memory of our dismal approach to the theatre the squalid slum of wych street then incredibly brutal and barbarous as an avenue to joy an avenue even sometimes for the muffled coach of royalty that the episode affects me as antedating some of the conditions of the midvictorian age the general credit of which i should add was highly reestablished for us by the consummately quiet and natural art as we expertly pronounced it of alfred wigans john mildmay and the breadth and sincerity of the representative of the rash motherinlaw whom he so imperturbably puts in her place this was an exhibition supposed in its day to leave its spectators little to envy in the highest finish reached by the french theatre at a remarkable height in a different direction moved the strange and vivid little genius of robson a master of fantastic intensity unforgettable for us we felt that night in planchés extravaganza of the discreet princess a christmas production preluding to the immemorial harlequinade i still see robson slide across the stage in one sidelong wriggle as the small black sinister prince richcraft of the fairytale everything he did at once very dreadful and very droll thoroughly true and yet none the less macabre the great point of it all its parody of charles kean in the corsican brothers a vision filled out a couple of years further on by his daddy hardacre in a twoacts version of a parisian piece thriftily and coarsely extracted from balzacs eugénie grandet this occasion must have given the real and the finer measure of his highly original talent so present to me despite the interval is the distinctiveness of his little concentrated rustic miser whose daughter helps herself from his moneybox so that her cousin and lover shall save a desperate father her paternal uncle from bankruptcy and the prodigious effect of robsons appalled descent from an upper floor his literal headlong tumble and rattle of dismay down a steep staircase occupying the centre of the stage on his discovery of the rifling of his chest long was i to have in my ears the repeated shriek of his alarm followed by a panting babble of wonder and rage as his impetus hurled him a prostrate scrap of despair he was a tiny figure yet so held the stage that in his company you could see nobody else half way across the room i associate a little uncertainly with the same night the sight of charles matthews in sheridans critic and in a comedy botched from the french like everything else in those days that was not either sheridan or shakespeare called married for money an example above all this association of the heaped measure of the old billsvast and various enumerations as they were of the size of but slightly reduced placards and with a strange and delightful greasy feel and redolence of printers ink intensely theatrical ink somehow in their big black lettering charles matthews must have been then in his midcareer and him too wasted and aged infinitely marked i was to see again ever so long after in america an impression reminding me as i recover it of how one took his talent so thoroughly for granted that he seemed somehow to get but half the credit of it this at least in all save parts of mere farce and patter which were on a footing and no very interesting one of their own the other effect that of a naturalness so easy and immediate so friendly and intimate that ones relation with the artist lost itself in ones relation with the character the artist thereby somehow positively suffering while the character gained or at least while the spectator didthis comes back to me quite as a part even of my earlier experience and as attesting on behalf of the actor a remarkable genius since there are no more charming artistic cases than those of the frank result when it is frank enough and the dissimulated process when the dissimulation has been deep to drop or appear to drop machinery and yet keep or at least gain intensity the interesting intensity separated by a gulf from a mere unbought coincidence of aspect or organ is really to do something in spite of which at the same time what i perhaps most retain by the light of the present of the sense of that big and rather dusky night of drury lane is not so much the felt degree of anyones talent as the fact that personality and artistry with their intensity could work their spell in such a material desert in conditions intrinsically so charmless so bleak and bare the conditions gave nothing of what we regard today as most indispensablesince our present fine conception is but to reduce and fill in the material desert to people and carpet and curtain it we may be right so far as that goes but our predecessors were with their eye on the essence not wrong thanks to which they wear the crown of our now thinking of themif we do think of themas in their way giants and heroes what their successors were to become is another question very much better dressed beyond all doubt     xxiv   good robert thompson was followed by fin m lerambertwho was surely good too in his different way good at least for feigning an interest he could scarce have rejoicingly felt and that he yet somehow managed to give a due impression of that artifice being as we must dimly have divined at the time in fact i make bold to say that i personally did divine it exactly a sign of his finesse of no such uncanny engine had mr thompson luckily known a needluckily since to what arsenal could he possibly have resorted for it none capable of supplying it could ever have met his sight and we ourselves should at a pinch have had to help him toward it he was easily interested or at least took an easy view on such ground as we offered him of what it was to be so whereas his successor attached to the condition a different valueone recognising no secondary substitute perhaps this was why our connection with m lerambert can have lasted but four or five monthstime even for his sharp subterfuge to have ceased entirely to serve him though indeed even as i say this i vaguely recall that our separation was attended with friction that it took him unaware and that he had been prepared or so represented himself for further sacrifices it could have been no great one assuredly to deal with so intensely living a young mind as my elder brothers it could have been but a happy impression constantly renewed but we two juniors wilky and i were a dragwilkys powers most displayed at that time in his preference for ingenuous talk over any other pursuit whatever and my own aptitude showing for nil according to our poor gentlemans report of me when a couple of months had sped save as to rendering la fontaines fables into english with a certain corresponding felicity of idiom i remember perfectly the parental communication to me of this fell judgment i remember as well the interest with which its so quite definite character inspired methat character had such beauty and distinctness yet and ever so strangely i recover no sense of having been crushed and this even though destitute utterly of any ground of appeal the fact leaves me at a loss since i also remember my not having myself thought particularly well in the connection allowed of my rendering faculty oh i seem inwardly to have said if it were to be if it only could be really a question of rendering and so without confusion though in vague very vague mystification to have left it as if so many things intrinsic and extrinsic would have to change and operate so many would have to happen so much water have to flow under the bridge before i could give primary application to such a thought much more finish such a sentence  all of which is but a way of saying that we had since the beginning of the summer settled ourselves in paris and that m lerambertby what agency invoked by what revelation vouchsafed i quite forgetwas at this time attending us in a socalled pavilion of middling size that between the rondpoint and the rue du colisée hung at no great height over the avenue des champselysées hung that is from the vantage of its own considerable terrace surmounted as the parapet of the latter was with iron railings rising sufficiently to protect the place for familiar use and covert contemplation we ever so fondly used it and yet not to the point of fencing out life a blest little oldworld refuge it must have seemed to us with its protuberantlypaved and peculiarly resonant small court and idle communs beside it accessible by a high grille where the jangle of the bell and the clatter of response across the stones might have figured a comprehensive echo of all old paris old paris then even there considerably lingered i recapture much of its presence for that matter within our odd relic of a house the property of an american southerner from whom our parents had briefly hired it and who appeared to divide his time poor unadmonished gentleman of the eve of the revolution between louisiana and france what association could have breathed more from the queer graces and the queer incommodities alike from the diffused glassy polish of floor and perilous staircase from the redundancy of mirror and clock and ormolu vase from the irrepressibility of the white and gold panel from that merciless elegance of tense red damask above all which made the giltframed backs of sofa and chair as sumptuous no doubt but as sumptuously stiff as the brocaded walls it was amid these refinements that we presently resumed our studieseven explicitly far from arduous at first as the champselysées were perforce that year our summer habitation and some deference was due to the place and the season lessons of any sort being at best an infraction of the latter m lerambert who was spare and tightly blackcoated spectacled pale and prominently intellectual who lived in the rue jacob with his mother and sister exactly as he should have done to accentuate prophetically his resemblance save for the spectacles to some hero of victor cherbuliez and who in fine was conscious not unimpressively of his authorship of a volume of meditative verse sympathetically mentioned by the saintebeuve of the causeries in a review of the young poets of the hour m lerambert too has loved m lerambert too has suffered m lerambert too has sung or words to that effect this subtle personality really a high form of sensibility i surmise and as qualified for other and intenser relations as any cherbuliez figure of them all was naturally not to be counted on to lead us gapingly forth as good mr thompson had done so that my reminiscence of warm somniferous mornings by the windows that opened to the clattery plashy court is quite so far as my record goes relievingly unbroken  the afternoons however glimmer back to me shamelessly different for our circle had promptly been joined by

still smaller sister at leastour first fine flâneries of curiosity her brave vaudoise predecessor had been bequeathed by us in london to a higher sphere than service with mere earnest nomads could represent but had left us clinging and weeping and was for a long time afterwards to write to us faithfully in the most beautiful copperplate hand out of the midst of her rise with details that brought home to us as we had never known it brought the material and institutional difference between the nomadic and the solidly the spreadingly seated a couple of years later on an occasion of our

straws our guide and philosopher of the summer days in paris was no such character as that she had arrived among us fullfledged and consummate fortunately for the case altogetheras our mere candid

neglected pupils are locked in a scrimmage on the floor but the marvel of our exemplar of the becky type was exactly that though her larger her more interested and sophisticated views had a range that she not only permitted us to guess but agreeably invited us to follow almost to their furthest limits we never for a moment ceased to be aware of her solicitude we might we must so tremendously have bored her but no ironic artist could have caught her at any juncture in the posture of disgust really i imagine because her own ironies would have been too fine for him and too numerous and too mixed and this remarkable creature vouchsafed us all information for the free enjoymenton the terms proper to our tender yearsof her beautiful city  it was not by the common measure then so beautiful as now the second empire too lately installed was still more or less feeling its way with the great free hand soon to be allowed to baron haussmann marked as yet but in the light preliminary flourish its connections with the past however still hung thickly on its majesties and symmetries comparatively vague and general were subject to the happy accident the charming lapse and the odd extrusion a bonhomie of chance composition and colour now quite purged away the whole region of the champselysées where we must after all at first have principally prowled was another world from the actual huge centre of repeated radiations the splendid avenue as we of course already thought it carried the eye from the tuileries to the arch but pleasant old places abutted on it by the way gardens and terraces and hôtels of another time pavilions still braver than ours cabarets and cafés of homely almost of rural type with a relative and doubtless rather dusty ruralism spreading away to the river and the wood what was the jardin dhiver a place of entertainment standing quite over against us and that looped itself at night with little coloured oillamps a mere twinkling grin upon the face of pleasure dim my impression of having been admittedor rather i suppose conducted though under conductorship now vague to meto view it by colourless day when it must have worn the stamp of an auctionroom quite void of the lots more distinct on the other hand the image of the bustling barrière at the top of the avenue on the hither side of the arch where the old loosegirt banlieue began at once and the two matched lodges of the octroi highly that is expressly even if humbly architectural guarded the entrance on either side with such a suggestion of the generations and dynasties and armies the revolutions and restorations they had seen come and go but the avenue of the empress now so much more thinly but of the wood itself had already been traced as the empress herself young more than young attestedly and agreeably new and fair and shining was up and down the vista constantly on exhibition with the thrill of that surpassed for us however by the incomparable passage as we judged it of the baby prince imperial borne forth for his airing or his progress to saintcloud in the splendid coach that gave a glimpse of appointed and costumed nursing breasts and laps and beside which the centgardes all lightblue and silver and intensely erect quick jolt rattled with pistols raised and cocked was a public holiday ever more splendid than that of the princes baptism at notre dame the fête of saintnapoléon or was any ever more immortalised as we say than this one was to be by the wonderfully ample and vivid picture of it in the eugène rougon of emile zola who must have taken it in on the spot as a boy of about our own number of years though of so much more implanted and predestined an evocatory gift the sense of that interminable hot day a day of hanging about and waiting and shuffling in dust in crowds in fatigue amid booths and pedlars and performers and false alarms and expectations and renewed reactions and rushes all transfigured at the last withal by the biggest and brightest illumination up to that time offered even the parisians the blinding glare of the new empire effectually symbolisedthe vision of the whole i say comes back to me quite in the form of a chapter from the rougonmacquart with its effect of something long and dense and heavy without shades or undertones but immensely keptup and done i dare say that for those months our contemplations our daily exercise in general strayed little beyond the champselysées though i recall confusedly as well certain excursions to passy and auteuil where we foregathered with small resident compatriots the easy gutturalism of whose french an unpremeditated art was a revelation an initiation and whence we roamed for purposes of picnic into parts of the bois de boulogne that oddly enough figured to us the virgin forest better than anything at our own american door had done  it was the social aspect of our situation that most appealed to me none the lessfor i detect myself as i woo it all back disengaging a social aspect again and more than ever from the phenomena disclosed to my reflective gape or to otherwise associated strolls perceptive passages not wholly independent even of the occupancy of twosous chairs within the charmed circle of guignol and of gringalet i suppose i should have blushed to confess it but polichinelle and his puppets in the afternoons under an umbrage sparse till evening fell had still their spell to castas part and parcel that is of the general intensity of animation and variety of feature the amusement the æsthetic and human appeal of paris had in those days less the air of a great shining conspiracy to please the machinery in movement confessed less to its huge purpose but manners and types and traditions the detail of the scene its pointed particulars went their way with a straighter effect as well as often with a homelier gracecharacter temper and tone had lost comparatively little of their emphasis these scattered accents were matter for our eyes and earsnot a little even already for our respective imaginations though it is only as the season waned and we set up our fireside afresh and for the winter that i connect my small revolution with a wider field and with the company of w j again for that summer he was to be in eclipse to me guignol and gringalet failed to claim his attention and mademoiselle danse i make

of european breakfastbread fit to be named even with the feeblest of our american forms then came the small crêmerie white picked out with blue which by some secret of its own keeping afforded within the compass of a few feet square prolonged savoury meals to working men whitefrocked or bluefrocked to uniformed cabmen stout or spare but all more or less audibly bavards and discernibly critical and next the compact embrasure of the écaillère or oysterlady she and her paraphernalia fitted into their interstice much as the mollusc itself into its shell neighboured in turn by the marchanddebois peeping from as narrow a cage his neat faggots and chopped logs stacked beside him and above him in his sentrybox quite as the niches of saints in early italian pictures are framed with tightlypacked fruits and flowers space and remembrance fail me for the rest of the series the attaching note of which comes back as the note of diffused sociability and domestic in fact more or less æsthetic ingenuity with the street a perpetual parlour or household centre for the flitting pausing conversing little bourgeoise or ouvrière to sport on every pretext and in every errand her fluted cap her composed head her neat ankles and her ready wit which is to say indeed but that life and manners were more pointedly and harmoniously expressed under our noses there than we had perhaps found them anywhere save in the most salient passages of stories though i must in spite of it not write as if these trifles were all our fare     xxv   that autumn renewed i make out our long and beguiled walks my own with w j in especial at the same time that i have somehow the sense of the whole more broken appeal on the part of paris the scanter confidence and ease it inspired in us the perhaps more numerous and composite but obscurer and more baffled intimations not indeedfor all my brothers later vision of an accepted flatness in itthat there was not some joy and some grasp why else were we forever as i seem to conceive we were measuring the great space that separated us from the gallery of the luxembourg every step of which either way we took it fed us with some interesting some admirable image kept us in relation to something nobly intended that particular walk was not prescribed us yet we appear to have hugged it across the champselysées to the river and so over the nearest bridge and the quays of the left bank to the rue de seine as if it somehow held the secret of our future to the extent even of my more or less sneaking off on occasion to take it by myself to taste of it with a due undiverted intensity and the throb as of the finest which could only mean the most parisian adventure the further quays with their innumerable old bookshops and printshops the long cases of each of these commodities exposed on the parapets in especial must have come to know us almost as well as we knew them with plot thickening and emotion deepening steadily however as we mounted the long black rue de seinesuch a stretch of perspective such an intensity of tone as it offered in those days where every lowbrowed vitrine waylaid us and we moved in a world of which the dark message expressed in we couldnt have said what sinister way too might have been art art art dont you see learn little gaping pilgrims what that is oh we learned that is we tried to as hard as ever we could and were fairly well at it i always felt even by the time we had passed up into that comparatively short but wider and finer vista of the rue de tournon which in those days more abruptly crowned the more compressed approach and served in a manner as a great outer vestibule to the palace style dimly described looked down there as with conscious encouragement from the high greyheaded clearfaced straightstanding old housesvery much as if wishing to say yes small staring jeune homme we are dignity and memory and measure we are conscience and proportion and taste not to mention strong sense too for all of which good things take usyou wont find one of them when you find as youre going soon to begin to at such a rate vulgarity this i admit was an abundance of remark to such young ears but it did all i maintain tremble in the air with the sense that the rue de tournon cobbled and a little grassgrown might more or less have figured some fine old street de province i cherished in short its very name and think i really hadnt to wait to prefer the then the unmenaced the inviolate café foyot of the left hand corner the muchloved and so haunted café foyot of the old paris to itswell to its roaring successor the wide mouth of the present boulevard saintmichel a short way round the corner had not yet been forced open to the exhibition of more or less glittering fangs old paris still pressed round the palace and its gardens which formed the right the sober social antithesis to the elegant tuileries and which in fine with these renewals of our young confidence reinforced both in a general and in a particular way one of the fondest of our literary curiosities of that time the conscientious study of les français peints par euxmêmes rich in woodcuts of gavarni of grandville of henrimonnier which we held it rather our duty to admire and w j even a little his opportunity to copy in penandink this giltedged and doublecolumned octavo it was that first disclosed to me forestalling a better ground of acquaintance the great name of balzac who in common with every other light writer of his day contributed to its pages hadnt i pored over his exposition there of the contrasted types of lhabituée des tuileries and lhabituée du luxembourgfinding it very serré in fact what i didnt then know enough to call very stodgy but flavoured withal and a trifle lubricated by gavarnis two drawings which had somehow so much in general to say  let me not however dally by the way when nothing at those hours i make out so much spoke to us as the animated pictured halls within the palace primarily those of the senate of the empire but then also forming as with extensions they still and much more copiously form the great paris museum of contemporary art this array was at that stage a comparatively though only comparatively small affair in spite of which fact we supposed it vast and finalso that it would have shocked us to foreknow how in many a case and of the most cherished cases the finality was to break down most of the works of the modern schools that we most admired are begging their bread i fear from door to doorthat is from one provincial museum or dim back seat to another though we were on muchsubsequent returns to draw a long breath for the saved state of some of the great things as to which our faith had been clearest it had been clearer for none i recover than for coutures romains de la décadence recently acclaimed at that time as the last word of the grand manner but of the grand manner modernised humanised philosophised redeemed from academic death so that it was to this masters school that the young american contemporary flutter taught its wings to fly straightest and that i could never in the long aftertime face his masterpiece and all its old meanings and marvels without a rush of memories and a stir of ghosts william hunt the new englander of genius the boston painter whose authority was greatest during the thirty years from 1857 or so and with whom for a time in the early period w j was to work all devotedly had prolonged his studies in paris under the inspiration of couture and of edouard frère masters in a group completed by three or four of the so finely interesting landscapists of that and the directly previous age troyon rousseau daubigny even lambinet and others and which summed up for the american collector and in the new york and boston markets the idea of the modern in the masterly it was a comfortable timewhen appreciation could go so straight could rise and rise higher without critical contortions when we could i mean be both so intelligent and so quiet we were in our immediate circle to know couture himself a little toward the end of his life and i was somewhat to wonder then where he had picked up the æsthetic hint for the beautiful page with a falcon if i have the designation right his other great bid for style and capture of itwhich we were long to continue to suppose perhaps the rarest of all modern pictures the feasting romans were conceivable enough i mean as a conception no mystery hung about themin the sense of ones asking ones self whence they had come and by what romantic or roundabout or noblydangerous journey which is that air of the poetic shaken out as from strong wings when great presences in any one of the arts appear to alight what i remember on the other hand of the splendid fair youth in black velvet and satin or whatever who while he mounts the marble staircase shows off the great bird on his forefinger with a grace that shows him off was that it failed to help us to divine during that afterlapse of the glory of which i speak by what rare chance for the obscured old excelebrity we visited the heavens had once opened poetry had swooped down breathed on him for an hour and fled such at any rate are the seesaws of reputationswhich it contributes to the interest of any observational lingering on this planet to have caught so repeatedly in their weird motion the question of what may happen under ones eyes in particular cases before that motion sinks to rest whether at the up or at the down end being really a bribe to ones own nondeparture especially great the interest of having noted all the rises and falls and of being able to compare the final pointso far as any certainty may go as to thateither with the greatest or the least previous altitudes since it is only when there have been exaltations which is what is not commonest that our attention is most rewarded  if the seesaw was to have operated indeed for eugène delacroix our next young admiration though much more intelligently my brothers than mine that had already taken place and settled for we were to go on seeing him and to the end in firm possession of his crown and to take even i think a harmless pleasure in our sense of having from so far back been sure of it i was sure of it i must properly add but as an effect of my brothers sureness since i must by what i remember have been as sure of paul delarochefor whom the pendulum was at last to be arrested at a very different point i could see in a manner for all the queerness what w j meant by that beauty and above all that living interest in la barque du dante where the queerness according to him was perhaps what contributed most see it doubtless in particular when he reproduced the work at home from a memory aided by a lithograph yet les enfants dedouard thrilled me to a different tune and i couldnt doubt that the longdrawn odd face of the elder prince sad and sore and sick with his wide crimped sidelocks of fair hair and his violet legs marked by the garter and dangling from the bed was a reconstitution of faroff history of the subtlest and most last word modern or psychologic kind i had never heard of psychology in art or anywhere elsescarcely anyone then had but i truly felt the nameless force at play thus if i also in my way subtly admired ones noted practice of that virtue mainly regarded indeed i judge as a vice would appear to have at the time i refer to set in under such encouragements once for all and i can surely have enjoyed up to then no formal exhibition of anything as i at one of those seasons enjoyed the commemorative show of delaroche given soon after his death in one of the rather bleak salles of the École des beauxarts to which access was had from the quay there was reconstituted history if one would in the strawlittered scaffold the distracted ladies with threecornered coifs and those immense hanging sleeves that made them look as if they had bathtowels over their arms in the block the headsman the bandaged eyes and groping hands of lady jane greynot less than in the noble indifference of charles the first compromised king but perfect gentleman at his inscrutable ease in his chair and as if on his throne while the puritan soldiers insult and badger him the thrill of which was all the greater from its pertaining to that english lore which the good robert thompson had to my responsive delight rubbed into us more than anything else and all from a fine old conservative and monarchical point of view yet of these things w j attempted no reproduction though i remember his repeatedly laying his hand on delacroix whom he found always and everywhere interestingto the point of trying effects with charcoal and crayon in his manner and not less in the manner of decamps whom we regarded as more or less of a genius of the same rare family they were touched with the ineffable the inscrutable and delacroix in especial with the incalculable categories these toward which we had even then by a happy transition begun to yearn and languish we were not yet aware of style though on the way to become so but were aware of mystery which indeed was one of its formswhile we saw all the others without exception exhibited at the louvre where at first they simply overwhelmed and bewildered me  it was as if they had gathered there into a vast deafening chorus i shall never forget howspeaking that is for my own sensethey filled those vast halls with the influence rather of some complicated sound diffused and reverberant than of such visibilities as one could directly deal with to distinguish among these in the charged and coloured and confounding air was difficultit discouraged and defied which was doubtless why my impression originally best entertained was that of those magnificent parts of the great gallery simply not inviting us to distinguish they only arched over us in the wonder of their endless golden riot and relief figured and flourished in perpetual revolution breaking into great highhung circles and symmetries of squandered picture opening into deep outward embrasures that threw off the rest of monumental paris somehow as a told story a sort of wrought effect or bold ambiguity for a vista and yet held it there at every point as a vast bright gage even at moments a felt adventure of experience this comes to saying that in those beginnings i felt myself most happily cross that bridge over to style constituted by the wondrous galerie dapollon drawn out for me as a long but assured initiation and seeming to form with its supreme coved ceiling and inordinately shining parquet a prodigious tube or tunnel through which i inhaled little by little that is again and again a general sense of glory the glory meant ever so many things at once not only beauty and art and supreme design but history and fame and power the world in fine raised to the richest and noblest expression the world there was at the same time by an odd extension or intensification the local present fact to my small imagination of the second empire which was for my notified consciousness new and queer and perhaps even wrong but on the spot so amply radiant and elegant that it took to itself took under its protection with a splendour of insolence the state and ancientry of the whole scene profiting thus to ones dim historic vision confusedly though it might be by the unparalleled luxury and variety of its heritage but who shall count the sources at which an intense young fancy when a young fancy is intense capriciously absurdly drinksso that the effect is in twenty connections that of a lovephiltre or fearphiltre which fixes for the senses their supreme symbol of the fair or the strange the galerie dapollon became for years what i can only term a splendid scene of things even of the quite irrelevant or as might be almost unworthy and i recall to this hour with the last vividness what a precious part it played for me and exactly by that continuity of honour on my awaking in a summer dawn many years later to the fortunate the instantaneous recovery and capture of the most appalling yet most admirable nightmare of my life the climax of this extraordinary experiencewhich stands alone for me as a dreamadventure founded in the deepest quickest clearest act of cogitation and comparison act indeed of lifesaving energy as well as in unutterable fearwas the sudden pursuit through an open door along a huge high saloon of a just dimlydescried figure that retreated in terror before my rush and dash a glare of inspired reaction from irresistible but shameful dread out of the room i had a moment before been desperately and all the more abjectly defending by the push of my shoulder against hard pressure on lock and bar from the other side the lucidity not to say the sublimity of the crisis had consisted of the great thought that i in my appalled state was probably still more appalling than the awful agent creature or presence whatever he was whom i had guessed in the suddenest wild start from sleep the sleep within my sleep to be making for my place of rest the triumph of my impulse perceived in a flash as i acted on it by myself at a bound forcing the door outward was the grand thing but the great point of the whole was the wonder of my final recognition routed dismayed the tables turned upon him by my so surpassing him for straight aggression and dire intention my visitant was already but a diminished spot in the long perspective the tremendous glorious hall as i say over the fargleaming floor of which cleared for the occasion of its great line of priceless vitrines down the middle he sped for his life while a great storm of thunder and lightning played through the deep embrasures of high windows at the right the lightning that revealed the retreat revealed also the wondrous place and by the same amazing play my young imaginative life in it of long before the sense of which deep within me had kept it whole preserved it to this thrilling use for what in the world were the deep embrasures and the so polished floor but those of the galerie dapollon of my childhood the scene of something i had vaguely then felt it well i might since it was to be the scene of that immense hallucination  of what at the same time in those years were the great rooms of the louvre almost equally above and below not the scene from the moment they so wrought stage by stage upon our perceptionsliterally on almost all of these in one way and another quite in such a manner i more and more see as to have been educative formative fertilising in a degree which no other intellectual experience our youth was to know could pretend as a comprehensive conducive thing to rival the sharp and strange the quite heartshaking little prevision had come to me for myself i make out on the occasion of our very first visit of all my brothers and mine under conduct of the good jean nadali beforementioned trustfully deputed by our parents in the rue de la paix on the morrow of our first arrival in paris july 1855 and while they were otherwise concerned i hang again appalled but uplifted on brave nadalis armhis professional acquaintance with the splendours about us added for me on the spot to the charm of his european character i cling to him while i gape at géricaults radeau de la méduse the sensation for splendour and terror of interest of that juncture to me and ever afterwards to be associated along with two or three other more or less contemporary products guérins burial of atala prudhons cupid and psyche davids helmetted romanisms madame vigéelebruns ravishing portrait of herself and her little girl with how can i say what foretaste as determined by that instant as if the hour had struck from a clock of all the fun confusedly speaking that one was going to have and the kind of life always of the queer socalled inward sort tremendously sporting in its waythough that description didnt then wait upon it that one was going to lead it came of itself this almost awful apprehension in all the presences under our couriers protection and in my brothers companyit came just there and so there was alarm in it somehow as well as bliss the bliss in fact i think scarce disengaged itself at all but only the sense of a freedom of contact and appreciation really too big for one and leaving such a mark on the very place the pictures the frames themselves the figures within them the particular parts and features of each the look of the rich light the smell of the massively enclosed air that i have never since renewed the old exposure without renewing again the old emotion and taking up the small scared consciousness that with so many of the conditions repeated is the charmto feel afresh the beginning of so much that was to be the beginning in short was with géricault and david but it went on and on and slowly spread so that ones stretched ones even strained perceptions ones discoveries and extensions piece by piece come back on the great premises almost as so many explorations of the house of life so many circlings and hoverings round the image of the world i have dim reminiscences of permitted independent visits uncorrectedly juvenile though i might still be during which the house of life and the palace of art became so mixed and interchangeablethe louvre being under a general description the most peopled of all scenes not less than the most hushed of all templesthat an excursion to look at pictures would have but half expressed my afternoon i had looked at pictures looked and looked again at the vast veronese at murillos moonborne madonna at leonardos almost unholy dame with the folded hands treasures of the salon carré as that display was then composed but i had also looked at france and looked at europe looked even at america as europe itself might be conceived so to look looked at history as a stillfelt past and a complacently personal future at society manners types characters possibilities and prodigies and mysteries of fifty sorts and all in the light of being splendidly on my own as i supposed it though we hadnt then that perfection of slang and of in especial going and coming along that interminable and incomparable seineside front of the palace against which young sensibility felt itself almost rub for endearment and consecration as a cat invokes the friction of a protective piece of furniture such were at any rate some of the vague processesi see for how utterly vague they must showof picking up an education and i was in spite of the vagueness so far from agreeing with my brother afterwards that we didnt pick one up and that that never is done in any sense not negligible and also that an education might or should in particular have picked us up and yet didnti was so far dissentient i say that i think i quite came to glorify such passages and see them as part of an order really fortunate if we had been little asses i seem to have reasoned a higher intention driving us wouldnt have made us less soto any point worth mentioning and as we extracted such impressions to put it at the worst from redemptive accidents to call louvres and luxembourgs nothing better why we werent little asses but something wholly other which appeared all i needed to contend for above all it would have been stupid and ignoble an attested and lasting dishonour not with our chance to have followed our straggling clues as many as we could and disengaging as we happily did i felt the gold and the silver ones whatever the others might have beennot to have followed them and not to have arrived by them so far as we were to arrive instinctively for any dim designs we might have nourished we picked out the silver and the gold attenuated threads though they must have been and i positively feel that there were more of these far more casually interwoven than will reward any present patience for my unravelling of the too fine tissue     xxvi   i allude of course in particular here to the æsthetic clue in general with which it was that we most or that i at any rate most fumbled without our in the least having then as i have already noted any such rare name for it there were sides on which it fairly dangled about us involving our small steps and wits though others too where i could for my own part but clutch at it in the void our experience of the theatre for instance which had played such a part for us at home almost wholly dropped in just the most propitious air an anomaly indeed half explained by the fact that life in general all round us was perceptibly more theatrical and there were other reasons whether definitely set before us or not which we grasped in proportion as we gathered by depressing hearsay that the french drama great strange and important was as much out of relation to our time of life our so little native strain and our cultivated innocence as the american and english had been directly addressed to them to the cirque dÉté the cirque dhiver the théâtre du cirque we were on occasion conductedwe had fallen so to the level of circuses and that name appeared a safety in addition to which the big theatre most bravely bearing it the especial home at that time of the glittering and multitudinous féerie did seem to lift the whole scenic possibility for our eyes into a higher sphere of light and grace than any previously disclosed i recall le diable dargent as in particular a radiant revelationkept before us a whole long evening and as an almost blinding glare which was quite right for the donnée the gradual shrinkage of the shining one the moneymonster hugely inflated at first to all the successive degrees of loose bagginess as he leads the reckless young man he has originally contracted with from dazzling pleasure to pleasure till at last he is a mere shrivelled silver string such as you could almost draw through a keyhole that was the striking moral for the young man however regaled had been somehow sold which we hadnt in the least been who had had all his pleasures and none of his penalty whatever this was to be i was to repine a little in these connections at a much later time on reflecting that had we only been taken in the paris of that period as we had been taken in new york we might have come in for celebritiessupremely fine perhaps supremely rank flowers of the histrionic temperament springing as they did from the soil of the richest romanticism and adding to its richnesswho practised that braver art and finer finish which a comparatively homogenous public forming a compact critical body still left possible rachel was alive but dying the memory of mademoiselle mars at her latest was still in the air mademoiselle georges a massive a monstrous antique had withal returned for a season to the stage but we missed her as we missed déjazet and frédéric lemâitre and mélingue and samson to say nothing of others of the age before the floodtaking for the flood that actual high tide of the outer barbarian presence the general alien and polyglot in stalls and boxes which i remember to have heard gustave flaubert lament as the ruin of the theatre through the assumption of judgeship by a bench to whom the very values of the speech of author and actor were virtually closed or at the best uncertain  i enjoyed but two snatches of the older representational artno particular of either of which however has faded from me the earlier and rarer of these an evening at the gymnase for a spectacle coupé with mesdames rose chéri mélanie delaporte and victoria afterwards victorialafontaine i squeeze again with my mother my aunt and my brother into the stuffy baignoire and i take to my memory in especial madame de girardins une femme qui déteste son mari the thrilling story as i judged it of an admirable lady who to save her loyalist husband during the revolution feigns the most jacobin opinions represents herself a citoyenne of citoyennes in order to keep him the more safely concealed in her house he flattens himself to almost greater peril of life behind a panel of the wainscot which she has a secret for opening when he requires air and food and they may for a fearful fleeting instant be alone together and the point of the picture is in the contrast between these melting moments and the heroines tenue under the tremendous strain of receiving on the one side the invading investigating terrorist commissaries sharply suspicious but successfully baffled and on the other her noble relatives her husbands mother and sister if i rightly remember who are not in the secret and whom for perfect prudence she keeps out of it though alone with her and themselves in hourly danger they might be trusted and who believing him concealed elsewhere and terribly tracked treat her in her republican rage as lost to all honour and all duty ones sense of such things after so long a time has of course scant authority for others but i myself trust my vision of rose chéris fine play just as i trust that of her physique ingrat her at first extremely odd and positively osseous appearance an emaciated woman with a high bulging forehead somewhat of the form of rachels for whom the triumphs of produced illusion as in the second third and fourth great dramas of the younger dumas had to be triumphs indeed my one other reminiscence of this order connects itself and quite three years later with the old dingy vaudeville of the place de la bourse where i saw in my brothers company a rhymed domestic drama of the then still admired ponsard ce qui plaît aux femmes a piece that enjoyed i believe scant success but that was to leave with me ineffaceable images how was it possible i wondered to have more grace and talent a rarer cooler art than mademoiselle fargeuil the heroinethe fine lady whom a pair of rival lovers seeking to win her hand by offering her what will most please her treat in the one case to a brilliant fête a little play within a play at which we assist and in the other to the inside view of an attic of misery into which the more cunning suitor introduces her just in time to save a poor girl the tenant of the place from being ruinously that is successfully tempted by a terrible old woman a prowling revendeuse who dangles before her the condition on which so pretty a person may enjoy every comfort her happier sister the courted young widow intervenes in time reinforces her tottering virtue opens for her an account with baker and butcher and doubting no longer which flame is to be crowned charmingly shows us that what pleases women most is the exercise of charity  then it was i first beheld that extraordinary veteran of the stage mademoiselle pierson almost immemorially attached for later generations to the théâtre français the span of whose career thus strikes me as fabulous though she figured as a very juvenile beauty in the small féerie or allegory forming m ponsards second act she has been playing mothers and aunts this many and many a yearand still indeed much as a juvenile beauty not that light circumstance however pleads for commemoration nor yet the further fact that i was to admire mademoiselle fargeuil in the aftertime the time after she had given all sardous earlier successes the help of her shining firmness when she had passed from interesting comedy and even from romantic dramanot less perhaps still more interesting with sardous patrie as a bridgeto the use of the bigger brush of the ambigu and other homes of melodrama the sense such as it is that i extract from the pair of modest memories in question is rather their value as a glimpse of the old order that spoke so much less of our hundred modern material resources matters the stage of today appears mainly to live by and such volumes more of the one thing that was then and that given various other things had to be of the essence that one thing was the quality to say nothing of the quantity of the actors personal resource technical history tested temper proved experience on which almost everything had to depend and the thought of which makes the mere starved scene and medium of the period the rest of the picture a more confessed and more heroic battleground they have been more and more eased off the scene and medium for our couple of generations so much so in fact that the rest of the picture has become almost all the picture the author and the producer among us lift the weight of the play from the performerparticularly of the play dealing with our immediate life and manners and aspectsafter a fashion which does half the work thus reducing the personal equation the demand for the maximum of individual doing to a contribution mostly of the loosest and sparest as a sop to historic curiosity at all events may even so short an impression serve impression of the strenuous age and its fine old masterful assouplissement of its victimswho were not the expert spectators the spectators were so expert so broken in to material suffering for the sake of their passion that as the suffering was only material they found the æsthetic reward the critical relish of the essence all adequate a fact that seems in a sort to point a moral of large application everything but the interpretation the personal in the french theatre of those days had kinds and degrees of weakness and futility say even falsity of which our modern habit is wholly impatientlet alone other conditions still that were detestable even at the time and some of which forms of discomfort and annoyance linger on to this day the playhouse in short was almost a place of physical torture and it is still rarely in paris a place of physical ease add to this the old thinness of the school of scribe and the old emptiness of the thousand vaudevillistes which part of the exhibition till modern comedy began under the younger dumas and augier had for its counterpart but the terrible dead weight or at least the prodigious prolixity and absurdity of much not to say of most of the romantic and melodramatic output it paid apparently in the golden age of acting to sit through interminable evenings in impossible placessince to assume that the age was in that particular respect golden for which we have in fact a good deal of evidence alone explains the patience of the public with the public the actors were according to their seasoned strength almost exclusively appointed to deal just as in the conditions most familiar today to ourselves this charge is laid on almost everyone concerned in the case save the representatives of the parts and far more other people are now concerned than of old not least those who have learned to make the playhouse endurable all of which leaves us with this interesting vision of a possibly great truth the truth that you cant have more than one kind of intensityintensity worthy of the nameat once the intensity of the golden age of the histrion was the intensity of his good faith the intensity of our period is that of the producers and machinists to which add even that of architect author and critic between which derivative kind of that article as we may call it and the other the immediate kind it would appear that you have absolutely to choose     xxvii   i see much of the rest of that particular paris time in the light of the institution fezandié and i see the institution fezandié rue balzac in the light if not quite of alphonse daudets lean asylum for the petits pays chauds of which i have felt the previous institutions of new york sketchily remind me at least in that of certain other of his studies in that field of the precarious the ambiguous paris over parts of which the great arch at the top of the champselysées flings at its hours by its wide protective plausible shadow a precious mantle of tone they gather these chequered parts into its vast paternal presence and enjoy at its expense a degree of reflected dignity it was to the big square villa of the rue balzac that we turned as pupils not unacquainted with vicissitudes from a scene swept bare of m lerambert an establishment that strikes me at this distance of time as of the oddest and most indescribableor as describable at best in some of the finer turns and touches of daudets best method the picture indeed should not be invidiousit so little needs that i feel for its due measure of the vivid the queer the droll all coming back to me without prejudice to its air as of an equally futile felicity i see it as bright and loose and vague as confused and embarrassed and helpless i see it i fear as quite ridiculous but as wholly harmless to my brothers and me at least and as having left us with a fund of human impressions it played before us such a variety of figure and character and so relieved us of a sense of untoward discipline or of the pursuit of abstract knowledge it was a recreational or at least a social rather than a tuitional house which fact had i really believe weighed favourably with our parents when bereft of m lerambert they asked themselves with their considerable practice how next to bestow us our father like so many free spirits of that time in new york and boston had been much interested in the writings of charles fourier and in his scheme of the phalanstery as the solution of human troubles and it comes to me that he must have met or in other words heard of m fezandié as an active and sympathetic exfourierist i think there were only exfourierists by that time who was embarking not far from us on an experiment if not absolutely phalansteric at least inspired or at any rate enriched by a bold idealism i like to think of the institution as all but phalanstericit so corrects any fear that such places might be dreary i recall this one as positively gaybristling and bustling and resonant untouched by the strenuous note for instance of hawthornes cooperative blithedale i like to think that in its then still almost suburban its pleasantly heterogeneous quarter now oppressively uniform it was close to where balzac had ended his life though i question its identityas for a while i tried not towith the scene itself of the great mans catastrophe round its highwalled garden at all events he would have come and gonea throb of inference that had for some years indeed to be postponed for me though an association displacing today over the whole spot every other interest i in any case cant pretend not to have been most appealed to by that especial phase of our education from which the pedagogic process as commonly understood was most fantastically absent it excelled in this respect the fezandié phase even others exceptionally appointed heaven knows for the supremacy and yet its glory is that it was no poor blank but that it fairly creaked and groaned heatedly overflowed with its wealth we were externes the three of us but we remained in general to luncheon coming home then late in the afternoon with an almost sore experience of multiplicity and vivacity of contact for the beauty of it all was that the institution was speaking technically not more a pensionnat with prevailingly english and american pupils than a pension with mature beneficiaries of both sexes and that our two categories were shaken up together to the liveliest effect this had been m fezandiés grand conception a son of the south bald and slightly replete with a delicate beard a quick but anxious rather melancholy eye and a slim graceful juvenile wife who multiplied herself though scarce knowing at moments i think where or how to turn i see him as a daudet méridional but of the sensitive not the sensual type as something of a rolling stone rolling rather down hillhe had enjoyed some arrested possibly blighted connection in americaand as ready always again for some new application of faith and funds if fondly failing in the least to see why the particular application in the rue balzacthe body of pensioners ranging from infancy to hoary eldshouldnt have been a bright success could have made it one it would have been a most original triumph  i recover it as for ourselves a beautifully mixed adventure a brave little seeing of the world on the happy pretext of lessons we had lessons from time to time but had them in company with ladies and gentlemen young men and young women of the anglosaxon family who sat at long boards of green cloth with us and with several of our contemporaries english and american boys taking dictées from the head of the house himself or from the aged and most remarkable m bonnefons whom we believed to have been a superannuated actor he above all such a model for daudet and who interrupted our abashed readings aloud to him of the french classics older and newer by wondrous reminiscences and even imitations of talma he moved among us in a cloud of legend the wigged and wrinkled the impassioned though i think alas underfed m bonnefons it was our belief that he went back beyond the first empire to the scenes of the revolutionthis perhaps partly by reason in the first place of his scorn of our pronunciation when we met it of the sovereign word liberté the poverty of which our deplorable libbeté without rs he mimicked and derided sounding the right the revolutionary form out splendidly with thirty rs the prolonged beat of a drum and then we believed him if artistically conservative politically obnoxious to the powers that then were though knowing that those so marked had to walk and even to breathe cautiously for fear of the mouchards of the tyrant we knew all about mouchards and talked of them as we do today of aviators or suffragettesto remember which in an age so candidly unconscious of them is to feel how much history we have seen unrolled there were times when he but paced up and down and round the long tablei see him as never seated but always on the move a weary wandering jew of the classe but in particular i hear him recite to us the combat with the moors from le cid and show us how talma describing it seemed to crouch down on his haunches in order to spring up again terrifically to the height of nous nous levons alors which m bonnefons rendered as if on the carpet there fifty men at least had leaped to their feet but he threw off these broken lights with a quick relapse to indifference he didnt like the anglosaxonof the children of albion at least his view was low on his american specimens he had i observed more mercy and this imperfection of sympathy the question of waterloo apart rested it was impossible not to feel on his so resenting the dishonour suffered at our hands by his beautiful tongue to which as the great field of elocution he was patriotically devoted i think he fairly loathed our closed english vowels and confused consonants our destitution of sounds that he recognised as sounds though why in this connection he put up best with our own compatriots embroiled at that time often in even stranger vocables than now is more than i can say i think that would be explained perhaps by his feeling in them as an old equalitarian certain accessibilities quand même besides we of the younger persuasion at least must have done his ear less violence than those earnest ladies from beyond the sea and than those young englishmen qualifying for examinations and careers who flocked with us both to the plausibly spread and the severely disgarnished table and on whose part i seem to see it again an effort of anguish to pick up the happy idiom that we had unconsciously acquired french in the fine old formula of those days so much diffused was the language of the family but i think it must have appeared to these students in general a family of which the youngest members were but scantly kept in their place we piped with a greater facility and to a richer meed of recognition which sounds as if we might have become in these strange collocations fairly offensive little prigs that was none the less not the case for there were oddly enough a few french boys as well to whom on the lingual or the family ground we felt ourselves feebly relative and in comparison with whom for that matter or with one of whom i remember an occasion of my having to sink to insignificance there was at the institution little of a staffbesides waiters and bonnes but it embraced such as it was m mesnard as well as m bonnefonsm mesnard of the new generation instructor in whatever it might be among the arts that didnt consist of our rolling our rs and with them to help us out more or less our eyes it is significant that this elegant branch is now quite vague to me and i recall m mesnard in fine as no less modern and cheap than m bonnefons was rare and unappraiseable he had nevertheless given me his attention one morning doubtless patiently enough in some corner of the villa that we had for the moment practically to ourselvesi seem to see a small empty room looking on the garden when there entered to us benevolently ushered by madame fezandié a small boy of very fair and romantic aspect as it struck me a pupil newly arrived i remember of him mainly that he had a sort of nimbus of light curls a face delicate and pale and that deeply hoarse voice with which french children used to excite our wonder m mesnard asked of him at once with interest his name and on his pronouncing it sought to know with livelier attention if he were then the son of m arsène houssaye lately director of the théâtre français to this distinction the boy confessedall to such intensification of our répétiteurs interest that i knew myself quite dropped in comparison from his scheme of things such an origin as our little visitors affected him visibly as dazzling and i felt justified after a while in stealing away into the shade the beautiful little boy was to live to be the late m henry houssaye the shining hellenist and historian i have never forgotten the ecstasy of hope in m mesnards questionas a light on the reverence then entertained for the institution m houssaye the elder had administered     xxviii   there comes to me in spite of these memories of an extended connection a sense as of some shrinkage or decline in the beaux jours of the institution which seems to have found its current run a bit thick and troubled rather than with the pleasant plash in which we at first appeared all equally to bathe i gather as i try to reconstitute that the general enterprise simply proved a fantasy not workable and that at any rate the elders and often such queer elders tended to outnumber the candid jeunesse so that i wonder by the same token on what theory of the castalian spring as taught there to trickle if not to flow m houssaye holding his small son by the heel as it were may have been moved to dip him into our well shall i blush to relate that my own impression of its virtue must have come exactly from this uncanny turn takenand quite in spite of the high fezandié idealsby the invraisemblable house of entertainment where the assimilation of no form of innocence was doubted of by reason of the forms of experience that insisted somehow on cropping up and no form of experience too directly deprecated by reason of the originally plotted tender growths of innocence and some of these shapes were precisely those from which our good principal may well have first drawn his liveliest reassurance i seem to remember such ancient american virgins in especial and such odd and either distinctively longnecked or more particularly longhaired and chinless compatriots in black frockcoats of no type or cut no suggested application at all as garmentsapplication that is to anything in the nature of character or circumstance function or positiongathered about in the groups that m bonnefons almost terrorised by his refusal to recognise among the barbarous races any approach to his view of the great principle of diction i remember deeply and privately enjoying some of his shades of scorn and seeing how given his own background they were thoroughly founded i remember above all as burnt in by the impression he gave me of the creature wholly animated and containing no waste expressional spaces no imaginative flatnesses the notion of the luxury of life though indeed of the amount of trouble of it too when none of the letters of the alphabet of sensibility might be dropped involved in being a frenchman the liveliest lesson i must have drawn however from that source makes in any case at the best an odd educational connection given the kind of concentration at which education even such as ours is supposed especially to aim i speak of that direct promiscuity of insights which might easily have been pronounced profitless with their attendant impressions and quickened sensibilitiesyielding as these last did harvests of apparitions i positively cherish at the present hour the fond fancy that we all soaked in some such sublime element as might still have hung about therei mean on the very spotfrom the vital presence so lately extinct of the prodigious balzac which had involved as by its mere respiration so dense a cloud of other presences so arrayed an army of interrelated shades that the air was still thick as with the fumes of witchcraft with infinite seeing and supposing and creating with a whole imaginative traffic the pension vauquer then but lately existent according to le père goriot on the other side of the seine was still to be revealed to me but the figures peopling it are not today essentially more intense that is as a matter of the marked and featured the terrible and the touching as compared with the paleness of the conned page in general than i persuade myself with so little difficulty that i found the more numerous and more shifting though properly doubtless less inspiring constituents of the pension fezandié fantastic and all subjective that i should attribute a part of their interest or that of the scene spreading round them to any competent perception in the smallboy mind that the general or public moment had a rarity and a brevity a sharp intensity of its own ruffling all things as they came with the morning breath of the second empire and making them twinkle back with a light of resigned acceptance a freshness of cynicism the force of a great grimacing example the grimace might have been legibly there in the air to the young apprehension and could i but simplify this record enough i should represent everything as part of it i seemed at any rate meanwhile to think of the fezandié young men young englishmen mostly who were getting up their french in that manycoloured air for what i supposed in my candour to be appointments and posts diplomatic commercial vaguely official and who as i now infer though i didnt altogether embrace it at the time must under the loose rule of the establishment have been amusing themselves not a little it was as a sidewind of their free criticism i take it that i felt the first chill of an apprehended decline of the establishment some pang of prevision of what might come and come as with a crash of the general fine fallacy on which it rested their criticism was for that matter free enough causing me to admire it even while it terrified they expressed themselves in terms of magnificent scornsuch as might naturally proceed i think i felt from a mightier race they spoke of poor old bonnefons they spoke of our good fezandié himself they spoke more or less of everyone within view as beggars and beasts and i remember to have heard on their lips no qualification of any dish served to us at dêjeuner and still more at the later meal of which my brothers and i didnt partake but as rotten these were expressions absent from our domestic our american air either of fonder discriminations or vaguer estimates which fairly extended for me the range of intellectual or at least of social resource and as the general tone of them today comes back to me it floods somehow with light the image of the fine old insular confidence so intellectually unregenerate then that such a name scarce covers it though inward stirrings and the growth of a comparative sense of things have now begun unnaturally to agitate and disfigure it in which the general outward concussion of the english abroad with the fact of being abroad took place the fezandié young men were as much abroad as might be and yet figured to melargely by the upsetting force of that confidence all but physically exercisedas the finest handsomest knowingest creatures so that when i met them of an afternoon descending the champselysées with fine long strides and in the costume of the period for which we can always refer to contemporary numbers of punch the fact that i was for the most part walking sedately either with my mother or my aunt or even with my sister and her governess caused the spark of my vision that they were armed for conquest or at the least for adventure more expansively to glow i am not sure whether as a general thing they honoured me at such instants with a sign of recognition but i recover in especial the sense of an evening hour during which i had accompanied my mother to the hôtel meurice where one of the new york cousins aforementioned daughter of one of the albany unclesthat is of the rhinebeck member of the grouphad perched for a time so incongruously one already seemed to feel after the sorriest stroke of fate i see again the gaslit glare of the rue de rivoli in the spring or the autumn evening i forget which for our year of the rue dangoulême had been followed by a migration to the rue montaigne with a period or rather with two periods of boulognesurmer interwoven and we might have made our beguiled way from either domicile and the whole impression seemed to hang too numerous lamps and too glittering vitrines about the poor pendletons bereavement their loss of their only their so sturdily handsome little boy and to suffuse their state with the warm rich exhalations of subterraneous cookery with which i find my recall of paris from those years so disproportionately and so quite other than stomachically charged the point of all of which is simply that just as we had issued from the hotel my mother anxiously urging me through the cross currents and queer contacts as it were of the great bazaar of which the rue de rivoli was then a much more bristling avenue than now rather than depending on me for support and protection there swung into view the most splendid as i at least esteemed him of my elders and betters in the rue balzac who had left the questions there supposedly engaging us far behind and with his high hat a trifle askew and his cigar actively alight revealed to me at a glance what it was to be in full possession of paris there was speed in his step assurance in his air he was visibly impatiently on the way and he gave me thereby my first full image of what it was exactly to be on the way he gave it the more doubtless through the fact that with a flourish of the aforesaid high hat from which the englishman of that age was so singularly inseparable he testified to the act of recognition and to deference to my companion but with a grand bigboy goodhumour thatas i remember from childhood the so frequent effect of an easy patronage compared with a topmost overlooking on the part of an admired senioronly gave an accent to the difference as if he cared or could have that i but went forth through the paris night in the hand of my mamma while he had greeted us with a grace that was as a beat of the very wings of freedom of such shreds at any rate proves to be woven the stuff of young sensibilitywhen memory if sensibility has at all existed for it rummages over our old trunkful of spiritual duds and drawing forth ever so tenderly this that and the other tattered web holds up the pattern to the light i find myself in this connection so restlessly and tenderly rummage that the tatters however thin come out in handsful and every shred seems tangled with another  gertrude pendletons mere name for instance becomes and very preferably the frame of another and a better picture drawing to it cognate associations those of that element of the new york cousinship which had originally operated to place there in a shining and even as it were an economic light a preference for pariswhich preference during the period of the rue dangoulême and the rue montaigne we wistfully saw at play the very lightest and freest on the part of the inimitable masons their earlier days of tours and trouville were over a period of relative rigour at the florence of the still encircling walls the still so existent abuses and felicities was also i seem to gather a thing of the past great accessions consciously awaited during the previous leaner time had beautifully befallen them and my own whole consciousness of the general airso insistently i discriminate for that alonewas coloured by a familiar view of their enjoyment of these on a tremendously draped and festooned premier of the ruesthonoré bristling with ormolu and pradier statuettes and looking almost straight across to the british embassy rather a low premier after the manner of an entresol as i remember it and where the closed windows which but scantly distinguished between our own sounds and those of the sociable and yet the terrible street of records and memories seemed to maintain an air and a light thick with a mixture of every sort of queer old parisian amenity and reference as if to look or to listen or to touch were somehow at the same time to probe to recover and communicate to behold to taste and even to smellto ones greater assault by suggestion no doubt but also to the effect of some sweet and strange repletion as from the continued consumption say out of flounced and puckered boxes of serried rows of chocolate and other bonbons i must have felt the whole thing as something for ones developed senses to live up to and make light of and have been rather ashamed of my own for just a little sickishly staggering under it this goes however with the fondest recall of our cousins inbred ease from far back in all such assumable relations and of how four of the simplest sweetest bestnatured girls as they were with the eldest a charming beauty to settle on the general ground after marriage and widowhood and still to be blooming there they were possessed of the scene and its great reaches and resources and possibilities in a degree that reduced us to small provincialism and a hanging on their lips when they told us that is when the gentlest of mammas and the lovely daughter who was out did of presentations at the tuileries to the then allwonderful the ineffable empress reports touchingly qualified on the part of our so exposed yet after all so scantily indurated relatives by the question of whether occasions so great didnt perhaps nevertheless profane the sundays for which they were usually appointed there was something of an implication in the air of those days when young americans were more numerously lovely than now or at least more wideeyed it would fairly appear that some account of the only tradition they had ever been rumoured to observe that of the lords day might have been taken even at the tuileries  but what most comes back to me as the very note and fragrance of the new york cousinship in this general connection is a time that i remember to have glanced at on a page distinct from these when the particular cousins i now speak of had conceived under the influence of i know not what unextinguished morning star the liveliest taste for the earliest possible rambles and researches in which they were so good as to allow me when i was otherwise allowed to participate healthgiving walks of an extraordinarily matinal character at the hour of the meticulous ragpickers and exceptionally french polishers known to the paris dawns of the second empire as at no time since which made us all feel together under the conduct of honorine bright child of the pavement herself as if we in our fresh curiosity and admiration had also something to say to the great show presently to be opened and were free throughout the place as those are free of a house who know its aspects of attic and cellar or how it looks from behind i call our shepherdess honorine even though perhaps not infallibly naming the sociable soubrette who might with all her gay bold confidence have been an official inspectress in person and to whose easy care or more particularly expert sensibility and candour of sympathy and curiosity our flock was freely confided if she wasnt honorine she was clémentine or augustinewhich is a trifle since what i thus recover in any case of these brushings of the strange parisian dew is those communities of contemplation that made us most hang about the jewellers windows in the palais royal and the public playbills of the theatres on the boulevard the palais royal now so dishonoured and disavowed was then the very paris of paris the shutters of the shops seemed taken down at that hour for our especial benefit and i remember well how the dressing of so large a number of the compact and richly condensed fronts being more often than not a matter of diamonds and pearls rubies and sapphires that represented in their ingenuities of combination and contortion the highest taste of the time i found open to me any amount of superior study of the fact that the spell of gems seemed for the feminine nature almost alarmingly boundless i stared too it comes back to me at these exhibitions and perhaps even thought it became a young man of the world to express as to this or that object a refined and intelligent preference but what i really most had before me was the chorus of abjection as i might well have called it led at the highest pitch by honorine and vaguely suggesting to me by the crudity so to say of its wistfulness a natural frankness of passiongoodness knew in fact for my small intelligence really didnt what depths of corruptibility droll enough as i win them again these queer dim plays of consciousness my sense that my innocent companions honorine en tête would have done anything or everything for the richest ruby and that though one couldnt ones self be decently dead to that richness one didnt at all know what anything might be or in the least what everything was the gushing cousins at the same time assuredly knew still less of that and honorines brave gloss of a whole range alike of possibilities and actualities was in itself a true social grace  they all enjoyed in fine while i somehow but wastefully musedwhich was after all my form of enjoyment i was shy for it though it was a truth and perhaps odd enough withal that i didnt really at all care for gems that rubies and pearls in no matter what collocations left me comparatively cold that i actually cared for them about as little as monstrously secretly painfully i cared for flowers later on i was to become aware that i adored trees and architectural marblesthat for a sufficient slab of a sufficiently rare sufficiently bestreaked or empurpled marble in particular i would have given a bag of rubies but by then the time had passed for my being troubled to make out what in that case would represent on a small boys part the corruptibility so to call it proclaimed before the vitrines by the cousins that hadnt as a question later on its actuality but it had so much at the time that if it had been frankly put to me i must have quite confessed my inability to sayand must i gather by the same stroke have been ashamed of such inward penury feeling that as a boy i showed more poorly than girls there was a difference meanwhile for such puzzlements before the porticos of the theatres all questions melted for me there into the single depth of envyenvy of the equal the beatific command of the evening hour in the régime of honorines young train who were fresh for the early sparrow and the chiffonier even after shedding buckets of tears the night before and not so much as for the first or the second time over the beautiful story of la dame aux camélias there indeed was another humiliation but by my weakness of position much more than of nature whatever doing of everything might have been revealed to me as a means to the end i would certainly have done it for a sight of madame doche and fechter in dumass triumphant idyllnow enjoying the fullest honours of innocuous classicism with which as with the merits of its interpreters honorines happy charges had become perfectly and if not quite serenely at least ever so responsively and feelingly familiar of a wondrous mixed sweetness and sharpness and queerness of uneffaced reminiscence is all that aspect of the cousins and the rambles and the overlapping nights melting along the odorously bedamped and retouched streets and arcades bright in the ineffable morning light above all of our peculiar young culture and candour  all of which again has too easily led me to drop for a moment my more leading clue of that radiation of goodnature from gertrude pendleton and her headlong hospitalities in which we perhaps most complacently basked the becraped passage at meurices alluded to a little back was of a later season and the radiation as i recall it had been that first winter mainly from a petit hôtel somewhere on the other side as we used with a large sketchiness to say of the champs elysées a region at that time reduced to no regularity but figuring to my fond fancy as a chaos of accidents and contrasts where petits hôtels of archaic type were elbowed by woodyards and cabarets and pavilions ever so characteristic yet ever so indefinable snuggled between frank industries and vulgaritiesall brightened these indeed by the sociable note of paris be it only that of chaffering or of other bavardise the great consistencies of archrefinement now of so large a harmony were still to come so that it seemed rather original to live there in spite of which the attraction of the hazard of it on the part of our then so uniformly natural young kinswoman not so much ingeniously or even expressively as just gesticulatively and helplessly gaysince that earlier pitch of new york parlance scarce arrived at or for that matter pretended to enunciationwas quite in what i at least took to be the glitter of her very conventions and traditions themselves exemplified for instance by a bright nocturnal christeningparty in honour of the small son of all hopes whom she was so precipitately to lose an occasion which as we had in our way known the act of baptism but as so abbreviated and in fact so tacit a business had the effect for us of one of the great forms of a society taking itself with typical seriousness we were much more serious than the pendletons but paradoxically enough there was that weakness in our state of our being able to make no such attestation of it the evening can have been but of the friendliest easiest and least pompous nature with small guests in congruity with its small hero as well as large but i must have found myself more than ever yet in presence of a rite one of those round which as many kinds of circumstance as possible clusteredso that the more of these there were the more one might imagine a great social order observed how shall i now pretend to say how many kinds of circumstance i supposed i recognisedwith the remarkable one to begin with and which led fancy so far afield that the religious ceremony was at the same time a party of twinkling lustres and disposed flowers and ladies with bare shoulders that platitudinous bareness of the period that suggested somehow the moral line drawn as with a ruler and a firm pencil with little english girls daughters of a famous physician of that nationality then pursuing a parisian career he must have helped the little victim into the world and whose emphasised type much impressed itself with round glazed and beribboned boxes of multicoloured sugared almonds dragées de baptême above all which we harvested in their heaps as we might have gathered apples from a shaken tree and which symbolised as nothing else the ritual dignity perhaps this grand impression really came back but to the dragées de baptême not strictly more immemorial to our young appreciation than the new years cake and the election cake known to us in new york yet immensely more official and of the nature of scattered largesse partly through the days and days as it seemed to me that our life was to be furnished reinforced and almost encumbered with them it wasnt simply that they were so toothsome but that they were somehow so important and so historic  it was with no such frippery however that i connected the occasional presence among us of the young member of the cousinship in this case of the maternal who most moved me to wistfulness of wonder though not at all with his then marked difference of age by inviting my free approach vernon king to whom i have in another part of this record alluded at that time doing his baccalauréat on the other side of the seine and coming over to our world at scraps of moments for i recall my awe of the tremendous nature as i supposed it of his toil as to quite a makebelieve and gingerbread place the lightest of substitutes for the europe in which he had been from the first so technically plunged his mother and sister also on an earlier page referred to had from their distance committed him to the great city to be finished educationally to the point that for our strenuous cousin charlotte was the only proper oneand i feel sure he can have acquitted himself in this particular in a manner that would have passed for brilliant if such lights didnt thanks to her stiff little standards always tend to burn low in her presence these ladies were to develop more and more the practice of living in odd places for abstract inhuman reasonsat marseilles at düsseldorf if i rightly recall their principal german sojourn at naples above all for a long stage where in particular their grounds of residence were somehow not as those of others even though i recollect from a much later time attending them there at the opera an experience which in their fashion they succeeded in despoiling for me of every element of the concrete or at least of the pleasantly vulgar later impressions few but firm were so to enhance ones tenderness for vernons own image the most interesting surely in all the troop of our young kinsmen early baffled and gathered that he glances at me out of the paris period freshcoloured just blondbearded always smiling and catching his breath a little as from a mixture of eagerness and shyness with such an appeal to the right idealisation or to belated justice as makes of mere evocation a sort of exercise of loyalty it seemed quite richly laid upon me at the timei get it all backthat he two or three years older than my elder brother and dipped more early as well as held more firmly in the deep the refining waters the virtue of which we all together though with our differences of consistency recognised was the positive and living proof of what the process comparatively poor for ourselves could do at its best and with clay originally and domestically kneaded to the right plasticity besides which he shone to my fancy and all the more for its seeming so brightly and quietly in his very grain with the vague the supposititious but the intensely accentgiving stamp of the latin quarter which we so thinly imagined and so superficially brushed on our pious walks to the luxembourg and through the parts where the glamour might have hung thickest we were to see him a littlebut two or three timesthree or four years later when just before our own return he had come back to america for the purpose if my memory serves of entering the harvard law school and to see him still always with the smile that was essentially as facial as livingly and loosely fixed somehow as his fresh complexion itself always too with the air of caring so little for what he had been put through that under any appeal to give out more or less wonderfully some sample or echo of it as who should say he still mostly panted as from a laughing mental embarrassment he had been put through too much it was all stale to him and he wouldnt have known where to begin he did give out a little on occasionspeaking that is on my different plane as it were and by the roundabout report of my brother he gave out it appeared as they walked together across shining newport sands some fragment some beginning of a very youthful poem that europe had with other results moved him to and a faint thin shred of which was to stick in my remembrance for reasons independent of its quality        harold rememberest thou the day        we rode along the appian way      neglected tomb and altar cast        their lengthening shadow oer the plain      and while we talked the mighty past        around us lived and breathed again   that was european enough and yet he had returned to america really to find himself even with every effort made immediately near him to defeat the discovery he found himself with the outbreak of the war simply as the american soldier and not under any bribe however dim of the epaulette or the girt sword but just as the common enlisting native which he smiled and gaspedto the increase of his happy shortness of breath as from a repletion of culture since it suggested no lack of personal soundnessat feeling himself so like to be as strange yet as still more touching than strange i recall the sight even at a distance of the drop straight off him of all his layers of educational varnish the possession of the advantages the tongues the degrees the diplomas the reminiscences a saturation too that had all sunk ina sacrifice of precious attributes that might almost have been viewed as a wild bonfire so his prodigious mother whom i have perhaps sufficiently presented for my reader to understand didnt fail to view itjudging it also sharply hostile to the action of the north as the whole dreadful situation found her with deep and resentful displeasure i remember how i thought of vernon himself during the business as at once so despoiled so diverted and above all so resistantly bright as vaguely to suggest something more in him still some deepdown reaction some extremity of indifference and defiance some exhibition of a young character too long pressed and impressed too long prescribed to and with too much expected of it and all under too firmer a will so that the public pretext had given him a lift or lent him wings which without its greatness might have failed him as the case was to turn nothingthat is nothing he most wanted and remarkably most enjoyeddid fail him at all i forget with which of the possible states new york massachusetts or rhode island though i think the first he had taken service only seeming to remember that this all went on for him at the start in mcclellans and later on in grants army and that badly wounded in a virginia battle he came home to be nursed by his mother recently restored to america for a brief stay she held i believe in the event that he had under her care given her his vow that his term being up he would not should he get sufficiently well reengage the question here was between them but it was definite that materially speaking she was in no degree dependent on him the old the irrepressible adage however was to live again between them when the devil was sick the devil a saint would be when the devil was well the devil a saint was he  the devil a saint at all events was vernon who denied that he had passed his word and who as soon as he had surmounted his first disablement passionately and quite admirably reenlisted at once restored to the front and to what now gave life for him its indispensable relish he was in the thick again of the great carnage roundabout richmond where again gravely wounded he as i figure still incorrigibly smiling succumbed his mother had by this time indignantly returned to europe accompanied by her daughter and her younger sonthe former of whom accepted for our great pity a little later on the office of closing the story anne king young and frail but not less firm under stress than the others of her blood came back on her brothers death and quietest most colourless electra of a lucidest orestes making her difficult way amid massed armies and battledrenched fields got possession of his buried body and bore it for reinterment to newport the old habitation as i have mentioned of their fathers people both vernons and kings it must have been to see my mother as well as to sail again for europe that she afterwards came to boston where i remember going down with her at the last to the dock of the english steamer some black and tublike cunarder an archaic africa or asia sufficing to the boston service of those days i saw her off drearily and helplessly enough i well remember and even at that moment found for her another image what was she most like though in a still sparer and dryer form but some lowtoned some employed little brontë heroinethough more indeed a lucy snowe than a jane eyre and with no shade of a brontë hero within sight to this all the fine privilege and fine culture of all the fine countries collective matter from far back of our intimated envy had amounted just as it had amounted for vernon to the bare headstone on the newport hillside where by his mothers decree as i have already noted there figured no hint of the manner of his death so grand so finely personal a manner it appeared to me at the time and has indeed appeared ever since that this brief record irrepressibly springs from that his mother as i have equally noted was however with her views to find no grace in it so long as she lived and his sister went back to her and to marseille as they always called it but prematurely to die     xxix   i feel that much might be made of my memories of boulognesurmer had i but here left room for the vast little subject in which i should probably once started wander to and fro as exploringly as perceivingly as discoveringly i am fairly tempted to call it as might really give the measure of my small operations at the time i was almost wholly reduced there to operations of that mere inward and superficially idle order at which we have already so freely assisted reduced by a cause i shall presently mention the production of a great blur wellnigh after the fashion of some mild domestic but quite considerably spreading greasespot in respect to the world of action such as it was more or less immediately about me i must personally have lived during this pale predicament almost only by seeing what i could after my incorrigible ambulant fashiona practice that may well have made me pass for bringing home nothing in the least exhibitionalrather than by pursuing the inquiries and interests that agitated to whatever intensity our on the whole widening little circle the images i speak of as matter for more evocation that i can spare them were the fruit of two different periods at boulogne a shorter and a longer this second appearing to us all at the time i gather too endlessly and blightingly prolonged so sharply before it was over did i at any rate come to yearn for the rue montaigne again the rue montaigne sublet for a term under a flurry produced in my parents breasts by a financial crisis of great violence to which the american world as a matter now of recorded history i believe had tragically fallen victim and which had imperilled or curtailed for some months our moderate means of existence we were to recover i make out our disturbed balance and were to pursue awhile further our chase of the alien the somehow repeatedly postponed real opportunity and the second the comparatively cramped and depressed connection with the classic refuge as it then was of spasmodic thrift when not of settled indigence for the embarrassed of our race in the largest sense of this matter was to be shuffled off at last with no scant relief and reaction this is perhaps exactly why the whole picture of our existence at the pasdecalais watering place pleads to me now for the full indulgence what would be in other words every touch of tenderness workable after all the years over the lost and confused and above all on their own side poor ultimately rather vulgarised and violated little sources of impression items and aspects these which while they in their degree and after their sort flourished we only asked to admire or at least to appreciate for their rewarding extreme queerness the very centre of my particular consciousness of the place turned too soon to the fact of my coming in there for the gravest illness of my life an all but mortal attack of the malignant typhus of old days which after laying me as low as i could well be laid for many weeks condemned me to a convalescence so arduous that i saw my apparently scant possibilities by the measure of them then taken even as through a glass darkly or through the expansive blur for which i found just above a homely image  this experience was to become when i had emerged from it the great reminiscence or circumstance of old boulogne for me and i was to regard it with much intelligence i should have maintained as the marked limit of my state of being a small boy i took on when i had decently and all the more because i had so retardedly recovered the sense of being a boy of other dimensions somehow altogether and even with a new dimension introduced and acquired a dimension that i was eventually to think of as a stretch in the direction of essential change or of living straight into a part of myself previously quite unvisited and now made accessible as by the sharp forcing of a closed door the blur of consciousness imaged by my greasespot was not i hasten to declare without its relenting edges and even during its major insistence fainter thicknesses short of which i see my picture the picture i was always so incurably after would have failed of animation altogetherquite have failed to bristle with characteristics with figures and objects and scenic facts particular passages and moments the stuff in short of that scrap of minor gain which i have spoken of as our multiplied memories wasnt i even at the time and much more later on to feel how we had been through the thick and thin of the whole adventure assaulted as never before in so concentrated a way by local and social character such was the fashion after which the boulogne of long agoi have known next to nothing of it sincecould come forth come more than halfway as we say to meet the imagination open to such advances it was taking one thing with another so verily drenched in character that i see myself catching this fine flagrancy almost equally in everything unless indeed i may have felt it rather smothered than presented on the comparatively sordid scene of the collège communal not long afterwards to expand i believe into the local lycée to which the inimitable process of our education promptly introduced us i was to have less of the collège than my elder and my younger brother thanks to the interrupting illness that placed me so long with its trail of aftereffects half complacently half ruefully apart but i suffered for a few early weeks the mainly malodorous sense of the braver life produced as this was by a deeply democratic institution from which no small son even of the most soapless home could possibly know exclusion odd i recognise that i should inhale the air of the place so particularly so almost only to that dismal effect since character was there too for whom it should concern and my view of some of the material conditions of the general collegiate presence toward the top of the steepish grand rue on the right and not much short as it comes back to me of the then closely clustered and inviolate haute ville the more or less surviving old town the idle grey rampart the moated and towered citadel the treeshaded bastion for strolling and sitting immortalised by thackeray achieved the monumental in its degree after a fashion never yet associated for us with the pursuit of learning didnt the campaigner suffering indigence at the misapplied hands of colonel newcome rage at that hushed victim supremely and dreadfully just thereaboutsby which i mean in the haute villeover some question of a sacrificed sweetbread or a cold hacked joint that somebody had been at beside such builded approaches to an education as we had elsewhere known the collège exhibited with whatever reserves the measure of style which almost any french accident of the administratively architectural order more easily rises to than fails of even if the matter be but a question of the shyest similitude of a cour dhonneur the court disconnecting the scene by intention at least from the basely bourgeois and giving value to the whole effect of opposed and windowed wall and important or balanced and placed perron these are many words for the dull precinct as then presented i admit and they are perhaps half prompted by a special association too ghostly now quite to catch againthe sense of certain sundays distinct from the grim that is the flatly instructional body of the week when i seem to myself to have successfully flouted the whole constituted field by passing across it and from it to some quite ideally oldworld little annexed musée de province as inviolate in its way as the grey rampart and bare citadel and very like them in unrelieved tone where i repeatedly and without another presence to hinder looked about me at goodness knows what weird ancientries of stale academic art not one of these treasures in its habit as it lived do i recall yet the sense and the note of them was at the time none the less not so elusive that i didnt somehow draw straight from them intimations of the interesting that is revelations of the æsthetic the historic the critical mystery and charm of things of such things taken altogether that added to my small loose handful of the seed of culture  that apprehension was in its way of our house of learning too and yet i recall how on the scant and simple terms i have glanced at i quite revelled in it whereas other impressions of my brief ordeal shrink for anything in the nature of interest but to three or four recovered marks of the social composition of the school there were the sons of all the small shopkeepers and not less by my remembrance of certain of the mechanics and artisans but there was also the english contingent these predominantly internes and uniformed bluejacketed and brassbuttoned even to an effect of odd redundancy who by my conceit gave our association a lift vivid still to me is the summer morning on which in the wide courtas wide that is as i liked to suppose it and where we hung about helplessly enough for recreationa brownish blackeyed youth of about my own degree of youthfulness mentioned to me with an air that comes back as that of the liveliest informational resource the outbreak just heard of of an awful mutiny in india where his military parents who had not so long before sent him over thence with such weakness of imagination as i measured it to the poor spot on which we stood were in mortal danger of their lives so that news of their having been killed would perhaps be already on the way they might well have been military these impressively exposed characters since my friends name was napier or nappié as he was called at the school and since i may add also there attached to him in my eyes the glamour of an altogether new emphasis of type the english boys within our ken since our coming abroad had been of the fewestthe fezandié youths whether english or american besides being but scantly boys had been so lost on that scene in our heap of disparities and it pressed upon me after a fashion of its own that those we had known in new york and all aware of their varieties and personalities as one had supposed ones self had in no case challenged the restless placing impulse with any such force as the finished little nappié they had not been as he was by the very perversity of his finish resultants of forces at allor comparatively speaking it was as if their producing elements had been simple and few whereas behind this more mixed and as we have learnt to say evolved companion his very simplicities his gaps of possibility being still evolved there massed itself i couldnt have said what protective social order what tangled creative complexity why i should have thought him almost indian of stamp and hue because his english parents were of the so general indian peril is more than i can say yet i have his exotic and above all his bold his imaginably even bad young face finely unacquainted with law before me at this hour quite undimmedannouncing as i conceived it and quite as a shock any awful adventure one would as well as something that i must even at the time have vaguely taken as the play of the passions he vanishes and i dare say i but make him over as i make everything and he must have led his life whatever it was to become with the least possible waiting on the hour or the major consequence and no waste of energy at all in mooning no patience with any substitute for his very own humour we had another schoolmate this one native to the soil whose references were with the last vividness local and who was yet to escape with brilliancy in the aftertime the smallest shadow of effacement his most direct reference at that season was to the principal pastrycooks of the town an establishment we then found supreme for little crisscrossed apple tartlets and melting babasyoung coquelins home life amid which we the more acutely envied that the upward cock of his so allimportant nose testified for my fancy to the largest range of free familiar sniffing cb coquelin is personally most present to me in the form of that hour by the value as we were to learn to put it of this nose the fine assurance and impudence of which fairly made it a trumpet for promises yet in spite of that the very gage as it were of his long career as the most interesting and manysided comedian or at least most unsurpassed dramatic diseur of his time i failed to doubt that with the rich recesses of the parental industry for his background his subtlest identity was in his privilege or perhaps even in his expertest trick of helping himself well  these images however were but drops in the bucket of my sense of catching character roundabout us as i say at every turn and in every aspect character that began even as i was pleased to think in our own habitation the most spacious and pompous europe had yet treated us to in spite of its fronting on the rue neuve chaussée a street of lively shopping by the measure of that innocent age and with its own groundfloor occupied by a bristling exhibition of indescribably futile articles de paris modern and commodious itself it looked from its balcony at serried and mismatched and quaintlynamed haunts of old provincial of sedately passive rather than confidently eager traffic but this made among us for much harmless inquisitory lifewhile we were fairly assaulted at home by the scale and some of the striking notes of our fine modernity the young the agreeable agreeable to anything the apparently opulent m prosper sauvagewasnt ithad not long before unless i mistake inherited the place as a monument of family quite modestly local yet propitious family ambition with an ample extension in the rear and across the clearest prettiest court for his own dwelling which thus became elegant entre cour et jardin and showed all the happy symmetries and proper conventions here flourished or rather i surmise at this time of day here languished a domestic drama of which we enjoyed the murmurous overflow frankly astounding to me i confess how i remain still in sensitive presence of our resigned proprietors domestic drama in and out of which i see a pair of figures quite up to the dramatic mark flit again with their air of the very rightest finish i must but note these things none the less and pass for scarce another item of the whole boulogne concert of salient images failed after all of a significance either still more strangely social or more distinctively spectacular these appearances indeed melt together for my interest i once more feel as during the interminable stretch of the prescribed and for the most part solitary airings and outings involved in my slow convalescence from the extremity of fever i approached that straitened and somewhat bedarkened issue of the rue de lÉcu was it toward the brightcoloured stronglypeopled port just where merridews english library solace of my vacuous hours and temple in its degree too of deep initiations mounted guard at the right here frankly discrimination dropsevery particular in the impression once so quick and fresh sits interlinked with every other in the large lap of the whole the motley sunny breezy bustling port with its classic its admirable fisherfolk of both sexes models of type and tone and of what might be handsomest in the thoroughly weathered condition would have seemed the straightest appeal to curiosity had not the old thackerayan side as i may comprehensively call it and the scattered wealth of illustration of his sharpest satiric range not so constantly interposed and competed with it the scene bristled as i look back at it with images from mens wives from the society of mr deuceace and that of fifty other figures of the same creation with bareacreses and rawdon crawleys and of course with mrs macks with roseys of a more or less crumpled freshness and blighted bloom with battered and bent though doubtless never quite so fine colonel newcomes not less with more reminders in short than i can now gather in of those forms of the seedy the subtly sinister the vainly genteel the generally damaged and desperate and in particular perhaps the invincibly impudent all the marks i feel sure were stronger and straighter than such as we meet in generally like cases under our present levelling light such anointed and whiskered and ekedout such brazen bluffing swaggering gentlemen such floridly repaired ladies their mates all looking as hard as they could as if they were there for mere harmless amusementit was as good among them as just being arthur pendennis to know so well or at least to guess so fearfully who and what they might be they were floated on the tide of the manners then prevailing i judge with a rich processional effect that so many of our own grand lapses when not of our mere final flatnesses leave no material for so that the living note of boulogne was really on a more sustained view the opposition between a native race the most happily tempered the most becomingly seasoned and salted and selfdependent and a shifting colonyso far as the persons composing it could either urgently or speculatively shiftinimitably at odds with any active freshness and the stale and the light even though so scantly rebounding the too densely socialised group was the english and the positive and hardy and steady and windwashed the french and it was all as flushed with colour and patched with costume and referable to record and picture to literature and history as a more easily amusing and less earnestly uniform age could make it when i speak of this opposition indeed i see it again most take effect in an antithesis that on one side and the other swallowed all differences at a gulp the general british show as we had it there in the artless midvictorian desert had i think for its most sweeping sign the high assurance of its dowdiness whereas one had only to glance about at the seafaring and fisherfolk who were the real strength of the place to feel them shed at every step and by their every instinct of appearance the perfect lesson of taste there it was to be learnt and taken homewith never a moral none the less drawn from it by the higher types i speak of course in particular of the tanned and trussed and kerchiefed the active and productive women all so shortskirted and freelimbed under stress for as by the rule of the dowdy their sex is ever the finer example so where the sense of the suitable of the charmingly and harmoniously right prevails they preserve the pitch even as a treasure committed to their piety to hit that happy mean of rightness amid the mixed occupations of a homemother and a fishwife to be in especial both so bravely stripped below and so perfectly enveloped above as the deepwading farstriding shrimpnetting crabgathering matrons or maidens who played waisthigh with the tides and racily quickened the market was to make grace thoroughly practical and discretion thoroughly vivid these attributes had with them all for the eye however a range too great for me to follow since as their professional undress was a turnout positively selfconsistent so their household or more responsibly public or altogether festal array played through the varied essentials of fluted coif and folded kerchief and sober skirt and tense dark displayed stocking and clicking wooden slipper to say nothing of long gold eardrop or solid shorthung pectoral cross with a respect for the rigour of conventions that had the beauty of selfrespect  i owe to no season of the general period such a preserved sense of innumerable unaccompanied walksat the reason of which luxury of freedom i have glanced which as often as not were through the steep and lowbrowed and brightlydaubed ruelles of the fishingtown and either across and along the level seamarge and sustained cliff beyond this latter the site of the first napoleons so tremendously mustered camp of invasion with a monument as futile by my remembrance as that enterprise itself had proved to give it all the special accent i could ask for or i was as free for the haute ville and the ramparts and the scattered battered benches of reverieif i may so honour my use of them they kept me not less complacently in touch with those of the so anciently odd and mainly contracted houses over which the stiff citadel and the ghost of catherine de médicis who had dismally sojourned in it struck me as throwing such a chill and one of which precisely must have witnessed the nevertobeforgotten campaigners passage in respect to her cold beef far from extinct for me is my small question of those hours doubtless so mentally so shamelessly wanton as to what human life might be tucked away in such retreats which expressed the last acceptance whether of desired or of imposed quiet so absolutely appointed and obliged did i feel to make out so far as i could what in so significant a world they on their part represented i think the force mainly sustaining me at that rather dreary timeas i see it can only show forwas this lively felt need that everything should represent something more than what immediately and all too blankly met the eye i seem to myself to have carried it about everywhere and though of course only without outward signs that might have betrayed my fatuity and insistently quite yearningly applied it what i wanted in my presumption was that the object the place the person the unreduced impression often doubtless so difficult or so impossible to reduce should give out to me something of a situation living as i did in confused and confusing situations and thus hooking them on however awkwardly to almost any at all living surface i chanced to meet my memory of boulogne is that we had almost no society of any sort at homethere appearing to be about us but one sort and that of far too great or too fearful an immediate bravery yet there were occasional figures that i recover from our scant circle and that i associate whatever links i may miss with the small still houses on the rampart figures of the quaintest quite perhaps the frowsiest little english ladies in such mushroom hats such extremely circular and bestriped scarlet petticoats such perpetual tight gauntlets such explicit claims to long descent which showed them for everything that everyone else at boulogne was not these midvictorian samples of a perfect consistency represented by my measure as hard as ever they couldand represented of all things literature and history and society the literature was that of the threevolume novel then and for much after enjoying its loosest and serenest spread for they separately and anxiously and awfully wroteand that must almost by itself have amounted in them to all the history i evoked  the dreary months as i am content that in their second phase especially they should be called are subject i repeat to the perversion quite perhaps to the obscuration of my temporarily hindered healthwhich should keep me from being too sure of these small proportions of experiencei was to look back afterwards as over so grey a desert through which none the less there flush as sharp little certainties not to be disallowed such matters as the general romance of merridew the english librarian before mentioned at the mouth of the port a connection that thrusts itself upon me now as after all the truest centre of my perceptionswaylaying my steps at the time as i came and went more than any other object or impression the question of what that spot represented or could be encouraged could be aided and abetted to represent may well have supremely engaged mefor depth within depth there could only open before me the place meant on these terms to begin with frank and licensed fiction licensed to my recordedly relaxed state and what this particular luxury represented it might have taken me even more time than i had to give to make out the blest novel in three volumes exercised through its form to my sense on grounds lying deeper for me today than my deepest sounding an appeal that fairly made it do with me what it would possibly a drivelling confession and the more drivelling perhaps the more development i should attempt for it from which however the very difficulty of the case saves me too many associations too much of the ferment of memory and fancy are somehow stirred they beset me again they hover and whirl about me while i stand as i used to stand within the positively sanctified walls of the shop so of the vieux temps now their aspect and fashion and worked system by which i mean again of the frumpiest and civillest midvictorian and surrender to the vision of the shelves packed with their rich individual trinities why should it have affected me so that my choice so difficult in such a dazzle could only be for a trinity i am unable fully to saysuch a magic dwelt in the mere rich fact of the trio when the novel of that age was bad as it so helplessly so abjectly and prevailingly consented to be the three volumes still did something for it a something that was all strangely not an aggravation of its case when it was good our analysis our terms of appreciation had a simplicity that has lingered on they made it copiously opulently better so that when after the span of the years my relation with them became from that of comparatively artless reader and to the effect of a superior fondness and acuteness that of complacent author the tradition of infatuated youth still flung over them its mantle this at least till all relation by one of the very rudest turns of life we of the profession were to have known broke off in clumsy interfering hands and with almost no notice given in a day in an hour besides connecting me with the lost but unforgotten note of waiting service and sympathy that quavered on the merridew air they represented just for intrinsic charm more than i could at any moment have given a plain account of they fell by their ineffable history every trio i ever touched into the category of such prized phenomena as my memory for instance of fairly hanging about the rue des vieillards at the season i speak of through the apprehension that something vague and sweetif i shouldnt indeed rather say something of infinite future point and applicationwould come of it this is a reminiscence that nothing would induce me to verify as for example by any revisiting light but it was going to be good for me good that is for what i was pleased to regard as my intelligence or my imagination in fine for my obscurely specific sense of things that i should so have hung about the name of the street was by itself of so gentle and intimate a persuasion that i must have been ashamed not to proceed for the very grace of it to some shade of active response and there was always a place of particular arrest in the vista brief and blank but inclusively blank blank after ancient settled more and more subsiding things blank almost in short with all matthew arnolds ennui of the middle ages rather than poorly and meanly and emptily before such states which was previously what i had most known of blankness this determined pause was at the window of a spare and solitary shop a place of no amplitude at all but as of an inveterate cheerful confidence where among a few artists materials an exhibited watercolour from some native and possibly then admired hand was changed but once in ever so long that was perhaps after all the pivot of my revolutionthe question of whether or no i should at a given moment find the old picture replaced i made this when i had the luck pass for an eventyet an event which would have to have had for its scene the precious rue des vieillards and pale though may be the recital of such pleasures i lose myself in depths of kindness for my strain of ingenuity  all of which and to that extent to be corrected leaves small allowance for my service to good m ansiot rendered while my elder and younger brothersthe younger completing our group of the ungovernessedwere continuously subject to collegial durance their ordeal was i still blush to think appreciably the heavier as compared with mine during our longer term of thrifty exile from paristhe time of stress as i find i recall it when we had turned our backs on the rue montaigne and my privilege was so to roam on the winter and the spring afternoons mild m ansiot under whom i for some three hours each forenoon sat sole and underidedand actually by himself toowas a curiosity a benignity a futility even i gather but save for a felt and remembered impulse in me to open the window of our scene of study as soon as he had gone was in no degree an ideal he might rise here could i do him justice as the rarest of my poor evocations for he it was to be frank who most literally smelt of the vieux tempsas to which i have noted myself as wondering and musing as much as might be with recovered scraps and glimpses and other intimations only never yet for such a triumph of that particular sense to be still frank he was little less than a monsterfor mere unresisting or unresilient mass of personal presence i mean so that i fairly think of him as a form of bland porpoise violently blowing in an age not his own as by having had to exchange deep water for thin air thus he impressed me as with an absolute ancientry of type of tone of responsible taste above all this last i mean in literature since it was literature we sociably explored to my at once charmed and shamed apprehension of the several firm traditions the pure proprieties the discussabilities in the oddest way both so many and so few of that field as they prevailed to his pious view i must have had hold in this mere sovereign sample of the accidentally the quite unconsciously and unpretentiously the all negligibly or superfluously handeddown of a rare case of the provincial and academic cuistre though even while i record it i see the good man as too helpless and unaggressive too smothered in his poor facts of person and circumstance of overgrown time of life alone to incur with justness the harshness of classification he rested with a weight i scarce even feltsuch easy terms he made without scruple for both of uson the cheerful innocence of my barbarism and though our mornings were short and subject i think to quite drowsy lapses and other honest aridities we did scumble together i make out by the aid of the collected extracts from the truly and academically great which formed his sole resource and which he had in a small portable and pocketed library rather greasily preserved some patch of picture of a saving as distinguished from a losing classicism the point remains for me that when all was saidand even with everything that might directly have counted unsaidhe discharged for me such an office that i was to remain to this faroff hour in a state of possession of him that is the very opposite of a blank quite after the fashion again in which i had all along and elsewhere suffered and resisted and yet so perversely and intimately appropriated tutoring which was with as little as ever to show for my profit of his own express showings the blank he fills out crowds itself with a wealth of value since i shouldnt without him have been able to claim for whatever it may be worth a tenth at that let me handsomely put it of my working sense of the vieux temps how can i allow then that we hadnt planted together with a loose felicity some of the seed of workeven though the sprouting was so long put off everything i have mentioned had come at this time to be acceptedly though far from braggingly put off and the ministrations of m ansiot really wash themselves over with the weak mixture that had begun to spread for me to immensity during that summer day or two of our earlier residence when betraying strange pains and apprehensions i was with all decision put to bed present to me still is the fact of my sharper sense after an hour or two of my being there in distress and as happened for the moment alone present to me are the sounds of the soft afternoon the mild animation of the boulogne street through the halfopen windows present to me above all the strange sense that something had begun that would make more difference to me directly and indirectly than anything had ever yet made i might verily on the spot have seen as in a fading of day and a change to something suddenly queer the whole large extent of it i must thus much impressed but half scared have wanted to appeal to which end i tumbled all too weakly out of bed and wavered toward the bell just across the room the question of whether i really reached and rang it was to remain lost afterwards in the strong sick whirl of everything about me under which i fell into a lapse of consciousness that i shall conveniently here treat as a considerable gap  the end
